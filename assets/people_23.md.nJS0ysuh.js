Either that or it's taken a new record for putting out dull off-center throbbing sounds from BOTH of my DVD players.

Yes, Joel & the Bots are brilliant here, and it's their riffs & frank remarks that give this DVD so much replay value.However, the actual \\"Manos\\" movie is utterly irredeemable. Until you have seen Manos, you do not know how bad a movie can be. Watching it the first few times will be a test of your endurance, especially if you don't drink or use mind-altering substances to ease the pain. Before long, you will be like Joel when he screams, \\"DO SOMETHING!\\" at the motionless actors onscreen.That said, the MST3K version is brilliant, because it makes a horrible movie experience a howling delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original is better than the MST3000 version","review":"\\"Manos\\" is considered as one of the worst movie ever made. I've seen the original version several times and I do believe that it is watchable, even enjoyable, Good campy film with an excellent performance from John Reynolds. The MST3000 version is ... and boring, surely because the original movie in itself isn't bad enough to be MSTied. The comments from Joel and the robots were great in some movies (check out \\"Mitchell\\") but ... in this one.So please, don't believe what people say: Manos isn't a masterpiece but also not a bad movie.

The delivery time was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"For DVD/Movie Lovers!","review":"I was accustomed to watching movies on my laptop but being back in school prompted me to acquire the Toshiba Portable DVD player. I bought the product and had it shipped to my home in Kingston, Jamaica, West Indies. To my delight the connections worked in my vehicle, any electrical outlet available and even on my new 40\\" Sony Bravia TV, and don't forget that it's portable - once the battery has been charged you can watch up to two or more movies on battery power alone. My girlfriend and I are avid movie watchers and we watch movies after work. Previously accessing the movies on the laptop was a chore for her but since getting the portable player she doesn't wait for me anymore - she watches them sometime during work hours. My co-workers love it, my children love it and guess what, I love it so much I am planning to purchase another. I recommend you purchase this product. It's one of those great buys you won't regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Screen resolution","review":"With an almost HD screen resolution this unit is a pleasure to watch.No other portable unit has this magnificant picture quality. My only reservation is that there is not a last memory resume feature. .The program will resume at the point where is was stopped , but will resume at a point of earlier stoppage , not at the last stop point. This is not the way it should be. Five stars if \\"last memory\\" worked the way it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great if it only lasts 10 months","review":"First, the good points; when I bought this player, I was very happy with it (although the buttons which looked like they were back lit when on, turned out not to be, so at night I frequently press the wrong button). The picture quality was fine for a portable and while spendy, the quality seemed to be worth it. The negatives: VERY poor sound volume unless you use the headphones. Even at top volume the dialogue is difficult to hear, especially when people carry on quiet conversations. The worst negative is that I've only had the player for 10 months and it already needs repair. The quality is worthless if the machine doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really a big let down.","review":"This player comes with a remote, which is nice, but the remote doesn't do 2 very important tasks. You can't turn the machine on or off from the remote, nor can you adjust the volume from the remote. Why, Toshiba, why? Also, this player performs very poorly after extended play times. i.e. once it gets hot it doesn't like to play smoothly. DVDs, even brand new out of the case, play really choppy and are stop and go. Lastly; the player makes terrible, almost grinding, noises when playing DVDs. These noises are sometimes so loud that you can't even hear the movie. If it were a VHS player, I would expect the tapes to come out in pieces! Not a good buy for the price I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"P2900 DVD Player Sudden Death","review":"I liked the unit fine for the couple of months it worked, then it just stopped \\"spinning up\\" DVDs on start-up.

The thirty day warranty starts when you place the order. I did not receive it for 2 weeks so when I realized the battery wasn't holding a charge....Amazon would NOT help me.

It needs a case the size of a small laptop computer to hold this large player, AC adaptor, cables, DVD's ,and seat straps.Overall:I'm pleased with the player enough to recomend it to anyone needing a large screen but not wanting to invest in a small laptop computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really nice DVD player","review":"Many family members have purchased portable DVD players. This is, by far, the nicest of the lot. The complaint about the battery size seems strange as we find the battery compartment to be most acceptable. If there is a complaint, it would be about the quality of audio via the speakers. This problem, however, is inherent to all portables. When connected to earphones (two output jacks), the sound quality is extremely nice. The picture quality on the 16X9 screen is better than we expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Issues","review":"I have had this DVD player for about 13 months and have had no issues until the battery completely stopped charging. The moment I pull out the power cord, the DVD player completely stops. This pretty much ruins the purpose of having a portable DVD player.

If you get one without this issue, it's a pretty good player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Lasted 12 months","review":"Just so you know, this thing only lasted 12 months before the rechargable battery stopped recharging.

If I have to scan that size I am out of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We had an older Visioneer USB scanner that worked quite well. It was about twice the size of this one, but we had high expectations of this brand. However, when we got it and started using it, it was not a pleasure to use like the old one. It's faster, but the problem is that it's hard to keep the paper to feed in straight and there's always a line down the section where the paper sensor is. The old scanner didn't have either of these problems. We tried cleaning it and everything, but nothing seemed to help. If you can get the paper in straight, with the exception of the line down the entire page, the image looks good, but we shouldn't have to deal with either issue in any scanner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a great little device that I highly recommend. Only complaints are: 1) the user-interface to adjust image properties is a little counter-intuitive -- you right click on an icon that doesn't seem like something you're supposed to right-click on. 2) Sometimes it is hard to make the paper go straight through without fooling the machine into prematurely starting to scan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3.5 years","review":"I really wish electronics manufacturers would make quality equipment again. I suppose 3.5 years is about the expected lifespan for things these days, but I'm sorta miffed that I spent $150 and it's dead now. It would also have been good if they had made software for Macintosh so I didn't have to run their Windows SW in a virtual machine.

It is nothing like I have ever heard and I find myself wanting more.Rather than spending too much time-sharing my enthusiasm for this release...

I found myself relying more and more on it alone as a reference guide as I became more comfortable traveling, as it highlights the things to see / how to get there, and leaves the details to the traveler. I also found people fascinated by its hand-drawn maps (beware trying to get the book back from a crowd- including other travelers!).

Best tracks are Psycho City Blocks, La Connecta Pt 1 & 2, Showdown, and Psyclones.

It's a new darker style but one you'll probably like. Now paralyzed from a gunshot to the throat Mr Duke and Jacken tell tales of the street from first hand experience.

Alot of the time people just refer to it in terms of Cypress - 'not bad if youre a big Cypress fan' or 'this B-real side project is alright' - now this really pi**es me off. The Psycho Realm existed before B-Real and after him (for a tragically short time)and he liked them so much when he saw them in some club that he got on their first album and helped to expose. So come on give Duke and Jacken the respect they desevre as individuals not just because they're affiliated with B-Real. Also check out their second album 'A War Story' which is a significant improvement on this incredible album and is alot better without B-Real all over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stalking for forever","review":"All the dialogue was either incredibly saccharin or just plain creepy.

Save yourself and go watch something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dream come true if you're a stalker!","review":"Wow, this is a fairytale come true for all stalkers. The only part of the movie that made sense is when Emma told Will to leave her alone. A restraining order would've been the happy ending here. I'm in utter shock that anyone would consider this a decent movie. Although this is a \\"movie\\", I found it such a stretch from reality. They might have well ended the movie with her on both knees proposing to him while a random flash mob broke out into song and dance. The poor acting matched the horrendous script. The only credit I'll give the movie, is it kept me watching in shock of how I could predict the next outrageous scene over and over and over. It was almost like a game. Anyone who can relate to Will, I would recommend psychiatric help. I'll repeat this is two thumbs up for stalkers....any sane person, stay away from this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For hopeless romantics - this is the best ever.","review":"This movie will stay with you forever.It's absolutely superb in every way.Great acting from the perfect cast, and great music.Be sure to have a box or two of Kleenex for some extreme heart wrenching moments.Brilliant.

I am definately adding this to my list of top 10 worst movies of all time. Don't watch this unless you like weird akward movies. It's not even a romantic movie. Emma is fairly normal but depressed and Will is happy but coo coo. He talks to himself and stocks Emma. I cringed watching this. I was bored and/or weirded out the whole time. I kept watching and waiting for it to get better, since I spent money, but nope! It never got better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting","review":"I was not convinced that Will was in love.

I wanted to like this movie...but I didn't like it even a little. The movie is awkward with nothing but sappy moments strung together, and nothing else. Every character is very odd and wierd with the exception of Emma played by Bilson.Will has been following Emma for years unable to tell her that he loves her. When, finally he works up the nerve to tell her. It's not romantic, or sweet, but very stalkerish, and wierd. The whole movie seems uncomfortable with Willie talking in public to his dead parents, and not following Emma. The dialogue is very cheesy.Don't waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stalkers will love this movie...","review":"*Spoilers But read anyway* The main character stalks this girl he barely knows for his whole life and then finally confronts her. This movie is creepy! I swear I thought halfway through it that the main guy was some psycho killer and that I'd miss read the movie category and we were really watching a psycho-thriller. To impress her he became a CLOWN! Definitely puts across the wrong message to stalkers out there. If you spend all your life stalking a girl and become a street clown you'll get the girl, LOL!P.S.

My copy of Mitchell seems to be \\"warped\\" for lack of a better word. Either that or it's taken a new record for putting out dull off-center throbbing sounds from BOTH of my DVD players.Manos is worse. In spite of having the hillarious Poopie Vol.1 reel on it, around track 16 (the layer change I assume), the playback stops. Not pauses - stops. Of course you can cue up track 17 and back up to the errant position and continue watching but obviously, Rhino decided to go cheap on these two disks (and future releases one's left to guess).

It is so awful that I don't blame Joel for leaving after watching it. Don Baker missed his chance at superstardom by not going after comic roles.

If you already have the video tape, don't bother adding ths to your DVD collection unless you are a completist and just have to have this to sit next to your other MST3K DVD's.This was Joel's last episode, at least they could have given us some bonus features that has to do with Joel's time on the show.

I've laughed my way through dozens of MST3K episodes (most of which I've watched many times over) as well as the movie, but Mitchell may be the weakest episode I've seen.

I wanted to read more by Daniel Asa Rose and I wasn't disappointed. I laughed and cried through out the book. I felt like I was on the trip with Mr. Rose and his very bright children.

I had several experiences of anti-semitism, and an awareness of what was happening in Germany, because of my father's work in sponsoring young refugees fleeing the Nazi's. Daniel Asa Rose's book helped me to understand my adult feelings about these childhood memories, and my own need for hiding places, my feelings about the holocaust and my need to carefully make my three sons aware of it early in their childhoods. Rose's book is a unique story, and a reminder that we must all love our children, and all the world's children as perhaps the only antidote to the effects of the holocaust. It is also full of warmly humorous moments in Daniel's childhood. It could even be a model for other fractured families seeking to construct new bonds."},{"rating":"2","title":"PORTRAITS OF TERROR, PORTRAITS OF LOVE","review":"The remarkable portraits in this book - the author's two young sons, his mother, his sister, their surviving relatives in Europe - and the landscape of their journeys across time create a depth of field in which Mr. Rose himself emerges as a man of exceptional tenderness and civility. The horrors of the Holocaust are numbingly familiar, but what's new here is love, a father's fearless self-discovery, for his children's sake, out of the terrors their family endured. An extraordinary achievement, very deeply moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh look at a subject which never grows old","review":"An excellent book.

Also, it does not teach you as many of the techniques for solving word problems that you will encounter in algebra outside of the book as it probably should do. A whole chapter devoted to word problems would have been good.This book is firmly aimed at school students or those who have forgotten the principles of algebra, and in that it is an excellent book.

I previously owned the earlier model of this, the iH13B, and it charged my ipod just fine...this one won't. This is progress?? Talk to iHome and they just shrug their shoulders and it's to bad, so sad, better luck next time. And why on earth would you make something that's portable with the ability to operate off an external power source and then not make it so you can plug it into a cigarette lighter plug?? Who ever heard of having a device work off 10 volts DC? Given iHome's consistent disregard for addressing these design flaws, I'd look to another manufacturer.

I assumed these would be hard plastic with threads to secure them to the connectors, like so many RS banana plugs I have used. The ones included with these Belkin plugs are pretty bad.

Second, the vinyl sleeve is very cheesy. It slides up and down the jack when you insert them and it's quite difficult to grab them with enough pressure to insert them into the female end.I have never seen bannana jacks built like this and I hope I never do again.

And it is. Martin Lee, co-founder of FAIR magazine, presents his exhaustive research on LSD. Most interesting for me was the first half of the book, which deals extensively with US intelligence experimenting with LSD in various ways during the Cold War Era. Beyond that, this book follows acid through the psychedelic 60s, and into the 1980s.While Lee does a good job of tying in social information to add context, he does at times discuss things seemingly not related to the overall picture of LSD, and at others, goes into unnecessary detail on popular events such as Woodstock & Altamont, which we've all heard a million times.Still, it's a great book for anybody interested in drug culture, or who enjoys investigative/sociological reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"i am 14 years old. therefore i wasn't there in the 60s, and was actually only about 2 feet tall when this book was written, but i got it from the library to read on an overseas plane flight and i was blown away. from the disturbing CIA expirements to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters to the 68 democratic convention, this book has it all. a good read whether you were there or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"no delivery","review":"Never received the book!

They also describe the scenes of Haight-Ashbury and the Human Be-In during the Summer of Love (1967). This book is not only about acid and who consumed it and why, but also about an era where alternative possibilities were explored and lived by. Part of the exploration was finding new values and consciousness, which of course led to experimenting with mind-altering substances. The authors do a great job of this, while at the same time the reader discovers that it wasn't just a bunch of hippies who tripped on acid.

I also felt there was too much \\"all about me\\" to this law of attraction. Then I found Robert Collier and his books gave me all the emphasis on God and helping others as a part of the law of attraction. To me, this was the great Secret in its fullness.

Stories like \\"Dusk,\\" \\"The Destruction of the Goetheanum,\\" and \\"Cinema\\" are masterful displays of form and structure.

When I received them in the package, I was thrilled with the beautiful, pearly sheen they give off. They aren't shiny like some lower quality sateens, but have a subtle luster and look gorgeous in low light. I pleased to find that this luster held after washing and even more pleased when I slept on them. They are so soft and will definitely feature heavily in my sheet rotation. My other sheets are a high thread-count silk blend and these are nearly as soft, just dreamy. But these sheets are at such a great price, I'm thinking of getting a second set. The colors are all so perfect that you're bound to find some to match your bedding.In my experience, higher thread-count sheets tend to wrinkle if you leave them in the dryer too long so you'll need to put them straight on your bed after washing to minimize wrinkling. Who has time to iron their sheets anyway? I certainly don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrinkled and thin","review":"I was happy with these sheets until I washed them - they came out of the dryer wrinkled like nothing I've ever seen before in a sheet.

I choose (pink) which is a muted color, almost beige (I was afraid the color might be too bright). I am also very please these sheets did not pill. I have purchased other sheets in the retail stores, that were very expensive that pilled after the first wash, which I returned for a refund. Although I gave only 4 stars, these sheets did wrinkle somewhat easily and were ample in size. I have a pillow-top queen mattress with deep sides and the fitted sheet fit with extra give to it.

Love Song and Inbetween Days are the only ones that ever got air play on this CD in LA, where I was living playing with my band. I was so dissapointed when I bought this CD. I hope they make another one that includes songs from Pornography, The Top, Faith and the dark music that made their name. I do not believe Smith is a sell out, he just decided to move in different musical directions and in my opinion they all just did not work.

For me YR is not only the best Steve Tibbetts record (and you must know I have all the records from him), but the best instrumental work I have ever heard.

After ordering it on Amazon, it arrived across the border within 3 days! The Xen is superior to the Garneau in almost every way -- comfort, styling, and especially ventilation.

The vents on the outside do not look very big but the helmet is mostly open around your head so all the air flows over your head/hair while your riding. The pad inside is a one piece design so you dont have to worry about losing it and it also does a great job of wicking away sweat. The first helmet I received had a defective retention strap so I had to RMA it to Amazon. The process was ridiculously easy and my replacement helmets works great.

This is the WHOLE movie in a nutshell. All members of the CIA are evil. All members of British intelligence are evil. All member of Israeli intelligence are evil.

The actor Sam Shepard tells us so in the \\"Making of\\" bonus and he knows because he's a friend of Valerie Plame, the faux spy. The action is totally implausible (as it is in most movies of this genre) but the plot (such as it is) is boring. Denzel plays Denzel really well (he's got that down pat) and Ryan Reynolds plays himself (not a compliment).

Why did Denzel turn himself in in the first place? Why does Reynolds pull a gun on local police officers? None of the actions of the major characters makes any sense, and the reveal doesn't help-- it just hopes that you didn't remember the first 20 minutes, I suppose, because it makes everything all the more illogical. Then, the big reveal just follows the now all too formulaic plot of most CIA oriented movies of the past decade or so.

Basically, the movie is a fantasy about how awesome it would be if the wikileaks documents had made any actual impact in the world.Could have been a lot more interesting, there was ample opportunity for a more mental/psychological aspect to the movie with Denzel Washington's character; instead the movie takes a hard left turn and never comes back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safe House Hype","review":"Sorry my wife purchased this movie.

First of all, Denzel has turned into The Mumbler - couldn't understand a thing he said several times even by turning up the sound. His presence always effuses a cool air, but he is kind of lame here. Then, there is the stone-cold-predictable Sam Shepard -one look at him, flashback to Swordfish, and VIOLA the plot is pre-solved. One enjoyable role was his Weston's sexy girlfriend.

The plot was average, the ending predictable and boring. I'm very sad to say they wasted Denzel's and Reynold's talents on this. There were so many pieces of this movie that were random and unexplained, and the whole plot - the thing about the list - was never really explained in detail. It was all too simple. I'm glad I used my free-Redbox-code on this, because it would have been a waste of money otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it, good movie","review":"This movie had just enough of everything. The plot was good, they didn't come out and tell you what was going to happen right away. The car chases were just enough and very exciting. The emotional factor (yes there was one in this action movie) was good, mainly between Ryan Reynolds character and his girlfriend. There was no cussing, no nudity but a lot of viloence although I thought the violence was more of a suggested than actual visual like some movies. Overall this is a movie that makes you think, keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't throw curse words at you left and right.

I like both, Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington so I was expecting it to be good. The movie was as advertised. A good thing you can expect from a Denzel crime/action thriller is that the acting will be good and the action won't be over the top. There will be enough action to keep you locked in but not so much where you mentally check out and don't care about the story. This wasn't the best Denzel movie, but at least it had a good cohesive story and some substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"INSIDE SEAMS SCRATCH THE CD","review":"The manufacturer could have easily glued the seams outside the envelope but the way they designed these Burlington envelopes scratches the cds as you slide them in and out. A poorly conceived product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harder to use than other types","review":"For a reason that completely eludes me, the manufacturer decided to go against the mainstream and glue the flaps on the inside of the envelope. All other brands are glued on the outside. The main disadvantage is that CDs are harder to insert into the envelopes: they tend to get stuck between the imperfectly glued flaps and the back of the envelope. This design also offers less protection to the CD, as the flaps rub harder against it when sliding it in or out, and may even scratch it a bit. Other than that, the envelopes are okay, but the only reason why you'd buy these instead of the cheaper Fellowes product is the shipping cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed","review":"As others have said, the side flaps should be glued on the OUTSIDE of the envelope.

Overall, this DVD was worth my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thigh Workout","review":"This is a great workout for your thighs, but it may be difficult for beginners. It takes some practice to learn to isolate the muscles you do not use very often and it is sometimes easy to cheat and use muscles other than those targeted to complete the exercises. I experienced some knee discomfort until I learned how to do this more effectively. The models do look lifeless but that may be to deter you from watching them so that you concentrate more on what you are doing. Brad often mentions that you have to make the muscle to mind connection to be sure you obtain optimal results and he tells the models to smile during the breaks in between sets. It is difficult to complete all of the reps at first, but it becomes a little bit easier with time."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Make Exercise Boring 101","review":"Um......if you want to do \\"12\\" exercises meaning do 15 reps of the same 3 exercises with stretches in between while a guy talks non-stop to you, get this dvd!Maybe if you are high strung or something, this would be a good exercise dvd for you, because it's very, very boring. I could not *believe* this guy was STILL talking.

A how-to-think-for-yourself guide that never gives advice but, simply, allows the reader discover it for him/herself. A sort of mental martial arts course for the wise. It uses the absurdity of the \\"experts\\" to negate their own would-be power. Read it and you'll never be the same. A path to personal freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"This book is a waste of time and money. The dates are wrong, the facts are wrong, the quotations have selected items omited in order to increase dramatic effect which distorts what was quoted in the first place. There has been much better \\"expert-speak\\" documented throughout history but it's not in this book. Why? Save your money and leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a serious book; but OK for the PC crowd","review":"I noticed many of the quotes were taken out of context, inaccurate, or were off-the-cuff comical/facetious remarks. Some of the \\"researched facts\\", are nothing more than partisan political opinions. It's a wonderful database kit for the left wing bumper-sticker intellectual. Of course, there's barely any quotes from the Clinton administration; but then again, Clinton's gaffs would require a 2 volume set alone! It is an interesting read, in that you get a sense of how the PC crowd shamelessly struggles to deconstruct history and facts. I'm sure Cerf and his staff giggled the whole time they were assembling the quotes for the educated derelict. Fortunately, most students of history are not that shallow-minded. Do some serious reading, and pass this silly tripe up.

It is gossipy and shallow. I was hoping for some insight into the early history of the craft revival, or perhps impressions of what it is like to run a long-established coven, the lifetime experience of being High priestess. Stories abourt how Crowther's cats lived and died, for example, do not fit the bill. (Goddess knows I love cats as much as anyone, but still.) Buy this book only if you are a completist, or have an obsessive interest in the early British Craft scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"This is a fascinating account of the woman who had very close ties to witchcraft's founder Gerald Gardner. Besides that, the author stands alone as a prominant figure in the history of witchcraft herself. I first heard of the author in a Dorren Valiente book where she appeared topless, as she does again here and for an older woman looked good. I guess a woman will a lot have to sell herself with sex to a male dominated society, despite her solid views expressed in this book on femininity. I like how she mention the book Aradia Gospel of the Witches as that is a book I own and got before I read this book. I really like reading about witchcraft and the occult and especially the rare autobiography of a practicing occult figue particulary one as prominant as the author. Gerald Gardner's memory still lives, even though he was really one of Aleister Crowley's last henchman, so the glory should really go to Crowley, instead he is \\"the wickedest man in the world.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice memoir","review":"This is a nice memoir from one of the few surviving (in this incarnation) members of Gerald Gardner's coven. This is a book for those considering the Craft or an interesting read for someone already involved. This book is recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best English-interpretation of I-Ching","review":"By far, this is one of the best English-interpreted understanding of the Chinese I-Ching. In fact, it puts other English interpreted versions pale in comparison. I-Ching is really a Chinese heritage and most, if not all, of Chinese Philosophy and understanding comes from I-Ching (as a source). What the book lacks is to show how each of the I-Ching hexagrams or Gua (total 64 Guas with 384 \\"Yaos\\" or lines of Wisdom) is rooted to which Chinese Philosophy and how in Modern days, they can be applied successfully. A Note: Under teh Preface Section III, 2nd Paragraph, the line should states that there should be 384 and NOT 386 Yao Texts (since 64 Guas multiply by 6 Yaos per Gua will give us = 384 Yao Texts!). Steven Lim (RSTN Consulting - Singapore)."},{"rating":"1","title":"hook, line, and sinker","review":"Everyone here seems to have bought the line that the author and publisher are selling them -- that this is somehow a \\"definitive\\" translation, simply because the author isn't a Westerner. This is a blatant appeal to authority fallacy if I ever heard one. The fact is that being an Asian and a Taoist master doesn't make one a good translator, and this good is proof of that. Frankly, it is riddled with errors. For an example of a review by someone who REALLY knows what they are talking about, see:http://biroco.com/yijing/karcherhuang.htmabout halfway down the page, after the review of Karcher's book.In the meantime, please save yourself the money and invest in a truly good translation, such as Richard Lynn's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Taoist take on a Confucianized I-Ching","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to get closer to an original translation of the I-Ching. I found Alfred Huang's version very appealing, and I liked his occasional comments on the Taoist versus the Confucian view. But then I took another look at Kerson and Rosemary Huang's I-Ching (ISBN 0-89480-319-0), which goes to a pre-Confucian translation of the oracle based on recent archaelogical findings. Previously I found Kerson and Rosemary's images limiting, now I find them clear and poetic; but I had to read Alfred Huang's version to appreciate the difference. I'm giving it 4 stars because now that I've seen both, I feel they work best together."},{"rating":"2","title":"What they (those other reviewers) said!","review":"Pretty much what has been said in other reviews are accurate. I want to say that there is a certain logic and flow to both Alfred Huang's writing and to the sequences of the hexagrams that I did not see in other texts. He also stresses that the core of I-Ching is not about divination but about coduct and sincerity. I never expected a book on divination could be so touching. Although it is probably out of character for Mr Huang to read reviews of his work, I hope that he does for the sake of knowing the lives he touched rather than for ego. It made me into a Taoist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book!","review":"Based on the two reviews I bought this book and was highly disappointed.

With this Croatian or Hrvatski dictionary if you please. Firstly this Croatian dictionary is not favored to Serbian, this is blatantly untrue. As well as the fact that the official script/text for Serbian is Cyrillic. The earlier given example of bread as sensitive, which I checked in this Croatian dictionary, clearly shows the word \\"Kruh\\" ,which is the correct Croatian word for bread. In regards to lacking several words and explanation of others, I also suspect this to be untrue, because the earlier poster would be able to provide specific examples and clearly failed to provide evidence of this.

The author doesnt use excessive detail on surroundings etc., enough to get his point across. I highly recommend it, as this book is a very realistic portrayal of how the west really was.

There has been so much written about the need for ioding for thyroid function, BUT, If you have Hashimoto's watch out for ANY form of iodine. Iodine will trigger the immune system into destroying the thyroid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing results","review":"My wife has hypothyroidism. The medicines the Doctors gave didn't help her. She was cold even on warm days, very sad and weak. Her confusion and body pains were increasing. I bought this Thyroid Support for her and hoped it would help. On the 2nd day of taking it she was no longer cold and thinking clearer. After a week of taking it she seemed to be recovered. It has been 6 weeks now and she is completely well.I am amazed and thankful for this product. My wife takes no medicines now, just the Thyroid Support tablets 2 or 3 times a day. It comes to just about $12 a month to keep her well. If the Thyroid is failing it seems to me that a supplement as this needs to be taken for life.When she has taken it 6 months I will review again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real heart racer","review":"I purchased these pills thinking I could cure or at least help my Thyroid issues but I was wrong! They say it's a more Natural way of helping Hypothyroidism but all it does is keep me awake and it makes my heart race! Neither one of these is what I want because it's not a good feeling at all.

I tried this hoping it would make maintaining my weight a little easier and would combat hair loss and brain fog. I did not have many of the other symptoms listed by people who bought this--cold hands and feet, fatigue, etc.--but wanted to optimize my regimen. I noticed no changes whatsoever.After giving this product all the time I could stand, I've concluded that this may be better suited for someone else: a person with a medically-untreated thyroid condition, or a thyroid condition with an underlying cause different from my own (radiation from Graves disease).

Still have cold hands and feet and all other thyroid like symptoms after taking them. They taste extremely sweet (like a sugar pill) and fall apart easily, almost like an aspirin.. These seem more like placebos than a medication or supplement. I read the placebo affect may work for some people, but thyroid conditions are serious.. You should be taking medicine that will help you get better, not make you 'think' you are getting better.

This stuff is indeed a miracle. Based on my exp, it should be taken when one feels the symptoms the most (like any other homeopathic remedy) however it wont be vise to exceed the recommended daily limit.Btw, I also take adrenal support by gaia, which is a wonderful supplement. I also take salt (sea salt a pinch) and sugar (cane sugar brown, half tablespoon) mixed in water (I take it as first thing in the morning and then at bed time), it works for me.. I have observed that any good multivitamin already has 100% of the recommended daily dose of iodine, so I do not want to take anymore then that, as too much of iodine can as well create thyroid issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do much of anything for me :-(","review":"In another attempt to self treat my hypo, i tried these based on the amount of good reviews.

It was like i could feel it moving through my veins, it was really weird. It was bothersome enough to have me in bed by 7pm most nights. Anyway, after a few weeks i stopped taking them. They just weren't the supplement for me. They do do SOMETHING though as i did notice a change when i took them... just not a good one. They do taste good though, very sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was rather disappointed.

Hey, what can go wrong with a label except that it doesn't stick? But, the software packaged with the Burlington was a pain to use. It was not user- friendly, has no print documentation and the help is paltry to say the least. I searched for twenty minutes trying to change the fonts. Something that basic should not be that hard. And the provided templates are mediocre, bordering on funky. The graphics used for the templates often looks like something out a 1998 clip-art program.Bottom line: If I had to do it over again, I buy a different CD Label Kit. I recommend you pass on this one.

I emailed their support, and I still haven't heard anything in 3 weeks. So I can't give it more than one star.The software looks great and does everything except print, but unfortunately that's the most important thing.

The rags to riches story of a immigrant is an intereting angle but it is overshadowed by hours of cheap melodrama about things that might be considered a scandal in the 19th century but just make you yawn now. There is a lot of yearning by a young man for a married woman and then later illicit love affairs between in-laws and people of mixed race from the south. A pregnant woman even falls down the stairs in slow motion after being pushed by her drunken husband. I knew she was going to lose the baby the moment she started walking up the stairs towards the man. The main charactrer spends a lot of time covering up illegitemate children to protect his irish sons political career. Gee could their be a parallel to a real life family in the USA, think hard.

We were hopeful it would be as good as some of the Masterpiece Theatre and BBC stuff. After the first few minutes, I sensed that we might be in trouble. Thinking it might get better, and for my wife's interest, I perservered to the end of part one. When it was over, we both looked at each other and agreed, that was enough. The acting seemed stiff and wooden and unpleasant. Furthermore, the dialogue did not seem to help or be conducive to the acting either. Overall, it appeared to be too much of a contrived and glorified soap opera with no grittiness or heart, just slick, formulaic script. Good literature, or movies, makes you care about the characters. Here, all I cared about was getting it over."},{"rating":"2","title":"What great memories.","review":"First I was shocked to find this.

I've read the book 3 or 4 times over the years and always thought how much I'd love the watch Joseph Francis Xavier Armagh grow up, fall in love and become involved in the politics of the day. It always amazed me how much this book and miniseries mirrored the life of \\"Old\\" Joe Kennedy (only set 100 years earlier!!). All I can say is, do yourself a favor: watch the mini series - then read the book, you won't be sorry! Now all we have to wait for is the other blockbuster miniseries \\"Testimony of Two Men\\" (starring David Birney and book also written by Taylor Caldwell)which aired a year later in 1977."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!!! NOT LIKE THE BOOK AT ALL!!!!!!!","review":"The only good part about this was the actors. It has a very complimentary cast, but I do not like how some of the main characters are portrayed, mainly Joseph Armagh. In the book he is a cold, conceited, cynical, and cruel man. In the movie he smiles all the time, is jovial, and is far to happy for his depiction. The story line doesn't even follow the book hardly AT ALL which is very disappointing. I loved the book for the story, and this movie is a whole different story than what I read. Many characters are also added in that were not in the book, and the reasoning is beyond me. I was not happy as a huge fan of the book, and I don't know if I'll ever finish this after just completing the first of three disks. HORRIBLE! If you liked the book, you'll hate this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time!!!","review":"As some of the other reviewers have already said, I have been waiting for this mini-series to be released on DVD for years!!

A brilliant novel by Taylor Caldwell and an equally brilliant mini-series starring Richard Jordan as the ambitious but troubled Joseph Armagh. A host of great actors appear in the mini-series, too, including Patty Duke, Barbara Parkins, Jane Seymour, Perry King, and Henry Fonda to name but a few.

Well it does not work. Feel it boy has got to be one of the worst songs Beenie has ever done.

If Radiohead had their way this boxset would never have been released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Well Clear...","review":"An obvious cash-in by EMI after losing the band and an attempt to try and make money through the high profile independant release of 'In Rainbows'.I would ask people not to buy this, for several reasons.Yes, Radiohead will make money from royalties, however, it is important that people do not buy this product to show EMI that we will not tolerate constant re-issues and abuse of Artist's work.It's obviously been a rush job - the artwork on the box itself is uninspiring to say the least and is not produced by Stanley Donwood.EMI own the rights to everything Radiohead have created from Pablo Honey up until the Com Lag EP. It is important that we show EMI we will not tolerate these poor releases otherwise they will continue to flood the market with compilations and whatever else they can dream up - which is something the band and fans never wanted.A disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst experience that I've had with an Amazon seller.","review":"After paying for the Radiohead box set, I was told over and over that it had been mailed. Almost a month went by and nothing happened. I asked over and over for information, and got the same answer. Finally, there was no answer at all for 6 weeks. So I requested a reimbursement from Amazon, and they took care of it right away. Thank you, Amazon! If you check their reviews, you'll see a lot of the same treatment of their customers. I just didn't check anything past the first few. That's my fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"Basically, this boxset is an attempt for the label to cash in on the very respected name of Radiohead one last time. While I personally am not a huge fan of the band, I did enjoy their most recent effort, and this whole set is just backlash due to the band not signing back to EMI and releasing their latest album digitally at a \\"pay-what-you-want\\" rate. EMI wants to get back at Radiohead, and this set is by no means endorsed by the band, so if you are into Radiohead, or believe in supporting the musician, please avoid this collection at all costs. It's a despicable tactic by EMI to take your hard-earned money: don't give it to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"These albums are all really good.","review":"You can buy them all separately or save some cash and buy them in this boxed set.

I had to keep adjusting it every 10 minutes, like a teenage girl trying to get comfortable in her new bra.I would reach in and adjust it constantly.I did give it about a month of use, but it is just way to cumbersome and uncomfortable.if it would stay in place and stay tightened up I would like it.it needs something to hold it down in place, especially is your a little stoop shouldered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"I think the brace works great.

Like someone else reviewed, the most it does is serve as a reminder to keep my back straight, but if I get lazy I can hunch over without this thing providing any support against slouching.

I lean over a desk every day for work & noticed my posture was not so great. This brace holds yours shoulders back. While it does this it pulls on the front of you so unless you sit up straight it's harder to breathe. I found more than anything else it keeps you actively aware of your posture so that you sit up straight. I recommend it. Of course it won't perform miracles but it's a step in the right direction. The quality is good. It looks like something a hospital would give out for an injury. I guess you could hide it under a jacket or something.

First off, it was REALLY challenging to put on by myself and adjust squarely on my back. The shoulder straps are really wide so it's hard to cover up, esp in the summer where clothes are a lot less bulky and thin!! More importantly, I did not notice it being effective in helping me stand up straighter or keep my shoulders back...it was a conscious effort on my part to pull my shoulders back and stand straight - something I can do WITHOUT having this brace as a reminder. Overall, didn't find it to be too useful or effective!! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"misrepresented!","review":"The claim that this brace has hook and loop closure is false. In fact, it has neither hook nor loop but only a velcro strip closure. I consider this to be false advertising. When Footsmart was contacted they said this was the only way they could think of to describe the closure because velcro is a trademark. Come on guys, this is not rocket science. I really think the reason for this description is to fool the public into buying this item. It also feels like one has a backpack on one's back. It produces a noticable \\"hump\\" on the back which is what I am trying to prevent by wearing such a contraption.

The author suggests that the British colonial conquests in Asia were not a result of a 2 century long plan but a result of policy mishaps and strategic positioning against the Dutch and then the French during 17th, 18th and the first quarter of the 19th centuries. The story of the main protagonist - a bungling group of shareholders and directors - is very well woven into the political backgroun"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Borrow to Read This Book","review":"For a book that claims to be lyical and class concious, it fails miserably. All class sterotypes from the knocked-up Indian girl, who works as a maid to the rich on Beck's Point (Harbor Point, Michigan) to putting down the Jews at nearby Charlevoix, as being noveux and crass, this book contains all of the attitudes of a spoiled child of Midwestern industialists. Even the wealthy materfamilias happens to be \\"Catholic\\" and dies in a fire. A Repubican WASP point of view is contained throughout this novel. Now that this hardcover book is remaindered, the 44 cents price seems fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting rendition of class and culture","review":"With sparse but image-rich prose, this book follows the lives of two \\"tribes\\" -- one wealthy and white, one poor and Native American -- through two generations. Full of loss, longing, love and redemption, this book hung with me long after I (too-quickly) finished it. The place is vividly rendered, the characters believeable. Though sometimes brushing the edge of sentimentality, Gamble is never preachy, and her rendering of class is right on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reader from California","review":"I loved this book. Terry Gamble writes beautifully, sometimes breathtakingly so. Sometimes I had to put the book down and close my eyes, to savor the images she creates. I fell in love with every character, even Lydia March, the head of the March household, who proves to be a formidable foe for Rachel. Ms. Gamble's sense of place is strong and true and by the time I finished the book, I felt as though I'd lived at Buck's Point, that I knew Rachel and Ben and Lydia and Woody.

The music really doesn't have the same quality as her CD. Sounds kinda cheap. Also there is a woman singing in the background that doesn't even sound like Shakira. She should not even be included.

I actually rather enjoyed everything up until the end, it was a bit wordy at times but I did enjoy the story. It just seems like there were so many things that didn't need to be in there that were and then you get to the end of the book and she rushes right through it. It cheapens what happened to her daughter, as though it's not a big deal to have that happen to you. I think it's sad not only in the fictional sense but also for those children or parents who have had this happen in real life. No child goes through that and just comes home and life just goes back to normal.

I spent a good hour in the bookstore trying to find a new author that I'd never read before and I even read the first few passages of this book and I thought that it would be perfect... I found myself extremely frustrated with this book. It felt like she spent pages upon pages saying the same thing over and over again... How many ways can you describe a mans body? I actually found myself skpping pages at a time because I just couldn't bare it. It felt like a rush job, perhaps a contractual obligation, but it lacked dept and feeling. There were parts that I wished would have been more developed, but weren't... It also turned me off to see many typo's... Not expected of a New York Times Bestseller.

There are phrases that repeat many times (\\"This was Jake.\\", or \\"The thing about Jake [or other people/objects] was . . . \\") The ending was blunt, with many threads linking the evildoer to the rest of the plot left untied. Most annoying was Sarah Mason's repeated ventures, alone, in the dark (of course), despite already having been attacked, having her house invaded/vandalized several times, receiving creepy phone calls, a freaky message on her car window, and being warned a lot about not going around by herself -- ARGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Have been a Karen Robards fan for years. Just finished reading \`Vanished,' and I'm sorry to say I was so disappointed. Was really looking forward to this book, but I just couldn't get into it. It was very boring and I had to force myself to finish, hoping with every chapter that it would get better. Vanished is very unlike any of her other books, almost as if it was written by someone else. I thoroughly enjoy her older historical romances as well as current romantic suspense novels, including Bait and Beachcomber. I've always liked her writing style with the exception of this book.

Do a search for \\"Platipus\\" here at Amazon.com to find that label's excellent trance compilations.The first track on this CD is the original _Voice of Earth_ album version. It is beautiful and uplifting -- you really must hear it if you haven't already. The Cygnus X remix is good, but sounds like a watered-down version of the Ferry Corsten remix that it inspired.

These are the clothes that Dickie Bettes was meant wear. There isn't that forced Southern Rock sound that was evident in his other solo efforts. He's comfortable here doing what comes naturally without struggling for a hit.

Mr. Jensen's thoughtful prose is eminently readable, his argument clear and convincing thanks in no small part to a masterly balancing of distance from and sympathy for his primary subject. The plight of temperament (in Schumann's case, genius) in conflict with ignorance, incomprehension, complacent professionalism and \\"benign\\" authoritarianism continues to be a matter of interest and concern. Who or what today would keep Schumann in a cage?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Dull","review":"Jensen's biography of Schumann is a merely adequate portrayal of this most extraordinary composer. The prose is incredibly flat and repetitive--the \\"insight\\" that Schumann loved children--hardly original considering the \\"Kinderszenen\\" and \\"Album fur die Jugend\\"--is made several times, though any further elucidation is avoided. Another glaring failure of the book is the lack of musical analysis. After spending far too much time on the youthful \\"Papillons,\\" Jensen practically ignores such ground-breaking works as the \\"Gesange der Fruhe\\" and the eerily gorgeous \\"Geistervariationen.\\" Often, such works receive only a curious aside, such as \\"dense texture\\" and the like.

Old arguments repeated ad nauseam; biased and vitriolic; opposing viewpoints misrepresented almost to the point of slander.

Most of the book deals with issues not particularly relevant to the issue. Furthermore, EP is often mischaracterized, so the arguments made against it aren't useful. Also, the arguments are poor and generally don't lead to the claimed conclusions. The first three chapters were so bad I almost quit.There are some good points and ideas in this book. Unfortunately, they're well hidden. One clear exception, Annette Karmiloff-Smith's contribution to this collection is excellent. There are a couple of other contributions that might be worth a read. However, much of the rest of the book is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me become an evolutionary psychologist","review":"When I read this book I was a sceptic about the usefulness of evolutionary ideas in explaining human behaviour. After reading it I became convinced that whatever these people were arguing I must be the opposite. Seriously, there were parts that made me laugh out loud they were so bad. Often these embarrasing excuses for arguments had been written by people who were not otherwise idiots (e.g. Anne Fausto-Sterling, Mary Midgely) but the arguments they used here would have embarassed a first year philosopy undergrad.

I have no problem with balancing the enthusiasm for evolutionary psychology with some good arguments, rational doubts, and sincere logic. Unfortunately, those are nonexistent in most of the work of Gould, et. al. The arguments are against a lunatic fringe that exists in every discipline, but assume that all those who ascribe to parts of ev psych believe all men to be inherent rapists, etc. etc., which is ridiculous. Anyone looking at this should balance it out with a book or two of Trivers or, even more palatable, David Buss, one of the best professors I've ever had and a very good writer on the subject. By all means, do not let this be your introduction to a discipline that is not even nearly represented in this ridiculous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent way to hit the on ramp to internet security.","review":"The data presented is cleanly written, and made available to trained and untrained minds alike.

I read this book as a favor to a colleague who's son is using it as required reading for a college course.This book is one of the worst books on security I have ever read. It states decent concepts, but the explanations are often entirely inaccurate. One that comes to mind is the statement that firewalls should operate at least at C2 security, but B1 is recommended. Those ratings are government ratings that are no longer used and even when they were, would not be accurate as both ratings require no networking capabilities to be installed.

It is not a story of the friendship between Alcott and Barton; indeed, Susan is closer to each of them than they are to each other. Still, it is a good story, well told, about friendship among women; it could stand on that truthful blurb alone, IMO. The book also gives good insight into the lives of women in the mid-19th century and provides never-to-be-forgotten glimpses into Civil War medical care.It may be my own pet peeve (I once had a fight with a poet who wrote about cows being made into bacon) but historical accuracy is a little loose. I don't mind the imagined cousin to move the plot along but, IIRC, Lincoln did not die the night he was assassinated; he died several days later at a residence across the street from Ford's theater. This jars the storytelling at a crucial point in the background narrative.The Bookschlepper"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerhouse Novel","review":"I so enjoyed The Glory Cloak, I could scarcely put it down.

The people who wrote it are clearly very experienced about this country. Just what we, and maybe you all, need to explore with confidence, if you're going for more than a casual trip.

If you are a member of AARP, you may enjoy the suggestions in this book. The worst part was the maps. Would it kill them to put all the information such as hotels, restaurants, shopping and entertainment on the SAME map instead of making me jump back and forth between several maps? The separation of graphic information made it frustratingly difficult to plan out daily itineraries. This book found better use as toilet paper.

That is to say, it is not designed to actually be used. My unit held out a little longer than that of other reviewers. I actually used it 2-3 times to switch out my regular tires for my all-weather snow tires, and it did indeed pump air into my tires. Of course, it required about 20 minutes of vIgorous pumping per tire. On my 4th use I heard a \\"popping\\" sound and I new this worthless hunk of metal had checked out.

They have incredible bodies and that in and of itself is motivating! If your butt improves instantly (which it will), does it matter who is smiling?! Each section is three exercises, and each is done in three sets with a stretch after each. If you have limited time skip a set, but don't skip an exercise.

However, what makes this album stand out is Van Morrison. He is an incredible singer who knows these songs and their history in vivid detail.

It is obvious from the writing that this is one of Kundera's earlier works. It has none of the polished prose of his later novels.

I wasn't wrong. This version stalled, tripped, then fell flat on its face early on. I've never seen such a lifeless horror flick. Everyone and everything was bland. There was an overriding sense of disinterest by everyone involved. I got the feeling that they just wanted to get it over with and move on to something better. Poor Ed Burns looked stunned throughout, as though he couldn't believe his agent stuck him with this thankless role. Likewise, Margaret Cho's indifferent contribution as a disbelieving cop. Even the evil ghost that was behind it all came off little better than a cartoon (in fact, at times it even looked animated).

The Asian originals make little sense, getting by on atmosphere; the American remakes make even less. This mash up of Ring, Grudge, Final Destination is an incoherent mess, even by the lowest standards, and it's a shame because I really like Shannyn Sossamon. She's one of those actors who have likability even in the worst mess, and she is professional enough to act, instead of phoning it in the way Burns does (he looks great, but he makes it very obvious to the viewer that he knows it's crap and he's only there for a check, which is understandable, but unprofessional).Avoid this- the worst episode of Supernatural is far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Dismal...","review":"In the tradition of The Ring and The Grudge, this is yet another attempt to capitalize on the once-successful franchise of Japanese horror film remakes. However, this movie barely registers on the richter scale. It plods along and by the middle of it, I found it almost laughable. It leaves one to wonder what the original film was like and whether it was as incongruous and silly. Shannyn is a good actress and would be better suited for more original material. Only watch this if you feel ghosts traveling thru cell phones to usher your demise is a terrifying premise. Could be.

Apparently I was right to be so!...it sucked it didn't even end right....they completely screwed that part up!.....Of course I don't know what I expected when they couldn't even get the ring tone right. The original was much better in terms of acting (although I will say the mane female lead did well) and they didn't have the cheap Hollywood scares that the US versions of movies seem so intent on using.....it was just a really great psychological horror movie...that gave you a lot more to think about at the end than its American counter part....my opinion see the original and forget this crappy remake was ever done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!!","review":"Today is my 19th Birthday and I had to see this crappy movie on my Birthday last year.

The original One Missed Call is well worth watching/reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawful","review":"One Missed Call, yet another PG-13 take on the Japanese horror genre, is a godawful mess from beginning to end. A group of young people start getting mysterious messages on their cell phones, which contain recordings of their own future deaths. Sadly, One Missed Call does little with the premise, other than throw one predictable scare at you one right after the other. The script is terrible with some hideous moments of dialogue, and the film as a whole lacks any kind of real guts and feels incredibly restrained in it's violence, and thus has no teeth to speak of. The acting, if one were to call it that, is just as bad. Not to mention, one has to wonder just what Edward Burns did to get cast in garbage like this. If starring in A Sound of Thunder was bad enough, Burns heads a cast here that includes Shannon Sossamon, Meagan Good, Azura Skye, and Ray Wise; and he manages to out do them all. Granted though, it isn't by much. Avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two missed hours","review":"This movie is just awful. Plain terrible. Ed Burns must be needing to pay the rent.

If you have the money for this movie save it for something else - Trust me you won't regret it. I watched the ending 3 times and honestly it made no sense. So...to sum it up...One Missed Call is one movie that you can miss and find something better to do with the time it runs!

I have nothing against remakes, but this one just doesn't work that well. First, it's not very scary. Then the acting comes off kind of stiff and overall it gets pretty boring.

I do. I can't help but keep myself occupied during the seemingly forever running time, thinking of how I would have done it.This movie starts off so lame and continues steadily the entire time. No real plot or character development. No directoral flow. No good acting. And the only thing creepy about the entire movie is the creepy ring tone. But the whole concept of a cell phone curse is totally B Grade and cheesy. Also, the broadcasted exorcism by a day time talk show host sums it all up.Don't waist your time. You'll wonder why you didn't just ignore this call."},{"rating":"1","title":"One movie you should \\"miss\\"","review":"This is a J-horror remake film that falls into the whole cliche of J-horror film remakes. This film could've possibly been OK, but I'm one of the many people who don't like this movie. \\"One Missed Call\\" is cliche in basically every way. It was basically as bad as \\"Pulse\\". I also hate that line where that girl says something like \\"You get a phone call, you hear your death, and then you die\\". It's trying to be creepy when it's horribly acted. There are some creepy points in this film, like that weird creature and those people that have screaming faces as eyes, but that's about it. You could possibly get this creepy feeling at the ending, but the feeling won't last long at all. You will NOT lose any sleep over this movie...unless you've never seen a horror movie and you're 6 years old.

If you are trying to validate your own blackjack simulations or if you are just interested in knowing the relative value of each player hand and each dealer up card, you'll find help in this book.But don't buy this book until you have already learned basic strategy.Review courtesy of www.hitorsplit.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent advanced book on Blackjack","review":"This is a good book for those players who want to get beyond the \\"what is blackjack\\" primers on the market. Much useful information on the probabilities involved in the game, and lots of tables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful but dated","review":"This book is primarily useful as a reference work. Anyone who is serious about using either of the systems presented in it (Hi-Lo and Halves) will need it, but it is definitely not for beginners.Playing conditions have deteriorated nationwide since this book was first published (and since its update) as the casinos have engaged in an \\"arms race\\" with counters, and so the outlook it presents is (to say the least) highly optimistic. Casinos have wised up about how to catch skilled players, and are much more careful about the options and promotions that they offer. Blackjack is no longer the easy road to riches.The discussion parts of the book do not sufficiently emphasize the importance of the depth-of-deal (penetration) to the player. This, more than which system or which tables are memorized, is the key to winning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good CD","review":"This CD really isn't as bad as others may have you think.

One thing bugged me though; after a few weeks the screen began to turn foggy in the material itself, making it a little harder to see the screen. After a few months, the screen became unreadable. This product does not last and is good for only a few months of usage.BTW: The installation process requires that you place the magnetic reader on the front fork and the magnet on the front spokes, but it does not tell you how high up on the spokes it needs to be. It does not matter where you put it on the front spokes, because any location will pass by the forks at the exact same time. The outer part of the spokes will just pass the sensor the same as the inner part of the spokes, not affecting the meter."},{"rating":"2","title":"cakes","review":"best mini cakes i ever made. pans were smaller than the previous pan i had but it worked out just fine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had several more!","review":"I hesitated to buy these pans because I wasn't sure I would use them very often.

A lot of useful outdoorsman functions, excellent range and clearity, light weight and compact. The only bad things I can really say about it right now is that it doesn't have a retractable/folddown antenna (Kenwood has one), location of the push to talk button and the belt clip, which seems very \\"cheesy\\" and doesn't give the impression that it is very secure.

The recordings on this disc were never meant to be commercially distributed - indeed the military is prohibited from doing so and thus gives them away for free. I have spoken with many of the military performers here in DC and they resent that a commercial company is able to sell these otherwise free recodings as a result of a quirk in the law. More importantly, the selections are not recorded in a way that is consistent with professional commercial standards. Other commercial patriotic CDs are much better.

I have tried it several times and it does not live up to its description. It falls off after I shower (thus not waterproof), and with in a hour after putting on dry skin it is falling off.

As a college student, I use spreadsheet and word processors quite frequently. I found that Word 2002 was cumbersome, ugly, and not as simple to use as previous editions (Word '97 was the best); and the spreadsheet was hard to manipulate and often did not operate the way I wanted it to. Making a graph with the proper axes proved quite difficult. To top this all off, this comes with Money 2002, Streets and Trips, and Picture It! Photo... features I doubt I'll ever use.

They are POSITIVE role models, unlike Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, (ironically they started out with Disney, lol)I also appreciate that it is not like rap music, which I never cared for. The songs are all good, we don't have to skip around to find a good song. The words are all innocent--no swearing or sex talk, it really is geared to younger kids and tweens. All of my daughters friends loved the movie and sing the songs all the time. I'm looking forward to the movie release. The dancing in the movie is \\"cool\\" and mom-approved.

But as I saw it the second time, and continuously heard the soundtrack (it's everywhere!), I started to realize: This is a mediocre musical.First of all, the main character, Zac Efron (Troy Bolton), DOESN't EVEN SING! I've read some peoples reviews saying, \\"I have proof it was Zac singing!\\" Yeah, these people have obsessions with Zac Efron, and won't smell the coffee. To all you people who still believe that it is Zac Efron singing, go to www.imdb.com, search High School Musical, and click on \\"cast\\" and it says the name of the guy who sings FOR Zac. People, get over it!And another thing. Even though the music may be somewhat entertaining, the plot to the movie is pretty stupid.Overall, I was impressed, until I did my research and found out it isn't even Zac singing!

You'll never get tired of listening to these songs. It's May and it's still my favorite CD to listen to. The lyrics come with the CD so you don't have to go online and search for them. There are two karaoke tracks, a song that wasn't included in the movie, and a remix of Getcha Head in the Game by B5.

I have had the misfortune of seeing this movie-twice. The acting is as fake is Ashley Tisdale's singing. Yep. The music is awful. But, I know how everyone can sing EXACTLY like Ashley Tisdale (Who plays Sharpay): Sing any song from the soundtrack with your fingers plugged inside your nose. Wow!! You sounds exactly like Sharpay! Yes, the music is that bad and unproffesional. They only hired these actors because they were the only ones willing to be in such a corny movie.I despise this movie and soundtrack.

The man girl, Gabriela, looked like she was in a music video in her solo. It was painful to watch. The entire thing was just too unrealistic to me about highschool life. ON the voices, well, it sounded very very very computerized. You can tell these aren't the kids real voices.

Oh yeah, theres gays and straights and bis and anything else you could think of and everyones fine with it. Some people might think thats a vulgar thing to say on a kid's movie but hey, gays are a reality and drama clubs love jocks and other people joinging, the varsity football and basketball captain had a lead in Grease last year at my school and its not cause he sang like a pop star.

All I could muster up is that I'm not a tween girl [that marketable age range between 6 and 13]. Any adult with an IQ point higher than that will be heading out towards the ENT to stop the bleeding.

Instead, I was somewhat surprised when I loved the movie, probably mostly because of the catchy songs (my favorite being \\"What I've Been Looking For\\") I don't think I would I would pay the $9.99 + shipping for this album if you have an iPOD, I would recommend just picking your favorites and downloading them in iTUNES.

My favorites are the hip hop Getcha Head in the Game done by Zac Efron & as a bonus the group B5. I also like the hit pop song \\" Breaking Free \\" by Zac & Vanessa Anne Hudgens. The whole cast joins in on We're All in This Together,another of my favorites.As a bonus there are 2 Karaoke tracks of songs so your young star at home can solo!Parents not only can give this CD as a gift without worry but may find themselves enjoying as well !"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good soundtrack","review":"this is a very good soundtrack.I like the song the start of something new,get'cha head in the game,what i've been looking for,what i've been looking for (reprise),stick to the status quo,when there was me and you,bob to the top,breaking free,We're All In This Together,I Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You, Get'cha Head In The Game B5 and Get'cha Head In The Game - B5 plus you can sing karaoke of the songs breaking free and the start of something new and it gives you words to all the songs it has a great singing cast like Zac Efron playing Troy Bolton Vanessa Anne Hutchinson playing Gabriella Montez Lucas Grabeel playing Ryan Evans Ashley Tisdale playing Sharpay Evans and much more even my mom liked the soundtrack and she doesen't really like disney soundtracks this is a really good soundtack. and if u seen the movie and liked it this is a good cd for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Great","review":"It is a great movie for kids and adults everywhere.

They are something that you can listen to on Radio Disney.

I watched the first hour or so, but by then it was so boring...just get to the end of the movie already!!! Ashley Tisdale did a pretty good job playing the brat (the opposite of her character in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody).There's not much to the singing abilities of anyone in this movie. What's worse is that it doesn't look like they're really singing it at all. I don't care if they really sang them or not....they obviously try too hard to look like they did. This is really all directed at Zac Efron, who seriously opens his mouth WAY too wide everytime he sings the smallest note...it's just weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST EVER","review":"THIS IS ONE GREAT CD THE MOVIE WAS VERY VERY VERY VERY GOOD AND I LOVED THE MUSIC FROM IT ESPICALLY THE ZAC EFRONS SONGS SO I HAD TO GET THE CD SO I COULD PUT THE SONGS ON TO MY IPOD!!!

I also really enjoy the reprise version of that song and also \\"Breaking Free.\\" Plus the 2 karaoke tracks are sweet! This is a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"High Scool Musical\\" is out!","review":"This year's best selling CD, is \\"High School Musical\\" which has gotten too much publicity. The soundtrack is OK, the best song is \\"Breaking Free\\", performed by Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens. Ashley Tisdale sounds like she has a robotic voice, its so digital and computerized. But \\"The Cheetah Girls 2\\" soundtrack is WAYYYY better if you like GREAT music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesiest Movie, yet Appealing","review":"Do you ever feeling like watching a movie where you can sing and dance along with and yet barely think at all? Well, this is the mindless movie you'd watch. However annoying, this movie is a movie that is sweet and fun. The comedy is at times very funny, and the scenery and (dare I say it) fashion are something to look at. The songs even if the lyrics are a jumble of words, are melodic and have great beats. The acting is okay, the singing good, and the corny plot=great. Everyone wins at the end, but you still have to love this movie. I recommend it for people who love those romantic, musical, comedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album for kids!","review":"My 8 yr. old daughter loved the movie and plays the soundtrack over and over.

H. White, author of 'The Once and Future King' which served as the basis for Disney's Sword in the Stone and the musical Camelot. Here you have pious nonsense served up raw but delightfully.

But I quickly grew tired of his lonely characters, each with their sad obsession with sex. Instead of careful observations on love's role in one's identity, his characters' relationships are lust-centered and stray from any further understanding of their personal development.Perhaps it was good erotica if I hadn't been so bored.

Could they spare it? There are two other tracks on this CD, but unless you're an Enya fan, they're probably not the reason you bought this release. Unfortunately, this short version of \\"Only Time\\" is going to cost you plenty...well over double the cost of the average CD single, and it's not even a maxi-single! What a rip-off!(...) this remix simply adds a subtle drum track and punches up the synths a bit. The song has *not* been sped up and is far from being an uptempo dance mix.In any case, it's a huge disappointment and a very poor value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the normal version but an electronic dance mix!","review":"Only Time is beautiful and one of my favorite songs but it just doesn't work as an electronic dance mix, it just takes away from the beatiful lyrics and Enya's beautiful angelic voice!

Pearl jam has lost the adolescent anger they had on their first two CDs, in songs like Alive and Jeremy, or Indifferece, Go and Animal. Their best songs on this their fifth album they have reduced them selves to melodic semi hard rock. There is one song though who shake my soul, \\"do the evolution\\" its anger and power is enormous. Also \\"Brain of JFK\\" shows that they still have the anger to rock in them. But, just because they have calmed down, it doesn't mean that its bad, most songs are of high standard and tha album scrapes together a 4 from me. However they have better stuff in them, that is shown in \\"do the evolution\\"Andreas"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love or hate pearl jam, you must buy it.","review":"Wow!

Not like it is a copy of someone else music but more like it has an aura that makes me feel at home listening to the songs.

I hate how it got to number 1 on MTV2, Pearl Jam shouldn't get radio play or money from people buying their CDs. I haven't liked any song I've ever heard by this awful band.

After the commercial disaster that was No Code, the Jam returned to old formula with Yield. Gone are the spiritual deliberations that dominated No Code; in are the tried-and-true mixture of boogie workouts and life-affirming meditations. Pearl Jam have their thing and they do it well- don't go changing on us boys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best","review":"Most people slobber over \\"Ten,\\" but \\"Yield\\" is a wonderfully understated album. \\"Do the Evolution\\" is their best flat-out rocker (coupled with a great video animated by the creator of \\"Spawn\\"), while songs like \\"Given to Fly,\\" \\"Wishlist\\" and \\"Faithful\\" bring out the best in the band. There are a couple of lapses into pretension (\\"Push Me, Pull Me\\" and the red dot song) but Eddie Vedder appears to have rescued himself from his coma."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good album overall","review":"This album is definately one of their best. The only album of theirs that can compete with this one is Vitalogy, which is their best album. Brain Of J. kicks off the album with a fast, quick beat, then ends up leading into one of the best songs on the album, Faithfull. This song starts off slow and then gets picked up into an epic chorus. Do The Evolution is a loud power rocker, and is sort of fun to listen to. Ballads such as In Hiding and All Those Yesterdays remain two of the best songs on the album. Don't expect to find any hit singles on this one. This is just the band laying back having fun in the studio. This isn't s great record in the least, but definately worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yield - don't hesitate","review":"I enjoy this CD. Pearl Jam mixed with middle eastern influences. This has Given to Fly and Do the Evolution but I love all the songs. The lyrics and music are deep and inspiring - just soaring. My favorites are Given to Fly; Faithfull; No Way; Wishlist, Pilate; MFC; Low Light; and In Hiding. This album has been discontinued so don't hesitate to get it, it will be well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"ok this cd is awesome ..u people quit dissing it...\\"brain of j\\" and \\"do the evolution\\" are 2 of the loudest ,grinding rockers that pj has ever done.\\" wishlist\\" is one of the prettiest.as is \\"all those yesterdays\\" and \\"given to fly\\" pearl jam has improved upon no code which really was a good cd.....AND TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO DISS\\"VITALOGY\\"..THAT CD IS CLOSE A MASTERPIECE AS TEN I DONT CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS...\\"NOT FOR YOU\\" AND \\"CORDUROY\\" AND \\"BETTER MAN\\" ARE 3 OF PJ'S BEST SONGDS EVER SO THERE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite albums ever!","review":"I have been a fan of Pearl Jam since their first appearance on MTV... but never loved their music enough in the beginning to buy it... though I thought it was really good music. On some odd chance I bought Yield and quickly fell in love with every track on the album. I think that they have ignored the popular themes in the market to come up with stuff that is truly original and powerful. Damn good album... if you like \\"alternative\\" or \\"rock\\" or anything along the lines of that I'd recommend this album/CD highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Jam, you've done it again.","review":"First there was TEN, which simply, is the best creation in all of music history. What followed was 2 other fantastic albums. But sadly, NO CODE left much to be desired. Then this came along, and basically gave life back to the band. Every song is a must hear, with favourites such as BRAIN OF J, WISHLIST and GIVEN TO FLY. This is , to put it bluntly, right up there with TEN. A MUST buy!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks.","review":"Pearl Jam started to suck since VS....they became dull, boring, and irrelevent with this horrible album. VS and afterward are not worth listening to, Pearl Jam was TEN thats it."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip","review":"I never quite understood the appeal of this album, or the appeal of most of the popular Pearl Jam albums for that matter. It seems the more popular a Pearl Jam album is, the more likely I am to think the album isn't quite as good as one of the bands less popular efforts. Yield is a fine example of that.Something about the vocal melodies on this particular effort strike me as unsatisfying for the most part. Pearl Jam is (or was) certainly capable of creating a mighty fine album when they wanted to. Problem is, Yield doesn't show me any of the bands finer qualities.Yield doesn't strike me as an album you should own, and just like Ten, it's my belief the two albums both have something in common- they are both overrated because the vocal melodies are weak, and the songwriting isn't up to the bands usual high standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critics be damned, This is a Solid Album","review":"This is Pearl Jam at their most honest. This is also Pearl Jam at their most uncertain. Eddie Vedder sounds distincly like a man rather than the howling God of \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\" Even the guitars sound like they are asking questions. \\"Do the Evolution\\" could have easily been turned into a fist pumping, testosterone injected thrasher. Instead the guitars are muted and muffled and Vedder sings every line as if it were a sick joke. I leave you to decide which deliverly is more powerful. As someone who has been a Pearl Jam fan most of my life, I have always considered the band's one indispensible quality to be their sincirety. No where is this quality more clear than on \\"Yield.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cd's","review":"I belive that this cd is an evolution for the group.

Thank God for Amazon, because here it is. If you love this type of Django-Jazz, you will be blown away. Musician friends of ours have sat in our living room listening to this CD in complete awe; the energy, musicianship, and sheer joy of playing comes through on this CD in a way that I've yet to experience. I can't say enough about it.

As a Grade 5 teacher it is always refreshing to discover a story that entertains and incorporates science topics. This is a great book for students in Grades 4 & 5. It draws the reader into the plot by revealing wonderous revelations about the characters and their delema bit by bit, then closing each chapter in anticipation of things to come. An excellent book for reading parent-to-child, parent-with-child, in peer groups, or independently.

Good Reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you want The Wonderful Flight To the Mushroom Planet?","review":"This review was writen by my son Sam Anderson, age 9 after reading this book. Do you want to buy a great book? I recomend The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet as a book you should read. This is an adventure story that is very exciting. Here are 3 statements that I came up with to describe this book; 1)It's a good book 2)It's exciting 3)It's a good story. You can find it at your local library. Have more fun finding this book at www.Amazon.com! I hope you like this book as much as I did. This book is fun and exciting for the whold family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"About the only thing I can remember from second grade, back in '61 or '62, is that I read The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet--repeatedly--and loved it. I always wished that I too could meet Mr. Tyco M. Bass. It never occurred to me at the time that I would have been prevented from doing so because I was a girl. As I recall, the little green ad that David's father found in the Pacific Grove newspaper was an invitation to a boy or boys to go on an adventure and do a good deed. But this didn't stop me from being enthralled with the book, with Mr. Bass, Mr. Bass's observatory, telescopes, filters, workshop, the Mushroom Planet, David & Chuck's spaceship, Mr. Bass's rocket fuel formula, or David's humble spur-of-the-moment mascot, Mrs. Pennyfeather (I believe that was her name).A great book to read if you are eight! Also great if you are 48!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A long-lost treasure regained: sans-drawings...","review":"I read this and other Mushroom Planet books as a child. I had forgotten the titles until a couple of years ago when I discovered the book during a Parent's Night at my son's elementary school. I read the book to my son who was 6 at the time. One thing I noticed is that the author's sentence constructions are particularly difficult to read aloud. The current published versions claim Robert Henneberger as the illustrator, but none of the in-print versions (that I can find) are illustrated! This is especially sad, as the drawings of the spaceship, Mr. Bass, and his laboratory were a lot of the appeal to me as a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great children's book.","review":"I read this as an eight year old and never forgot it. It was just as delightful over forty years later. I plan to read it to my grandchildren, and I hope they enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sort of glad Spielberg or Lucas never touched it","review":"All of the Mushroom Planet books should be considered as gems by the major movie producers, but think about the political correctness they would likely impose. The original story had two boys, Dave and Chuck, building the spacecraft. I'm sure most Hollywood producers would inflict a girl into the scene with no regard to the integrity of the author's written word. In fact there is almost no role played by any female in these books. Would that stop the Hollywood distortion machine from wreaking havoc with the original story line ? NO. If the Mushroom Planet saga ever is made into film, my prediction is that it will bear scant resemblance to Eleanor Cameron's superlative vision of a small invisible planet visited by two small boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine - (for most people","review":"I read a book called The Mushroom Planet, by Eleanor Cameron. It takes place in the city and on the planet. Two boys named Chuck and David go to a planet. They are supposed to save the planet from starvation and sickness. But did they save it? Read to find out!

Believe me, Levine doesn't know how to get in touch with any celebrities--he hasn't represented one since he split from another PR company and formed his own.Don't waste any money on this book. If you want to contact a celebrity, just do a little research online and you can find out what company represents them, and send your mail through them.

Not only is the picture poor, (lots of lines, distortions and poor color), but someone rewrote the translations. Also, not only were words changed, there were a lot of spelling errors.

From the moment I saw the distributor's clip play in front of the title screen, I just knew that this transfer was going to be crap - I was not disappointed in this respect. The sound? Like it was recorded from an oscillating speaker. The picture? I am convinced that someone personally applied scratches, grit and god knows what else to each and every frame - they might have also bleached it as the colors are both dull and overblown at once. And the sub-titles? Prease, do not odd started me get mister.All I can say is what a shame, what a disappointment! Raise the Red Lantern is a wonderful film which I would recommend to anyone, however this DVD is appalling. I'm not alone in this feeling, as you can read for yourself in the other reviews.

I own a copy of this film on vhs and it is far superior to the dvd transfer. The transfer looks like it was made from the worst possible copy they could find. And don't get me started on the subtitles... It's shocking that the distributors would let something like this out, but then again we are talking about money.

Whatever happened to quality control?. Is the American audience so starved for good film that it will buy/sell such a mediocre product? The audio isn't in true stereo, and the video is blotchy.

To top things off, my wife and I who had been anticipating release of this incredible movie on DVD have viewed the many reviews describing the appallingly poor quality of this release and will most likely now have to wait many more years to elapse before we will see Raise the Red Lantern again. What a debacle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great film ruined","review":"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers. I also absolutely love this movie. However, the quality of this DVD honestly couldn't be alot worse. It does indeed look like a very bad job was done of \\"taping\\" this movie. It looks like an old VHS tape you might have that was copied from a copy (that itself had been copied from another copy). The translations are extremely poor (my initial thought was they had gotten a person whose primary language was Chinese, and that didn't speak English very weel to translate the movie). Also, they only translate the audio...any characters written on the screen are not translated.If you've seen the version of this movie on the premium cable channels, don't expect to see that same quality. That is not the version you get on the DVD. Had I known this, I certainly would have passed on this DVD.

Since I loved the movie so much, I thought I would make an exception for the first few minutes, but as the movie continued, so did the white lines. I could not believe what I was seeing. The DVD copy of this movie, reminded me of the old movies I use to see years ago, when there were only 7 channels on TV.And not only is the visual appearance of this movie distorted so is the sound.

This is a 5-star movie, but the quality of this transfer is horrible. Parts of the movie are very scratchy and full of film debris. Worst yet, to me, are the subtitles. They are laughable. Almost every subtitle contained some error. While it was (sorta) fun to laugh and the odd subtitles, that tended to remove me emotionally from the film. Too bad. The same comments apply to the \\"Ju-Dou\\" release from this same company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD, beautiful movie","review":"This DVD is a travesty. I agree with many of the reviewers here and plan to return my copy - my VHS copy is infinitely better - I wish everyone who bought this DVD would return their copy - maybe the people who created this MISERABLE OBJECT would get the message. My DVD was not knocking around loose in the case or anything. The amount of snow and scratches right off the bat was ... well, words fall utterly short. The colors were ruined, there were even out of focus spots. GOK what their source material was, but I think sandpaper may have been involved. The laughable subtitles were just rancid icing on the poison cake. I think I'm still feeling the effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"This really comes as a shock! And I am not talking about the quality of the film but the quality of the transfer.You simply can not believe your eyes when the titles at the beginning of the film start to roll. Scratches all over the places, overblown colours, and it does not get better.This is a really shoddy release, that nobody who loves this film should buy. Why was this released at all? This is no favour to the film and its creators. And surely it is no calling card for the company who released this mess.So: BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor transfer","review":"As much as I think this a wonderful movie, which I've watched many times both on its original release and on vhs, this has to be the worst dvd transfer I've ever purchased. Not only is the image scratched and snowy, the subtitles, not the same as the vhs, are appallingly bad. If the release company is going to market this as a 'collection' by the director, then it could have made some minimal effort to preserve the integrity of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this movie but not this copy","review":"The translation is so messed up on this copy.

I own the VHS tape and recently \\"upgraded\\" to the DVD. I should have read the reviews prior to purchasing the DVD - what a giant disappointment!This DVD is horrible. I can't believe that it is even on the market. The picture is snowy - white streaks running thru the whole movie. Picture quality is murky, colors are foggy and uneven. The sound is equally horrible.Shame on whoever produced this less than amateurish DVD. This movie deserves better.

Hopefully someone will transfer this properly to DVD format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, there's are better Yimou Zhang's movies than The House... and Hero","review":"Yimou Zhang took a great novella by Su Tong, added red lanterns, and made one compelling beautiful film. However, the transfer of this DVD is a travesty. From the appearance of the main titles one would think this is a bootleg version of the film. The scratches, the poor sound quality, and the inaccurate English subtitles make the watching of this DVD a painful experience. It's a shame that such a visually and musically stunning film has to suffer from corporate greed. Do yourself a favor... See this movie on Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Film","review":"The first time I saw this movie, I was sort of annoyed by the way the Master of the House treated his wives with the expectation that they will be available to him at his whim. But as I watched it more and more, I began to realize that even though there was a strong cultural tradition to behold amongst those within the household, each wife had to maintain her own salvation in a fierce competition for the Master's attention more so than love. And the master did nothing to encourage harmony within this household. The jealousy shown by Mistress #2 only lead to lies, deception and eventually murder. The movie is beautifully done and I especially like the way the seasons are depicted to add some sense that with each comes a new beginning, fresh start. But we are quickly fooled. I highly recommend this movie for all to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Culture","review":"I had to watch this video for an English class in college.

When I received the DVD, I could hear that the sound of the disk moving in the box i.e. it had not been properly locked in. Sure enough, when I looked at the disk, I saw scratches all over the disk. I hade emailed to Amazon telling them my problem. And, I did not receive any response. Instead, I receive a computer generated reply which does not address my problem.I want a new DVD of the movie to be sent to me. I am so disappointed by the lack of attention in such an organisation.By the way, I also have a complaint about another movie \\"The Story of Qiu Ju\\" which I had ordered in the same batch. You can see this in my review on the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I ever saw","review":"I HATE when that happens. You watch a film and boy, is it bad. But you keep watching, thinking it HAS to get better because NOTHING can be THIS BAD!So you hold on, and hold on just a bit longer straining to see things turn around. Then BAM ! The WORST part of all happens & it's over at the same time.Aarrgggghhhh. Now, all you have are REGRETS you ever came by the stupid movie in the first place, & wishes you could erase it from your memory banks.Sigh. Live. Make mistakes. (Hopefully)Learn & avoid the same mistake in the future... and when you have opportunity: do what you can to help others not repeat your painful costly error.Do yourself a favor watch something else. Something with Jackie Chan, perhaps... or the wonderfully romantic mini-series At the Dolphin Bay (you can see previews on youtube. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"....gimme a break","review":"Unfortunately for me I had seen this flick. Chinese movies never connected to real life as freedom of speech is directive from Communist party and to understand it you have to move to China and experience reality and this is why the movie set up in 1920 as it safe. Movie is also boring as it possibly could be. Brrrrr..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful & haunting movie that bears repeat viewing.","review":"I caught this movie on the CBC channel late Sat. night and I was floored by it's visual beauty and haunting storyline. The quality of the cinematography, direction and acting is exceptionally high. The film grabs you and doesn't let go until it reaches it final tragic ending. Gong Li is special as Songlian, however the acting by the rest of the cast is also first-rate. This is a film that has to be viewed more than once to truly appreciate its special qualities. Looking forward to getting it on video so that I can see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I absolutely love this film - it's difficult to get Chinese films in PAL format in the UK, but I managed to get this one from a local store after much looking - I really recommend it. The camera angles are inspiring, and the plot works remarkably well. I have read the book by Su Tong, as well, and though much in the book and in the film does not match, it is a inspirational adaption. I hope that one day \\"Opium Family\\" by the same author gets made into a film too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Orientalism, but still Chinese","review":"Yimou Zhang attacks the problem of creating a legitimate transnational film for the People's Republic of China; at the same time acceptable to his censors and popular enough outside China to convince all concerned of the venture. He chooses a novella by Su Tong, who walked the same tightrope in print; and in adapting the story for the screen manages to convert the 'lush exotic detail' that is the stereotype for Asian goods,into another symbolism that fits East and West alike.Li Gong is as always breathtaking in beauty and acting, and the rest of the cast is flawless. Yimou brings forward many of the visual and cultural emblems from Ju Dou,which is likewise melancholy and dangerous, and continues through a remarkable run of films such as Shanghai Triad and To Live. If one has come to Chinese film via Crouching Tiger, a long look at these films will do wonders. Red Lantern is a good place to start. Don't miss Red Sorghum."},{"rating":"2","title":"I watched it few times!","review":"Great movie!

A university-educated (which here means 6 months!) girl goes to live as a concubine in the home of a wealthy feudal nobleman in 1920's China, having accepted that she has no future if she tries to make it on her own. Once there, she becomes the Fourth Wife/Mistress, and embroiled in a battle for her Master's favour (in doing so makes life much easier), and to stay sane. The acting is brilliant, the relationships between the women of the house and their servants well-realised, and the atmosphere is perfect. There cannot be any excuse for not seeing this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to Tony Polito!","review":"His review is spot on--the transfer on this film is horrible. The VHS is much better quality, with more fidelity both to sound and to color. From a transfer standpoint, it almost looks like an early-70s film in terms of the washed-out look of it.Hopefully someone will have the decency to come out with a new version of this (and please--release Red Sorghum, too!) that treats it with the respect it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to stop watching...","review":"Like almost every other recent reviewer, I have been waiting years for this beautiful movie to be released on DVD...what a disappointment. I can only reiterate what everyone else has said - the film quality is so bad and the translation is so ridiculous that about 15 minutes into it I just had to turn it off. I have never seen such a poor-quality DVD! PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS VERSION OF THE DVD! It's a piece of junk and does no justice to the absolute beauty of the original movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WE'VE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS ON DVD, BUT....","review":"I've been waiting for \\"Raise the Red Lantern\\" on DVD for quite awhile. It is good to finally see it available. However, this transfer is very disappointing. First of all, the print is not restored. In fact it's not a new one! This one's been shown many times in some cinema somewhere with scratches and all. Also the \\"Surround\\" sounds more like mono to me. And worse of all, in 2006, it's \\"widescreen\\" but not \\"Anamorphic\\" nor \\"Enhanced\\" for widesceen televisions. I still have my Laser Disc of this fim which is \\"Pan and Scan\\", but at least it's a new print and in real \\"Surround\\" sound! This is a stunning film visually and a wonderful story. It's a shame someone didn't do it justice. Keep an eye out for a new mastering one of these days. Hey, Criterion! Are you listening?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made movie of a situation that could have truly happened","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much because the actors were very good. The Story is sad and you have to realize that in every culture in the world there has been a view that women are just property. It also shows how different personalities of people co-exist together and that one needs to be careful of their words and actions so as to be able to co-exist in situations in which we can not change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"I've been a collector of fine films for years. I have the original Laser edition of \\"Raise the Red Lantern\\" though it is the cropped version. I'd waited years for the eventual DVD release of this fine film. What a disappointment.

Sadly though its transfer to DVD is appalling - the picture quality is so poor it resembles a pirate copy and the subtitles are so badly translated that they would be laughable if they didn't ruin such a fine film. (What is a 'forth wife'? Why is the master of the household so often referred to as 'the mister'? Who thinks 'come-on in, come-on in' is natural English?) It's the worst subtitling I have seen in 25 years. This film really deserved a great deal better. And Amazon oughtn't to sell a product of such dubious quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I have rented this VHS tape many, many times over the last 5 years and never tire of it.

If you love this movie, or even films in general, you'll only be left angry and frustrated after viewing this low-rent excuse of a DVD. Razor Digitalent, the California-based company listed on the DVD as the distributor, should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is great the DVD copy is TERRIBLE","review":"This is a really great movie, bittersweet, sad and just wonderful acting. I was really excited to have to come out on dvd finally. HOWEVER, this DVD version is absolutely DREADFUL, it is all scratchy and poppy, it looks like someone just did a really rough copy from an old vhs tape and put it onto the DVD, it needed a lot of remastering and it didnt get that. I hope someone else releases a better version of it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did they find this scratched up film?","review":"As the other reviewers here indicate, the DVD is almost unwatchable with all the scratches, discoloration, hisses and pops. To give you an idea of the quality, it was like watching an old, worn film on a very old projector - and NOT in a charming classic cinema way (if you were in elementary or middle school in the 1970s, you know just what I mean). The English translations have too many mistakes to list. What a shame. I waited many years for this to be released on DVD, only to be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful film ruined by dreadful dvd quality","review":"This is one of the greatest and most colorful films ever made - too bad that the Razor dvd issue is an embarrassment. Streaks, lines and static are present throughout the film. Dark scenes especially are horrendous. The rich colors are subdued and bleed terribly. The sub-titles are awful and the English language is butchered with grammatical errors. The VHS edition is better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"buy the ERA release","review":"I bought the ERA release from edaymovie, and it is a fantastic transfer. There are also subtitles in English, Simplifed and Traditional Chinese. I Speak Mandarin and so I can attest that the English subtitles are good (though obviously leave out the subtlety of the Chinese).I was impressed the whole way through, not only with the movie, but with the transfer of the ERA version. It is stunning, and dare I say, flawless."},{"rating":"1","title":"The film is great, the DVD transfer really does suck that bad!","review":"I, too, eagerly awaited this film to be released on DVD. Unfortunately, it has the quality of a video camera being pointed at an old, scratched copy in a movie theatre. You can literally see the edge of the screen and the misregistration of the film as it passes. It wobbles. The colors are very contrastly, just like a bad video camera. The sound is okay.The film, when seen in a theatre, is ever as haunting as some of the scenes in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but the meaning of the red lanterns, and their ominous presence, is completely lost in this version. How sad.If you can get your hand on the VHS copy, you'll be getting a better copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raise The Red Lantern","review":"I have to agree witrh the negative comments about this release.

God never deserts the characters, even when they are in dire straits and renouncing Him. However, this is simply not a strong work of fiction. The dialogue varies from mostly believable to painfully modern, and the prose is less than captivating. The general scope of the novel is good, the characters have promise, but the writing itself is simply not up to par. It's a shame that this really is one of the best representatives available of modern Christian historical fiction; the people of God should set the standard for the rest of the world, not come off as second best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Light to My Path by Lynn Austin","review":"This book has so many historical errors.

It certainly isn't one that you can read to your kids.The idea is that the fish need to go on a \\"treasure hunt\\" from one page to the next. On each page, there are \\"clues\\" that are hidden by flaps the reader lifts up. After reading all the clues, you're supposed to understand what's going on and then proceed to the next page.The problem is that there is no real direction, and some of the \\"clues\\" under the flaps don't really mean anything. Not only that, but there's no real mystery. You just look under the flaps and turn the page. The reader doesn't have any decisions to make.The worst part is at the end. The \\"treasure\\" is just a statement saying that one of the characters is going to talk about his adventures. That's it!

Having read the original Scaduto biography of Dylan in hard cover in 1973, I was delighted to find this Kindle version, which has a bonus - biographic updates into the 1980s. However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the Kindle conversion. Words with accented letters, such as cliche and deja vu, were corrupted throughout the work. And the last couple chapters of the Kindle edition - the 1980's updates - had dozens of corrupt characters per page in place of apostrophes, quotation marks, etc. What should have been a great read was full of distracting e-flaws.

The reggae version is pretty good too. I also enjoyed \\"Wishin and Hoping\\", which is just a nice song.

But MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITES are track 6 \\"I'll be Okay\\" by Amanda Marshall and track 10 \\"Always You\\" by Sophie Zelmani. They are wonderful.Actually, I am buying a second just to get a good upload of these two tracks from a new CD onto my PC Jukebox [MusicMaker]. Even my daughter of 8 yrs. replays track 10 over and over. IT'S WORTH BUYING! [TWICE EVEN]"},{"rating":"1","title":"This soundtrack SUCKS!","review":"One of the most annoying things about this soundtrack, and others, is that the songs as they were performed in the movie is not what is recorded on the CD. It was the songs as they were sung in the movie that made me want to buy the CD. I want a soundtrack that has the actors singing the songs as they did in the movie to give me that same \\"feeling\\" that the movie did. \\"I say a little prayer\\" and \\"I just don't know what to do with myself\\" were much better performed by the actors in the movie. On this soundtrack they are extremly irritating because they do not come from the movie as the word \\"soundtrack\\" implies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"I, like one of the other reviewers, listened to this once and tossed it in the trash.

You know, the song that cautions about making a pretty woman your wife. I needed the song for a PowerPoint presentation/gameshow I was doing in honor of my husband's 50th birthday/LIRR retirement party. (Yes, he did make the mistake, early in our marriage, of casually agreeing with the advice in the song! He has since learned not to voice those opinions.)I found myself pleasantly surprised by the eclectic selection of songs and have downloaded it to my Zume. It is nice to hear some of the oldies again and remember what you were doing when they were first popular. It makes for a nice nostalgia trip.

The only reaon I wanted it was because of the song \\"What The World Needs Now Is Love\\" - Jackie DeShannon, which is track #8 on this CD. After I listened to the rest of the songs I was disapointed. I'm just glad I didn't use my own hard earned money to buy it or I would feel ripped off. The few songs that I enjoyed where \\"I Say A Little Prayer\\" - The Cast Of 'My Best Friend's Wedding' track #12, \\"Wishin' And Hopin'\\" - Ani DiFranco. track #2, and \\"Tell Him\\" - The Exciters, track # 4.

Nothing else freezes except PictureIT. I have no idea what they were thinking what they designed this program, they make what is the most simplest processes in other imaging programs and turn them in to 12 steps. So bloody frustrating.

The software is written for the 5 to 10 year old intellect, so anyone serious about design, then please stay away. Consider something from Adobe - save your soul.As mentioned before, if you are running Windows 2000 then you are going to have all kind of problems.The software also installs lots of extra things you don't want like a calendar, then attempts to connect over the web to 'update' itself....

I was not able to produce a number of detail corrections that I can perform with ease in Adobe's program.

I contacted Arttoday and Microsoft to see if I could get usable pictures but to no avail.I didn't have as many problems that a lot of the other users had ( I have XP, 256RAM, Epson Printer) but I did have a lot of crashes and green boxes. So I did return the program after speaking to Microsoft online, who was very helpful by the way.

Most of this info could be found via the internet with greater accuracy, depth, variety, etc. That was about 2/3's of the book. For some some of the more important spots like Charleston, Charlotte, Atlanta, and Savannah there was little info about history, what to see and do, etc. And most of the info was old and inaccurate.

I love this little thing, I keep it in my car for when I'm on long traffic-filled drives and then take it with me into class for whenever I get bored. It's a great way to increase grip strength for seasoned weightlifters on a variety of exercises, plus it toughens up your hands and works in those calluses so you don't ever have to look like a wienie using gloves at the gym.

I agree with the previous posts. I'm assuming it's the type of rubber or the process used to make the rubber- so far, cleaning agents have not removed the smell, though I hope it subsides.All in all, worth it for a good set of workout devices, and is a good tool for someone training to strengthen for both Martial Arts & Rock Climbing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice.","review":"They seem a bit stiff.

While I expected a book about a young man faced with the challenges of his sexuality and his subsequent experiences. I was disappointed to find pages filled with over the top stereotypes and frankly bigoted representations. Instead of handling the subject matter in a respectful way, it paints stereotypes and then assigns values to those stereotypes. One would assume from the book that all male Christians with American flags are homophobic and racist bigots.

It's one that stays with you. Like Mrs. Rossi, I have a wonderful marriage. I can't imagine being as strong as she was to survive such a tragic loss. She had to be carry on for her baby boy though. Since this true story ends in 1981, & I read it in 2002, it makes me wonder if Nancy Rossi remarried (how does one find another soulmate? I'd like to think it's possible to have another great love after being widowed so young.) I hope she had more children, and wonder what her son John (who must be 23 now) is doing. That's my only complaint with non-fiction -- if you were deeply moved by the \\"characters\\", it's frustrating to not know how their lives turned out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steely Dan's Last \\"Rock\\" Album","review":"Steely Dan's \\"Royal Scam,\\" was the last album the band produced that was more of a rock format than jazz. Walter Becker and Donald Fagen were finally breaking away from record company mandates and producing the kind of music that was in their hearts. This album was probably a sort of transition album for them. Some hard driving guitar work on cuts like \\"Kid Charlmagne,\\" along with slower songs such as, the title cut, demonstrate their range. With their ever-acerbic wit, this album will satisfy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, yet rawer than any other Steely Dan","review":"What a string of perfection Steely Dan put together between 1975-77!! Three masterpieces in a row .... \\"The Royal Scam\\" gets dismissed by a lot of people as being a misstep, but I think it's all dynamite. Larry Carlton's guitar solo on \\"Kid Charlemagne\\" is worth the $... for this CD (one of the greatest in history). What I love about this CD are the drum grooves. Rick Marotta does a great job on \\"Caves of Altamira,\\" but Bernard Purdie, the greatest groove drummer ever, provides some mindblowing grooves. \\"Kid Charlemagne,\\" \\"Green Earrings,\\" \\"The Royal Scam\\" and his inventive reggae groove on \\"Haitian Divorce\\" will provide you with a lifetime of listening pleasure. I have the old CD version of this, which isn't too crisp, so I think I need to update, since the remastered version has gotten some raves."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Punkers Hate This Stuff?","review":"Yeah, their sound is \\"slick\\" and reflects \\"musicianship.\\" I guess that's enough to disqualify them from consideration by the safety pin crowd.

It's odd that a message of such intensity could be delivered with such beauty. And from the \\"jazz-rock\\" fusion kings comes Reggae in the form of Haitain Divorce.

The arrangements, unlike most of the pop/jazz fusion of the earlier albums, are more funky and more guitar-driven than the first four albums. This album also functions as kind of a bridge between the earlier efforts which had more of a rock tinge to it, to the smooth-to-perfection jazz of Aja and Gaucho (though this album has more life in it than Gaucho could ever hope to have). If you are a Dan fan, you should get this album immediately. If you are new to Steely Dan, I would start out with Aja or Pretzel Logic and then buy The Royal Scam, its a great album and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best SD album","review":"All of Steely Dan's album are fantastic. They all share cynical, cryptic and humorous lyrics - halve the time your not 100% sure what their singing about. They all share great playing. For me The Royal Scam is their best work.It has a punch in the drums and bass that other Dan albums don't. This is apparent from the intro to Kid Charlemagne. It also has wicked guitar solos, exemplified by Kid Charlemagne's played by Larry Carlton. And many of the lyrics tell dark stories about drugs, shootings, sex,more drugs, marital problems and immigration.My favourite songs are Haitain Divorce with its humorous lyrics and the sound from the distorted guitar is amazing. I also love The Caves of Altamira. It has one of the best drum tracks I have ever heard and the chorus flows perfectly. But all the songs are sublime. However to fully appreciate them you need a good stereo and you need to listen to it loud. For this is not background music \\"turn up the Eagles the neighbours are listening\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"With the exception of Gaucho, Steely Dan never released anything less than excellent.

I can still hear the entire guitar solo and fade from \\"Kid Charlemagne\\" in my head at the drop of a hat.Listen to the radio today, if you can bear to...NO ONE is out there doing anything like this; no one has and likely no one will.

However, once I get familiar with the program, I am happy with it. The manual is a bit confusing.The only worry I have is I am not sure if the control valves will fail shut when there is a low battery on the unit.

I was concerned b/c i have a dripper system which is very pressure sensitive. adding a second soaker hose would have changed my flow rates, but with the system it does 10 min of the first loop, then 10 of the next, etc. It did not leak, but you know you have to be careful to attach correctly as with any hose system plumbers tape helps.

The local hardware store tried a special order but the company can't even give a date when the additional stations will become available.If you are trying to build a 2 station system this is an expensive alternative, if you are trying to build a 4 station system you will not be able to complete the project unless you buy another base kit. This product is a bait and switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, doesn't work well","review":"Installation was very easy with the included manifold and the valves fit perfectly onto the manifold itself. I ended up buying two systems.However, the valves open only unreliably so keeping a seed bed damp in a new lawn is impossible. Offhand, five of eight valves open reliably, three of eight open only one time in three.The timespan between a valve closing and another (or the same one) opening is around 90 seconds. When the valve does not open, the reset time is similar. This equals a lot of time waiting for a valve that won't open.I've also had trouble with the displays blanking out if they get damp (not wet, just damp). This requires resetting the entire system and reprogramming time, day, and schedules.All in all, this system disappoints for its price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undurable","review":"It is a nice system and easy to put together. It is not quite durable valve to last. It sometimes stopped working or leaks the water after it shuts off by the timer.

But the concept of having one timer control 2 valves with the possibility of expanding to 4 valves appealed to me. Unfortunately one of the valves leaked and was defective. Also, the threaded hose connectors on the brass manifold come off too easily when removing a valve or a hose. The whole thing leaked badly. The DIG timer (model 9001D) is way much better in both design and quality. I installed two DIG timers on a plastic manifold from my local hardware store with no leaks whatsoever on the first try.

My children love it too and it actually keeps them quiet in the car. At home, they love to dance to it and when I played it at a recent gathering of our adult friends, everyone was dancing to it impromtu in the living room!

These days, its rare to find such great music all in one CD. These are the only artists I have heard that can combine eastern/western music so well and package it to be a joy for any listener. The melodies get you hooked immediately. From the day i bought this album it has not left my CD changer. I was laughing so hard reading the previous reviewer's comments, the reviewer was trying to talk about flamenco music calling it flamingo and then panned the album. Flamingo is a bird, flamenco is a style of guitar music. Shahin & Sepehr's music is neither a bird or flamenco, but a melange of wonderful sounds that raise the spirit every time I listen. My favorites are Echoes of Persia which i think is a masterpeice followed by No Souvenirs and the title track Nostalgia. A must have CD for world music, smooth jazz, or new age guitar afficianados!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nostalgia?","review":"Their first album, 1001 nights, was may be the best these two musicians could offer. Later as Spanish or flamingo music became popular, many other artists entered the scene who did a much better job. In their latest album, Shahin & Sepehr try to bring some Persian flavor to their music but with no success. The title Norouz (which is the Persian new year) ends up being the same old Spanish flamingo and the rest of the titles fail to justify the name of Nostalgia, because they have nothing to do with the Persian music. In their last title on this album they try hard to bring Persian melodies in, an again they fail.The question is, while making this album, were Shahin & Sepehr nostalgic about Persia or Spain? I wish I could give you an answer.Bottom line, if you are looking for Persian music, try Axiom of Choice and if you are looking for Spanish kind of music, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pointless...","review":"This book was not that great.

It's especially ironic that the track titled \\"Dolphin's Theme\\" doesn't have a single sound from a dolphin in it.I'm sure some people will like this for the music aspect, and maybe even for the ocean sounds as well... and that's fine, but do not buy this if you think you're getting dolphin sounds, because you aren't.

McBain succeeds in pulling off a couple of surprises and the characters are developed enough to be interesting, if not always believable.This novel is no longer in print but if you can find a copy of it somewhere, as long as the price is reasonable, it is worth the investment.

The plot, while borrowed at several points from other classic westerns, is straight forward and good. It is a film that you can watch and watch again.3 stars for the DVD.

It was almost as if High Plains Drifter was such a good movie that they decided to make it again with different characters.

Otherwise, it follows the classic original right down to ending with a youngster standing on the edge of town shouting \\"I love you\\" as the hero rides off (but not wounded as Ladd's character was). One parallel does not work, though. In the 1950 version, we can understand why the Jean Arthur character will be attracted to the clean-shaven, quiet-spoken, peace-preferring Shane. But why would the Carrie Snodgrass character and her nubile daughter played by Sydney Penny possibly be drawn to the scruffy, menacing Preacher, who too obviously relishes the destruction of other human beings?"},{"rating":"1","title":"anamericancallederik","review":"The Pale Rider is one of the worst westerns I have seen.

A classic western, good guys versus bad guys all the way!Let me begin by saying I'm not a Clint Eastwood fan. However with that said, I also have to say that this particular movie is the rare exception to the rule. Here Eastwood is at his best; tall, silent, deadly and remote.

He, oddly, becomes adored by the women of the town(unlike in High Plains Drifter, in which he was despised). He is actually more ghostly than in \\"Drifter,\\" being there one second, and when you turn your back for a second, dissapearing. Eastwood delivers his normal, quiet, squinting appearance. However, it seems like the bad guys have nothing better to do than look out the window all day, and the main villain walks right up to Eastwood in the final battle, as if he WANTS to be shot. You keep wanting to say \\"WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HIM?\\" Pale Rider is a fun western, and quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"PREACHER-MAN","review":"What else can be said about another great Clint Eastwood movie? He's a tough guy, on the side of justice and the down-trodden, and is good with his knuckles and a fast gun.

Buy that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"slowly going downhill.","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Christian music--I find most of it grossly derivative and formulaic. But I loved switchfoot's first album, \\"The Legend of Chin.\\" It was raw and full of energy, and the songs were very well-crafted and original. The second and third albums were ok, but not nearly as good as that one. But I didn't like \\"The Beautiful Letdown\\" at all. On my first listening, I found myself wincing as I heard the lyrics. So trite, so contrived. What happened? Some of the songs are alright, but about half of the album reminds me of why I stay away from contemporary christian music. John Foreman said that the songs on the first album were songs he wrote in his dorm for himself--they weren't necessarily meant to be consumed by the masses. That might explain the gradual watering-down of their music, as each of Switchfoot's subsequent albums have been made to appeal to an ever-expanding audience. I guess it's just hard to be original and creative and keep a record deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grrrrr","review":"Man I'm sick of all these Creed/Nickelback/3 Doors Down/Staind type bands.

Well all I can say about this one is that the only good song on the album is meant to live, which is the only reason I gave it to stars. A little to pop for me and there are no good songs. Come on people all they did was make a good song and fill the rest of the space with crap.A little to christian for me as well (keep that stuff out of rock) and thats why so many people are dedicated to this album.If your not a god freak, your not gonna like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Amazing!! This CD is really good... the 2nd best Switchfoot album of all time! The lyrics are witty and thought-provoking... the band is SOOO talented... Jon's vocals are mind blowing... production is flawless... GET IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Switchfoot has taken it to a new level.","review":"Absolutely amazing! I have always admired Jon Foreman's lyrics. They're always full of honesty and simplicity. Well, on this album Switchfoot takes it to a new level. You can tell that the band has really grown up over the years and acquired an understanding that comes with age. A theme that I find all throughout The Beautiful Letdown is the sanctity of life, the importance of living each day to the fullest. This theme is evident in songs like \\"Meant to Live\\", \\"This is Your Life\\", \\"Gone\\", and the remix of \\"Dare You to Move.\\" I thoroughly enjoyed the entire album, but I particularly liked the last number, \\"24\\". This song reminds us that if we don't cop out on our Christianity, God will change our lives and make us new.No doubt, this is one of the best albums I have heard come out of the Christian music industry in some time. I recommend it to anyone who would agree that \\"we were meant to live for something more.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate organized religion and I love switchfoot, go figure","review":"Just in case anyone is non-christian or dislikes churches or doesn't even believe there is a god, I'd still say buy this album, cause I'm in the same boat and it's really good. It isn't trying to convert anyone or preach to you it's just really good usually positive uplifting songs, and when every other song out there is either about sex or killing yourself or how sad or angry you are, this is some refreshing wonderful stuff. I dare say it's given me a better outlook on life even. It just makes you happier to be alive and realize how things aren't so bad, so check it out.And the singer has a great voice, the band's rockin, the songs all sound different from each other... it's a really good find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Switchfoot's The Beautiful Letdown","review":"Jon Foreman is one of those songwriters that has that rare ability to absolutely captivate; it's refreshing to hear music that HAS SUBSTANCE, but isn't the least bit preachy. The enitire thing is simply riveting, with high-energy songs like \\"gone\\" (<my personal favorite) and \\"ammunition,\\" and \\"meant to live,\\" but also slower songs that are also extremely beautiful, like \\"twenty-four\\" and \\"more than fine.\\" I especially enjoyed the bass parts, especially on the title track, \\"The beautiful Letdown.\\" This album has the youthful rawness that that has been characterictic of the band since their first album, Legend of Chin, yet it's obvious that they've grown and evolved; FIVE STARS, people! this album truly is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever..","review":"I've been a switchfoot fan for a long time, and they're the best band I've ever known. Their music is very inspirational, especially this CD. It has beautiful songs like \\"On Fire\\" or \\"24\\", with both beautiful messages. It also starts with a great opening using a very powerful song called \\"Meant to Live\\". It also has a great remake of a song that's been in previous CD's and in the 'Walk to Remember' Soundtrack called \\"Dare You to Move\\" The other songs are also great, so overall this CD was the best I've heard in a while. I almost guarantee you'd love the music on this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid soulful rock and roll but...","review":"be careful buying the DVD version. The video for Dare you to Move(a great song with a great message) is the original video. The one you may have seen on VH1 or MTV is \\"version 2\\". IMO version 2 is the better video. So if you like the music you have heard on the radio you will like the entire album.

I love switchfoot. these guys are great christian guys,. and have a great sound,. but i have noticed that each of their cds gets worse. Every cd gets more overproduced,. and harder to tell apart from other bands. Most of the songs on this cd sound the same, and one question.. why did they put \\"dare you to move\\" on this cd,. when it was on \\"learning to breathe\\"? that confuses me,. but oh well.

I think its sad when people trash someone's review just because they dont agree with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Let Me Down!","review":"This cd is PHENOM!

Solid guitar playing mixed with meaningful lyrics, this album was Switchfoot's greatest yet. The diversity of this album was incredible. Switchfoot can switch it up with rocking songs like \\"Meant to Live\\" and \\"Ammunition\\" then slow it down with a soft and gentle tune like \\"On Fire\\" brings out the talent they have in store for the fans in the future. An album with spiritual meaning and motivation, what more can you ask for. This is the best switchfoot album yet, so go get yours NOW!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best, and something the world needs to hear!","review":"Pop this CD in and you will be blown away. Honest lyrics, catchy tunes, and great musicianship. Tim Foreman is an amazing bass player (check out Beautiful Letdown and This is your life), Chad Butler is sweet drummer, Jerome Fontamillas adds a new flavor on keys, and Jon Foreman is a gifted songwriter. The amazon.com review does not do this album justice (ie: Jon Foreman shows song-writing potential. Give me a break!

This musical effort, although there is something called effort in this, is one of the worst musical CD's that I have heard in a long time...so why the 2 rating? Well, there are some good songs on this record, but the low rating is because I feel that this group has seriously misrepresented itself. This is not Christian by any means...in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"This album is KINDA creative at best with only 3 good songs.

Their latest album may be a little bit different from their previous three cd's, but thats only because change was necessary for them to get better considering they mastered the sound they once played. You can still tell its them underneath with songs like gone and adding to the noise... which became my instant favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"Switchfoot just keeps getting better and better with the times!

It rocks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Letdown, Though Beautiful","review":"Man, In the world of Rock, stuff is dark. From bat-eating Ozzy to the infamous Manson, rock and roll suffers from a lack of good clean music. This awesome band from california provides a \\"beautiful\\" alternative. This surf band, although Christian, is an awesome choice. Their songs \\"Meant to Live\\" and \\"DareYou to Move\\" provide a supercharged, slightly heavy style. Songs like \\"24\\" and \\"On Fire\\" are Switchfoot's quiet relflections on life. Songs like \\"Gone\\" and \\"Ammunition\\" Provide a rockin'-good time with a energetic beat and great lyrics. Lyrically, this band is solid. Their lyrics are clean, encouraging, and are catchy enough to easily get stuck in your head. Overall, this is a model band. The world of Rock needs more bands like Switchfoot, and more SHWEET albums like \\" A Beautiful Letdown.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Switchfoot - Beautiful Letdown","review":"Switchfoot's messsage on the passing of time coupled with strong musical talent makes for a compelling collection of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD ever","review":"We have had the cd for 4 months and still are not sick of it.

This is just a another great band that will go down with the other classic alternative rock groups"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen.... then listen again..... then again.....","review":"I've been a Switchfoot fan ever since \\"The Legend of Chin\\". I couldn't wait to pick up the new CD, and I finally got to last night. It's now 10:42am the day after and I can't quit listening. If you're a Christian like me, this CD will inspire you.

I fell in love with I dare you to move. I drove home ran to my computer and typed in the lyrics I remebered trying to find the band's name. I found out it was Switch foot. I ran the listenning sample from amazon and then bought the CD.. I loved the song I dare you to move. It is pretty it made me run home, boot up my computer and search for them, the last group that made me do that was Remy Zero ( Save me)When I found out that Switchfoot is Christian music it was an added plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Letdown, hardly ever.","review":"I went into a store and bought this cd for 8 bucks, no joke. I went home and popped this bad boy in, and was quiet pleased with what I heard. I didn't have a clue as to what kind of band they were, I didn't know what they sounded like. This was the first time I've boughten a cd before I heard any song off it and I liked the whole thing. Once you pop the cd in, after the first song you just want more and more. Then you can't stop listening to the cd. Its that good, go out and buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 thumbs up!","review":"I first heard Meant to Live on the radio a while ago. I liked the chorus (We were meant to live for so much more,) and I was interested in the group. I'd heard that the group prayed before every show, but I didn't really comprehend that the music was going to have a Christian message. As I listened to the cd, the meaningful, relatable lyrics hit me hard. The underlying Christian references acted as a refreshment of faith. At times, the music almost moved me to tears, namely during \\"The Beautiful Letdown.\\" But the underlying Christian theme through the album doesn't \\"ruin\\" the song for non-Christian listeners. The songs have lyrics that relate to the world, from wars, to money, to how time slips away. The catchy hooks will leave you singing these songs wherever you are. It's definitely a must-have for any true music fan, or anyone who just wants something to listen to in the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Letdown, but Beautiful","review":"From the opening cords of the first song this album is lyrically and musically brilliant. Switchfoot challenges the listener to live each day to the fullest, to make the most of each moment, and to make a different, for the future is now, \\"Are you the person that you want to be?\\", were you \\"Meant to Live\\" for something more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is an amazing album. Jon Foreman is one of the best songwriters out there, and he proves it with his achievements on Beautiful Letdown. Great from begining to end. The album starts off with Meant to Live, one of their best to date. The album takes through all of Switchfoot's talents, lyrics, grooves, and vocal harmonies. It's so good I didn't even notice the album was coming to an end until it stopped. Great rock for everyone. Everyone should have at least a little Switchfoot in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet!","review":"If you thought Switchfoot couldn't get any better, guess again. The Beautiful Letdown is here and it is so amazing. These guys continue to turn out tracks that whisper to your soul (24, On Fire, The Beautiful Ledown) and songs that rock the house (This Is Your Life, Adding To the Noise, Meant To Live)! Seriously though, I believe it is the best album I have ever heard. Period. Every song is well produced, well played, and cleverly written. Trust me, contrary to the the title, you will NOT be letdown by this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"switchfoot breaks mold of christian music.","review":"finally. a band for christians who cant stand christian music. as one who feels the level of the majority of christian music is subpar, along comes switchfoot, and they make me think otherwise. their music will make the listener think, while at the same time providing brilliantly catchy, even innovative music. the beautyu behind this album is its subtlety. it hints at a longing of a God without blatantly shoving our nose into the Word. with a headphone perusal, one can also see that the music's subtle characteristics are sure to garner some head scratching and wonder on 'how did they make that, or what is that?' for this reviewer, the track 'this is your life' is the greatest piece in this puzzle. with its electronicky anthemic sound, it draws you in, and even makes you want to - heaven forbid - raise the roof. buy this album right now. and hey, its even cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointment(but just a little)","review":"The reason I didn't really like this cd was because it wasn't under a christian lable.(Columbia) If they are christian people, why can't they be a christian band? Besides that fact, this cd is awesome. The songs speak to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh No, not again","review":"Meant To Live- Everyone's heard it. Most people love it. I'm one of them. And to know they were Christian and yet still produced something like that- i knew i had to have this CD.But unfortunately, the old adage that a Christian band can't produce good music consistently is true. Meant to Live is the only good song on here. The rest of the album consists of sappy, cliched bubble-gum pop. And SLOW, sappy, cliched bubble-gum pop. The music, the lyrics, they all suck. Not even fit for radio. Even Meant To Live gets old. I payed $8 for this album, before it went platinum and blah blah blah. So i wasn't ripped off as bad as some. And yet, $8 for one good song that i don't listen to anymore? A complete waste of time and money. Any true music fan, stay away from this album. You'll die of boredom if you try to listen to it all the way through. Maybe your grandparents will like it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown Indeed","review":"I can't wrap my mind around why this CD has been getting such good reviews! Personally, I bought it because the song Meant to Live is awesome and, silly me, I thought the rest of it would be as well. Instead- it was a letdown and believe me when I say there was nothing beautiful about it! I couldn't listen to more than thirty seconds of each song without skipping to the next because I couldn't stand it! All the good qualities from Meant to Live were severly lacking on the rest of the album. Songs like Dare You to Move just made me want to throw up with the whiny, over reaching vocals. Hopefully this will teach me a lesson about the 'buy the CD because the single is good but it turns out to be a bunch a crap' syndrome that so many of us suffer from. If you decide to buy it anyway- at least you were warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title says it all","review":"There is only one good song on this album in my opinion. That one song is Ment to Live and it's already played out. Something told me that this album wasn't going to be worth it so I donwloaded it and deleted every single file just after listening. The songs are horrible. Everyone who likes them I guess are intitled to there own opinion but I don't see the good in this album. Like one of the guys said in another review on here rock is supposed to be controversial and this is the opposit of that. A good album I think any of you should check out is Smile Empty Soul's self titled album and listen to \\"This is War\\" <-great song."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown, but not beautifully so","review":"The adage \\"Never judge a book by its cover\\" would apply to audio as \\"Never judge a CD by its first song.\\" The melodic rock piece 'Meant to Live' was decent to say the least, and promised of perhaps more experimental, less-vanilla songs on the rest of the CD. I was deeply saddened to find that the rock had all but dissipated by track 2. John Fields did the one thing a producer should never do - his mixing turned what could have been something driving and hard-hitting into a passionless piece reminiscent of Beck on a barbituate-inspired spirituality check. The vocals lack passion to the extent that the lyrics are more inspiring to read than to hear breathed through an overproduced semi-techno track. Not that I have qualms with techno, but a techno album should be a techno album, a rock album a rock album, and to cross the two is to turn licorice into bubble gum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!","review":"I got this CD for Christmas, and I can't stop listening to it. Every song on it is great, from the rock-hard and rock-solid \\"Meant to Live\\" to the moving \\"Twenty-four\\". My personal favorite is \\"Gone\\". It could top the best of Third Eye Blind. I recommend this to anyone who has ever listened to previous Switchfoot albums and to anyone looking for a solid Christian rock band. 5 out of 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge improvement from 'Learning to Breath'","review":"I felt that their previous album was a little to \\"pop\\" for my taste.

A definite chemestry exist between this band, and I look forward to anything else this band produces."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"well what else can u really expect from switchfoot. it was just a matter of time before they got signed on a major label. i was skeptical at first but no more. the only thing i can say to people reading this is, Buy this album. now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanna Be A Farmer?","review":"Switchfoot's fourth album is their most refined and powerful to date. They examine simple questions about existence, and subtley offer a reply in the latter half of the CD. Musically, it is very enjoyable to listen to. Lyrically, it offers far more than the complacency so apparent and rampant in the music industry. The ambiguity of Jon Foreman's words take some time to settle, but by the end, the listener is challenged to take action, not to be complacent. The re-release of \\"Dare You To Move\\" from their previous album \\"Learning to Breathe\\" and the soundtrack to \\"A Walk to Remember\\" only confirms the band's commitment to action instead of passiveness, activity instead of retirement. The music will grow on you, give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indeed a Letdown","review":"I also bought this based on the 1st song. The rest of the CD is NOTHING like it, and it totally lacks any inspiration or originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Song....Bad CD","review":"I bought this cd because of the first song...I saw it on MTV this morning and thought that the rest of the cd might be at least somewhat similar to the first song. I guess I was horribly wrong. The rest of the cd, aside from track #1, is like a mix of bad club beats mixed with acoustics. Very bad songs afterwards.Now dont get me wrong, the first song was tremendous. Best song I ever heard, it's all I play in my car now. Phenomenal it was. But alas, I was wanting more of what was displayed in the first song. If it was the band who wrote that song, then they should have written the whole cd themselves. But if it was someone else who wrote that song, then they should have had that guy do their cd for them.This cd to me was made for a one hit wonder type deal. I mean, I really cant see any other song off that album getting on MTV like \\"Meant to Live\\" did. All in all dont buy the cd, just burn the first song on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the purchase, but worth the ITunes tracks","review":"There's too much electronic effects in this CD. The best songs on the track are simply Meant to Live (which gets radio play on big name stations), Dare You to Move, and On Fire.The rest of the tracks seem to \\"mainstream Christian\\" in its attempt to be different by adding an electronic sound to it.If switchfoot stuck with the classic acoustic drums and ditched the cacaphony of electronic effects, the CD would be a winner.Buy the good songs for less than a dollar @ itunes.com or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"keep your jesus out of my rock!","review":"oh my god, this record is terrible... rock and roll is supposed to be intense, controversial,and socially important. rock is supposed to be a giant middle finger to the system- \\"the man\\", if you will. what we have here is the most bland, platonic, hopelessy...vanilla, there we go...band in the history of the world. does anyone remember the unstoppable juggernaut of drugs and sex that used to define this stuff? very few people pull of being whiny, and this band is NOT AMONG THEM. jesus, go buy a nirvana record if you MUST wallow in your depression, at least they were good at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it!","review":"Why would any band come out and draw attention to the fact that they are Christian rock? It is the worst marketing strategy possible. As soon as most people hear \\"Christian\\" they instanly think \\"This is gonna be lame.\\" If I wanted to be preached at, I would go to church. I am sure these guys are a big hit at those horrible Christian rock concerts that are only attended by kids whose parents won't let them buy good music.Anyhow, this CD isn't totally lame.

Quality music for those who like rock and pop-rock. Even better served if you are into the christian theme. Until you actually know they are christian, you will not hear it. \\"Meant to Live\\", \\"Beautiful Letdown\\", and \\"Dare You to Move\\" are three of their big songs on this CD. If you really listen to the words being sung, you will get an uplifting feeling, this band's entire intention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art with Meaning","review":"All art is subject to the personal likes and dislikes of each individual that encounters it, therefore, I wouldn't expect everyone to enjoy this CD as much as I do. That's OK. Nonetheless, these artist have dared to use their art as a vehicle for changing lives, something that many young artists don't think about anymore. Almost anyone can entertain, but not very many entertainers have real purpose or can inspire positive change in others. Switchfoot has done a remarkable job of producing a great album with edgy, provocative songs, and an even better job of communicating hope to this world. I'm lovin' this album and what it represents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep and Meaningful","review":"I had first heard \\"Meant to Live\\" on a music video website and I was completely blown away. Not only did it have a rythmic, melodic beat that compelled me to blow the capacity on my speakers, but the lyrics were so wonderful and really made me think. It was only until after I had actually purchased the CD that I realized that it was a Christian Contemporary. Nothing about this album is pushy or preachy, it's just plain rock infused with great sounds and good messages for anyone who actually has a brain and questions this life. I'm way impressed and hope to see another album blow away my new speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite cd!!!!","review":"When i bought switchfoots cd i only knew the songs Gone and Meant to Live.

I recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beautiful Letdown- The best Switchfoot album yet...","review":"The Beautiful Letdown shows that Switchfoot will grow to be a popular group. In their new album are ten new songs, and a repeat and better version of \\"Dare You To Move\\" from Learning to Breathe. All of these songs I can listen to over and over, and if I think I'm getting tired of them, I always find myself turning it on again. Their unique sound and beat along with the great, understandable, and inspirational lyrics make this album their best yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Switchfoot-The Beautiful Letdown","review":"I was recently introduced to Switchfoot this past summer. I am pretty open minded when it comes to music, but Christian Rock was never my thing, but hearing Switchfoot was a whole different story.

You just might be surprised by what you hear and fall hard for Switchfoot. I know i did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ChristianMusicGuru","review":"Switchfoot has come a long way from their debut album \\"The Legend of Chin\\" in 1997. With \\"The Beautiful Letdown\\", Jon, Tim, Chad, and newest member Jerome Fontamillas (formerly of Fold Zandura and Mortal) offer up an 11 track extravaganza of driving rock and catchy pop. Every single track on this disk is a gem. Jon Foreman is one of the most talented frontmen in rock as he is a former Gibson Guitar Les Paul Horizon award (awarded to the best upcoming guitarist), lead singer, and lead guitarist. This is their first major label project as they have signed on with Columbia/Red ink records and they certainly have not disappointed. Drop what you are doing right now and buy this cd now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome rock!!","review":"I wasn't much of a rock fan before I picked up this album (I still liked it but I'd choose rap over it anyday) but then I gave this CD a spin and I loved it!!! This is an awesome CD that every rock fan should own! With leading singles like \\"Meant To Live\\" (which they play often on VH1's Insomniac Music Theater :D), \\"Gone\\" and \\"Dare You To Move\\", there's no arguing about whether it's good or not. If you are a respectable rock fan, go out and buy this CD. You will NOT regret it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"impressed","review":"When I first heard this cd I found it hard to believe that this was christain rock. There is so much negative music out there right now and switchfoot is a refreshing blend of rock and positive lyrics. I can't really compare this any of the other switchfoot cds because I never heard any of them but this cd is by far the best rock cd ive heard this year. The only negative part is I don't think there is enough songs and many of them sound the same but overall it's an excellent cd. If you like bands like third eye blind and maybe goo goo dolls you will defintely like this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Discovery","review":"I first became aware of Switchfoot when my jazz teacher used \\"This Is Your Life\\" as one of our warm-up songs. I simply could not help but listen to the lyrics and to the amazing voice asking me \\"This is your life. Are you who you want to be?\\" Those are pretty extraordinary words. I purchased \\"The Beautiful Letdown\\" one week later. I have to admit I wasn't so crazy about all of the songs. I mostly listened to \\"This Is Your Life.\\" But as I listened to the CD in its entirety, it dawned on me how profound this band's lyrics were. I'm all about praising God, but some Christian artists make is easier for main stream kids to get into Christian music by giving us messages we can relate to that are BASED on God. I think it's harder to write songs that way... but that's just me. This is a great album for anyone who wants to be uplifted! I'm doing a ballet to \\"Dare You To Move\\" in April!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerfull Words with meaning behind them","review":"This is a band who puts meaning behind their songs.

I've been listening to Christian music for 11 years now, and I never had anything good to say about Switchfoot. \\"The Beautiful Letdown\\" is an awesome album, I was blown away by this album and shocked to hear how much this band had approved. I also think it's awesome when a Christian band gets big in the secualr market, it opens more doors to minister to non-Christains. If someone who thought Switchfoot sucked listen to this album, it really is awesome and a huge improvment."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Letdown","review":"Beautiful Letdown is a thoroughly enjoyable album. It contains songs that really rock and some more mellow ones.The songs contain very positive lyrics along with the great sound. One thing that is really great about this band is that they get a lot of exposure on mainstream radio stations so they spread their uplifting message to a much wider audience than equally talented bands that are confined mostly to Christian radio.If you haven't listened to Switchfoot, you will be in for a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Christian band that's made it mainstream","review":"Switchfoot's music has made it to the radio, and that shows that christian music, if it's good enough, is played on the radio.

At first I was dissapointed to find out that the rest of the CD was basically quiet, and nothing like \\"Meant to Live.\\" But I do have some taste for that type of music, and it was surprising awesome after I listened to the whole CD.

It is almost criminal that it doesn't get discussed as often as \\"A Love Supreme\\" or \\"Giant Steps\\", considering the brilliance of fellow saxophonist Eric Dolphy's arrangements and drummer Elvin Jones' intense rhythmic support, let alone Coltrane's lamenting modal improvisations throughout the various takes of \\"Africa\\".

After reading the effusive reviews, I opted to go with the Canon S800 rather than another HP. I have to assume that the people who rated this machine so highly have never used an HP. It is slower, less quality, more cantankerous and more expensive than my old HP -- and that one is three years old. There are only two areas where it lives up to advertising: the separate color cartridges and the rear paper feed for card stock. Even there, the rear paper feed is manual, one page at a time...

I was not overly impressed at first, but once I saw a print on high resolution paper, I was pretty much sold. Then two of the store employees told me that the Canon S800 would impress me, as it's prints could blow any HP, Epson or Lexmark print out of the water. The only problem was, their S800 wasn't set up to print samples. I went to another store, and their S800 couldn't do samples either.I researched it online and saw many rave reviews, which said that you couldn't tell the difference between a normal photo and one printed on the S800. Combining that with the individual ink tanks, I figured I couldn't go wrong. I got the printer yesterday, and have tried many prints on it on a variety of papers. I have yet to be impressed, I am highly disappointed though. I will be returning the S800 and purchasing an HP or Epson."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"I just set up my new S800 today and so far it's working great.

It has the best pictures and presentation. She doesn't just write out the recipes, she teaches you what a cheesecake is all about. There is a great little section on Tips that really give the reader the idea of what is happening with the cheesecake when it is in the oven and how to serve it. In addition, she helps the reader to be able to modify the recipes that she gives, and make them their own. You can alter the recipes to handle different size pans, or adding or substituting different ingredients too. I have given this book out to many people over the years. When I bought it, it was in hardback only. But since 1994, it was only in paperback. I am now very glad that they have put it out in hardback again.

The recipe temps are just too low. I have been baking cheesecake for 20 years. I thought perhaps she was on to something that would produce a better, smoother cheesecake - just not the case.

And the best part - everyone raved, and thought that they had been professionally made!! There was a small-scale war on during the reception as to which cheesecake was the best one.

Problem is it ALWAYS takes 7-10 minutes to acquire a signal. I have followed all the directions. My hand held will acquire in seconds. The magellan, once it acquires a signal, works fine. Their customer service was useless. They cut and pasted the same words from their user manual when I asked them about it. I set the location, I waited many minutes before departing, the unit had a clear view of the sky etc ... I suspect that the cost differences between this unit and the 500/700 have to do with the quality of the signal acquisition circuits. Of course I will not find out as I will go elsewhere. The GPS status screen showed multiple satalites with good signal but the unit still took minutes to lock the position.

The Magellan struggled to pick up a signal (like other reviewers, I want to point out that I live and drive in a major metropolitan area, so why is the signal so bad?) every time I used it; clouds and trees seem to knock out the signal entirely.

Anyway, after all that, the unit refused to initialize maps and would only beep obnoxiously anytime a button was pressed. 'Turn it on and go' is their slogan. Turn it on and go where? Back to the store to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product stopped working after 1 year, Magellan unresponsive--don't purchase!","review":"I loved this product when I got it as a Christmas gift, but my Roadmate 300 quit working 12 months after I received it. I called Magellen and was told that this product was \\"obsolete\\" and there wasn't any recovery software for it. They also told me that I could pay $150 for a \\"replacement.\\" What a joke. Go with a Garmin or Tom Tom instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great unit when it finally works!!!","review":"The Roadmate 300 is an awesome unit when it finnally picks up a signal. Therin lies the problem. Somtimes the unit goes 15-20 minutes without actually finding where the car is located. And I am not located in the \\"Boonies\\" either. I tried it in both Chicago and Denver with the same results. About 50% of the time it does not pick up the signal for long periods of time.

This one worked well and I was happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck getting support from INDIA","review":"I got this thing brand new and ran their software to download detail map to its 80MB of internal memory. The software asked for authorization #; which cannot be found anywhere. I then tried to download the map to my 512MB SD card (followed their authorization instruction), the RoadMate then came up and said \\"Map not found\\". Called their support people, some where in India since Magellan outsources their support, about 4 times and average waiting time is 30 minutes each. They said they need to send me an index file and it will fix my problem. I waited the whole day and did not get any file. The index got to me a day later, I followed their instruction, and the RoadMate 300 finally came up. Tried it out and it ran much slower than the RoadMate 500."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good device with outdated map","review":"This is a good GPS system overall. It functions well for the basic travel guide with the very reasonable price.THe problem for this unit is that the map is outdated. It is strange that it has the streets around our community which is about 2-year-old, but it does not have my street which is 7-year-old.In general, in a established city (such as Houston inner city), it is good enough, but in the rapid-developing area (such as Houston suburb), the map might be too old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Get A Garmin","review":"The device, when it works, is fairly impressive. The problem is when the unit doesn't work, the support is nearly nonexistent. My Magellan Roadmate 300 NA was a Christmas gift from my wife. Fresh out of the box one of the Navigation Keys did not work. After more than a month with numerous not very helpful exchanges with their support services department, I finally received authorization to send the unit to Fort Worth Texas. After an additional two weeks, including some time where they were asking me for shipping and tracking information after I had already received delivery confirmation from the shipping service, The unit was returned to me with the original defect repaired but now with another key inoperative! They now will not answer my support requests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Service should keep you away from all Magellan products","review":"Stay away from Magellan all together. Bought the RoadMate 300 last Black Friday (Nov. 24, 2006). Pretty good unit for the price, had intermittent problems connecting to the satellite. Finally went. Called Magellan in August 2007, received a Return Authorization. They supposedly have a 14 day return policy. Well it is now almost November again and after numerous calls to Magellan still no GPS. They use outsourced phone representatives, so you can not be assured that they actually understand what you are saying and I have had a very hard time understanding them most times. After numerous promises that the replacement GPS is on the way and refusal to provide a tracking number as of today I got off the phone with them and started filing complaints with the BBB and the attorney general. Pay more and stay away from Magellan. They don't care about you once they have your $$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BOOK, not the Movie/DVD !!!!","review":"I'm not sure how so many reviewers managed to mix up the two . . . anyway, the nature and tone of the book are vastly different (and in my mind, much more entertaining) than that of the movie. Winston Groom's \\"Gump\\" is filled with side-splitting ironic humor, as well as an healthy skepticism of the various powers that be that the protagonist encounters. My guess is that people who saw the movie first will be disappointed by the lack of sentimentality in the book - but if you are one of the handfull of people remaining on the planet who have not seen the movie, PLEASE read the book first - it's hilarious and life-affirming, without falling into the maudlin trappings that (at least in my mind) diminished the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree on Austin!","review":"This book is absolutely rubbish! This is the first book which the film version is far better than the original book! The story is so unconvincing, especially going to space and landing on a wild forest. I enjoyed the first 50 pages or so, but the story repeats and repeats itself again. I'm Korean and English is not my mothertongue. Still, I read many of the books in a day or two because I just couldn't put it down. Well... This book took me a few hours to read the first 100 pages or so, and WEEKS to finish the rest! And I wish I never read the rest... Rubbish! Go get the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Direct Change","review":"''Forrest Gump'', the movie, was magical, funny, touching, and great. The novel was a piece of trash. The character in the book was a brute who had a fascination with the s-word. Throw the book in the fireplace. See the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened to the beauty of literature?","review":"What was Larry King thinking when he said it was the funniest novel he ever read? I read it about a year ago and thought it a faith tester to get through the whole thing! This novel has no literary quality, no message(except maybe that idiot people don't have to live a hum-drum life)and stands as an isult to the world of literature. The story is about Forrest Gump, an idiot-savant who goes on to become fame and fourtune overnight. I think Winston Groom is adicted to swearing, displayed well in this book. It didn't teach me anything, and the only reaction after finishing it was to throw it away. I could have written a better novel, and I'm only thirteen! (Sorry if I offended anyone out there who enjoyed the book, after all, you are entiled to your opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumber 'n a box o' rocks","review":"I'm truly amazed that anyone read this book and saw movie potential in it. (The movie's pretty good) The story line is absurd, the narrative is annoying, the main character isn't the least bit believable, and the whole section on him becoming an astronaut - not only unbelievable, but brutally racist in a way that made me almost physically ill.I kept reading in hopes that was a brief tangent into the absurd, but the book just kept getting worse. Like another reviewer here, I'm a person who generally finishes a book once begun, and now wish I hadn't. I completely wasted 3 hours of my time. Please don't waste yours on this horrid book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio Performance by Mark Hammer is Hilarious","review":"I read this book once before, at its release in 1986, when it was just a low-profile \\"quirky\\" book. The subsequent smash-hit \\"warm and fuzzy\\" movie version superceded my recollections of it. Now over ten years later I re-visited \\"Gump\\" via Mark Hammer's audio rendition and found it as rich and satisfying as authentic, down-home southern cooking -- not the bland version some try to foist off as southern food. For the most part Groom succeeds at being weird and wonderful, but the \\"do you want to buy a watch?\\" scene, and Forrest's movie screen test fell very flat, and the ending, while avoiding predictability, didn't resonate for me. But I laughed (hard) aloud several times at Hammer's narrative, so all's forgiven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forest Gump","review":"This was a book about a movie.I think that you should read the book and see the movie, because the book goes into the same details as the movie but you the reader can picture the story the way you want. Forset Gump is a storie about a man telling his life story.He talks about the girl thyat he is in love with Jenny.He also talks about when he was in the war where he met Bubba,and Lutent Dan. He also talks about his mother. He is what you could call a \\"mamas boy\\". He love to talk about his mother to others. I recommend that people read this book. It is a good book and it is fun to read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forrest Gump","review":"I read the book after I saw the movie, still the book outperforms the movie undoubtedly. The book could really take you to somewhere you'd never imagined, through the eyes of Forrest Gump, everything is possible. It was hysterical, cynical, well-written and an ultimate satire of American history, a must-read book that you have to keep in your collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"I thought Forrest Gump was one of the best movies I had ever seen, so I came to read the book with high expectations. I was in for a surprise, however, but a really enjoyable surprise it was. The surprise was that the movie had very very little to do with the book (even less than you would usually expect) but the book had its own smorgasbord of utterly unbelievable events and comedy. The undercurrent is pretty much the same as the movie; Forrest is not as stupid as we would like to think. The ending was quite tame for such a rollicking story, however. Anyway if you're in need of something funny, pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like sludge from the bottom of the Mississippi","review":"Could this book be any worse? To think that Robert Zemeckis fashioned such a wonderful movie out of this dreadful sludge is a true testament to his filmmaking ability. This novel feels like it would never end and it stretches credibility to the upmost (a monkey and a retard in space? a veteran throwing away his medals? ... gimme a friggin' break). Do yourself a favor, don't buy this drivel ... rent the movie instead. Too bad Amazon doesn't let you choose \\"zero stars\\" because that is what this drivel deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this a long time ago, but remember my feelings well","review":"This remains the only book I have ever read that is worse than the movie. The adventures were less believable (albeit, his life in the movie is pretty out there too!) and the book, surprisingly, doesn't allow the reader to love Forrest as much as the movie does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the book OR the movie","review":"I thought Gump the movie was 3 hours of mindless schmaltz, but after reading the book I can understand why Zemeckis didn't stay true to Groom's novel. Book Gump just isn't likable at all. Instead of an oafish, lovable doofus who spouts memorable catchphrases we have a pot-smoking, even dimmer doofus whose adventures are even more ludicrous than those shown in the film (the one with Raquel Welch was just too much).Jenny comes off even worse in the book, if that's possible, and Forrest's narration gets irritating after a while. People either love the movie and hate the book or vice-versa, but I just didn't like either of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't but this book -- get the movie instead.","review":"This is the only time I have ever believed a movie to be better than the book on which it was based. Groom's Forrest Gump is a big redneck with a foul mouth -- not the endearing, lovable character Tom Hanks played. I remember when the movie Forrest Gump came out, and I heard that Winston Groom was suing because he never got all the money he was promised. If he got five dollars, it was more than he deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"a month later and still no product!","review":"I ordered this book over a month ago and STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT!

It's boring indeed. But as I watched the movie before, then I just pay more patience on it... after then I just addicted to it !! I like the way he loved Jenny Curran... and he showed a different but simple view from AN idiot. Life is simple, isn't it ?! He brought us back to the nature again... far away from this complicated society -- at least for a while. Personally I don't think he's AN idiot, he's always trying to do the right thing. \\"U know what I mean ?!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to get started, but rewarding in the end","review":"This book is written from the point of view of an idiot savant, a person of limited intelligence who is yet extremely smart in specific areas. To capture this point of view, the author writes in a semi-literate first person. Here is a sample sentence. \\"My daddy, he got kilt just after I's born, so I never known him.\\" A whole novel in this format is difficult to read. Yet once the reader adjusts to the style, the story is a very touching one of true values.

The Jack Black website suggests that you only use one swipe per underarm, and boy are they right. Using more may cause slight irritation and also leave a visible white residue. So don't do that. It would be like gargling a gallon of mouthwash every morning - it will work but it will be uncomfortable and is totally unnecessary anyway.But your average drugstore brands are also pretty effective, and also considerably cheaper, so why buy this one? Primarily a) so you don't smell like a drugstore brand and b) so you don't smell like much of anything, because this deodorant doesn't have a strong scent. Those things are worth a couple extra bucks to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad residue","review":"i'm a big fan of Jack Black products, but this deodorant is a disappointment. it leaves a residue that doesn't wash off well, even with the company's own body wash. it protects for a lot longer than normal deodorants, but it almost isn't worth it when trying to be rid of it in the shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed","review":"I've had this product for around 5 months now and have had all of the problems described in other reviews.

This spreader replaced a Scott's Speedy Green that broke while I was using it. At least that lasted a few years but eventually a plastic piece that controls the discharge opening broke.

Although it does miss it's mark on some occaisions, and some of the jokes seem to be regurgitated from other films, it is a funny movie with redeeming qualities.For a true Python fan, you will enjoy it. For someone new to Python, it will be touch and go.This copy/edition has NO special features. Just so you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this dvd Dan.","review":"Do you like Monty Python? Cheech and Chong? Marty Feldman? Mel Brooks movies? Well mix that all together with a bit of Peter Cook and Peter Boyle, and you have Yellowbeard! You get Eric Idle, John Cleese, and Graham Chapman from Monty Python. Cheech and Chong from (need I say where). Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn and Peter Boyle from Young Frankenstien. Even David Bowie makes an appearance. There is also a whole cast of others who make this movie one of my favorites. So stagger stagger stagger crawl crawl your way the check out and buy this dvd. It has been a very long wait. Now it is finally here! I only wish I could give this more than 5 stars because it deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates of the Caribbean as Told by Monty Python!","review":"Finally! This is a true classic of the British humor genre and should appeal to fans of all ages. Risque at times, and bitingly funny throughout!Graham Chapman, John Cleese and Eric Idle carry the Monty Python banner well and fans of \\"The Young Ones\\" will readily recognize Nigel Planer as Commander Clement's somewhat bumbling first officer. Peter Boyle (Everybody Loves Raymond) plays Yellowbeard's mutinous former first mate. And Cheech and Chong add an hilariously diverse element with their recurring roles.David Bowie, who happened to be vacationing on a nearby beach during filming, makes an humorous cameo. But, sadly, it was to be Marty Feldman's final film as he died during filming.Great comedy with not a serious moment from start to finish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be getting old","review":"This wasn't as funny as I remember it back in the day.

I was very happy to see it come out on DVD. The image quality is very good and the sound (mono) is good too. I have the tape but now watch the DVD exclusively.

The reviews that I read were all positive. We watched about a half an hour of this snooze fest, before turning it off. To say that we were disappointed would have to be an understatement. The plot was slow. The jokes, if you can call them that, were not funny, at all. Dreadful. I am giving it two stars only because of the remarkable cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT RULES","review":"Although many critics say this was a bad movie,This was one of the greatest movies I have seen and own.

Meanwhile we are entertained by an all-star cast. Madeline Kahn is a delight to watch. Martin Hewitt (Endless Love [1981]) has the role as the son of Yellowbeard who has a treasure chest map tattoed on his head.

But if all those folks who hail this cinematic shmatta as a classic are happy in Fantasyland, who am I to argue with them? Why, you may wonder, do I bestow as many as 2 stars on this thing?

Only the Holy Grail would rank higher on my scale. The film also has the added bonus of featuring a young and compelling Stacey Nelkin. Hard to imagine why she did not become Mrs. Woody Allen instead of Sun Li. (Apologies on the spelling)Like most Python Works, it is edgy and may offend those of the political or religious right or left but then, most of the time, you cannot avoid offending those people anyway.See it for a hearty laugh, me maties!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Python Movie EVER!","review":"This is by far the best Monty Python movie EVER!

Anyway, the rest of the story is about the escapades of him making his way to his buried treasure.Should leave you rolling on the floor if you like Python or Mel Brooks style.\\"Must ave been that shark what jogged my memory\\" \\"Mister Moon!\\" \\"Must ave been more of a tif\\" \\"Pa-lague?\\" \\"Cabin Boy Smith\\" \\"She's the brains of the outfit\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"So good, it ought to be on DVD","review":"When I first stumbled upon this movie, I thought it might be a decent way to kill an hour or so. I was right, but the movie was so much more than I expected. Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Peter Boyle, Cheech (Marin) and (Tommy) Chong, Madeline Kahn, and (last but not least) Marty Feldman-none of them would let you enjoy a quiet moment. I know that this movie will not be for everyone, but if you enjoy things like Monty Python productions or Eric the Viking, it is a safe bet that you will enjoy this film.Vive la DVDwe need the DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Shame To be Only on VHS","review":"Yellowbeard is a fantastic film that shows off the best of Monty Python, Cheech & Chong, and some of the usual cast members from Mel Brooks films.

And the extra price for the useless remote control is silly. Come on, who seriously uses a remote control when you can just reach up & push the buttons or turn a knob, especially while you're trying to drive safely. Quality of the sound however is quite good, but then again most radidios in this price range are worthy of quality speakers, such as the SR60's from BA that are in my car. This radidio really, really needs a SD memory card slot.

This is hard, as Sarah is repeatedly been accused to have encouraged her assaultants and is been considered to be a bad witness because of her intoxicated condition during the crime and her previous police record involving drugs charges.The story is familiar, predictable and lacks in the field of credibility. It manages to somewhat avoid sentimentality, though, even if some of it's still aparent.The acting performances are good and Jonathan Kaplan's directing is well paced and talented.All these aspects turn an otherewise horrible picture into a watchable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Jodie Foster very much!","review":"I'm from Holland and only 14 years old so I'm not very good in english but I'll try: I love this movie it's very good played especially Jodie is good!

This means that this movie could have been a four and easily a three, had it not comitted some cardinal errors. First of all, the story is too convoluted. There are simply too many 'what ifs', too many 'is this real, or a dream?'. Secondly, this movie is too long. This movie, like so many others, were it cut and edited into half, would be twice as good. Otherwise, the performance by Tom is stellar and the story had some meaning. Although, one really has to wonder what it all really means. The idea of a physically perfect Tom Cruise being suddenly mutilated in a car accident is a great one for a movie. What happens when someone who has it all, suddenly loses what made him so alluring in the first place? A beautifully shot movie which would have been much better served by a script editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for the reviewer who didn't do the right research....","review":"Um, I don't even own this CD, haven't even heard it, but just wanted to let Alex know that Nancy Wilson isn't Brian Wilson's daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's that song!

However, I was disappointed that the soundtrack left off \\"Good Vibrations.\\" It's not like I couldn't buy a Beach Boys CD that includes it. But personally, when listening to a soundtrack...if the movie's done well and has a fitting soundtrack...I like to be reminded of the emotions and ideas that the songs played on in the context of the film. The three songs that hit me the most and were absolutely perfect in the film's context were \\"Ev'ythng In It's Right Place,\\" \\"Sweetness Follows,\\" and \\"Good Vibrations.\\" Those three songs will always have a different meaning to me since I've seen the film. It's a shame they couldn't work it out so that all three were on the soundtrack. I'm assuming it was a contractual thing with the Beach Boys. Oh well, still a worthwhile purchase.

Cameron Crowe, who once wrote for Rolling Stones magazine, and Nancy Wilson did an amazing job. Nancy's song \\"Elevator Beat\\" is so phenomanal i cant stop listening to it.

As far as the Vanilla Sky Soundtrack goes it has some good songs on it, but it contains less than half of the songs in the movie.I suggest that you listen to clips of all the songs on this album and make sure that the songs you want and like from the movie are on it BEFORE you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie, Amazing Soundtrack","review":"....What else do you expect from Cameron Crowe?

The amazing graphical detail is completly stunning and I love it.From Barry Helmsley (WWF Superstar)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!! But where's the manual?","review":"Just got FS2k2 for Christmas and overall it has been great. The graphics are excellent and I have already logged many hours trying out the various aircraft. My only real complaint is the lack of a proper printed manual. I don't know about everyone else, but I really hate having to read a manual on a computer, especially when you just need to look up something quickly while in the middle of game play. As a result, I spent half a day printing the manual and putting in a 3 ring binder.I have also had some minor gameplay issues and choppiness that I have not yet been able to tweak out. I am running it in a brand new Dell 1.6 ghz system with a Hercules 3D Prophet 4500 64mg AGP card and 256mg of RAM. It seems like this would be more than enough machine, but nothing I do seems to eliminate the occasional choppiness.Overall, an excellent game that would be even better with a real manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the upgrade","review":"This version of FS (Flight Simulator) has the look and feel of Combat FS 2, with Civilian aircraft (you do get a corsair). I could go on about all the great features about FS 2002, but if your a fan of Microsoft's flight simulators you'll end up buying this one too, and it is worth it. I really enjoy the computer generated air traffic and the air traffic control. In short if you want as realistic of a flight simulator as you can get on a home PC, this is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is unstable!","review":"Just received Flight Simulator 2002 for Xmas and having a real problem using it. Seems that I get continual \\"freezes\\" or pauses every few seconds while trying to fly any of the aircraft in the program. This is not only annoying but almost unusable, since it's is hard to make fine adjustments during flight (especially trying to hover the bell helicopter).I would, however, appreciate any help, tips, or suggestionsthat could possibly cure this problem.

The game causes PC to freeze constantly. Can t use the game / am depending on Microsoft's tech support to get the game functioning.(?)However the main issue, after all the enthusiastic previews, I expected much more. Apart from the new ACT communication features, nothing really new in comparison to FS 2000. Still one and the same generic engine sound for the B737/777 and the 747 - sounds like a vacuum cleaner / not like a jet engine! Exactly the same engine noise as heard on FS2000.I have a Computer with Pentium III / 450 Mhz Processor and 128 MB Ram, that s by far not enough power to run a software like this and they should make this clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks excelent","review":"This game looks so class, real ATC, weather generation, flight planner and loads more!

The best part of it was finaly the WX was very realistic. I put the WX to THSA with with heavy precip. When I did a side view, it looked very real, I thought I was in the BE-99 that I fly in real life. Shooting an app down to mins was like the real thing. I was truly impressed. I found that the airport listing was much better than before& when you wanted to find an airport, you could just use the airport idenifier ie. KBUR KLAX ect. and it took you there. The hold short and taxi lines were a big pluss. The ATC was ok, But I am andvit VATSIM user. I tryed to load up Squawk Box, and it just did not like it at all.I hope it will work when it if finally released.The bad thing was, I did not see ant improvement of the frame rates in flight.

No more blue screens or crashes, just beautiful bug-free play.FS2002 is by far the best sim I've ever played, and it's programming is far more efficient, as it can keep a good framerate on a decent machine (Celeron 800) with the graphics turned way up! Thousands of trees and small buildings, very detailed terrain elevations, airports that actually look like airports and function like airports, the ability to download real-time Jeppesen World weather with a winds-aloft feature, the sun reflecting off the water, real-time ATC which works very convincingly and good all-round dynamic scenery AI.I would recommend this to any flight sim enthusiast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Let's face it.

I expect they will fix this in a hurry though by the next version.The Frame Rate has increased with the new version, which is a delightful surprise. The scenery appears pretty much the same with the exception of randomly appearing and disappearing buildings.The packaging is .... All I got was a box, pamphlet, program, and CD envelope (not even a jewel case). The Quality is no longer there as with previous Microsoft products. If you have (or ever) purchased Microsoft Train Simulator, you'll know what I mean.If you do not own a Microsoft Flight Simulator, I recommend buying it.

The ATC function helped me understand some of the phraseology, and the real weather option set the mood. Although I fly a Cherokee 140, I found the other aircraft fun and easy use when the performance data is understood.Want to practice emergencies? This program has it. IFR isn't for those just wanting to fly in pretty weather, so practice losing pitot/static system, lost communications or even an engine failure.Play, practice, have fun! Don't take it too seriously.

The Government should not decide what you can and cannot do with your person or property!

His analysis is withering and remorseless (and largely unanswerable) and the arrangement is appealingly easy to follow.

It's a shame that \\"51 phantom\\" and \\"shake hands\\" don't adequately capture that live magic, but what album ever does? I think I kind of like the Allstars better that way --- GOOD albums --- AWESOME live band. So I will continue to buy their albums. But I tell you this --- BUY their albums. But do yourself a favor and SEE THEM LIVE BEFORE THEY GET TOO BIG!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 2nd album","review":"51 Phantom is a competent followup to Shake Hands. While they won't win any songwriting awards, they write songs that play to their strengths and sound honest and fresh.

I would think that any fan of their first album would be happy with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy hooks, slick production","review":"I bought this CD after hearing \\"Lord Have Mercy\\" on the radio. It is difficult to classify this band, as it plays a truly original mix of blues, southern rock, gospel, and almost grunge (\\"Mud\\"). The melodies are catchy and the production values are good. Getting a power trio mixed properly can be a challenge. Family relationships (drummer and guitarist are brothers, their dad is the producer) make this interesting listening for musical families. I have to give at least four stars to any CD that occupies a slot in my magazine for more than a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"I cannot believe nobody has reviewed this. This is a quality rock and roll and blues album. Kind of gospel-tinged good-time blues, some soul like psychedelia.

And check them out live if they come your way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less 80s, more blues","review":"Their first album, Shake Hands with Shorty, was badass. This time around, they got away from the rockified blues (and R.L. Burnside) and went more mainstream rock and roll. The only problem for me is that the rock and roll sounds way to 80s glam rock. Example: the laser-beam sound in the background one of the tracks. That's 80s, not blues, and way too cheesey.Recommendation: buy their first album, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mighty slim","review":"I was surprised to see how small this book was - I should have read the fine print!

The book fills the bill adequately, but the problem is that it handles the issues very superficially. The book addresses about all the important issues, but it does not give them the proper treatment.On the other hand, because the book is very thin and fast to read, it more probable that a prospective gun owner has the patience to read through it, and it certainly is better to have read this book than having read no book at all. But the problem is that some persons (who are not into reading, anyway) may think that they have read \\"a book about shooting guns\\", and think that they don't need to study the subject any more. One has to wish that reading this book gives a beginner an stimulus to study the subject further."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for all pistol shooters","review":"I strongly recommend this book for both beginner and veteran pistol shooters.

More sparks between Stephanie and Ranger, the heat between those two could set the pages on fire, but Joe is steadily becoming a better influence over Stephanie and we hope it stays that way.

It just doesn't get stale, thank god. This time, ol' Stephanie is trying to find a guy named Singh who skipped when his visa expired. Then there's a murder, then more, and threats of still more - directed to Steph herself. Hilarious slapstick set pieces, something Evanovich excels at, are interspersed with real knuckle-biters.

All the while she is trying to catch the killer, she finds herself marked as the next victim, and she has to look over her shoulder with every step she takes. The criminal plot in this book is not the strongest yet, but the ususal characters surrounding Stephanie more than make up for a weak plot. As usual, Stephanie moves in, temporarily, with her sexy boyfriend and cop, Joe Morelli, while the mysterious Ranger moves around on the fringes of her life as well. There are many funny scenes in this book, and it was a very good read. It can be read without knowing the other 8 previous books, but they are definitely also worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"To The Nines","review":"This is the funniest thing I've read in a long time.

As indicated by the title of my review, the bulk of the book is filler, mostly about the numerous members of the narrator's cute and irrelevant family, a tremendous amount about one of her coworker's eating habits, and much about her sexual attractions. Once the facts in the case finally become clear, any mystery reader will identify the culprit immediately (though the protagonist and the multitude of investigators involved in the case will remain mystified for another fifty pages); more experienced readers will spot him in the first fifty pages. Unless you just love any book about Stephanie Plum, save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the Nines was written for a fifth grader","review":"This book was written in the language of a fifth grader. I felt like I was reading about Jack and Jill. Besides being utterly annoyed with the simplistic story-telling, I found the plot slow and silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"blah, blah, blah. you can read this book in an hour, that's because it took janet evanovich an hour to write this uninspired waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"To The Nines","review":"Too funny for words. Stephanie is up to her usual antics and doesn't let up. Fun read as always. Janet never lets me down."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the Nines","review":"Great book to read at the beach. Funny & witty storyline will keep you wondering what predicament the characters are going to get into next. A fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud","review":"All of Janet's book keep me coming back for more. Love to read but especially when story has mystery, romance and most of all makes me laugh out loud. I am now on number 11 and already has sparked my interest. Thanks and keep them coming!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's made a come back","review":"I loved books 1 through 5. 6, 7, and 8 were steadily going downhill. Thank goodness, this one gets back to the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to GO!!!!!!","review":"After being disappointed by Sugar Plums and kind of amblivant about Hard Eight I was hesitant to spend the money to buy the hard back copy of To The Nines but Janet Evanovich delivers in this book!! I found myself laughing outloud so many times! And with two awesome guys like Ranger and Joe I'd flipflop between them too!! One chapter I'm all for Stephanie and Joe and the next chapter I'm for Ranger and Stephanie! How long do I have to wait for #10?? If I had to say one thing negative about this book is that now that I've read To The Nines it's going to be forever until #10 comes out..... Janet ....write faster!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on Track","review":"I was really disappointed with the last two books of the series, but this one was much better.No cars blowing up, no peeking in coffins, no food falling out of Dad's mouth. The culprit was pretty obvious, and I thought the search for Singh ended a bit too early, but all around, this was much more enjoyable than the series has been lately, and I'll look forward to 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"a worthy fix for Stephanie Plum addicts...","review":"Janet Evanovich cranks out yet another installment of her very successful Stephanie Plum (\\"bounty hunter chick from Jersey\\") series with 'To The Nines'. For those who fear the series has run out of steam and has become, gasp!, boring ... relax. Evanovich continues her comic writing ways and gives the reader what he/she is looking for: laughs and escapism.But what about the story? It is the usual Stephanie Plum nonsense. Murder and mayhem in Trenton. This time Evanovich becomes a bit more topical by throwing in internet stuff (yes, Stephanie Plum surfs the net), and her full-sized ex-prostitute sidekick Lola goes on the Atkins diet. And Evanovich throws in a trip to Vegas for good measure. However some of the enjoyable yet tiresome routines (Grandma's visits to funeral parlors, Stephanie's cars getting blown up) are thankfully absent.Bottom line: not a memorable installment but certainly an enjoyable Stephanie Plum experience. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"This book isn't bad; it's very bad. I've read the previous eight volumes in the Stephanie Plum series and enjoyed them tremendously. This edition, however, lacks the intelligence, humor,and sexiness of the prior volumes. Dialogue is forced and flat. Situations such as the airport check-in are ludicrous rather than funny. Worse still, many of the recurring characters act strangely \\"out of character\\"--e.g. mysterious Ranger turns chatty; large, confident Lulu diets to impress a man. The attractive elements of many of the characters' personalities have simply disappeared. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Janet.","review":"Janet Evanovich is right on track with To The Nines. Received the book yesterday and finished it already. I was laughing out loud through the whole book. I like that the book focused more on Stephanie's personal life than her job, it was a nice change. Joe and Ranger are as hot as ever, thank you Janet. Looking foward to the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone Re-hash","review":"The gags are becoming more overused and the plots less engaging as we read more and more and more and more. Stephanie needs to learn some new wisecracks and her characters need some new idiosyncrasies if she is to survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT BOOK!!! IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLUM MYSTERIES","review":"I loved it!!! The book is just wonderful!! It is a load of laughs. I could not stop laughing at some parts. Lula is soooo funny!! I liked the fact that story moved out of the Burg and to Las Vegas for a minute. The Vegas part was very interesting. Of course, you still have the love triangle between Stephanie, Joe, and Ranger. The plot thickens with those three. I can't wait to see how the author is going to play it out. Stephanie's sister is in this book also. She is a total trip. I could not put the book down. I finished it today. It only took me a week to finish it!!! The beginning was pretty interesting. She kept you in suspense trying to figure out who was the killer. The ending was great! I just loved it!! I can't wait for #10!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Goodie","review":"Her 9th book in the Stephanie Plum, hilarious bounty hunter series, is almost as fresh as her first. This one has Stephanie involved in a sicko's killing game, with Stephanie as the prize. Whoever is the last man standing gets to kill her.The writing is fresh and funny. The action and suspense are page-turning. At times, tho, Stephanie seems too lax in her safety, oftentimes trying to fire her bodyguards. More sexual tension between Morelli and Ranger makes it all the better. And bless her heart, Ms. Evanovich kept Albert Kloughn (\\"Clown\\") around for this book too. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie's Back","review":"After the disappointing Hard Eight and Visions of Sugar Plums, I'm glad to not only see Stephanie back, but no cars were demolished (getting old), she seems to be getting better at the apprehension aspect (about time) and she's finally learning to take care of herself. I also liked her relationships with Joe and Ranger much better in To the Nines -- I didn't think they treated her very well in Hard Eight. There are a lot of great moments in this newest outing, but I think one of my favorites is when Lulu(?) thinks she's growing fangs from eating so much meat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still funny, but getting tiring","review":"I enjoy her writing because I find her novels to be very funny. However, I'm really getting tired of the same old thing. Same characters with the same issues. How long does a running joke have to last? How many ways can you crack on Vinnie's sexual 'preferences'? How many ways can you blow up a car? How many times do you have to be in danger before you take the gun out of the cookie jar? The formula is good, but it's getting old."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Time Evanovich Reader","review":"I had to really keep pushing myself to keep reading. Stephanie is interesting, the characters in the book are kind of interesting. Lula is a bit overplayed, and kinda stereotypical. She only gets away with it, because many of the characters in the book are sterotypes.As far as this being a mystery, well that is where it fails. I figured otu what was going on pretty early. Just way too obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"this was my introduction to the fabulous author, janet evanovich. i had a hard time putting this book down. if i didn't have a baby at home, i would have read it in one day. i love janet's style of writing, very captivating. i am now buying all of the other stephanie plum novels. you won't be disappointed. keep up the great work, janet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close, but no cigar","review":"This is a great series and this is a good book but, it's just not up to the standard I've come to expect from Evanovich. It was too short and under developed. Also, the ending was not very climactic. This felt like Visions of Sugar Plums part II. I would recommend it mainly because the characters are so funny they can carry a less than stellar story."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAND","review":"I just didn't feel the energy in this book that I have in most of the other \\"Plum\\" series books. I had the honor of meeting Ms. Evanovich and she says she has a lot more to come. I am a big fan of this series but this book was preditable with every page I turned. Sorry.... I know this is not a popular response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Yet","review":"This book was by no means JE's best effort. It was obvious from the start who did it. The story lines plodded by and few parts were very funny at all. No suspense and few laughs made for a relatively dull book. At least it was all over quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"For morons only","review":"Had to put this down after a few pages. She's popular which doesn't say much for the intelligence of her average readers or our education system. Just awful obvious writing, stupid schoolgirl humor, sexist in so many ways, repeated gags, boring boring boring, from her ratings, don't people read decent writing anymore & have any critical faculties left. The idiotic name Stephanie Plum gives away the sheer silliness & desperate reaching for effect on every page. Readers... there are terrific crime writers out there both men and women, Evanovitch isn't one of them, nor is she funny unless you're 14 years old mentally. I had to give it 1 star to get on, it's worth no stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"to the nines","review":"I always buy from Amazon.com because I can count on them to , ship what I want, and in a short period of time.have what I want"},{"rating":"1","title":"jumped the shark","review":"i really enjoyed the first eight books, but for me this one sent the series sailing over the fin. i couldn't even finish it. even though i enjoy the books' characters, i particularly can't stand joe morelli, and his prominence in this one really set my teeth on edge. it's a shame, because no one's made me laugh out loud like janet evanovich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Stephanie Plum","review":"I love all the books in the Stephanie Plum series. All of the characters are well developed and I've laughed out loud quite a few times reading this 9th novel in the series. The only reason I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars is that I'd figured out who the bad person was when there was about a quarter of the novel left and I couldn't figure out how Stephanie never did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet's the best for mystery humour","review":"I have read most of Janet Evanovich's books and if it's humour as well as mystery you're looking for, get her books! Each new one you read keeps you up-dated on where Stephanie stands not only with her family, but also with her up and down love-life that parallels her humourous but hectic bounty hunter episodes, each more entangled than the next. There is no swearing in Janet's books, but the sex innuendoes keep you laughing all the way. You may want to be broad-minded, but hey, Stephanie Plum's just a New Joisey girl at heart and you can't help but be with her all the way. Not everyone will get off on her books, but I think they're great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please keep them coming","review":"As with all of Janet Evanovich's books, you are torn between reading as fast as you can to find out what happens and reading very slowly to make it last. This was a lot of fun, but a little too short, and it didn't include enough Grandma humor. Still, I can hardly wait for the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun; great reader","review":"The woman who read the CD unabridged version of this book was spectacular. She did all the voices just the way they should sound, although I never considered what that might be when I read on paper the other eight books.The plot is minimal, the dopey events max. But Lula is still great and I liked Stephanie even more when she was \\"telling\\" me the story outloud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny and addicting!!","review":"I LOVE all the Stephanie Plum novels. They have wonderful, funny, lovable and sexy characters. I have read all 9 of her novels from this series twice. I can't wait for #10 in June to come out. I have to say it's the best book I EVER read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamest of the Series","review":"The Stephanie Plum series gets tired in this latest book - the killer is obvious about mid-stream, and the romance with the cop and the other bounty hunter are warmed-over, same-old, same-old. The cast of characters was charming and funny for the first couple of books, but there's nothing new here. And there's none of the true gripping suspense I found in the first book, with the truly scary psycho killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent continuation of the series","review":"Okay, the Stephanie Plum series is not great literature, but the stories have good plots, a great protagonist, and some great wry humor.I think Lorelei King as the read for the unabridged version adds just the right amount of character to the reading to enhance its enjoyment. Unlike many readers, she does not allow emoting to interfere with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephanie never changes","review":"If you've read the first few Stephanie Plum novels you need read none of the rest. Janet Evanovich needs to let her character learn from her mistakes and grow! I was excited when I found the \\"Plum\\" novels and read through them very quickly. They were great. Both funny and fun to read. By number six I was getting worried. Enough wrecked cars. Enough fear of guns. I waited quite a while before picking up To the Nines and doubt that I will bother to read #10. Sorry, Janet. Grow up Stephanie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but not the best of the series","review":"Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series is one of my favorites series. Book Nine is fun and sassy, but I wouldn't rate it as the best of the series. Still, I wouldn't have missed it. A fun, fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the best one yet!!!","review":"Loved, loved, LOVED this book!! I didn't intend to read it as soon as I got it but I just HAD to scan the first page or two. It pulled me right in and kept my interest. I read it at every possible moment I could find. Fast paced and, as usual, I was sorry to have it end. In my opinion this one is probably the best..........but I can't wait for #10!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Plum Yet","review":"\\"To the Nines\\" is the best Plum yet! By this point in the series I feel as if I know the characters so well that Evanovich's descriptions of their antics are side-splitting funny! Fast-paced and hilarious! Don't miss out."},{"rating":"1","title":"More substance, and suspense, needed","review":"I'd been hearing what fun Janet Evanovich's mysteries were to read, so I picked up \\"To the Nines\\" hoping for an enjoyable afternoon. What I got was the literary equivalent of cotton candy -- sweet and not unpleasant, but not nearly enough to make a meal. Stephanie Plum and the two men in her life, Morelli and Ranger, were likable enough, but I didn't really get caught up in their lives and concerns. The novel could have been more tightly plotted, and worst of all, I figured out who the bad guy was well before the end of the novel. When it comes to weirdo characters and over-the-top plot devices, I like Sue Grafton and Carl Hiaasen much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasurable Entanglements","review":"The \\"Round Dozen\\" is a gentle yet enjoyable visit into the life of William Helder, a wealthy business executive in London. For years, he has been searching for the cristening cups that had been apart of his family for centuries, but over time, some had disappeared. He has the last cup left to find, and it is this search that introduces him to the quiet, contented, country loving, already betorthed, Hazel Paget. Their lives entwine and entangle within the search for the cup. The eccentric antics of Hazels Aunt, Lady Storring, the gentle shoving of Williams step-mother, the wooing of a freind of Hazels, Mavis, and her energetic suitor Bernie, not to mention Hazles, brother, a struggling musician and sister-in-law, Dilys, all weave together, to make a smile bearing, relaxing, and thoroughly satisfying, light read, with a bit of mystery thrown in to add body to the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"I loved this book. I got it last night around 8:30 PM and finished it by Midnight. It definitely lived up to the expectations I had for this Plum novel.One of my favorite things about this series is the interaction between Joe, Ranger and Stephanie. In this book, when Stephanie's life is in danger, Joe and Ranger work together in order to protect her. Kind of nice to see that they can put aside any problems to protect Stephanie.Stephanie's family has gotten even crazier since the previous book, Valerie is falling from her place as the good child. Grandma Mazur fantisizes about Ranger anytime she sees him. And Mom spends lots of time in the kitchen ironing and cooking.Stephanie was, yet again, the person that someone was trying to kill. I won't tell you who wants to kill her, it would ruin the surprise.Overall this was one of my favorite of the Stephanie Plum series. I can't wait for the next one to come out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God another one!","review":"Ok, the first 5 or six were funny to read. After a while it is awfully boring. everyone and everything is same. The ditzy Stephanie can't make up her mind, stupid apphenensions going bad, blah blah blah!!!!(I bought these for my daughter; but read a couple of them myself)Anyway, I think it is time to retire Stephanie and do something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandma Mazur wouldn't be amused by this one.","review":"I love the Plum series. But like John Grisham, Evanovich seems to be working more from a timetable than true inspiration with this one (i.e., produce one book a year come hell or highwater regardless of the quality).Yes, it still has some of the same qualities that made me read and enjoy the first books in this series. Lula and Grandma Mazur are still hysterical characters. The sexual tension between Stephanie, Ranger and Morelli is still palpable. But this is where the similarity ends. This wasn't Evanovich's best effort. I hope the author can get back to the creative sources she had for previous books. Otherwise, this might be the last Plum book I read for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud!","review":"This is my first Janet Evanovich book - and I absolutely loved it! Fast paced and very witty, I found myself roaring with laughter! I can't wait to go read the previous 8 books!

Now when I think of this book, I'll remember how the characters reminded me of the 3 stooges and the keystone kops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low brow farce","review":"This is NOT a comic thriller mystery. It is farce first and foremost with a mystery as a side element--and not an intriguing mystery at that.

Buy the more expensive version of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet Evanovich - To the Nines (Stephanie Plum series)","review":"The Stephanie Plum series is great! A great series if you like action and mystery! Some series fall flat after the first few books, but not this one. This series continually references the old characters, introduces new characters, and keeps the story line fresh and interesting with Stephanie Plum's professional and personal life. To sum it up, the series is very interesting, never boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet Evanovich To The Nines","review":"I received this book way before the time stated for me to receive it.

Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a quick and easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERBOARD DIALOGUE","review":"The characters are interesting with human weaknesses and faults. However, abrasive humor dominates this book. The plot is treated like a (necessary evil) vehicle running in the background. The main characters are preoccupied with sex and humorous taunting of each other. All this would be okay if supporting a story line. I had to force myself to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Service","review":"Ordered two books from this seller & only recieved one.

The graphics are so bad, my comp freezes every 15 minutes, so many errors, i practically cry that Microsoft did such a bad job. The airplanes are so cheap that the skins load all over the scenery, you can't even crash with another airplane, u just go through them. If you crash in water, there is no splash, the airplane just hits it and gets stuck in one place!!!!!! Thats just crap, 1 star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome game","review":"Beautifully done and a joy to play. (I wanted to give this item 5 stars but Amazon won't let me change it from 2. Go figure.)This game has so much to offer: awe inspiring scenary, take off or land at any airport you can think of - no matter how small, and the new floatplane means you can take off and land anywhere there's water.When I first started playing this game it crashed my system a lot, but it turned out I had a bad memory module. This game really gives your system a workout.The flight instruction is great, except that the manual is filled with annoying (non)humor that makes reading it a real pain. I just want flight instruction! If I want comedy I'll turn on the comedy channel.Overall I give this product two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best Flight Simulator available for the PC","review":"MS Flight Simulator 2002 is a very detailed game that lets PC users attempt their skill at flying in a simulated environment. The game platform is a very accurate 3-D model of the entire Earth's surface, and features many many airports all over the planet. My favorite feature is the real-world weather conditions that you can download from the internet. Unfortunayely, the fog/ visibility effects looked better of FS 2000. The cloud formations look great on this one, though. I just wish they would include more aircraft, like a twin-turbine Cessna, or a military jet, like F-16 or MIG.Depending on the type of PC you have, the performance of this demanding program will probably slow the frame rate down, especially when flying over very detailed cities like New York or London with broken clouds and other air traffic. Just be sure to check the specs and make sure your PC can handle it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, basic flight simulator","review":"This simulator has plenty of options and adjustments for a beginner. It is fun to take off and land at airports near your home and to see familiar geographic scenery. The sound effects make it all the more realistic. My 13-year old son was very worried when I made my first (successful) landing attempt at a small airfield near our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear for Take-off!","review":"I played this game at a relative's house, and I liked it so much that I want to get it for myself!I started out just creating flights and crashing the plane (there are no crash graphics, which was a bummer for me, the plane could hit the ground with the nose, but then just pop back up and skid on it's landing gear! The planes wouldn't sink in water either!), but then I started 'learning' how to fly the plane! That was where I got hooked on the game. \\"Learning\\" how to fly was a lot of fun, it was like you were really flying with an instructor in the cockpit with you (well, it is a SIMULATOR)!Next, the graphics are very good, and the sound effects are very realistic! The physics of flying are also great and so are the weather physics! I recommend buying this sim, but only if say you want to fly realistically. If you don't, just buy some other game (such as a fighter pilots game)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Simulator!!!","review":"This game is GREAT for anyone who loves planes, or has any interest in them, for that matter!! This is by far the BEST simulator game out on the market! I only gave it 4 stars because it does have a few glitches here and there, but it is still a GREAT game! I will say though, it is well worth the money, but, I think you would get a better deal by getting the Professional Edition! So check it out! You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002","review":"This is typical of Microsoft products....they don't work and they charge you to try to fix them.

I should have known thatthe price paid was far too cheap for a new, usable game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of FS Simulations","review":"I've had them all since FS4. 2002 is by far the best of all. Games like this can be very problematic, both within themselves and what they can do to your system. Not the case here, at least not with me. I originally installed FS2002 on a Windows ME system. Since then, I upgraded to Windows XP and the Simulator just hummed along without missing a beat. Of course there are things that could be improved (maybe a little more accurate ATC) but what do you want for $50? The Real World Weather works great and you'll want to add FSNavigator and some of the great AI aircraft to keep you company on those long flights. I've heard the horror stories about the new FS2004 and I'm in no hurry to dump my 2002. It's been too good to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The detail is amazing","review":"I bought this game the day before New Year's Eve, and I'm still amazed at the detail. In Vegas, George Carlin is headlining at Bally's and the Bellagio fountains are in full swing. The entire Los Angeles area from a high altitude looks EXACTLY what it looks like in real life (I fly over it frequently). Actually, that goes for every city. Even taking off from a small, non-descript island in the Philippines, all of the surrounding island geography is correct. Simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"HERE'S A HINT!","review":"I want to answer a question that is on a lot of peoples mind! I have just ordered this game but have played it on school computers! Many people are dissapointed in that you can't crash on this game! Well, you can! Just go to the AIRCRAFT button on the top file bar on your screen!

I've enjoyed her past albums, up until the live version of Mountain High...Valley Low. When you have to tell people that you're singing about Jesus?....I mean that speaks volumes. I love Yolanda, but I hope she goes to another label. I think this label is sapping her talent. They don't allow her voice to really shine through.

In fact I purchased an additional pair for my hunting friends. The ability to turn off certain features you didn't want or like such as the 'Roger Beep'is a plus! These units worked extremely well in all of my treks through the woods, canyon and draws. I was able to keep in touch with others with little problem.I do recommend making or puchasing a case for their protection. The face plate seems to scratch easily.The only drawback I discovered was the small buttons are difficult to activate with gloves.

The first day I used the radio, the battery cover fell off somewhere and now the radio is useless unless I wrap rubber bands around the body to keep the batteries from also falling out. Motorola's excellent battery cover on its first Talkabouts misled me when buying the T6250 into thinking this too was well designed. I wouldn't buy another one.It also didn't receive transmissions from other peopled' FSRs. I've had the older Talkabout 250 and the newer T6250 both turned on but only the 250 would receive those transmissions.Don't buy this radio; Motorola discontinued it for some reason and I suspect we've identified two of the reasons.Sure, some of the features are nice.

While the story was definitely one that should have been written, often the reader is subjected to phrases such as \\"It is unclear...\\" and \\"It is unknown...\\" Unfortunately, these phrases seem to proceed sentences that would have contained facts very important to the case...and, of course, the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me with questions!","review":"As a long time resident of Grand Canyon I have been long interested in the Canyon's most famous murder. I was disappointed in this book and hope that someone does a better job in the future. I found Scott's writing inconsistent --- at times detailed but frequently hurried and shallow. While reading it I felt the author was trying to meet a deadline and was way behind! Frequently details were left out --- his description of exactly where the murder took place on the trail is inexact. I never felt like the author was close to giving me insight into this murder. Apparently the murder was done for financial reasons --- the book contained just a few sentences giving the financial details. More questions!!! Way too much heavy use of quotes from official sources rather than insights by the author or experts."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"Quite surprised to find this here!

I did see them live in the 80s and watching this 20 yrs later gives me a whole new appreciation for them.

The rest of the books are really only rehashing of previous events.Rowan's connection with murder victims becomes more and more traumatic, Rowan and Felicity become more and more violent and they become less and less practicing Pagans. Each book becomes less and less enjoyable.After reading Harm None and Never Burn a Witch I felt like I would have loved to meet Rowan and Felicity. After reading the rest of the books I hope I never meet anyone even remotely like them.I was hoping for a postive view of Pagans in the modern world. Characters who held onto their spiritual beliefs in the face of overwhelming odds. But as the series progresses, Rowan and Felicity become complete hypocrites. Both characters become snarky with each other and Ben and both become very violent. What a disappointment.My advice is to read Harm None and Never Burn a Witch and forget the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I give this movie high marks for being well done and in most areas authetic in detail (though the bad guys were a little too evil).

The big studios were selling off their assets, being acquired by large mutinational companies, and were totally out of touch with the movie going public.

Marvin's rendition of \\"Born under a Wandering Star\\" in particular was startling good. Jean Seberg rounds out the film with her beauty, charm, wit and wonderful acting ability.

I kept watching thinking it would get better and resolve at the end, but it just kept getting stupider and stupider, yuckier and yuckier. I would NOT recommend this movie to ANYONE I know -- even the perverts. I wish I could give it negative stars instead of being forced to give it one at all. Don't watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie they tried to ruin","review":"\\"Paint Your Wagon\\" is almost a textbook case in how to ruin a film version of halfway decent musical. Take a minor Lerner & Lowe hit, blow it up all out of proportion, cast three non-singers for the main leads, and remove most traces of the whimsy and irony that made this moderately popular in the first place. That the result is STILL somewhat entertaining is almost a miracle. A lot of the credit has to go Lee Marvin, who plays his trademark drunken Westerner to the hilt. But Clint Eastwood and Jean Seberg are bland to the point of nonexistence. A standout (he's hard to miss) is Harve Presnell, an actual singer who belts out the movie's big hit, \\"They Call the Wind Maria\\" then promptly disappears. There's a lot of \\"what-in-the-world-were-they-thinking?\\" in this one. But it's still worth a couple hours of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch this while eating","review":"Most people who write reviews I'm sure do so because they had a lovely family experience with the film. Watching Paint Your Wagon alone is about as much fun as counting toothpicks or watching leaves fall. The acting bites, the music is suspciously un-hi fi and the story line is WEAK. All in all, this film deserves any and all butchering it receives. It has survived only because it has become a cult classic. So put it on the shelves next to Rocky Horror or Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and leave it there."},{"rating":"1","title":"paint your wagon","review":"i got this movie and watched it and it was good till i got to the end and it would not show the ending so if you are thinking you will buy it dont this review is from george moran"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"I don't have much to say about this movie.

Never much for musicals, and always big on Eastwood westerns- I nearly vomited when I saw this. Two of the coolest actors to ever star in a Western- together...singing?! I love Lee MArvin and Eastwood, but this movie was rediculous. I enjoyed the plot, sort of...it was just the absolute wrong movie for these guys. I hear who's in it, and I expect Hang 'Em High or High Plains Drifter, and an Ennio Morricone score. I got this instead. As you can see, I'd be dissapointed. It was even worse to see what everyone thinks is a joke from the Simpsons, is a real movie. Thumbs way down on this one.

I think I was 8 or 9 years old. I get the same thoughts and feelings as I got the first time I watched it. This movie has so many funny blips that I can't believe it. Like, \\"Whats a fornicater? I don't know, I'm not a religious man\\" and many many more. The story line is super and the characters and singing and scenery are just the best. Incredible movie. Whenever I need to escape for awhile, I head to No Name City where the drinking is good and I can sing loud and then when I wake up in the middle of the night, I'm OK again. This is just a great movie all the way. I'm still in love with Elizabeth after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paint Your Wagon","review":"All the family loved this movie, from grandma and grandpa to the youngest of the grandkids.

Presumably accurate, the book dissects and describes the history and chief tenets of Islam, with its literal inconsistencies and contradictions. This can't be all there is.

I can't believe that Amazon would ship this product with only the original manufacturer's packing which is not designed for the rough handling of third party shipping. Amazon refused to send a second replacement after promising that they would do so.

This one might be better made them other Haier products.2. You might get a good one.To set the baseline: Most reviews for appliances and electronics on Amazon are negative. Most reviews are written by people who bought a product, had trouble with it, and get even by writing a bad review. People who get good working electronics or appliances do not tend to write reviews, so you don't see the possitive experiences as much.

They actually look exactly like what is presented when you view the larger image of the item. They are backed by what I think is rubber. I doubted whether or not the coaster would be able to absorb with this material. But they work great. There is no condensation on the bottom of the coaster when having an heavily iced drink.

If your relationship is lacking in the \`vitamins and minerals' of a healthy lifelong relationship, look elsewhere. But if you're in a solid marriage and want to help your wife learn how to enjoy \`dessert' (before someone else does), look no further. The heart of what Ms. Schwartz shares in this book is two-fold and true to the title she gave it. She does a masterful job of showing men how women wish to be treated non-sexually and then goes where few have gone in spelling out the nuts and bolts of how to help your women enjoy her sexuality in the same way you do. What's the difference? You've been orgasmic since puberty and your wife want's to start soon. Wise is the man who not only learns what Daylle is teaching in this book, but learns it in the order that she teaches it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Any book that honestly attempts to bridge the desires and expectations of men and women is a good thing in my opinion.Most of Daylle Schwartz's book deals with pleasing women \\"out of bed,\\" which I think is for the best. Towards the end, she transfers the common sense suggestions she's made for listening to attending to the needs of women to the realm of the bedroom.Basically what it comes down to is that to be a decent lover, a man shouldn't be wanting to learn bedroom tricks, but rather should be willing to be a friend to the all of the woman that he loves.It's not the most comprehensive or perfect book, but I think there's plenty of information and ideas about what women want that any man can benefit from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"I have read and reread his book a few times now. Information is clear and concise. If you have trouble and need some help understanding women, dating, sex, this is a very good read.

However, in order to get that close shave your facial hair can not be too long. I mean it has to be stubble or new growth to get that smooth close shave. If not then yo will need to shave the stubble with something else first, then go over face several times with the Bump Free Shaver.

Once i unplugged it to test its speed and how good it was, 5 minutes later it start to kind of slow down and act weird. Right then and there it just died on me, like a engine that was pushed to hard.

I'm not looking for a close shave because of ingrown hairs,however this Wahl shaver misses so many hairs I have to use a trimmer prior to using it. I suspect instead of the hair going into slots to be cut(like my remington) it has to pass thru the mesh holes on the Wahl.

I do not recommend this shaver at all. In addition, the packaging the vendor shipped the shaver in was very inadequate. The shaver was so loose in the package that the shipping process caused the shaver to actually break out of the clamshell packaging.

This product is vastly inferior. It is critical that every black man struggling with razor bumps understand that FOIL ELECTRIC RAZORS DO NOT WORK AND ARE NOT AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO ALLEVIATE RAZOR BUMPS IN BLACK MEN. I'm shocked that Wahl has tried to capitalize on its hair clipper popularity by putting out this very loud, ineffective foil shaver.

It took so much effort and concentration to read certain parts that I could feel the sweat popping out on my brow. To make matters worse, I could only figure out portions of the book, even after a couple of reads.This study guide goes a long way toward answering lots of questions I had about the story, the plot, the characters, and how they interrelated. This was such a big help to me that immediately after finishing the study guide I started reading Infinite Jest yet again, only this time a lot more of it clicked, and made it so much more enjoyable. I only wish the guide had revealed more, but I suppose there's something sort of magical about not being able to figure the whole book out. It would be lots of fun to have more of these guides for great works of fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Illuminating Guide","review":"If Infinite Jest has become the Ulysses of the late twentieth century, then this excellent guide is the equivalent of Stuart Gilbert's companion to Joyce's masterpiece: Burn offers a lucid unravelling of some of the more mysterious aspects of Wallace's book (what exactly is up with Hal, where the mastercopy of the film is at a given time), but he also demonstrates fascinating parallels with books like The Golden Bough that I'd never thought of. It's also mercifully free of the kind of esoteric literary theory that spoils so many literary studies - refreshingly Burn prefers to situate the novel alongside the work of writers like Jonathan Franzen, and William Gaddis.The book is short (you sometimes get the feeling that Burns wants to say more but doesn't have space) but within those limitations this is a fine study of a terrific novel - highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A post-reading guide","review":"Hi,This is a wonderful guide to Infinite Jest.It contains, in just a few pages, a valid summary of the book; a short biography of DFW and lots of hints to start a conversation about the great writer's masterpiece.Nonetheless, IJ is such a broad subject that a short guide could never be sufficient to really master the text without reading it with patience and attention, maybe a couple of times.Id est, you cannot take an exam on IJ without reading the book thoroughly before. This guide will re-create timelines, happenings, connections that might have been unclear to the reader, but the reader must well know what Mr.Burn is talking about.I consider myself quite an attentive reader; however, Burn's guide made me realize that, amid the 1079 pages of the book, there were links between the sub-plots that had skipped my surveillance.A Must-Read for those who have loved this book and want to know some new perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is fiction","review":"The author did not even do enough research to know that early Egyptian calender had 36 not 52 weeks, or 3 not 4 seasons.

For really in depth baseball check out High Heat, but for gameplay Triple Play is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Game","review":"This game has to be one of the worst baseball games on the PlayStation. For one thing the game gets stuck A LOT. As for home runs, it's got an emphasis on those. I like hitting home runs, but not when they're obviously exaggerated. The gameplay is often lame, as a player is halfway toward home, but then he runs back to third, on both teams that happens sometimes! I do not recommend this game very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome game","review":"This is a super fun game for all ages. The home run derby is the best.

One would think that with all of the realistic game-play and other options that this would be a sweet deal, well it isn't. The CPU is very unrealistic in its ability to play, it is easily mastered and becomes very unchallenging long before the All-Star break. This happens no matter what level of play you select or what kind of strategy you unleash. I played 40 or so games into the season and now my game just sits, collecting dust. I have bought my last EA Sports game no matter how enticing the synopsis or the graphic's snapshots on the back of the package may be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"There are a few good things, but overall it's a very bad game. I like the addition of legends like Cy Young. Also the graphics are good but nothing fantastic. The worst part of the game is baserunning. There's only one button for either sending a runner forward or back, so you get with situations where runners end up going to the same base and there is nothing you can do about it. This is very annoying. Also, before every game you play, you have to save the game (which takes a while), then after the game it has to load. It's a bad game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EA Sports has did it again","review":"This has to be the best baseball game for the Playstation today!

In addition.....rey ordonez has hit 4 homeruns in 2 games for me (on pro mode)In conclusion, this is pretty much the same as last year (except for the horrible extra features such as having a home run derby in a livving room) the only really good thing about the game is being able to use hall of fame players, but the game play is very unrealisitc, and im sick of these monsterous polygonal graphics....why cant these developers stay away from those ugly close ups forever....(or at least until PS2 is out)"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool game","review":"the guy who said that this game had no pitch control, no way to tell how tired your pitcher is and that fielding is impossible doesnt know what he is talking about. as for the first two, he is plain wrong, and as for fielding, it can get a little tricky on allstar level, but once you get used to it, it's not bad; even diving isnt that hard. the game is a lot of fun, but it doesnt have the greatest replay value, unless you play it againt another person. the historic players are fun, but they are so good that they kind of make the game too easy. anyways, as far as baseball games go, this is one of the best ive ever played. my only real complaint is that i find baserunning to be a pain in the ass, and ive been tagged out many times because i couldnt run the bases like i wanted to."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pretty good toy","review":"the bratz rock angelz concert stage is a pretty good toy, i mean it doesn't fall apart and it doesn't have too many pieces, but i would just get the band instrumentz because it has, well, more instruments! it's also way less money, i mean $20 versus $50."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Energetic Cd from an Energetic band","review":"When you listen to their first CD, you can hear the difference from Evolver.

Never again will I make the same mistake. I really don't see why this album is named the way it is because I don't see how anybody can be envious of this garbage. I will give Fat Joe a little credit.

With all the commercial [stuff] nowadays alot of rappers have fallen into the trend,making true recent fans upset. But I will have say that this album is totally not a bad album at all. I was expecting some over-exerted bling-bling material, but Fat Joe (like always) has presented a decent offering. With songs from Murder Rap to He's Not Real you can see that this man is still a hungry hardcore rapper. Sometimes you may turn your head when the same mastermind who composed these songs is the same one with the flashy diamond rings and expensive cars on his new video. But to the old Fat Joe fans you will not be overly disappointed. Yeah there are a few songs here and there that may not thrill the old fans, but he does represent well. Trust me.

The King of New York! Why?Because he is another rapper who just became a part of the disposible flavor of MTV and Radio for this month or so?In my opinion ever scence Biggie Smalls and 2-Pac died.

I love the T289 it is small and light weight. The big selling point for me was that you could have the 38 privacy codes so you could feel more private no interuptions.If your wife is like mine she won't use them if someone is cutting in on your conversations. Another feature was the buttons were a little more organized than the T250 which is still a nice hand held but it is larger and my wife didn't want something big to carry I to also agreed.

The authors of the Newcomer's Handbook tell you what you need to know. They also list a service I didn't see listed anywhere else -- Personalized Relocation Management (...) which helped me find a great place in Santa Monica within 24 hours of landing at LAX.

Except for the justly famous Gun Crazy, a wild film noir take on the Bonnie and Clyde story, and the talked about but more minor noir The Big Combo, most of Lewis' films are not well known and a lot of them are not good, though the director often tries to do something stylish or unexpected with some of the scenes. It's not surprising I guess that the only book on the man is this slim, expensive and not very detailed book. It's okay if you love Joseph H. Lewis movies and you want to spend 30-something dollars for a moderately extended interview and a filmography. The interviewer doesn't go very deep and you don't come away with a very good idea of what inspired Lewis or even many good anecdotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"plays at most less than 180 songs","review":"There are only two reasons for having an expansion slot, one is to be able to quickly and easily change the songs you can access, the other is to be able to listen to more songs at a time. This player doesn't support that second feature because there is a limit to the number of songs it can access at a time. Using only songs that I tested, and verified would play with the device, I found that it was impossible to to have the player display over 180 songs, This is a serious unforgivalbe deficiency in the product.

Also, the LCD screen keeps going out - coming back on - then dying again.I'm a Mac user and had counted on this player being compatible, but it's really not!

You should remember your speech pretty much word for word. You should think of the cadence of how you'll deliver it.

The actors are all brilliant. It is a different kind of love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful coming of age movie","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I still cry every time I see it. It is sexually explicit, but the scenes are erotic, artsy, and beautiful. Yet, this movie is more than a tool for foreplay. It is a delicate love story, a story of two people who could never be together due to differences in race, age, religion, and culture. Although they know from the beginning their relationship cannot last, each dives in anyway.This is one of the few coming of age stories that centers around a girl, and the only one I can think of that centers around her sexual growth. Through her tricky attempt to maintain a separation of her physical form and emotional state, she learns the hard way that the mind-body connection is strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"aptly titled film about the lovers","review":"this is a beautifully photographed and artfully directed film. i saw both rated and unrated version of this film and contrary to most opinions here, i would recommend the r-rated version since the unrated version take away the narrow focus of the film and dwell too much on unnecessary love scenes. don't let critics who call this soft porn sway you from truly enjoying this film. this is not a soft porn. it's a film about the lovers. the film is narrowly focused like a well written essay. sure, the characters may not be developed as much as we would like. but lets face it, what does lovers care about when the temperature is high. they only care about making love and being with each other. and afterward, maybe a meal. anyone who have had great love relationship will treasure this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Lover\\"","review":"\\"The Lover\\". starring Tony Leung and Jane MarchVery good movie, excellent \\"cinema\\" -- good story, well filmed, great acting.Really enjoyed the going back to school scenes.... the crossing of the Mekong, the boat, the car, the bus, the drive.And the ending, the ship leaving for France.Wonderful.5 stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars for pure eroticism amid cultural contrasts!","review":"What an intriguing, beguiling tale. It is a study in sexual awakening for a young woman, seduction by an older, experienced man, and cultural tension between East and West. Would any American director know how to present this marvelous sensuality in such frank, yet beautiful images? My partner, who has been so very leary of on-screen sexuality, loved it! And so did I. One of the few films I have chosen to purchase for future screenings. If my review strikes a note, be sure to get the unrated version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cinematographic interpretation of Duras' novel","review":"This is a movie that can be seen many times, both due to the beauty of its cinematography and its many layers of meaning. The film manages to capture the flow of Duras' prose. In some ways, it is even more beautiful and subtle. March and Leung are so sexy it hurts, and this film has some of the most beautiful erotic scenes that I have seen in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Read the \\"Editorial\\" Review","review":"This film version of Marguerite Duras' book tells a lovely story about race and class. The characters are willing to cross those \\"societal\\" lines, but only to a certain point. It leaves you wishing that they had the guts to follow their true desires, even if it means ditching the expectations of others.I won't give away the ending, but this story is FAR more than \\"soft porn\\". Maybe to the uneducated, it is just that. To the more open-minded, it's a tale about crossing boundaries and the wonders you'll discover when you do. You also see the down-side to that, which leaves you questioning why society has a hierarchy based such superficiality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss March...","review":"If you have seen Jane March in The Color of Night opposite Bruce Willis, you know what to expect here as well. Lots of sex and skin, with some decent acting as well. Do not watch this one with mother...The movie is a haunting \\"love\\" story with numerous scenes involving a young looking March fully nude. She is beautiful and gives a decent performance as well. The Lover is enjoyable on a visual level mostly, but has a fair plot as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbingly 'Romantic'","review":"'The Lover', starring Jane March, has excellent direction and cinematography, and the acting is very smooth. Its true-to-time and place imagery is also quite captivating. However, the 'innocence lost' ethos goes overboard, with one-too-many sex scenes between an underage girl and an older French Indo-Chinaman. Adapting this story to film creates this inherent problem- how do you keep the story engaging without making it look like 'illegal' (read- 'child') soft porn. There's one scene in particular where the girl is essentially raped, and, the way the film progresses thenceforth, it is as if we are supposed to accept this offensive assault as an acceptable part of their relationship.I think people give this film 5 stars because they get swept away with the romantic reverie, while overlooking the reprehensible pedophilic realities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annuad..No","review":"What can I say about The Lover! nothing much really..It is disappointing to say the least, especially if you expect a cinematic masterpiece follow up to The Name of the Rose. It is the story of an impossible relationship between a french young girl,and a chinese man in indochina, based on a story by Marguarite Duras. The first problem with the film is the casting of Jane March, who really does not have the sensuality and erotisicm of the french heroine she is playing..The performance is just dull.as for the hot intimate scenes, and the big question that arose at the time..did they do it or were they acting? to that I say, who cares really!!!a huge disappointment from a director that gave us Chariots of Fire, The Bear and of course The Name of the Rose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever!","review":"I have the VHS, the book, and now the DVD. Love it every time, and I've never found a better love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"Suspenseful erotic drama with Jane March and Tony Leung. A young French female boarding school pupil gets involved in a not allowed relationship to an older wealthy Chinese. She believes that it is all about sex, and she realizes too late that it has been love. Unusually realistic revealing naked scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"A story that touches on social hierarchy and racism. This movie is about two people who feel each one is too good for the other. Jane March tries to make it sound like a love story but what is apparent is a poor white girl gets involved with the rich \\"China Man\\" (Tony Leung)for money and he with her, for sex, as he knew he would never marry her. Beautiful actors. Erotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"innocence, sensual, sexual, erotic, need i say more?","review":"Other than the old cinematography, (it looks as though it were done in the 1970's)it was a great film. I bought this movie because it was about a white girl and asian man and you do not see that enough; so it sparked my interest. The man is very handsome with a hot ass and the girl is a young slender virgin who is curious about sex and might as well give it a try with this man persuing her. It has a lot of full frontal nudity, very realistic sexual scenes and just a lot of sex. Very good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's call it what it is","review":"My last blurb for this video didn't show up, so let's try again.It's just classy soft-core, and borderline child porn at that.

I give it two stars instead of one because if that's what you're looking for, you'll be pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This Boring Movie - Like Watching Paint Dry","review":"This movie is slow, boring, has no real plot, wooden acting. Watching this movie is like watching paint dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by its pretention to \\"Art\\"","review":"This movie is beautifully photographed and well acted and based on a short novel people love. So is it Art? No. It's soft-core faux kiddie porn. The girl is barely a woman -- her thin frame and flat chest turn the nude love scenes between her and a mature man into scenarios of child statutory rape.... If you disagree, consider it without the sexuality. Not much left, is there? (And don't say the sex is necessary. Why wasn't it necessary in American films for the first fifty years?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately Powerful!","review":"I have heard all of Aline Barros CDs (in both Portuguese and Spanish), yet this CD is the best!

If you're an Ace Combat fan this game is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ace Combat Zero","review":"I liked the game, but it was really similar to the previous version, and a lot shorter; it had a lot fewer sorties. One substantial update was that you can buy different weapons for each plane. But the price for such is very high, and really uneccessary as you can always succeed with the stock weaponry each plane comes with. Another change is that the player is now a mercenary, fighting amongst allied forces. Personally, I don't care for this feature.

Each one of these games have the same graphics and controls but each one has a different story and planes. It is very hard like other ones and takes forever to beat. The people talking to u r annoying like others because they distract u while u r in a battle. The sound and music is very cool and great for these type of games. After u beat the game there is missions to do or u can either battle in multiplayer or do mini games in multiplayer. I kind of like this one better than AC5 because it is multiplayer and it has missions to do so u r not bored after u beat the game. It is also not as hard as the other ones. This is a great game to have and it is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ace Combat","review":"A must purchase for all aviation game freaks. Great graphics, great fun.

As much as I loved Ace Combat 5 I found myself back in the grips of a addictive game. The one thing I missed in the new installment was the soundtrack. Ace Combat 5 gave us a great song to jam to. Blurry was an awsome addition to the game and I felt a little let down that there was not another theme song to push the envelope in ZERO. Other than that the game is flawless. The planes. The Action. And the Setups just go on to prove the ELITE status of the people at Namco Games. Keep em comming.

Now we can see what a hilarious (and fine) essayist he is, too. Reading this honest and embarassing collection of nonfiction pieces is as sweet and exhilirating as wrestling on the carpet with a crush.

And I am not surprised in the least that it tanked. Mr. Ames just doesn't have the confidence to carry the wit.

I doubt he'll have any more books published."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man with the Chipper Zipper","review":"Reading \\"What's Not to Love\\" is like travelling with Walter Middy to a sex shop or getting to know the secret life of Woody Allen. Jonathan's amazing talent for relating things with understated humor and matter-of-fact delivery that most people would be embarrassed to admit they've thought about is the unity in this wildly funny book. How many guys actually talk about their fears of getting gas when making love to a woman for the first time? There's nothing less romantic than a little flatulence. And who could relate with such humor things like colonics, penile warts, or cataloging the most curvaceous waitresses while on holiday? Not a book for prudes or those who think the spiritual is at war with physical, this is an endearing ride through quite personal, brilliantly related sexual insecurity. I could call Jonathan the man with the chipper zipper. Don't miss out on this extraordinary tail. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical","review":"What a refreshing book!

Korn, Deftones, System of a Down, Rage Against The Machine, all the giants were inspired by the music of one of the greatest bands of our time. I hear most people write about how great the song Epic is and how well Mike Patton wrote his lyrics on that song. Well, thats not what im gonna say. You can tell that this band has grew on this cd. From the early punk days of ex-singer Chuck Mosley, to the late Faith No More sophisticated sound of 1997s masterpiece Album of the Year. If you forget about the regular conflicts between the band, and the constant guitarist lineup changing, Faith No More worked wonderfully together. They crafted some of the most underappreciated and overlooked songs ever. If you disagree with me, its obvious your a fool. This bands music and legacy will always be here to stay with us.

Definitely can be divided into parts. The great tunes are on the first half of the first disc: We Care a Lot, Epic, Falling to Pieces, and Midlife Crisis. The second half has some good stuff: Digging the Grave and Gentle Art of Making Enemies are like thrash metal, with the later tune also reminiscent of Limp Bizkit at times. Evidence is almost an easy listening tune. The second disc is much shorter than the first, less than half an hour, and is pretty forgettable.

If smoother game play then it would be a great game. Another downside was that the CSI Miami game was on the CSI Dark Motives CD and visa versa! But with all this said I am a fan and will probably get CSI 3 & 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would recommend this game","review":"If you love to watch CSI, then I would recommend this game to you.

I was not at ALL disappointed.I have played the Law and Order games, and the horrific Cold Case Files game(ugh!!!!!)

Very fun - highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Problems","review":"The first 5 games in the first set (CSI Investigation)were loads of fun and I had absolutely NO problems.

He is a service canine and a woderfull dog that daily gives his life to assist me. When I had a home and could keep it up, he could see me need to bend over to pick up after him and was so smart, he would go back to the end of the property in the woods to go, to save my pain. I have arthritis of the spine.I wish I was that intelligent and considerate.Now going to dog walking parks and renting, I must be considerate and have found these bags very reasonable and do the job fine.Whats not to like, the world is good and Buddy, nicknamed Hollywood, cause he is a star that just loves everyone. When we drive through town, everyone says, HI BUDDY, and nothing for me LOLOLOLOL. he does deserve the hello's ten times over and these bags help all off us be good people to others and are cost effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"If you are looking for a dog poop bag that is not only substantial in strength, but in size (for quantity) - this is it. We were thrilled when we first used these for our 105-pound lab. The bag itself will hold a lot and is strong. We have found these to be the best on the market. Don't waste your money on ones that are less expensive. if you have a medium to large breed dog, you'll be pleased with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Every Leash","review":"Having a Poop Patrol dispenser on every leash makes dog walking easier.

I find this much easier than a pooper scooper or any other method of managing doggie waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I had high expectations for this book. I have read many of the dragonlance series. It possessed none of the \\"magic\\" that made the dragonlance books great. The characters were shallow. None of them touched me. I was \\"sick\\" of several of them by the time I could drag myself to the end of the book. There were no redeeming qualities at all. My advice...Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak, weak, weaker ..","review":"Having read lot of this author's work I was looking forward to reading this new series. I'm not sure if the fact that I read the George R R Martin books before this one but I was sorely dissapointed. The book seemed shallow, rushed, and uninspired. I'm not sure if the lesbian theme was meant to draw in the 15 year old readers, but it certainly didn't add anything to the story. If you are expecting anything similar to Dragonlance or The Deathgate Cycle, don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Age inappropriate for pre-teens & \\"tweens\\"","review":"I've bought many of the Weis/Hickman Dragonlance books for my son over the past couple of years. He has been greatly delighted in the writing, so I bought him the Dragonvald Trilogy. He, of course, read them immediately before I could get to them. When I finally got to Mistress of Dragons, I was extremely unhappy with the in depth lesbianism, crude references to heterosexualism and the graphic description of a violent rape. I felt these depictions were not suitable for pre-teens or \\"tweens\\" and I was greatly upset that nowhere was there any indication that these topics were included so responsible parents would be able to make an informed choice as to whether or not to allow their children to read such a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as expected","review":"I wasn't expecting more than light entertainment from something written by Margaret Weis, and I got...light entertainment. This is a pleasant, quick fantasy with a simple but involving plot that will keep you turning the pages until the story ends. None of the characters are particularly likeable or unlikeable, with the exception of Draconas, who was actually interesting. His inner conflict is unusual--he is a dragon and owes allegiance to the dragon government, which stops him from helping humans.There is little information about any of the three societies, but there is enough to get by on. The writing is clean, and if not brilliant, certainly not painful. The tale was compelling enough that I will pick up the next book in the series at some point.If you don't really like fantasy, don't bother reading this. You'll think it's stupid.But, hey, it was nice for a dreary afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Fantasy","review":"If any of you are like me you've read just about everything you can get your hands on. If that is the case then it is so hard to find original fantasy stories that don't spin off of Lord of the Rings, or say Harry Potter. This book is amazing, the way the author winds her story around the characters is so original I had no idea where the story was going. You get very close to all the characters, but no matter how you try the ending is unpredictable, and I love it. If you're into fantasy please please do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weis is Fun, Entertainment, Sci- Fi","review":"During the summer Months when I'm not in school, I look forward to Entertainment reading something that's Sci- Fi and action packed; I feel that Margaret Weis has done this in her Dragonvarld Trilogy. She captivated me with Mistress of the Dragons and kept me with Dragon's Son, and left me wanting more similar reading with the last Master of the Dragons. (She is a real entertainment break from regular graduate school work, lol)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistress of Disappointment","review":"Being a fan of Weiss and Hickman, I looked forward to this independent writing with much enthusiasm. What I learned from reading this book is how important Tracy Hickman's contributions have been to past books; particularly in character developement and also the ease with which I was brought into the tale.The first chapters of Mistress of Dragons brought immediate reminders of an earlier book by Marion Zimmer Bradley. They are so similar I was experiencing flashbacks of that tale while trying to read through this one. I also wondered why the love scene between Edward and Melisande received no description, yet the description of the very violent rape was quite detailed. It seemed out of place in this story.I will pass on the sequel to this tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Zero here","review":"Not sure what the lesbian relationship was supposed to add to this otherwise lackluster book, but it didn't work. Lacked the swashbuckling, cliffhanging appeal of Weis's other books, like she was tired and just trying to pull something together. I was sorely disappointed and wasted my money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, Simplistic, and Stupid","review":"I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, they were quickly dashed. I don't know why Weis didn't team up with Hickman as is her wont. But, the lack of a second author dooms the effort. The book has an interesting premise, but is filled with inconsistencies, triteness, and plain ol' stupidity. If Hickman had been around, they could have bounced the material off each other and corrected most of the bad writing before it hit the shelves. As it is, it's practically un-stomachable. I put the book away about half way through it as not being worth the effort. But, I later picked it up and finished it in the hope it would get better. It didn't. It got worse. I was practically gagging by the end. Stay away from this book and its series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous tripe","review":"If you are looking for intelligent, well-written fantasy, try something else...anything else. Being big fantasy fans, my husband and I picked up the audio version for a 20+ hour car trip. After a dubious start, he insisted that we listen to the first 3 CD's \\"in case it got better.\\" It did not.I was looking forward to strong female roles that I imagined a Dragon Mistress to be. Instead, the lead female is whiney, insipid, and petty. The male roles are almost as lifeless and predictable.Mix in some stupid, pre-adolescent erotica and boring, seemingly unending, descriptive romanticism, and you have the whole package.I have never been so disappointed in a $45 bookstore trip.Robin Hobb and Ursula LeGuin have nothing to fear here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on it.....Weak Read.","review":"This is by far the worst of all her books. Did she have to meet a book obligation deadline or something with her publisher? The storyline was not strong and the characters were weakly developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough work done on ethos","review":"This might be a strange gripe, but I don't like fantasy authors who don't come out with a full religion system in a book. By which I mean you can't have a \\"devil\\" and yet not have a \\"god.\\" You could have extra-planar beings, or you could have people who worship another god but by putting devils into your storyline you need to explain how that all works. The author didn't in this case and I stopped listening to it in chapter 5. I know Ms. Weis is capable of designing a belief system as I've enjoyed some of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic writing, gratuitous homosexuality, rape & violence","review":"Lesbian themes introduced early in the book add nothing to a lackluster plotline. It should be made more obvious by the publisher that there is sexual lesbianism in this book. I am all for anyone's right to choose their sexual affiliation. But I didn't appreciate the surprise of it and fear many readers, parents included, will be unpleasantly shocked. Not suitable for young adults under fourteen. The rape scene was horrible and the violence was overly graphic, but none of it fit into the plotline well. It didn't work.The ending was disappointing - I hate books that end on a cliffhanger forcing you to buy the next book in the series so they can make money. I was looking forward to reading this book, but was disappointed and wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works fine","review":"I have it, and I can play my Bratz dolls on it perfectly.

You get a lot for your money, including a well-made (for a kid's costume) outfit, earrings, pom poms, whistle, megaphone, and headset. Once fully attired, you little girl will look great and act...well..just like a cheerleader. An added bonus is the sturdy book-like box, which easily serves as a permanent storage locker or a keepsake for other things. My only complaint is that the pom poms shed like mad and the glitter which adorns the microphone head sloughs off rapidly, leaving specks all over the house. Putting this minor issue aside, however, this is a fun toy that your girl will love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

Believe me if youhad any common sense you would get this game! i would reccomend it over the third one. Mainly because you need a really good computer to play it. hope this review was helpfull!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely fun","review":"I installed Age of Empires II (AoE2) about 4 years ago. Today, I still play with friends online about once a week. There is something special about AoE2 that makes every game a new experience, drawing us back time and time again.One thing that appeals to me is its well balanced military system. AoE2 offers a small but complete set of units, each unit playing very differently from another, this means most units will be utilized well in a battle. Many other games have many more unit types than AoE2, but few of them play out as sophisticated as AoE2.Semi-successors of AoE2 such as \\"Age of Mythology\\" or \\"Rise of Nations\\" have been on the market for a while, each with promising new features. Yet, neither game could offer the excitement and variety that AoE2 offers. There are aspects of AoE2 that newer games were unable to duplicate. If you value good game play, I would highly recommend Age of Empires 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sim City with seige weapons!!!!","review":"If you like battles and are creative, then you will love this game. The graphics get an A+ and the game is so fun that it will hook you for hours. You get to make cities, armies, and more, but at the same time you have to be cautious with your rations, you only have so much stone and food. But, you can easily just harvest more supplies, making it so that your city never stops growing. And yes, there are exiting battles, conquests and explorations, too. If your parents want games that are educational, guess what, THE AGE OF EMPIRES II has tons of historical facts about the middle ages. In the long run, all these things put together make this a very cooool game."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GAME ROCKS!","review":"This game has me hooked! It's one of the few games I have that keeps me coming back. This is because of the fun campains and the great 1 player games. You can fight the computer, be allied with the computer, or have an all out war; the latter is my favorite.There also many difrent maps you can play in and many difrent types of games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good game","review":"Much better than AOE (Age of the Empires) 1! In this game if your people go behind trees or other buildings you can see their outline so you never lose you guys. This game also has girls instead of just boys. You can walk over farms so you can build them more closely than you could in the other game."},{"rating":"2","title":"probably best rts war game ever made","review":"This game really is pretty amazing. I've had it for the past 5 years, and I still have tons of fun playing it. The graphics are much less glossy than newer games, and I actually think that in a way the graphics benefit from not being 3d. It makes the old-time feel more authentic....Anyway, awesome game overall. I just wish they made a version for osx, instead they release age of empires 3! This game might be less flashy the age of emp. 3, but it's definitely more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely annoying","review":"This game is extremely annoying for two reasons. First, it gets extremely laggy sometimes for no apparent reason. Also, the AI is not fun to play against. The AI is extremely fast because it doesn't have to use the mouse. However, the AI is also really stupid, and it doesn't have a good strategy, even on the hardest difficulty. So, playing against the computer is not fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gold edition??????????","review":"Aren't gold editions supposed to have both the age of kings and the expansion kit for a cheaper price? Just got my game, and when installing, the game complains that without Age of Kings installed that the conquerors expansion kit cannot install. I called Microsoft support and told them that I am installing a gold edition, and they said that gold editions only include the expansion kit for double the price.

The levels are extremely challenging. The cheats are also quite good. I think that this game took me almost a year to beat. I also reccomend the expansion.

You start as a tiny little settlement with only a few villagers. Over time you build an army, get new technologies, and fight other civilizations to make your empire rule over all others!The only reason I gave it four stars is because the graphics are not the best in the world.

The bears are remarkable, and the storyline of how a young cub who has lost his mother meets up with a giant grizzly and wards off human hunters is simply irresistible. Jean Jacques-Annaud's direction is superb in letting the bears tell their story in their own inimitable style. A true wildlife classic for all to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny but slow","review":"We laughed at the antics of the baby bear and were awed by the presence of the adults.

This kind of movie has a time and a place and a kids movie it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"Here's a hint. Bear's aren't people. A bear whining \\"mama\\" over and over again isn't cute. It's obscene. The animal rights wackos were certainly off their meds when they made this dog of a movie. I take that back. Calling this movie a dog is an insult to real dogs.The scenery was beautiful at least. I turned off the sound and looked at the views. The movie was clearly the most disgusting portrayal of other people's values that I have ever seen. Why is it that the animal rights crowd thinks they can portray hunters in such a way? I'm sure they intended this to insult many people and indoctrinate others. What a sad lot the people who made this are. Teaching kids to hate other people is not a good thing.

Okay, I flinched, cheered, teared up. Its totally engrossing reality is unlike any other movie I've experienced.I recommend THE BEAR to everyone, any age, any nature, any culture.

From the obviously skewed image of the hunters as ruthless pigs, to the most shocking: actual dubbing of human infant voices and whimpering on a cub bear, as if the bear were a human baby. Made without regard for the true lives of bears and to put out an anti-hunting message. For undeniable proof of such, it was made with support from The Human Society of the United States, a terrorist animal rights group with an official sounding name to fool you, but in truth it has no connection to any government agency at all.All true conservationists, avoid buying this movie, as you are simply funneling money into the anti-hunters hands.

It was interesting to see how the world of academia has changed since Crump was a graduate student.I liked this book because Crump teaches interested tidbits about the life of amphibians and tropical ecology interwoven with her stories of fieldwork. It was great to learn how Crump deals with the challenges of motherhood and fieldwork at the same time.I thought everything about this book was great, but could see how some might think this book is a little dry if you aren't into biology.

If someone wants to use the envelopes to write money amounts on, then they will like the paper and the register-like columns on the front and back of the envelopes.

This trio playing on the album really make interesting use of space and texture while backing up Mike Watt's surreal, yet heartfelt story-telling. Nels Cline's guitar-playing adds a fervor to the rhythm skeletons who sway and dance from song to song. The percussion is full of dramatic nuances and emulations of ship sounds and other bells and whistles. Very solid. This all adds up to a theme, and a very interesting one indeed. Listen for the subtle musical references from old Minutemen (Watt's initial band) songs and riffs. Characters from that era are referenced from that era, as well: particularly the great D. Boon.

When I began readingit, I had some difficulties with the old English at first and I was glad to have an easier modern translation beside it. But with the time I really liked Shakespears style of writing and I didn't need to read the easier text any more.I could imagine the outcome of the plot right from the beginning of the book. (Who is falling in love with whom...) And also the end was predicable and very easy to guess. Normally I don't like stories like that (with no surprises and a happy ending), but it didn't bother me here, because in a way it suits the style of hiscomedy. I really liked to get to know Shakespeare this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvellous play full of intrigues and jokes","review":"Some time ago we started reading Shakespeare's \`Twelfth Night'. Unfortunately we were rather in a hurry and so I had to read the play once again when I had time off to really understand the jokes and enjoy the play. I often heard people saying that Shakespeare liked intrigues and used to write funny and sometimes even a bit obscene and rough plays. I found that rumour confirmed while reading \`Twelfth Night'. Nevertheless I liked the play and as our teacher procured a \`side-by-side with modern English' version of the play the initially unfamiliar Elizabethan English wasn't a reason to despair. As for me, I can recommend the play to everybody who likes comedies which are not to superficial. Sir Toby and Malvolio were surely my favourite characters. They are just killingly funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at second sight","review":"My first thought after I heard that we were going to read a Shakespeare play was: Please don't! But soon after starting reading it and getting into it I had to change my mind. The play is very amusing and sharply written, it is entertaining and not old fashioned at all. The plot is a bit confusing at first but at least after Act Two everything clears up and you can really start just enjoying the book with all its action and (sometimes hidden) humorous situations and expressions. I don't know many other Shakespeare plays, but this is one I would absolutely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice...","review":"It's a really funny play, even if I didn't understand everything, but the second time I read it I could concentrate on the hidden jokes, because I already knew the plot.And there were many of them... Most impressed I was with Feste, the witty fool serving Lady Olivia, pretending to be a fool, but indeed being very intelligent.Feste was for me really the most important character even if he wasn't the main actor, it was him that included the intelligent jokes into the (sometimes not that exciting) story. The realtions(hips) are even rather confusing but nevertheless forseeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful confusions","review":"Somehow it was difficult to understand, especially the jokes. And without the jokes the value of the play is lost. But still i think it is wonderfully funny comedy, and it was very interesting to read also the old Shakespeare English from time to time, even if we did not really understand it all the time.I liked the wonderful confusions among the main characters. And how full of life the characters are,so human. And it is amazing that a woman plays the main charactre in that 15th century!I would recommend it to everybody, because it is interesting, funny and humourus. It is also a good play for a class because you can easily replay parts of the play, which is somehow very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but no empirical proof","review":"I am always reading books on parapsychology and looking for substantial empirical information.

While the book is written by a man who could be reasonably described as a minarchist, it's exceptionally useful to big-state left wing socialists, such as myself, who value understanding why this sort of thing has failed, and failed so badly, in the past.In addition to the educational value, it is an absolute page turner, filled with exciting historical moments that will be brand new to most American readers. I heartily recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated But Good","review":"This is a good book if you take it for what it is, which was hard even for me. I realize the point of the book is that grandiose social engineering doesn't work and that the lessons of the 20th century prove that, and yet I still thought that beating on the dead horse of the Soviet scientific state was rather pointless. The other stuff was really good.This is a good book for thoughtful people. Its lessons hold for much smaller social engineering and should be required reading for every politician, although they probably still wouldn't get it.The subtitle is \\"How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed\\". I think the lesson is that almost all state schemes to improve the human condition are going to fail and are going to fail for the same reason. The original American scheme was one of the few exceptions.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Points, too long","review":"This book argues that states create simple models in order to understand and regulate society. In many cases forcing society to conform to the model becomes an end in itself. The oversimplification implicit in these models causes various reform schemes to fail. Most of the book consists of presenting examples and variations on this theme.I saw in another review a criticism that the examples were not convincing, which I disagree with. The examples seem proper and on topic to me. They include modernist theories of urban design, the Russian revolution, and agricultural \\"reforms\\" in the Soviet Union and Tanzania. Another reviewer thought Scott is making the same argument as Hayek, but that's not really true though they're certainly more similar than the author is willing to admit.My major criticism of this book is that it's about 60-70% too long.

And to top it all off, more of Autechre's stunning artwork (ie. a booklet that is a blank white sheet). If you like electronica that is put through a blender, with the an indeterminate downbeat, with shards and fragments of instruments, with machines breaking down, this is pure heaven.

This is not a movie you'll be watching in order to reflect on the early works of some of acting's hot talents. This is a collection of terrible actors thrown into a low budget rushed out film that had to be released before Vanilla Ice's career tanked.

I rented it on a $.49 day at the local movie store, and I expected a truly terrible, yet entertaining movie. Although it was beyond that. Truly terrible is wayyyy too generous. In my 18 years I have never seen a worse movie. However, it was entertaining. It was hilarious, however, mostly because it was so stupid. Watch it because it's so bad that it's funny. It's like the movie \\"attack of the 50 foot woman\\". You watch it because it's a novelty, and not a good movie. So rent it if you dare. But if you buy it, I pity you. It's funny for about an hour, and then you wake up. I seriously think the writer/actors were on peyote, or maybe marijuana. Or maybe both.

Vanilla Ice's acting is one the worst in years and his dance moves are corny and poorly done. It has little-to-no plot. The visuals are confusing and really don't add anything to the story(or lack there of). The Villain is chessy and phoned in a mile away and the some goes for the romance in this film. I give this film a 0 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool as Ice","review":"I think the movie really shows that Vanilla Ice is just as good of an actor than anyone else.

The actors are bad, the plot is bad, the direction is bad. Then why am I giving this movie 4 stars? Because in spite of all its weaknesses, Cool as Ice is a cute, enjoyable flick with no other pretense than trying really hard to be a good star vehicle for Vanilla Ice, whose short-lived fame turned him into a laughingstock soon after. To this day, I still think there's something entertaining about that film, though I can't quite put my finger on it. Watching Cool as Ice is a wonderful trip down memory lane: everything that made the pop culture of the early '90's so peculiar can be found in it, from the outrageous, colourful outfits to the awesome dance/pop music. It may not be a good movie in terms of its cinematographical values, but as far as entertainment goes, I think there are a lot of films out there that are much worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely terrible....","review":"after a freinds recommendation I watched this film - without doubt it is the single, most terrible thing that has ever appeared on my television.

On the one hand, it goes really well with the action in the game, and in fact adds to the experience 3 fold while playing. On the other hand, while I do think that the music was done well, I don't think its worth listening to at your leisure. This is a straight action packed, shoot-em-up type game with very little pause in between. As such, there is a lot of action based music on here. As a matter a fact, probably all but 2 or 3 tracks are like that. While this is not exactly a bad thing, for those who are like myself, who prefer a little more variety in a score, this can get very tired very quickly. I just happened to have a friend who has it so i burned a copy for myself, and boy I'm glad I didn't pay for this cuz I'd have been mad. Then again, this is just my opinion.

They have a blast on them. The kids in the neighborhood love to come over and have races. The are fast, alot faster then the speed listed for my son and that is probably because he is younger then who it is meant for.

She was 7 when we got it for her. It is fast enough but not to fast that she can not handle it. Her friends all want to ride it when they come over to play. We did have to replace the batteries about 1 year after we purchased it, but I think you have to expect that with any battery powered item like this. It will only work on hard surfaces because of the small tire size, so we have also purchased the electric 4 wheeler that is great for in the yard. You just have to remember to plug them in after each use so the batteries last longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT FUN FOR OUR 4 KIDS","review":"We bought this for Christmas for our 8 year old son who loves races cars.

We have probably clocked 30+ hours on it, had 25 different drivers (grown men too) and we haven't had any problems. We are seriously considering buying another one this month. Easy set up, easy to run. We did have a friend who was 6 go on it, he is a smaller boy and he bounced around a bit when he drove. It goes as fast as it claims to until the end of the battery charge. However, the charge lasts a good long time.

I have a 10 year old, who had a pocket rocket (also by Razor) that after 3 years kind of lost it's coolness. Overall he really likes the go-kart, his hangups are the speed, more leg room, and turning control. He's around 5'1 and 76 pounds and is forced to sit butterfly style, which looks strange. I consider this a starter kart, since there isn't much to it. I really enjoy the red color and haven't noticed the battery life being a problem. I did read that in many reviews. I noticed in the instruction booklet it strongly advises to charge for 18 hours and the box says something like 12.. I went the full 18 and no complaints.

I call again, talk to another service rep., re-fax my documentation and after a week-and you're not going to believe this-they send me an electrical kit for for one of their scooters. So I call again. This time they are not receiving any audio on their customer service lines so I'm shouting into the phone (three times I tried) and they hang up on me after 10 seconds or so...each time!

My kids didn't get to ride it for even an hour before the belt broke. An extra belt was stored in the cart so we replaced the broken one, adjusted the tension and let the kids ride again. Again, no more than an hour later, the belt broke again. I called Razor, and they sent a replacement belt which took over an hour to put on because you have to take the back wheel and axel apart. Two hours after fixing it, it broke again. Called Razor again, sent replacement belt, again. Changed belt AGAIN, BROKE AGAIN! Called Razor a last time, and was told they would send one more belt but we would have to pay $5.00 for each belt after. Was told they could not take cart back.In my opinion, there was something wrong with the belt gear. So unless you have time and money to spend on this item, DON'T BUY IT!

She loves control and speed. She races the boys on the street on a slalom course and everyone has fun. We have modified the kart slightly. The turning radius was large when we received it. It could barely U-turn on narrow streets. I cut the steering locks off with a hacksaw and file. It now turns with less than a 5 foot radius and is more responsive. Brakes needed adjustment for her small hands. The battery seems ok. She said she'll never get tired of his toy, even after having it for a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razor Ground Force","review":"This is a very fun cart.It's a hit with all of the neighborhood kids.The only thing I would change is to improve breaking, it takes too much force, (hand strength,) to stop the vehicle effectively, even with the brake properly adjusted.

Not to mention all of the neighbors come out to play. The only thing i didnt like about this item was the fact that the brakes are on the steering wheel which makes it difficult to brake for my son. He has learned a way around it because if you let go of the gas trigger it will slow down pretty good not a complete stop so my son has learned to gauge the amount of room he will need before the car will stop completely. I really in all like this go kart better then the power wheels because you dont have to take the battery out to charge the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great time for kids","review":"We ordered the items on December 12th hoping for a Christmas delivery.

My son is 6 and rides this thing with no problem, its actually a little small for him. His legs are all cramped up. Makes me wonder if the other people here have very small children, or possibly I'm raising a giant. The brake is getting scraped up and bent all the time since it sits close to the ground, its a pain to bend back and fix. The entire bottom of the cart is scraped up, but it doesn't seem to affect the drivability.The battery life on this thing is amazing. My son drove this almost two miles on a single charge. Lots of fun, adults don't fit well on it though.So, here's an edit: Its now broken and refuses to move. Kinda sucks, I guess we'll see how the warranty works."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY this piece of junk!","review":"I received the Razor Ground Force electric go-kart on Friday.

I live in a major city but the closest one they could find is over 20 miles outside the city. I'm returning it instead -- and you wouldn't believe how difficult it is to get it back in the packaging.I would not recommend buying this piece of junk.

They have their friends over and have a blast. It goes just the right speed as to be safe. It is so low to the ground so it will not tip over. It does make wide turns. They always wear a helmet. Lots of fun. I would recommend this product especially if you were considering one of the plastic cars as I thought my son would grow out of it too fast and you get so much more for the money. Easy to store in the garage on hooks to keep it out of the way. Hope this helps.

Watching this \\"classic\\", I couldn't help but be floored by the incredibly poor job they did in the closing sets of the film. Any historic value the film might have had went down the toilet for me during those last scenes. If you are primarily interested in movies for their popcorn entertainment value, don't dispair, as you probably won't even notice this flaw. For me, it really ruined any value the film might have otherwise had.

The period photos are interesting, but the sequence is long and slow and contains no plot development.Long and slow pretty much covers the rest of the film too. Paul Newman is occasionally charming as Butch Cassidy, but Redford's Sundance is brutal and inaccessible, and Katharine Ross as the third side of the love triangle is like a character from one of those creepy old sex-ed videos you watched in grade school.There is no greatness in this movie, no matter what anyone says or how many people have seen it.

I thought it tried to be a bit too much or to have something for everyone (the bicycle scene went on a little long for my taste, for example).

It's spawned the Speghetti Western films, started the 'buddy-film' movement, and ditched the tradtional western music for a more contemporary one.BC&SK; is really the OG of the buddy films. Loosely based on historical facts, this is a tale of two friends out agianst the world. With the duo of then-superstar Paul Newman and up and coming sensation Robert Redford, the acting is superb. The writing is very good; just funny enough to be above a sitcom, but not so much that it's a comedy.A great deal of detail is brough, I love the sepia tone montage, desperado shoot-outs and the variety of settigns.

Paul Newman plays the dark humored Butch Cassidy and Robert Redford plays the grimmly straight Sundance Kid.Butch and Sundance were famous train robbers from the early 20th century on the edge of the last hey day of the truly wild west. The Union Pacific Railroad hired a select group of lawmen to hunt down and kill or capture. (Let's be honest Kill) The two Outlaws. The Outlaws were never heard from again. Some believe that they went to Bolivia and were killed by the Bolivian Army.This movie tracks the final days of Butch and Sundance. Uproariously funny. No matter how dark the sitiuation, these two outlaws manage to drop a darkly humorous line. This is the kind of movie that you and your friends will quote often. A tad violent for children, but on the upside no cussing. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Western and crowd-pleaser","review":"Butch and Sundance (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) are two affable outlaws who bear no malice toward anyone although they make their living by robbing trains and banks. They enjoy their freedom and their easy-going camaraderie until they make the mistake of stealing from the wrong man, a powerful millionaire who sets a skilled, relentless group of hired killers on their trail. From then on, death is always in the background, implacable and ever-present. They may escape for a time, but the end is unavoidable./Newman and Redford have great chemistry. Their timing and the way they play off each other is the main delight of this film. This movie helped redefine the modern Western and issued in a slew of buddy pictures. Watch it to see two Hollywood legends at their finest in a hugely entertaining film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Story, but not the best Western ever made","review":"It has been years since I saw this movie, but I recently ordered it on Netflix. Butch Cassiday and the Sundance Kid is an entertaining story, but I do not think it as great as many reviewers give it credit. The cast is strong with Paul Newman and Robert Redford, but the story drags along. A classic Western does not need as much dialogue as this one to tell the story. Maybe that is its appeal to some. While the interaction between Butch and Sundance is appealing, it gets tiring at times. Personally, I like more chase scenes and gun fights in Westerns. This movie is definitely worth seeing, just not a classic in my mind. I would pick something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"narrow screen","review":"I hate the narrow screen it takes away from the movie.

Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid, and Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy are wonderful together. In their first film together, they play the roles of outlaws who make a living robbing trains. After a relentless posse is formed to track them down, Butch and Sundance are constantly on the run eventually flushed to Bolivia where they attempt to continue their wistful ways. The cinematography is breathtaking at times although i thought the scenes from Bolivia were somewhat poor. This box-office hit won two oscars, one by David Goldman for his script writing and the other by Burt Bacarach and Hal David for the movies theme song \\"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\\". Katherine Ross also plays the part of Sundances beautiful girlfriend Etta Pace. If you are a Newman and Redford fan this is a must see! A bit of trivia: Newman first offered the part of Sundance to Jack Lemmon who declined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed.

Actually I have forgotten how the original DVD version looks liked, so I took it out for comparison, and yes, the Blu-ray version does look a little bit better, but overall the picture quality is still so dreadful, it seems you are watching the movie through a muddy window: colour is dull, contrast is low, and the image is blur.If the studio can't make an aged movie look decent, then they better don't release it in the high definition format, as there are so many other good, classic movies waiting to be re-mastered.The audio also improves a bit, but still don't expect much from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies of all time","review":"I love this movie, having watched it many times.

People behave \\"heroically\\", \\"honestly\\", \\"loyally\\" (Romanists) or \\"greedily\\", \\"dishonestly\\", \\"weakly\\" (non-Romanists).

Worse it leave you frustrated not knowing what was this movie all about since when the movie ended I was scratching my head thinking who was alive, who was dead and who got killed. They brought in a couple into the middle of the movie to tell the audience that she saw a girl under the kitchen really umblelievable.

The stepmother is suffering from some psychological disorder for which she is medicated, but it does not prevent the stepmother from acting out her occasional disturbed behaviors. There also seems to be something very bizarre happening in the old house in which they live. It appears as if the house is haunted by ghosts that are trying to reach the girls in their dreams and awakened state. Tale of Two Sisters has extraordinary camerawork that brings out the feelings of each scene as it is well balanced with meticulous detail as it enhances frightful elements in the story.

It can be very confusing as to what is the essence of a ghost or what is reality. Supposedly, with two sisters who go back to their father's house and are met by a step-mother, but one sister is already dead before we realize it. It is bloody, violent, and just plain weird.There is just way too much going on for anyone to grasp the storyline, determine who is who, what is what and why is why? To me, it is a mess of a film.

Several improbable plot devices (ESP and and the sperm donor dying of AIDS) made even this potentially gripping plot weak. But, what irritated me was the fragile mother who could not seem to be critical of her grossly philandering husband who has sex with her sister in the kitchen many times while she is upstairs. The mother does not even ask her sister to move out and barely reacts when she walks in on her husband and sister. She does say something to her husaband--his reply is that he is a \\"horny prick.\\" Oh, well! Everyone in the book knows her husband and sister are having sex and when one character asks her why she sticks with him her answer is that marriage includes even the tough times. The husband never makes any effort to reform, shows her no respect and it is left unresolved. I'd prefer a stronger heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"This is possibly the worst book I've ever read. I literally was skimming the pages 1/2 way through just to get to the conclusion. The female \\"heroine\\" is so weak kneed and pathetic it's amazing she can tie her shoelaces by herself not to mention track down her missing son! She kept complaining how everyone thought of and treated her as a crazy person and honey! if the loony bin fits...!I realize this was a first book attempt and heaven knows I don't have the talent for writing but if you read this book just go in with eyes wide open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infuriating \\"Heroine\\"","review":"This may be the most annoying book I've ever read. The main character, with whom the reader should at least sympathize, made my skin crawl. She represented every negative stereotype of women ever perpetrated. She is inept, ineffectual, irritating. She was so useless as a mother that I didn't care who kidnapped her son -- he'd be better off with anyone but her.Her \\"poor pitiful me\\" demeanor, her delight in her own incompetence, her willingness to tolerate emotional abuse from her husband (abuse that, frankly, I wanted to inflict on her myself) made this reader hope that she would be done away with before the book's end.I am amazed that a woman writer could and would create such a caricature of a character, much less hang a novel on an idiot like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"A child is kidnapped. The mother is desperate to get her son back. She comes across as a ninny to me. The author tries hard to convey the emotions of her characters instead of letting the story tell it.

Stay away from Steal Away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Careful What You Wish For...","review":"David Bernstein has done something that most lawyers have a difficult time doing - he wrote a short, accessible book for a general audience. Since I have seen law review articles that are nearly half as long as this book, that is no small feat.To me, the most important part of the book is Bernstein's consistent emphasis on how those arguing for laws that erode civil liberties might be shooting themselves in the foot. Any law that can be used to silence the speech of those whom you do not like can also be used to silence your speech. Whether this argument will prove compelling to those in favor of speech restrictions is a matter I will leave up to the reader. I will note, however, that in general, those in favor of using government to achieve their personal goals tend to believe that the political winds will always blow in their favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end....","review":"This is the final book in the \\"Dark Tower\\" series.

The first books hooked me (pre accident) and the later books drug me along, hoping for Kings return to greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Light, White Heat","review":"The quest of Roland Deschain for The Dark Tower ultimately becomes a circular journey - with a twist - as the best conclusion may come from the mind of the Constant Reader, as King brings to an end a series that was published from 1982-2004.The illustrations by Michael Whelan are fabulous and oftentimes the best storyteller. At times very tedious, oftentimes frustrating, with few flurries of brilliance - and ties to such works as Hearts in Atlantis, From a Buick 8 and It - the parallel to the timeless journey of an everyman can be inferred, but falls short without a proper coda."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I'd never started.","review":"Other (negative) reviews seem to sum up my opinion pretty well. Please don't start this series. If you start, please don't read the last book. It's really just bad. And it could have been so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"More philosophy than adventure in the final book","review":"What started as a fantasy adventure story ends with a literary and almost philosophical conclusion along the lines of Franz Kafka. Not that this book lacks for the ususal King suspense and gore.Reunited, the gunslingers take us to places unseen before. Though the final installment isn't one of my favorites, it's still mandatory reading if you've been following the story. My main fascination with the last three novels has been the question of Roland and Jake. Would Roland betray Jake once more? The answer is only implied, but like the final scene, the Crimson King and the mysterious Tower-- it's open to speculation.I've really enjoyed this epic and it's interesting to see it evolve into something unexpected. My sense is that some of these characters will show up in future King stories, though it seems to be the final story for Roland.Long days and pleasant nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Journey has no ended.","review":"This was a great book. Very long but it needed to be to tell the whole story. I am glad that my journey to the tower is now over, but I will definitely be reading this series again later in life.Overall this book good. The ending is a shocker and it makes you wonder what exactly happened through all 7 books! I've never really cried through a book before and this was a first. King makes you so connected and really care for these characters. I feel like I really knew Susannah by the time I was finished with this book. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spin it again...","review":"Lots going on here folks...a must if you've come all this way. Started this the year my youngest was born and now he's on the path, too. (But is among those who prefer \\"TS\\" as the all time best.) Best line of the book...comes from Oy. Great illustrations, esp. the one of the ka-tet, and that of Roland and Jake-smoke'em if ya got 'em."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hile Stephen King","review":"First I would like to say I'm reviewing the history not just this book.This story is the best I have read so far, actually I cried in the last book, I never thought that I was going to cry because of a book, I never cry in movies.Stephen puts all his hearts in this story it is amazing How all his good books gather in this story with so much power.About the end I like the one that stephen makes in the end about Roland in the dark tower. Remenber Ka is a wheel. So I will read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love S.K.","review":"I work in a domestic abuse shelter and on my \\"off\\" time I enjoy reading books by Stephen King. This series of books are great. I love them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Books in One","review":"This book is long, and it feels more like two books. To avoid spoilers, despite the fact that it's been around for a while, I'll keep it vague. The first half is action packed and intense. Then stuff changes fast, and the second half has a very autumnal feel, and is very subdued. The climax to the series is in the first half of the book, with the second half being more of a retrospective deneoument than the culmination of several thousand pages of literature. This writer personally felt like the final confrontation was a bit of a cop-out, although the very ending was a nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Tower Series - So Much Promise - Nothing Delivered","review":"The series would have been better off if a ghost writer or collection of fans got together at a pub and wrote the last 3 books. Wolves of the Calla took me two years to read, I skimmed through Song of Susannah, and read the first 100 pages of Dark Tower VII.The worst part for me is that I loved the series and characters. By the time I got into VII, I could care less. Wish Susannah would get run over by another subway, Eddie would OD, Roland would blow his other hand off, and Oy would get gurt and die. Only Jake still held any interest.Do yourself a favor and read the spoilers here in the reviews. I skipped to the last chapter of the book and then still didn't care how it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ka...Ka Ka","review":"As far as I'm concerned, King should have stopped after the third book because that's when his great story really ended. This last book in the gunslinger series let me down in so many ways (and was so anti-climactic) I lost count. I will never read another word of Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Unfortunately to explain how lame this book was, I would also have to disclose some plot spoilers. So, I'll generalize as best that I can. First, most of the characters have their bit of the story end in an unsatisfactory manner. In particular, \\"the bad guys\\" who are often built up over hundreds, if not thousands, of pages are dealt with in an incredibly abrupt manner. Also, I felt like the book should have ended about half way through. At that point the story felt naturally over. After the half way point, I kept asking myself why is there still more?I doubt many people will read this review before reading the book, but if you do. don't bother. Just enjoy what you have read so far. After all Steven King gives similar advice at the end of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dark Tower, Book 7","review":"How disapointing after more than 20 years of reading to have it all end in this fashion, typical of Steven King. I was hoping he would give this story his best effort, but instead it seems he just wanted to be done with it. As a long time King fan, I hate to diss this book, but cannot give high marks for this one. Inserting himself into the story lost all credibility for me. I wish I had stopped reading the series at book 4 or 5 as my imagination created several ending senarios that were better than the actual."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative reviews are correct","review":"I liked this series quite a bit up until wolves of the callah. That book was ok, but was probably the last \\"good\\" book of the series. Song of Sussanah was just plain boring. The last book, the dark tower, was just pure, utter garbage. There were some good parts that kept my interest, but overall it was trash. The ending was ridiculous, and the killing off of all of Rolands companions made me loathe this book. I thought it was just me, that as I got older, I lost my taste and patience for kings style of writing, but looking at the reviews here, I know its not just me that feels this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Strange Journey Comes to an End.","review":"Stephen King's Dark Tower series is without a doubt his most eccentric piece of work. I have spent an extensive time reading the complete series and I have to say that in the end it was well worth it. I truly believe that a person has to be disturbed in order to put in writing some of the things found in this brilliant series. That's the one quality that in all probability makes Stephen King the most thriving writer of our era.This last book like all the previews ones is extremely creepy, depressing and bizarre; but in a very pleasant way. I know that a lot of people are going to be really annoyed at the ending, but if you have read the entire series you can comprehend that a conclusion like this was expected. I'm just relieved that Stephen King is still alive after his mishap, and that he was able to draw to a close what is arguably the most significant work of his writing career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah so so ending","review":"Yes, as the author one should enjoy the journey of a adventure not the ending. However, that doesn't mean you give a so-so ending. My heart, which had falling in love with these characters didn't move one way or the other. I neither hated it or loved it. I think Roland's purpose the thing that drove the reader curiosity was this carnal hunger to reach the Tower. Where he was sacrifice friends , family and his very soul. To ending doesn't equate, balance out this magna-tic need to reach the tower where even his ka-tet he would even sacrifice them. For all those sacrificed the ending doesn't give them any good meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I started reading the series 3 months ago, and have since not been able to put down any of the books. I read some of the reviews before every book (but not enough to spoil anything for me), and was starting to get nervous with some of the critisism I encountered. By the time I got to book 7, I was terrified it might suck. Fortunately, I was blown away with nothing but positive vibes for the ending.SPOILER ALERT!!!!!Part of me wishes I had never read Coda (then my ending would have been the Tower door slamming shut behind Roland-which in my opinion would have been sweet enough). But, one has to finsh what they start, and so I read on (after 4000 plus pages, I wasn't going to stop so close to the end). It's kind of what I expected. That is, a bit of a downer with a possible positive (the horn). But WTF, that's a King novel. The ending had to be dark. Remember folks, its a Dark Tower, not a White Tower."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Better Ending","review":"Spoilers ahoy!A better ending: Roland and the reader, now having journeyed across the years over thousands of pages, open the door at the top of the Tower and find: a pile of cruddy metafiction Stephen King novels to read again. Roland, horrified, blows the reader's brains out to spare us the thought and then eats his sandalwood gun. Just before he pulls the trigger, he mutters vaguely in the direction of the reader's corpse: \\"Stephen King is the real Crimson King.\\" Fin."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY","review":"So bad that I want to give this a ZERO star rating but the website only allows 1 star as the lowest. I have been a Stephen King fan for many years, but this book should be an embarrassment to him. And to be the finale of what was a great series makes it even worse. I plodded through it hoping it would redeem itself but it never did. Instead of reading this book in two weeks time like most of the other volumes, this one took me three MONTHS to force myself through it. What a waste and disappointment it was. I feel that SK copped out and also went to haywire with narcissism (perhaps a result of his accident?). If any of the earlier volumes in this series were written like this one, I never would have continued with the series. Sad. Utterly disappointing. This is going to make me shy away from any future writings he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"This last book in the DT series is a huge disappointment and an embarassment for King. In the afterword he as much as admits that the ending sucks and requests readers to not complain to him about it. I won't, since I got this book from the library as opposed to actually purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly sore and disappointed!","review":"After following the story of this ka-tet we've all come to know and love, King ends this saga in the most anti-climactic way ever. It's a cheap shot. Worse of all, several elements of the ending are inconsistent with given premises or rules, rather, in the book. Which makes the entire series much ado about nothing, unfortunately. Stephen King uses this book to do what most authors and movie writers know it is in poor taste to do...to make himself a character. The ending takes a cheap shot at the fans of Roland, and Stephen King does not apologize for it. A long, anti-climactic, and purposeless ending to an otherwise amazing series."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's best work","review":"To all of you complaining about the end, King gives you fair warning before the end of the last chapter; it's about the journey, not the destination. And he speaks true. What exactly DID you want at the end? The fate of the ka-tet is tragic and brilliant (even Mordred's story is tragic) and the ending was amazing, breathtaking. I literally could not stop once I started this book, finishing it in only a week. Seems a lot of long time Dark Tower readers simply didn't GET what King was doing from the beginning. Wolves of the Calla was a clear low point for this series, but in truth it's the ONLY low point.I can't recommend this book enough, please do yourself a favor and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disspointing and Detached","review":"This one has potential for some readers to enjoy. Un-emotional and cheap death for our friends we've been following for so long. And endng that is laughable at it's attempt to be epic. A cheap and unaproachable ending to a series with so much promise and so little follow through. Stop reading after book 4 and you will be more satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big let down","review":"I'm not going to waste your time, and not going to spoil the story, just in case you decide to buy this book. The ending is such a huge let down I literally just sat in my chair for nearly a half hour, contemplating how such an ending could have been avoided. I agree with many reviewers that King wanted out, and penned the last three books in a whirl wind struggle to be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a let down this last book was","review":"I wished someone would have stopped me from starting this gunslinger series, so that I would never feel this way. I could not even get though to the end of the book because I was so let down. It seemed that SK could not wait to get the story done with. A story that you could not help but be a part of. Indeed, I felt so drawn into the story that I felt all the emotions that a good writer like SK wants you to feel. So I felt part of the ka-tek. But what he did to this last book made me cry. All the waiting to be reunited with the family only to see them thrown aside like nothing but side thoughts instead of great characters is such a shame and should be a crime of some sort. That Sk got away with this and then had the nerve to say at the end don't write him any letters because he would not respond is the icing on the cake. I wish I could tell him this myself. I will not read anything by him for a long time because it will take a long time for me to forgive him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Drivel","review":"After being seduced by the hard edged writing of the first three and a half episodes of the Gunslinger series I was more or less compelled to follow it through and buy/read the rest. I feel like a complete idiot paying for way overpriced pap by a writer that just went through the motions in these directionless and practically incomprehensible final issues. While the first three were tightly written and published in paperback at reasonable prices the author chose to \\"package\\" the remaining books in hardback and loading them up with meandering plot lines leading to a conclusion that had no meaning to me. There was no reason for this other than to get the price up by adding \\"perceived\\" value. Honestly, I feel insulted and made a fool of but very glad that it's over. Roland deserved better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Mr. King,","review":"I don't know if you read these reviews. I suppose, if I were you, in a morbid mood, I couldn't stay away. If you do, I hope you see this one, because I have to say this - Thank you thank you thank you! Not because of this book, or the Dark Tower series as a whole, but for providing me, through your many books, many many hours of enjoyment. From your short stories to your novellas, your enormous novels to your miniseries, I've been thoroughly entertained, frightened at times, disquieted often, saddened and exhilirated. When you almost died, not only was I extremely concerned for your health, but I grieved for the stories I may not have gotten the chance to read. Thank you again for your strength and courage, and may you have many more years to enjoy with your family and friends.P.S. Thank you once more for the ending to this awesome series. I personally felt it was completely fitting and right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I have the entire series & this is the last book in the series.

The book arrived in decent time and in great condition. Satisfied customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW WTF?","review":"I don't read a lot of Stephen King, and after reading this series I may never again. Wow, I have no idea what happened. Its not like the ideas and concepts presented where over my head or anything, I understand what King was trying to do suspense wise. But he created a fascinating world(s) and then didn't explore or explain any of it. He made things so abstract that I found much of the suspense to be gone by Book 7.Congrats on making this far along in the series. I seriously thought about stopping after Wolves of the Calla. The series is very abstract, and Book 7 is almost as abstract and nonsensical as Book 1 except longer. Books 2-4 where entertaining and very much worth reading, I'm not sure what happened after that point though. I had to force myself to read book 7 if only because I had spent so much time reading the first 6 books, ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"King's Everest left unclimbed.","review":"The previous reviewers tackled all the plot weaknesses that I could imagine so I'll make this rather short. The thing is, if anyone is looking to buy book 7 chances are they read 1-6 and have to read 7 anyway. The series is the only thing I have ever liked by King. Well, that was true until the end.(final 3 books) The Dark Tower epic should have been King's crowning feet, his Everest. Mr. King not only didn't make it to the top, he only got about a quarter of the way there and decided that it would be too much work to finish the climb. The self-centered universe idea was not only the thoughts of an ego maniacal man, but thoughts of a weak mind. It would seem that King got an itch to finish the series and didn't have any answers so he jumped at his first thought. I really can still recommend the series just because the first 4 books were so good and you can't have a story without an ending.(no matter how bad)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad the tale is done.","review":"Old fan here. Slightly disappointed in the ending only because I thought the eternal hero/quest concept was a little too close to the idea in Matrix Reloaded, which hit theaters a few months before King finished his book.I agree with some of the other reviewers that the Artist character seemed like a cop out to dealing with the Crimson King.I would have thought the journey up the Tower, with all its levels, could have made a book in itself.I wish the editor HAD chopped more of Mr. King's funny language, because it got hokey after awhile.However, even with my minor dissatisfactions, I would not trade the time I spent reading these books. The story may not have turned out as I would have liked, but I'm not the author. We could criticize King for copping out at the end, as the King character copped out from his duty, but old fans should be happy that King decided to finish the tale at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"the only way it could end\\"???","review":"What a jackass.Let's put aside the agonising repetitions (hey, this worked with \\"redrum\\" and others as a plot device),without which the book could have been half as long...Let's ignore the lame deaths of much loved heroes AND hated villians..Let's try to blow off the almost unforgivable sin of writing yourself into one of your stories (I quit reading him when Clive Cussler did it)...And focus on the sheer arrogance of the phrase \\"the only way it could end\\".I'm sure as hell not wishing you hadn't survived, Steve, but don't think for a moment that your publishers wouldn't have farmed out the ending to someone else.Someone who might have done a better job.Get this one from your local library, folks. Don't let him earn a single red cent from it. He doesn't deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Decline...","review":"I got hooked on this story, and from the first book to the fifth I just couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of the next one. The last two were pale in comparison. I kept reading simply because I had to know how it ended, and now that I know...I feel Cheated.Mr King took a great story and drove it into the ground. Im glad its a chapter of my own life thats finally over....NEVER AGAIN"},{"rating":"1","title":"i tried to give this book zero stars...","review":"If the rating system would have allowed I would have done exactly that. Stephen King allowed his egomania to run too far amuck in this book. He attempts to be clever with prolific literary allusions, but only so he can put himself in the same light as truly great authors. I have to admit that I enjoyed these allusions in the beginning. In the end of the series they become over obvious forecastings of what is to happen next. I truly loved the first four books, and five and six are ok. Seven is simply the worst book I have ever read. It is the very first book I intentionally left unfinished, other to flip through and learn how every one dies, and of course what a hoax the tower it's self turns out to be.There are only about ten good pages in the book for every one-hundred. While those ten are often very good, the other ninety leave me disgusted.Stephen King has let a great series become a cheap amalgam of other's literary genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constipated Reader","review":"Wow. Have been waiting to post this review for a while now and am finally getting into Amazon so here goes...This was a crappy way to end the series and it should have ended with W&G.; Better to have not reached the Tower at all then to have reached it like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God For Spoilers","review":"After reading the first book of this series I became enthralled with anything, and everything, Dark Tower. Roland was my hero and I wanted to see good triumph over evil. Books 1-4 were the best, 5 and 6 kept me entertained, but I just couldn't make it beyond the third chapter of book 7. Thanks to all who included spoilers, although I never lost sleep after putting down book 7 prematurely.I think the series would have been best left incomplete, at least then we could all debate what would have happened and postulated how great it would have been. Instead we are left with the weaknesses of books 5 and 6 and the complete drivel that is book 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Basically, this series went downhill for me once Mr. King tossed himself into the story as a character. I hoped that, unlike Song of Susanna, that this wouldn't be a major part of The Dark Tower; that he got this out of his system with the 6th book. This hope is thrown in the garbage not only with the continued emphasis on the Stephen King character, but with the totally lame death of one of the most important characters in the book; a lame death directly related to King's presence as a character. It seems to me that time spent on the King character could have been spent developing Mordred beyond the nothingness that is his character, and involving the man who has been Rolands nemisis from the start instead of killing him off early and simply without Roland's involvement.I really didn't mind the ending and could put up with the other little things not so great about the book, but put those on top of the presence of the King character, and you simply have failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"You came so close","review":"As one who read the first three books (Gunfighter, Drawing of the Three, Wastelands) over twenty years ago, there was a period of time when I didn't know if the \\"quest\\" would ever end. Now I wish I would have left them on the train (Blaine the pain) and not gone any farther.Stephen King: You cheated us. You had it all in the palm of your hand, but your hands wet with sweat, and your soul needs a rest, your fooling yourself and you don't believe it.... You are killing your self and you don't believe it. (Thanks to pink floyd)What kind of ego lets you incorporate your own being into this thing? It was not about you, it was about Jake, Susan, Eddy, and the Gunfighter. Pretty hard to bring Oy into the new world wasn't it?If you want closure, do not read this book.

Crimson King Spider shirts for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King's worst book.","review":"This installment in the excellent Dark Tower epic sucks the worst.

Avoid this stinking crap and read the excellent books 1-4."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest literary disappointment","review":"I loved the first four books of this series. Then the part about Father Callahan was boring in the fifth, but it was basically good until Callahan learned he was fictional. King's ego is so enormous he made himself a god-like character! Then I struggled through the sixth book as it was mainly boring, and I can't even finish this one. I got to page 660 or so and it's just boring without Eddie and Jake, who should've made it to the end!King should definitely 'say sorry' for this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch make it stop","review":"People expect better from Steven King, (but I guess not anymore.) I would not recommend this series to anyone. If you are here and agree than make a review for \\"The Gunslinger\\" where we may prevent what happened to us, from happening to others. I can only say I am glad the series was complete and I never had to wait for the next book. By the time folks get to the second half of the series it is too late. If this is the standard the author wants to be judged by so be it. Personally I think he should have let it go until such time as he really had idea's for it. If he was going to cop out he should have at least given us better closure."},{"rating":"2","title":"It had to end sometime.","review":"Both hurrying to get to the end and wanting the series to continue further is a typical reaction to any good series and with the Dark Tower it is no different.

If you understand completely what Stephen King was trying to do with this series then you will like this last installment. Actually, you will LOVE it. I personally thought the ending was wonderful and totally unexpected. It just makes me sad that now I no longer will be with Roland and the others. It was a good long run and I could not be more satisfied.

It truly is the right ending. \\"The only ending, in fact\\".My main complaint, along with so many others, was the death of Flag. But maybe Roland will catch him and dispose of him himself on his next attempt, or the next, or the next, or the next.Though the answer may forever be hidden, this is what keeps the story alive.

I enjoyed the journey to the Dark Tower, all the books had moments of pure delight and in the end the characters were what I enjoyed most. However, the ending was so incredibly lame that I still can't believe that anyone could be satified by it. Are they just trying to justify anything KING does by saying \\"it's the perfect ending\\", when in reality it's not an ending at all? You know things are bad when KING himself has an Author's note that basically states that the ending is garbage and if you don't like it then tough.

I truly believe the real Stephen King walked through a door somewhere and a Femelo wrote this as well as Wolves and Susannah. An absolute waste of time. In this world, Mid-world, End-world and every world. Ultimately, everything that meant so much throughout the volumes (the Rose, the Beams, the Tower itself) mean nothing at the end - which is really no end at all.

I read books 5 and 6 and was like, \\"uh\\".... and continued to read for the sheer fact that I THOUGHT they would get better. Book 7, just because i thought, yes, let me see my beloved ka-tet make it to the tower. All for naught, as no one made it except Roland, and did he die a happy man knowing he'd succeeded?

I agree with the other serious King fans and DT fans, that after reading and waiting for then next book to come out wanting to know what happens next(im 35). I was very dissappointed how the book ended. I was like \\"WHAT....THATS IT?\\" It was almost like King didnt even try to put a good ending. It was subpar at best. As a big King fan i enjoy most of his books. The last 3 DT books were not very good. It was almost like he wasnt really trying to write good, just trying to hurry and put something out there. Id say for the series as a whole i enjoyed it, but King could have done way better with the last 3 books esp. the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all messed up...","review":"Spoilers alert.

After plowing through 1000s of pages of this series, the reader learns in Book 7 the disappointing answer. ka-ka!I think what disturbed me most is how badly Detta/Odetta the major female character was treated. Let's see if I can remember the worst of the insults... both legs amputated, schizophrenic, victim of racism, raped (by a demon, no less!), gives birth (sorta) to a spider monster, boyfriend killed...

If you haven't, more's the pity. I think that, from previous comments, many people may be missing a key point. Some of the less satisifying plot resolutions make sense as they are written since the epic quest is to save a world gone 'hinky'. Wierd things happen in a wierd world, and when the world accelerates, so does the wierdness. All in all, I was thrilled with the book,and felt it fit nicely at the end of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Tower VIII: The Wasted Opportunity","review":"I'll keep this brief. King could have made this series worth something. He could have made a profound statement about the writer as God, about the reality of characters--how they live in our minds, how a character that lives in the writer's mind can journey on within the imagination of his readers. Instead, after an actually very good nine-tenths of the book, he gives us an anti-climatic showdown outside the Dark Tower, and a final resolution inside the Tower that is... horribly, horribly mundane and unoriginal.Oh, but I guess that's not King's fault--after all, he's just a CONDUIT for the story, right?Thanks, Stephen, for passing the buck. I still love \\"The Gunslinger\\", and \\"Wizard & Glass\\" was a beautiful trip. But the ambition and promise of the first books is dead. And in my mind, the Tower falls--flat on its face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commola Come Come - Good Marketing is a Chum!","review":"After six books that built up to this final volume, which should be a great climax, we get. . . this?I'm extremely disappointed.

Quite the crafty one King most certainly is, and a master of the mind.It has 3 endings depending on how you want to immortalize the characters and events, and King highlights stopping points between each for those who wish to remember series in different aspects. Furthering past the first ending isn't required, but if you must know every little detail to Roland's journey come happy times or horrific ones, you'll read them all :)**MILD SPOLIER BELOW*********The third ending reminds me much of a great epic noir tale... with a very Donnie darko/Shutter Island/Max Payne/Castlevania: Lord of Shadow\\"-esque completion. Definetely a shocker, but adds up perfectly and should end no other way than this way. Classic King!*******end spoiler"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !","review":"This is one of the best books of the Dark Tower.

I enjoyed alot of King's work(The Stand,IT,Everything's Eventual,etc.)but the warnings are true!I was shocked when Eddie was killed off, then I told my self \\"Mabe King just wanted to kill him so he could make the last half of the book more serous,because Eddie was liked the comdy relef in the series\\".But(yet again)just when I am finally getting used to not having Eddie around, King kills off Jake! And I cryed for poor Oy, I could feel how sad he was. Then the I stoped reading and got on the computer and wrote my own ending, it is almost 300 pages long and it starts right before Eddie is shot in the head(In my version Eddie dosent get killed)it is called 'Dark Tower 8 The Tet dosent end so badly'(I don't think Badly is even a word, O well King made up alot of words in his story)But(again)the book kept me reading to the end so I guess its not that bad. So long readers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Dissapointment","review":"As a huge fan of the Dark Tower series my expectations may have been a little high but I was dumbfounded with how weak this final novel was. The plot was weak and few of the characters stayed true to what they were portrayed to be in the first 6 installments. The nearly invincible anti-christ is easily killed by a baby and the king of all that is evil turns out to be a crazy old man with a box of hand grenades! Rolands faithful sidekick abandons him just before the so called climax but a character he met just days before stays with him! I didn't mind what was found at the top of the Tower but would have loved to have seen some resolution to the many loose ends - like who was Walter and why did he seek the Tower ect. If you loved the first six books, save yourself the aggrivation and don't read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King leaves one for the toilet.","review":"This was undeniably the worst book of all the Dark Tower series.

I was hooked I read the entire DT series straight through and thoroughly enjoyed it. However, by the end of The Dark Tower I was ready for it to be over. I liked the final sentence and the ending of the book but I felt like the last few chapters were very bland and predictable. It seemed to me when reading the last few chapters that King was as tired of writing the story as I was of reading it and just wrote down something to end it. It was a little disappointing, as I found the rest of the series very well thought out and well written. Some readers do not like the ultimate ending of the series but I like the way sai King decided to end the tale, it gives the reader, and Roland, a glimmer of hope. All in all I loved the DT series and I even liked book seven, but after reading 4000+ pages straight through, I was a little disappointed with the last few chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spoilers","review":"It's not like Mr. King didn't warn us, it's all part of the great wheel. Rolands Tower is the snake that eats itself and the number of roses to be saved are infinite.I liked that all of us constant readers got a warning, before continuing on, but lets face it all of us gunslinger fans, are tower junkies just like Roland. Stop puhhhleeeze.So, we take the story teller's hand and there's no happy ending back to hobbiton here. Just the yawning abyss of infinity swallowing us down for another turn of the wheel.And the more you mull the ending over the more horrible it becomes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"You know - I generally work hard for my money. So you can imagine how I felt after shelling out on this latest King book, and discovering that it was a huge con trick. This book appears to have been written by someone who has not worked hard to deliver a special piece of work to us. It is really boring and the whole thing is more like reading a shopping list.I'm going to be bold and say that it's time some of these so called \\"big Names' stopped trading on past glory and produced something original. Along with this book I purchased a relatively unknown book called 'The Seed' by an English writer called Davide De Angelis. Now this is all about something new and dangerous - check work like this out and see if writers like King can keep up. Time to move over. Sorry as I have enjoyed so much of King's work, but there is no excuse for a book like this AND it being a best seller. It's all hype. ZERO STARS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outraged!","review":"I can't believe I actually wasted so many hours involved with this crapola! It's a classic shaggy dog story.Steven King is not a good writer at all; he's a brilliant story teller who talked himself into a corner on this one. We should have known what to expect, because King routinely has let-down endings. Nevertheless, I feel cheated.Update: I gritted my teeth and re-read 'The Gunslinger\\" just this year (2010).

If you think about how big the Dark Tower books are a really bad ending can make it seem like a huge waste of time.I won't go so far as to say it was really bad but if I knew how it was going to end I wouldn't have read it.The main problem with the book was that there was no real action in the book from 50% forward none from 75-95. Nothing really gets tied up. It seems as thought there should be a book VIII that is the real ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh oh","review":"Somehow I'm in the parrallel universe where the Dark Tower VII is lousy. It was all going pretty well. That there was a diminishing quality throughout the books we mostly agree. The starkly drawn briskly paced first book gave way to mass quantities of not unwelcome characterization and intrigue. Though still a little too charmed by his own earthy approach to classic fiction, King I felt had what it took to take me to the Godhead. Unfortunately no more of that sweet tasting sample found at the end of no. 1 was to be found (for me anyways) at this end.But maybe my luck will change, and I'll one day be able to see the rich spiritual allegorical mythological significance of this volume and it will all be revealed to have been great storytelling all along. Then maybe I'll take another look at the Matrix trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end","review":"I have been waiting to read the end of the Dark Tower series for a long time which has finally arrived!

There were some dissapointments, but they were made up for (when you read them you will find out). I actually almost shed some tears ate one point (you should be able to figure this ut too). All in all the book was very very good...not as good at the drawing of the three or the waste lands, but it was better then the last 2, thats for sure. There is no point in me writing a summation of the book, since if you are reading this you most likely will but it anyway cause you read the last 6 books and why stop now? One word of advise...when he tells you stop stop reading the book, take that as the true ending and what follows as something to just wrap up the story for those who need an ending. Remember, ka is a wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"and the whole thing starts again.......","review":"i really loved the first 4 books in this series and after having waited so long for the rest of them i was really hoping for more. numbers 5 & 6 were mediocre if even that and while this last book was pretty good the ending made me feel as if i had wasted all this time reading these books.i think stephen king took the easy way out and just could not think of an ending to the book. i would have rather waited longer for the book than to have it now and be so completely unsatisfied by the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent set of books!!","review":"The book was excellently written (as are most of Stephen Kings books). It was the first time I've actually cried reading a Stephen King book. So many died. I've been reading this series for 20 years & haved gotten very wrapped up with the characters and attached to others. The last 3 books I couldn't read fast enough. I was disgusted with the ending....after all these years, but I figured it was typical Stephen King to leave you hanging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appropriate Ending for a Long Journey","review":"It has been a long journey for readers of the Gunslinger series.

The Gunslinger is a semi-angelic character physically glowing (somewhere in book 6?) with Good, who finds himself turned away at the Gate. It's as though Goodness lied to Roland, which simply doesn't happen. Goodness doesn't lie; otherwise, it wouldn't be Good.So that's my issue with the book and the entire second half of the Gunslinger series: It lied. If you need more lies in your life then by all means, finish the series. As for me, I get my fill on the evening news."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop, but...","review":"I've long been a fan of this series. I read the first three as a teen and then (as all teen's) couldn't believe I'd actually have to wait for the rest. But, thank you Mr. King, for finishing. I'm about half way through the book, and WOW. Ok, this is different, than most of his books, and I've always thought it was one of the best story lines of all time. I'm not sure I'm gonna love the way it ends, but the story, and road (for the ka-tet) has been so long, in a way, I'm happy to see it end either way. Which is pretty much exactly wha Sai King is looking for!If you didn't read the first 6 Don't read this one, go back, start with gunslinger and revel that you won't to wait more than a decade for the rest of the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless anti-climax","review":"If you choose the start at the beginning and read \\"The Gunslinger\\" you are in for a great read through an entertaining and interesting book. The only problem is, you are going to get suckered into six more books, the last 3 being terrible. But by that time you will be clutching on to the joy of the first books so hard you will be blinded to the FACT that the series winds down to a pointless anti-climax. Ka is a wheel, and the ending makes sense (I KNEW what would happen even before I read the book - ask my wife!). The rest is a series of introductions and disposals of 1-sided characters and pointless action. NOT IMPRESSED. This book (and the preceeding 2 BORING ones) is a letdown for the series. But, if you are already reading the series, you have no choice but to see it through. May you reach the clearing at the end of the path and GIVE THIS BOOK ONE STAR WHEN YOU GET THERE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!","review":"I enjoyed the first 3 or 4 books, down hill from there. Very annoying to have to flip past the first part of the book or the last part (6% of one book, however many pages on a kindle that was I don't know). I want to read the story not read about King talk about himself, his Tabby, etc. Grace the back cover w/a short humble bio and be satisfied with that, I will be. I bought the books to read a good story and be entertained, if I was interested in the authors life story I'd be buying auto biographies or biographies, not fiction! Inserting himself into the story? annoying. I am going to have to go back now and re-read the Stand or It to remind myself why I originally liked his books and reacquaint myself with good stories. I have ALL of his books but the further I get into this series the more I dislike it!

I thought I would read one a month. I was wrong...I couldn't read fast enough. I finished all seven in under 2 months. I was hooked..I laughed, I cried and I shivered in the dark. This book had the penultimate ending.I have not re-read any books since the Tolkien series and The Stand.

I saw stuff momma never told me about."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End","review":"I, like many others, followed this 'magnum opus' from word one with a devotion I've never given to any other literary work. I craved an ending befitting the beginning but, as the end drew nearer, realized that it just wasn't to be. The tailspin started at the end of The Wolves and it just couldn't be pulled out from there.

And sadly even my low expectations weren't met. Apparently, Mr. King threw in the towel a long time ago for this series.It was bad enough to cannibalize his own stories for lack of original ideas, but the way in which he wrote himself into this series as a demigod was beyond belief. As other reviewers have written, his foreshadowing in this book. was not in the least bit subtle.I don't reccomend this book to anybody but diehard fans of this series that have to know how it ended. Even then, it would probably be a good idea to borrow somebody else's copy and read the final chapter to spare yourself the agony that is this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mouthwash anyone?","review":"Most of the reviews I have read have been detailed enoughin their intensity.

The way Jake died was the only good part of the book. Susannah's personality shifted so radically, and so suddenly that it was completely out of character. After 6 books, their story, struggle, saving their lives she reacts so strangely? If so, what does that say about her? Plus, the Tet Corp near the UN, etc...YUK!I am glad that it ended the way it did...maybe King will try to rewrite this and actually put some time into it.Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disappointment","review":"The first 3 books were just great but I didn't like 4, 5 and 6 so much.

All of the complaints so many people have about it being rushed, and being a let down in the end, are understated at best. King basically seems to have just been trying to get it all over with in this one, so he rushed through the story, superficially dropping off the supporting characters like Eddie, while at the same time bringing in the artist kid like an easy dab of plot line superglue. This is very sad and disgraceful, considering that this is Kings supposedly greatest life's work, and the first four books were very good -Why did he have to go and ruin it on some crash course and shoddy spree to the finish line? Overall, a major downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I'm not going into details here, save to say the continuous loop idea is so much malarky.The concept causes so many logical problems it doesn't make any sense.To go 99.999% of the way be left with that... well...

Everything has already been said, but I want to reiterate the whole notion of King just finishing this thing for the sake of finishing it. I was very disappointed to lose Eddie in some freak accident. He is my favorite character, and to die that way gave me the sourest taste in my mouth. How awful to do that to one of the main characters! And to think, the one character that Roland faces the end with is some newbie we really don't give a crap about. And his 'face-off' with the Crimson King...come on! What face-off? Danville freaking _drew_ the King away. The end. Gawd.The ending, however, was fitting, and I couldn't think of another way to do it. Everything else, though, sucked.

The characters which were so well crafted and defined are almost treated as tired loose ends which must be dealt with. King still retains his style of writing throughout book seven, but his handling of plot seems to have been stinted. I had some reserve when King wrote himself into the series and fear that it was well founded.The focus on the series is Rolands quest for the tower, a journey which many readers expected him to have a final confrontaion with his enemies, yet the ones we are treated to I found lacking. What should have been Kings masterpiece tying into the connecting threads of tower related books to form the tapestry of the series, ends up frayed and tattered."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor end to a declining series","review":"There are already many reviews that do a good job of describing most of the main problems with the book. However, some points need clarifying. First of all, the ending would be OK (the writer gets to end the book however they want), except for the fact that it doesn't make sense according to all of the rules of time-travel that the characters have discovered during the previous 2 books. Secondly, the ending of Mordred would have been much more clever and ironic if he had simply died of food-poisoning. The reviews are pretty on-the-mark with the other villian's deaths, though: they are just not very believable. And again, the characters' sudden obsession with slang speech is pretty annoying. Even more annoying is when reviewers use it. While better than Wolves of the Calla or Song of Susannah, this book is still does not nearly meet the promise of the first 4 books of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ending","review":"I really liked the way King ended the Dark Tower Series. except for the fact that he gave us a cliffhanger at the end with Roland starting in the desert again, but now hes got that horn and I really want to know how that changes his story, but we'll probably never find out unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"an epic journey","review":"I thought this was a great book.

I'm just sad that it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it ...","review":"Especially the part when Roland sings the names of all the people who helped (and died) so he could reach the Tower. If this series could be made into a movie or movies (which I doubt) that would be one of the best moments in cinema ever, it gave me goosebumps and haunted me (that night I dreamed of the Tower and what could be inside - I hadn't read the Coda yet). The ending is cruel, but I think it worked as a metaphor for the cleansing of one's karma (ka - karma?). I also hoped that Roland could get his much deserved rest when he reached the Tower, but maybe his whole quest perfected him somehow, and now he will make the right choices through his journey, so he can be worthy of entering the White and be at ease at last... Just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"wholly Awesome!","review":"This, the final chapter of the dark tower series as well as the beginning it seems. Until I considered all the implications of the ending I thought it sucked and left a lot of questions unanswered and a lot of territory uncovered....but... as usual, leave it to master tale-teller Steven King to make the unpalatable, totally pleasing and believable. I had eagerly awaited this book if for nothing else, than to see what was at the top of that darned tower and when I seen it i was disappointed and equally pleased at the same time...there are worlds other than this, and so it would seem that there is hope, after all, that the gunslinger, Roland Deschain, may not be damned after all... or maybe is damned and this is his hell... who knows.. I think King did an excellent job in writing one of the best narratives I have ever read, and allowed readers to ponder the many messages it feeds to us"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a Let Down","review":"I was just plain disappointed in the last Dark Tower book. I didn't mind author King being a character, that seemed rather clever, but the cavalier way in which the members of the ka-tet were disposed of, not to mention the removal of the various villians, seemed anti-climatic and unimaginative. Say sorry, sai King, but it was a Let Down. Poor Oye, what a way to go. And by the way, I don't get why Roland was being punished with eternal wandering -- yeah, he acted badly at times, I suppose, but he did save the universe, didn't he? You have to break some eggs to make a super hero omelet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sai King, please shoot thyself in the head","review":"I started to write a full review and then realized that the answer as to whether or not you want to read this book can be summed up in two sentences: If you love and live by this series (as I have for twelve years) do not read this final volume; it will only break your heart. King, you should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"looping at the wrong point","review":"I liked the series very much, until have read the ending.The idea about looping is wonderful and absolutely correct.However, the looping point returns Roland to the point where he is chasing dark man, while it should return him to the point where he could save his real Rose: Susan Delgado.She was that Rose, which Roland had lost.That was the turning point in Roland's sad fate, and only this could really stop his perpetual quest."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark towers book 7","review":"It takes a while to read and you must read the other books first but I would say it was a great series.

It's most definitely a worthy finish to the series. If you're reading this then the chances are you've already read the other books in the set but, if not, I urge you to go and read those first, and get hold of any missing ones you may have skipped over.A long series like this is a trial as much for the reader as it is for the characters in the story and, I suspect, as much of a trial for Mr King himself over the years. There is always a feeling of loss at the end of a series, when you realize there may be no more stories about your favourite characters, but there is also relief that it is, at last, over.As the saying goes \\"All good things must come to an end.\\"Bravo Mr King. It's a series destined to go down as one of the greats of modern fantasy.

Haven't we been through five of the first six books with Susannah with no feet? It is a big book and a big story, but I just can't seem to get past the fact that neither King, nor his editors, nor his publisher noticed that there is a main character jumping to feet she does not have."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"too many king fanbois giving high marksI agree with all the 1 and 2 star reviewsThe last 3 books were misstep, after misstep, after misstepTBH- I was always more of a Robert McCammon fan myselfswan song is superior in every way to the standand McCammon's multi volume epic Mathew Corbert series is so friggen solid, makes the DT series look like a jokeKing should be ashamed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Steve didn't learn from his Ah Ha moment in the previous offering...","review":"I'm really don't like self-aggrandizement.

I read the series, and they didn't just get worse after the third one, it just turned to garbage. In this last one, I couldn't get past Stephen King writing himself so heavily into the story. And this gunslinger story started out so good. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I bought and read this when it first came out in print. It is the perfect climax to one of the most amazing series I have ever read. Top notch. Will always be one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ka is a Wheel","review":"The last installment of this epic series takes us to the colossus that we've all known waits only for Roland. King communicates the deja vu landscape well throughout the entire series, but it is never better than it is in this novel. In this dreamlike world we all expect to find something special at its conclusion. While the ending is going to be controversial, I thought it was a perfect fit for King's deja vu world...truly genious.While some of the pinacle showdowns proved weak (nothing new for this series), Roland's ultimate showdown with himself was well worth waiting for. King also follows book 6 with an insight into himself as he stars in his own novel. King takes it to the line, but backs off enough to make his presence plausable and arguably necessary.Five stars & quite a capper on one amazing life's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not with a bang, but a whimper","review":"Like the universe about which he writes, Steven King's series is falling apart. I've read all seven books, and the series effectively dies after about the third. Steven King says he's retired, and I'm afraid it's past time. He's just mimicing himself, desperately trying to tie up all the BS loose ends he wrote into all his other works, and it just doesn't work. His earlier works were great, but for the last decade it's been junk, and I'm really sorry I was dumb enough to fall for it and spend the better part of $100 on the last three of this series. I won't buy any more his stuff, and I advise no one else to either."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the Journey that Makes it All Worthwhile!","review":"This has been a wonderful series.1-I love how Stephen King has taken almost every convention ofscience fiction and fantasy writing and managed to wedge theminto one series. Nicely done.2-I love how he picks on himself as a person, a write, acreator and really explores those themes especially strongin this final book. For anyone who has felt the creativeimpulse think about that while you are reading.3-I hate that so many people plunged and hung onto the issuesw/ the ending. It really was the only way because it is thejourney of these books that have made it worthwhile. Wouldyou really want finality?Strongly recommend this series. I think this book is much stronger than the last one which was mostly tying up loose ends. This felt more like the Gunslinger and Wizards and Glass which had more depth to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"King just wanted to end it.","review":"I don't really blame him. He was probably being pestered mercilessly to put out book 7 in the series. But if he was going to put out something this bad, I'd have rather just always wondered how it all turned out. King states at the end that it was \\"the only ending.\\" Actually, I could think of several that would have been much more interesting. That said, if you've read the six really great previous books in the series, you're not going to stop before you've read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"I really enjoyed the first 4 books of this series. As a matter of a fact, I think Wizard and Glass and The Drawing of the Three are both absolutely phemononal. I even enjoyed a lot of Wolves of the Calla (although the dialouge was really annoying after a while).That being said, the series really took a turn with the 6th book when Mr. King seemed to run out ideas. It's back and forth from this world to that from then on and the incorporation of himself as a character (and somewhat of a God I might add) is ridiculous. I heard him say a few years ago that after he really was hit by a car that people were more worried he would die and never finish the Dark Tower series. I guess that's where he got the idea of having Jake save him from the car but I though it was a terrible twist.I can only hope that George R.R. Martin doesn't screw up his Song of Ice and Fire series like Stephen King did The Dark Tower and Robert Jordan did The Wheel of Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, Book 7)","review":"I've followed \\"The Tower\\" series from the first book, avidly! So imagine how I felt, when all seven books finally lead to Roland accomplishing his Dark Tower goal, only to have hime climb the stairs and blow a stupid horn! We are offered nothing else but lamely encouraged imagination usage thereafter, with the exception of Mr. King's afterword labeled \\"FOUND (Coda)\\" where he basically gives us an aggarantly explained ATTEMPTED CONSOLATION AS TO WHY HE ENDED THE BOOK THIS WAY. To add insult to injury, he does lead us to Suzanna after she traveled through the unfound door....but again, leaves us with nothing more than a \\"wishy-washy\\" scenario of her future.One last thought, if Mr. King cannot find his way to writing with his usual creativity and zeal sober, that may I suggest that he retire with nothing further? I frankly would have preferred he stopped while he was ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"my personal opinion on the Dark Tower 7","review":"I was totaly disapointed with the ending in this series of books. I felt let down, and like I had waisted my time and money on the entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I don't write long reviews and I am not a regular Stephen King fan only having read two books outside the Dark Tower series. I hated how he seemed to be trying to explain to his readers who had been long time fans why he hadn't given them the books they wanted to read. Does he really believe that God or \\"Ka\\" gives him the ability to write and dictates when he can or can't? That was absurd. Secondly, stay out of the book. I wasn't reading these books to find out a biography of your life and divine purpose in creating this story. I don't really care about the ending being a loop and I actually wish the other 4 didn't get to end up fat'n'happy together. I just wish King would stay out of his story. It seemed like he just didn't have a way to explain the book so he wrote himself in- really cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened????","review":"The Dark Tower series is 7 book marathon, and the runner(writer) seemed to run out of gas after Wizard & Glass (book #4). After reading the book, I get the idea that \\"Sai\\" King has rushed another Dark Tower book. Books 5,6,and 7 all just seemed weak compared to the earlier Dark Tower writings. Stephen King dropped the ball, and he knows it. In this book he even takes time to make excuses, saying that he is sorry and that he did not control where the store went. Mr. King did not let the Dark Tower reader down, it was \\"ka\\" or maybe even the Dark Tower itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale Spices","review":"All of the spices that I purchased from this company were stale and old.

Frommer's guidebooks are usually pretty dependable, but this one is the exception. Planning to go to Malaysia, I purchased the book and it has only a brief (about 100 pages) on the entire country of Malaysia. Have to buy another book. The Singapore section seems ok for someone going there.Frommer was very deceptive. If it were an automobile, they would have to issue a recall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mayalsia? Look Elsewhere!","review":"Although the title of this book would make one think that both the CITY-STATE of Singapore & the COUNTRY of Malaysia would receive coverage equal to their size, think again. Two-thirds of the book is devoted to tiny Singapore and the rest to huge (in comparison) Malaysia. I guess it's not so surprising when you learn that the author lives in Singapore and is married to a Singaporian! Frommer should be ashamed of their title. It should more accurately be \\"Singapore with a Section on Malaysia\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time","review":"This book should not EVEN include Malaysia. Way over half the book is about Singapore. It barely mentions any destination in Malasia besides KL. The few large cities it does mention, little to no relavent travel info is covered by this book. Oh, maybe if you're a museum nut! That's not my kind of travel. The hotel references are made from a rich elitest snob point of view.

It has amazing music, challenging and unique stages, and the best controls of any Castlevania game to date.

It did not hold power as long as the original Nikon battery, but it is much cheaper. However, I soon found that it began to lose power *very* quickly.

For individual stock picks, how to tell from a chart which way the price is going, it is completely useless. Given that Technical Analysis, in most investors' minds, involves chart reading, and understanding indicators (RSI etc), this book is misleadingly labelled - there is one (short) section with a few OHLC diagrams, not very useful at that. There are many books that cover the topic, this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, I understand!","review":"This book really explained how technical indicators work.

But I feel that when they made this, they developed a sort of timeless feel that resonates through later listens. Upon first hearing it I wasn't that impressed, I thought this needs to be more spur of the moment, but then slowly and surely I realized it was great in a different way.

Everyone else played their parts with varying degrees of success. The idea of the Vatican bailing out a starving nation (China) was ludicrous as Quinn (as the pope) reluctantly announced at the end of the movie.

Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoes of the fisherman","review":"The \\"Shoes of the Fisherman\\" is not only a very dramatic film but a very educational one as well. The movie depicts the sequence of events leading up to the election of a pope. Many catholics and non-catholics alike do not know the procedurs envolved in electing a pope.

I highly recommend this movie to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful movie on the purpose of the church","review":"This movie will have you questioning the real reason the church exists, not only the Catholic church, which is the subject of the movie, but all churches.

If there is any criticism to be made it is that some of the longer letters are completed in the appendix,making for some clumsy back-and-forth thumbing.

I may just buy him a copy of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Informative","review":"This book is one of a kind. It takes a lot of skill to work in fact and fiction, and that's just what this author has done. This is perfect for both the fiction and non-fiction enthusiast. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced, excellent read","review":"I really loved this book especally after reading David Jacobs \\"The Threat\\" which although excellent reading held out no hope for abductees but to accept and learn to live with what is happening to them.The Facade deals with what is actually going on and why. Another worthwhile read though not fiction is Gary Bates \\"Alien Intrusion\\" which comes to the same conclusions that we are dealing with a very real problem but one of an interdimensional nature rather than extraterrestrial.For anyone who has been abducted and didn't enjoy the experience, read and test for yourself what these authors are saying if you want some real hope instead of the false hope held out by these so called \\"aliens\\" who lie constantly and contradict themselves. I know what I'm talking about because I was an enthusiastic new ager but with the great good fortune of having a mother who prayed for me -listen to these people -the truth will set you free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but still get the original","review":"I loved this book. I read the original edition, and then checked out the new one. The new edition is definitely more exciting and is better for a modern audience. However, from an analytical point of view, I prefer the original. The first edition is slightly tedious, but it spends more time presenting evidence and discussing theology to back up Heiser's hypothesis. To me, this is critical in a novel designed to educate in an entertaining fashion. While the new edition is certainly more entertaining, I doubt that I would have taken the author seriously regarding his ideas about extraterrestrials/supernatural beings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gen 6:1-4 & 1 Enoch 6-8","review":"As a theology student specializing in Old Testament exegesis and biblical archaeology, I was familiar for quite some time with academic articles and writings of dr.

I read it yesterday (in one day). Wow. Great book. Fast paced. But most important: based on real and academic exegesis of OT and Dead Sea Scrolls.As for the \\"fiction\\" part... Yeah, the characters are fictional, but IMHO i don't think that the background for the story is."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read. A good start to a promising series","review":"A pleasant combination of C.S. Lewis and Michael Crichton. At times it kept me on the end of my seat. Intellectually stimulating, while still appealing to the fantasy. Heiser has made an interesting mix of theology with the UFO culture. If you enjoy the X-files you'll find this book a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll feel the urgency","review":"First-time author Michael S. Heiser crafts an absorbing supernatural thriller colored from the backdrop of UFO lore and Biblical theology. The story is fiction, but the author stresses that the historical UFO accounts, and subsequent official quotes, are real. Whether you believe that or not, and in my opinion it's not necessary that you do, Heister's The Facade is a fine read.Some mentions: The narrative pacing is quick and balanced--the urgency never lets up. The interactions between the players are fun even though there's a lot of standing around in groups and talking, and it didn't help that some of the minor characters are hard to distinguish from one another. And lastly, a wish of mine, I would like to have seen more personal failings in Dr. Scott's past. I know this goes against his Christian integrity, but I feel he would be a stronger character because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated 20 Chapters in...","review":"Years ago I saw an episode of Quincy Jones MD. which was an anti-drug PSA. In it Quincy was spouting off facts in unnatural dialogue leaving minutes of frustration before something happened. This is what my experience of The Facade has been 20 Chapters in, and frankly, I will probably not finish the rest. Sitting in a board-room meeting for chapter after chapter is not a good way for characters to discover what is going on in their world. Maybe I'm missing out and it gets amazing in chapter 25 or something, but I threw my hands up in the air at 20. This may be a minority opinion. I had the same response to the discovery chapters of Da Vinci Code. These lengthy sections feel like someone took paragraphs from a paper arguing for their conspiracy, and then pasted them in a dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad.","review":"Here you have an example of a really boring and poorly written book. Nothing new here. Another garbage Christian book disguised as a sci-fi thriller. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Christian book","review":"If you are a Christian beware of the ideas presented in this book. It is not based on the beliefs of the reformers. Heiser is hard to pin down on his beliefs because of what I call his \\"shotgun\\" theology. He sounds like a Mormon, a Jehovah's Witness and sometimes like Herbert W. Armstrong and all this while claiming to be a solid conservative Christian. I know this is a work of fiction but it does present ideas that I consider contrary to the Faith. Someone has pointed out that Heiser appears to have written some of his own five star reviews. If you will click on the profile of Michael Heiser on the review about the book being a \\"mind grenade\\" and read his other reviews there, it does seem like Heiser is the one who wrote that glowing review of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sexual Repression is Tangible","review":"A Devil behind every bush.

The midtempo material is acceptable if not superb, but dreamy, wistful slow jams like \\"Smile Again\\" and \\"Meantime\\" are just exactly what pure, organic soul should be. On the weak side, her style is certainly respectable, but her singing skills lack the refinement of those of Jill Scott or Ledisi.

I would not compare here Jill Scott,Lauryn Hill, India Arie, Badu, Jaguar Wright, Floetry. Those artist stand out from others. and they have a jazzy, funkadelic, Blues, 70's sound. Conya doss doesnt. She sounds like any other R&B artist singin about the same old [material] \\"Oh my Baby Left me your no good ...

She may have a voice that compares to those artists, but she has absolutely none of the creativity and originality of those three giants. This cd is boring and monotonous. Every song sounds the same. A good voice just isn't enough. A lot of women can blow, but more is needed to separate a good singer from the rest of the pack. What makes those other artists that I named so great is that they take risks and incorporate other types of music like reggae, hip-hop, jazz, go-go, and even latin music into their work.

Michael Cretu wasn't involved of making this CD (He had worked to enigma3 that was released one year later with big success).

That alone, in my eyes, warrants the treatment of his works in the way he treated the works of others before him. I have to give him - he was a prolific writer and some stuff he got right.

In terms of what makes this product great there are many things. First of all due to their pattented heat insulating methods it keeps your cold can of soda cold the whole time you drink it, but almost more importantly it keeps your hand warm as well! Also because it has 2 thin stainless steel layers it is hardly larger than the can either, which fits like a glove! I was facinated by how well it fit the first time I used it. Also it doubles as an excellent coffee mug especially for those pod coffee machines at the office and such as it's 10 oz size is appropriate for.

It does NOT have any extra technology.By using the lapel clip, it allows you to get it very close to your subject, thus giving you a better recording signal. And having a better recording signal has the side effect of cutting out more of the background noise. So with that in mind, it \\"cancels the noise.\\" I just think the title is misleading.But the mic is great and tiny so it allows you to keep it out of view as much as possible if you're also shooting video. The ability to turn it at any angle allows for even better positioning for maximum signal.I would recommend it even if it was more expensive. But for this price, you should definitely buy it even if the only purpose it ever serves is being a backup mic."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful","review":"extended the range of my voice recorder greatly.

Minor annoyance? Maybe, but read on, it gets worse.Next, I choose to click the button that (supposedly) copies the files from their cd to my hard drive, and it crashes and dumps me out of their program. These guys can't write the rudimentary code to copy files, but they're supposed to teach me something? (but wait, there's more)After manually copying the cd, I opened their first example program from chapter 2 (CD player).

If you just give a listen, you too will see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums I own!","review":"I bought \\"Wide Open Spaces\\" on impulse, after hearing \\"There's Your Trouble\\" just once on VH1. The album was an instant hit with me, and \\"There's Your Trouble\\" remains my favourite track. The album provides quite a wide range of music styles, although the theme throughout the CD is country. This is the sort of CD that you are always in the mood for, and although a lot of the tracks are quite sad, they are not depressing. One of the best songs on the album is \\"Let 'Er Rip\\" as this comes about half way through, and provides a complete contrast to most of the CD.I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves music, and it is definitely enjoyable to non-country music fans. However, if you fall in love with this CD, be wary of the follow-up CD, \\"Fly\\" as the Dixie Chicks style has changed dramatically"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music","review":"I prided myself for loving different kinds of music. No matter the genre one knows talent when they hear it, and the Dixie Chicks have it in spades. This is a wonderful CD with great music and lyrics.

(I believe they released a few albums on smaller labels with a different line-up.)The songs are all very good, but stand-outs are the title track, with it's wonderfully lilting choruses, the spunky \\"There's Your Trouble\\" and the opener \\"I Can Love You Better\\".A good start, but I think the Trio improves on their next release, FLY and really hits its stride on their latest effort, HOME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv It!","review":"I luv this cd. It shows the Dixie Chicks style and personality. It makes you want to dance to the beat. BUY THIS CD! IT'S AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly Good Effort","review":"I admire the people who put this together for trying a lot harder than they needed to. Sorry to be sexist, but they could have marketed the ladies by looks alone, given them garbage to record (with perhaps a good song or two), and milk the act as eye-candy for as long as they could.Instead, they come out with an ear-popping set that shines in all categories: songwriting, producing, singing, and musicianship. OK, it shines in album cover, also. Not only are they good to look at, they also contribute as musicians.While most of the songs are good, a great album often has at least one song that you can play over and over without getting tired of. With me, this one is \\"The Heartaches on Me\\". All in all, a great team effort that introduced the act to the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK is the best word to describe this music!","review":"This album really doesn't have alot of depth to it. Its all about a lead vocalist and two background singers. Hardly what I would call a GROUP. The two sisters are extrememly talented musicians, but their singing is very minimal on this project.

I could think of some better ways to spend my $15!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for rookies, but keep trying- you'll get it right!!","review":"Vocals are haunting,\\"get under your skin\\"-type.

The writing and musical ability are already there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, fun","review":"'Wide Open Spaces' is an enjoyable album. The Dixie Chicks are so energetic and bubbly! Their music is very fun to dance and sing along to. I don't really have a favorite song on this cd because they're all good, but I really like 'I Can Love You Better,' and 'There's Your Trouble.' 'You Were Mine' is pretty, too. I'd say this is probably my favorite country album, and I'd recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They bubble to the top","review":"Fly was the first country album I ever bought, and Wide Open Spaces was soon to follow. I am a recent convert (1999) to country music, lured by the country triumverate--Leann Rimes, Shania Twain and (though I hate to admit it now) Faith Hill. Once I became acclimated to the twang and enamored with the fiddle, I found that, while there's merit to these acts, its only when you take country on its own terms, that you learn to appreciate it. And that's why I bought the Wide Open Spaces. You don't have to worship Dolly Parton to appreciate them, and yet their talent is UNDENIABLE. The Chicks are masters of their craft: the storytelling, the perfect marriage of voice and melody, and staying artistically fresh. When it comes to young female country stars, they just do it better than anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dixie Chicks Kick Butt!!!","review":"I have never liked country music but my best friend made me listen to the CD one day and I fell in love with them!!

But after hearing a little Garth and a little Shania, I thought I'd give these girls a try. It was not a mistake. From my very first listen I was captivated by the music and the lyrics. \\"You Were Mine\\" is heartwrenching, as is \\"Loving Arms,\\" and I challenge you to sit still and not sing along to \\"There's Your Trouble.\\" Give this cd a try; you will not regret it - it captures all the heart and soul of country music, and none of the cliches."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think the cd is absolutely fantastic!","review":"I noticed that 10 people gave this cd 1 or 2 stars and all the rest of the people gave it 4 or 5 stars.

When I first bought the album, I enjoyed most of it. As I listened to it more and more, I realized just how bad the lead singer's voice can be. The music is great, the background vocals are great (I'd personally like to hear the other two sing some songs), but the lead vocals are really lacking. I can't say I *do not* buy this album, but make sure you really like the group before buying it. Don't get it until you've heard more than just a couple of their songs. I gave my cd to my girlfriend. The good songs just don't make up for the numerous bad ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"These 'chicks' sing it like you've never heard!","review":"The first time you hear the Dixie Chicks... guaranteed you'll be blown away.

The Dixie Chicks have done some genuinely beautiful composing here, and it's about time someone did. \\"Wide Open Spaces\\" is a testament to the right of passage called young adulthood. With upbeat riffs and inspiring vocals we hear the story of a young lady's decision to step out and see the world. \\"There's Your Trouble\\" will have you dancing with its fine fingered fiddl'n... \\"Let'er Rip\\" is the only disappointing song, and I found myself skipping over it after the first time through the CD.

The ladies exhibit their beautiful voices in a variety of different songs. The cd contains many different instruments and has various tempos. Their music style is country. Each member is blessed with musical talents and they portray them on this cd. They all can play different instruments as well as sing. The music to me was awesome, and it caught my attention.

If you like a CD that goes \\"thump\\" \\"thump\\" \\"thump\\" \\"thump\\" for 40 minutes, on beat-after-beat, on song-after-song, then you'll love this CD.

I say that their music isn't music but it just noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great music","review":"The point of these reviews is to critique the product. [...] Wide Open Spaces is a great CD. The song itself I think is still my favorite from them, and the whole CD has infectious lyrics and music. The instrumentation is wonderful. It's an effective blend of traditional country with the reality of contemporary country music. I think its popularity foreshadowed the huge success of the Oh Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack.

It is quite a change from the garbage that is being played on Pop/Rock stations. I have discovered the group very recently, and I wish I had when they released this album. My favourites are 'I can love you better','Wide open spaces','The heartache is on me','Let 'er rip'and 'Give it up or let me go'. It is not my favourite DC album. That is not to say I don't enjoy it. I like 'Fly'and 'Home' better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God it Was Short!","review":"When I first got this book I expected it to be like one of the small paperbacks in the Jedi Apprentice series; small, short, but still good. I didn't realize just how short it was! Nevertheless, I still had high hopes for it, me loving Padmé and all. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. [author:Julianne Balmain|18358] didn't seem to know the character of Padmé very well. She seemed a little off the whole book and Balmain made it seem like Padmé and Amidala were two different people, which made absolutely no sense.The story was boring, with no emotion, no excitement. She loses the amulet, Padmé and her handmaiden look for it and find it, the end. The amulet is an ugly locket-type thing. In another review it's described as a lump with ropes around it, and that's just what it is.Maybe this book could be enjoyable for other people, but to me it was a big disappointment.Review also featured on Goodreads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book","review":"The illustrations are great. It's a cute, short-story about Queen Amidala, her lost amulet, and her best friend Sabe. It takes place the day Theed is invaded by the Trade Federation. The two friends retrace Amidala's footsteps from the day before and the amulet is found. Sabe must take the Queens place to ensure her safety. To show her gratitude, Padme has Sabe wear the necklace. True; it isn't an epic book. But it is a nice read. The Amulet that comes with the book isn't plastic, it's metal, and isn't nearly as horrid as earlier described. The box is also a nice little keepsake.If you like Queen Amidala, you'll love this little set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"This book has many problems. I will be sending mine back to Amazon as soon as I find my packing tape.1: The \\"amulet\\" itself. From the cover illustration, I figured it would be the forehead-ornament on the black feathered costume which is featured prominently. Not so: the amulet is a lump of black, with bronzey ropes across it. The amulet opens like a locket. It is the ugliest piece of plastic jewelry I've seen in a long time.2: The plot. I'd hoped that the story would be worthwhile. It is not. Amidala realizes her amulet is missing, she and a handmaiden go to look for it, they find it and return. No adventures. No uplifting tale. No additional background to the movie.The only thing worthy about this \\"book\\" is the box that it comes in, which is pretty and would make a fairly decent 'secret box' for a child.

True, she didn't explain much of the back story, and people who aren't familiar with the series would get confused, but...?

It is God's Money, to help mankind, someone has to manage it. This book does NOT tell you HOW.

It does not tell you how to give it away or philanthropy.

I don't get the negative reviews here. Stellar production from Glyn Johns and fine songs from both Leadon and Michael Georgiades (who doesn't even rate a billing on the CD, and the back cover. Thanks, Wounded Bird) make this a sonic treat. Some of the best drum sounds ever, masterfully delivered by David Kemper.

My comments on \\"Long road out of Eden\\" also apply here - innocuous, often pleasant stuff, but nothing that really reaches out and grabs you (or at least me). It seems that the Eagles and their spin-offs have all reached the ends of their roads and should stick to the \\"oldies\\" circuit, living off past glories.P.S. I am informed by J.

The rest still stands."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIFELESS AND UNINSPIRING","review":"When Leadon left the Eagles there was hope that this album might provide some stellar material that he had been unable to peddle to the band. What we got with this release was a set of boring, unimaginative and tedious tunes.Poor Bernie does not possess much of a lead voice and that is painfully exposed here without Frey/Henley/Meisner harmonies to provde cover for him. The songs never really catch fire and the whole affair is a snoozefest.In short, this album stinks out loud just as it did in 1977.

Then I ran across this book in the library. It lists \\"2,243 irregular Spanish verbs, 34,550 irregular verb forms, 40,500 definitions, and 4,850 regular verbs arranged alphabetically...\\", and is incredibly useful.

Even as a MA study, I would only give it a B-."},{"rating":"2","title":"church history in a nutshell","review":"Have read this book a few times and always get something out of it that I missed the first time.A good book for the average person to read to get a glimpse of church history...very interesting comments made about Islam especially with the present climate regarding that faith....and eye opener to read that Islam was used to bring discipline on the church. I would recommend to anyone that would like to know how the church has been, from the beginning, on through the Crusades, the Reformation, the split in the church between the East and West up to the time of Spurgeon. Interesting also to know a little of the history of the Baptists, the reformers, the Methodists and also the persecution of the church down through the ages. All in all, a very informative and easy to read book on our faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tradition with a twist","review":"One of the tenderest, least condescending children's albums ever made. If you're a fan of Edwards' buttery yet raspy singing, you'll be charmed by his renditions of children's classics like Stewball and Flies in the Buttermilk and moved by his own original compositions, like Little Hands. In some ways, my child always preferred Raffi and more bouncy CD's to this one - but for music that dug into my heart as well as his, this one can't be beat. I give it regularly as a new-baby gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Currently unhappy","review":"I purchased this product for a christmas gift in November.

It is about the particulars of Hindmarsh Island and the writing of ethnography in the southeast. It is about anthropologists and anthropology. It is about the politics of knowledge in an oral culture and those of a print-oriented one. It is about women who insist on being authors of their own lives. And it is about belief, dissent, story-telling and story tellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good content but badly written","review":"Writing style is difficult to follow. Authors use acronyms that were not previously defined, there are syntactical errors (eg p. 338 \\"If a frame received at a peer from a remote peer is larger than that capable of the end station to handle\\"), and their whole approach is too abstract. Their configuration examples are also badly explained (eg they don't state clearly that in an RSRB over TCP configuration you have to define the local peer in the same way as a remote peer).For configuration examples the online documentation at cisco.com (especially the technical tips) is infinitely superior. The only use I found for the book was in Part I, which is a (superficial) introduction to SNA technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I looked forward to making cakes in this pan.

Many helpful hints about raising a gifted child. Main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general -- and may push those with \\"normal\\" kids into thinking they have gifted ones and down that track -- when they should not. Gifted kids are the exception, not the norm as this book makes it seem."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow! exactly what I thought..","review":"I have been hearing a lot about these guys lately on web boards and such and have to agree with all the hype.

The album sounds like it was written by 12 year old girls in need of a hug. I hope this is not indicative of the future bands from Nebraska. If so, I would say that towns 15 minutes has passed already.If they would stop trying to sound so emo maybe they could write a song with a decent hook instead of droning romps with hooks obviously stolen straight from sunny day real estate and the pixies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"Honestly, it was just lame in my opinion. It was marketed as a Christian movie, which it was not. The storyline just seemed unsteady and like it was missing a lot. From the other reviews I read there was a book and they didn't follow along with it well. Which may be why it seemed sort of angsty and not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vow-video","review":"The movie seemed to drag in parts but definitly took time to develope its characters.

She loves sappy love stories. However, the movie arrived in a case that was cracked on the bottom. The paper in the cover was warped at the top, as if it had been wet. And the movie had quite a few light scratches on it. The movie skips around a little, which was slightly annoying. I won't be returning it because it was so cheap and not worth the trouble, however I am very disappointed with the condition of this movie and case."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vow","review":"Loved the movie The Vow great service will use again good good good good good good good good goood good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great from the producers of The Notebook","review":"Two of my favorite stars of the day: Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum.

There is little intensity in this, it's just sort of bland. This is basically a nice love story, but there's nothing outstanding about it, nothing that grips or hooks the viewer. I didn't care about any of the characters. The ending is also anti-climatic. Overall, if you're in the mood for an average movie, then this is the movie for you.

He SUFFERED for her and she basically walks away from him during most of the movie!! Gah! And the ending? What happened to that?

Paige is injured in a car accident. When she awakens in the hospital, she mistakes her husband for a doctor. She has forgotten the recent months of her life, forgetting having met her husband altogether, and even worse, believes she is still engaged to a former fiance. Paige never does recover her memory so will she recover her marriage?I was worried that the movie version seemed overly dramatized (and I imagine that there is a fair amount of dramatic license), but pictures of the real-life couple (Kim and Krickitt Carpenter) at the end of the movie remind the audience that this truly was inspired by a real love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Fellas","review":"This is the consummate chick flick. Based on true events it reads like a campfire story for the romantic notions of love without boundries. Having to watch this after an actual wedding only added to its pompous blow by blow of situational angst for the poor main characters. Have your phone handy to sneak in a sports score or two during the swollen violin scores you will endure.

THIS HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE A GREAT MOVIE BECAUSE IT HAS A GOOD STORYLINE, BUT TOO MANY POSSIBLE SCENES BETWEEN THE 2 OF THEM ARE MISSED AND THERE'S ALOT OF UNNECCESSARY FLUFF TAKING THE PLACE OF THAT. ALSO, THE ENDING DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE ENDING. I KEPT WAITING FOR SOMETHING GREAT TO HAPPEN AND IT DIDN'T! I GUESS IF YOU'RE REALLY INTO ROMANTIC MOVIES THIS MAYBE ALITTLE BETTER FOR YOU, BUT IT JUST DIDN'T CUT IT FOR ME. ONLY ONES (THAT DON'T HAVE COMEDY MIXED IN) WORTH WATCHING MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE TO ME ARE THE NOTEBOOK AND TITANIC AND THIS ONE REALLY REALLY DOESN'T COMPARE. I PROBABLY SOUND LIKE A JERK, BUT I ACTUALLY WISH I COULD GET THE TIME I SPENT WATCHING IT AND $10 I SPENT BUYING IT BACK HAHA. I WISH I WOULD HAVE LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I went and saw this movie with my beautiful fiancee and I enjoyed it...even more than she did. She praises The Notebook and Titanic. Those were good too. I liked The Vow a smidge more than Notebook. But hey, I don't mind going against type because most would disagree. I liked the story of true love severely tested here in a way that you don't see often. How hard would it be if the love of your life forgot who you are and you could lose that person? I felt the pain of that. This isn't a genre that I have tons of favorites in. Like Horror and comedy, romantic movies have to be really special for me to like. Was this perfect? Maybe not. But I didn't think The Notebook was either, but it did the job. Also, I'm not one that is afraid to admit liking a movie like this amid all the gratuitous sex, graphic violence and raunch trash that gets churned out nowadays. Many have lost respect and chasteness, and it reflects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phony cheese","review":"Everything felt fake and hollywoodified throughout this movie. From the scenes, to the acting, to the makeup, I just could not enjoy this movie because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have seen the trailer, then you have seen the movie.","review":"At the end of the day, this movie is what it is. If you are expecting romantic greatness then you've come to the wrong place, because most of \\"The Vow\\" is very love story paint-by-numbers. But if you are looking for a fluff-piece to get you though Valentine's Day, because your significant other forgot to plan a nice dinner, then \\"The Vow\\" may be what you are looking for. In a nutshell, the main reason why \\"The Vow\\" is a subpar romantic movie is simpler than just \\"the acting was bad\\" or \\"the dialogue was poorly written\\". In a nutshell, \\"The Vow\\" doesn't work simply because not for one minute was I invested in any of the characters on-screen. And that is the kiss of death for any romantic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vow","review":"I watched this movie over and over again.

My mom, sisters, and I loaded up on gelato and kicked all the men out in preparation to watch this movie. All of us were so disappointed that we traded two hours of chick time for this movie. We forced ourselves to keep watching in hopes that it would get better and that the supposed determination of Tatum to win his wife back would move us to heartfelt sorrow and anticipated victory. That didn't happen. Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams had poor chemistry. What should have been sappy but acceptable romantic interludes were poorly done and completely unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"Horrible movie, I couldn't even finish it.

I was just expecting so much more. I spent half the movie wanting to go through the screen and smack her parents. And then the reason that she didn't talk to them, ARGH! I just expected this movie to make me feel good and to make me happy. And it didn't. Rent it folks, don't waste your money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More a drama than romantic or comedy","review":"I'm really perplexed why this movie is considered a romantic comedy. It is not particularly romantic or comedic. This is no \\"When Harry Met Sally\\". This movie would have been a flop if it was not for Rachel McAdams. She is a fabulous actress. Its too bad she has been typecasted for these so called romantic romcoms. Tatum Channing is woefully miscast. He is flat as a distressed husband trying to deal with his wife's disability. I think Ryan Gosling or Ryan Reynolds would have been better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"My best friend loves \\"The Notebook\\" and kept commenting that she wanted to see \\"The Vow.\\" So for her birthday I downloaded it for her, and we watched it together. I had heard the true story a few years ago, so I thought it would be interesting, but we were both terribly bored with this movie. I like both of Adams and Tatum, but overall this movie seemed like it was made for Lifetime Television. I feel sorry for anyone who paid to see this in the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vow for Life!","review":"The movie \\"The Vow\\" is about a man's vow to his wife for life.

Paige the entitled. Paige the bully. It was all about Paige and very little about her husband. He was going through ton of stress and agony that never got expressed on the screen just a nice guy gentleness and one punch. He was truly the perfect gentleman. He even learned to love the cat. Great for a superficial story but not a great movie. I would have liked him to have had more voice to express anger even at her for lets face it ruining his life and not trusting him. Instead its all about Paige and her rotten family that were trying to rewrite history. How many more secrets did they keep? So not a great movie. If you like date movies its good but don't expect any realism in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly done","review":"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. The acting was decent, although there was no chemistry between the lead characters.

Really? I mean, cut him off if you want but it seems like a tad bit of an overreaction to me. Her mom and sister were probably like WTF did we do? She was a total brat throughout the whole movie. Her character was unlikable and he was a wuss. I hated it. I'm glad I Netflixed it rather than paying to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed!!!!!","review":"I read the book and about the only thing it has in common with the movie is the Title!

I hadn't read the book from which the movie was adapted. I had only seen the preview. For a romance I found it surprisingly good. Channing Tatum's physique was offputting (and not in a good way - the guy looks like he has been taking too many steroids or working out way too much), but once I got past that aspect his character was heartbreakingly beautiful (corny statement I know, but watch the movie and you'll know what I mean).This is a great date movie or a good film to watch when you are away from your sweetie (and missing him/her).I know I won't be buying the film (it isn't something I would watch again and a again), but I would highly recommend renting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD...","review":"Loved the CD from the moment I played \\"All is Forgiven\\" at a rock station in Seattle. If I remember correctly there was a buzz about this CD since it was all digitally recorded (a big deal back then). I could be wrong about that, but it's not the point.The point is that every song is really strong... great vocals, excellent guitar.. beefy drum work and still one of the cleanest recordings out there. What continues to amaze me is that I can pop this CD in and listen to it over and over for hours. The Siren CD has kept me company on many interstate road trips. The songs stay in your head... sound familiar, but always sound fresh at the same time. Amazing vocals from Kristin Massey with a nice slight echo in the recording.This CD is a treasure, and I think one of those rare finds. To the members of SIREN...Robert Haas, Jon Brant, Kristin Massey and Gregg Potter... thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book not for higher levels of entry tests","review":"I used for preparing for Orange County Comm Coll, NY assessment tests.

So far, I'm not crazy about it. The material feels very flimsy and cheap, and it's not squeeze like other nuby products. What I did like are the soft spout - my baby can drink from it (although a lot of liquid comes out and sometimes he can't handle it); it's easy to clean (wide top) and I like the lid that comes with it. The one con is that it's just like any other sippy cup so I think I could have saved a couple of bucks and time to have it shipped. I could have bought one at my local grocery store!My baby is only 6 months old and still can't manage to use it on his own so please read more reviews before you make your decision! I haven't fully used it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"color","review":"even though color may vary,allow customers to choose what color they want.i am very much dissatisfied because i got a pink and i have a boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star is Too Many!!!","review":"These sippy cups are worthless. My one-year-old grandson grows so impatient with this sippy that he cries in frustration. The sippy spout collapses due to the suction. Just a couple of swallows and you have to take the cup away and pull the spout back out. Ridiculous. It's such a dumb and worthless product. I don't know why this company continues to produce these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky and spout collapses","review":"This cup is awful. I bought it at a local store because I thought it was the Super-spout cup (which I like a lot), but this cup is terrible. The entire top and spout collapse when my son drinks out of it because the small vent holes do not work, and the cup leaks because it is hard to align the removable soft silicone spout part with the screw-on top/handle piece. If I could return these cups I would - they are the worst. The best thing I can say for them is that they are easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"it leaks!","review":"It was a waste of money.

During the day, it's fine. But I usually put my little one to bed with some water in a sippy cup. After 3 mornings of completely sopping sheets (and a screaming baby), we had to give up on using this one for bedtime. Back to the Nuby straw cup, which works nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opening very large","review":"My daughter had a hard time with this cup... the opening is very large and she would choke on the water because it came out too fast.

The nipple is latex like a bottle and he had to bite down on the nipple to drink from it. It was great for about the first two months, then the little things in the nipple that control the flow managed to break and now the flow is way too fast for him and he decides that the cup is better to water his toys than to drink from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is supposed to be a LEAK proof cup....NOT! My daughter had water all over herself from it leaking. No matter how tight I tighten the lid it still leaked from there. And on top of that, the lid is a PAIN to take off. The plastic get slippery to hold when wet and the handle makes it difficult to get a good grip to unscrew the cap. I would definitely NOT buy another one of these cups. Don't waste you money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice 1st cup","review":"I bought this cup at a local Meijer store after the pediatrician suggested that we give our daughter water after her meal. She was six months at the time. I chose this cup because she already had two teeth and with a hard spout cup she would just bite on the spout. I felt with this cup it might encourage her to suck since it was similar to a bottle nipple. She was able to hold onto the cup with relative ease. We have been giving her water in it for quite sometime and she definitely was drinking it but I never knew how much. She is now 10 months. Today I wanted to see how well she was doing, so I put some of her morning bottle into this cup and she drank it like a pro. I believe that she will be easily off the bottle by 1 year and I do believe part of that is because this cup is an easy transition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great leak proof sippy with a cap!","review":"I' surprised this product only has 3 reviews. I've tried 4 sippy cups, and this is PERFECTION. It's hard enough to look for sippy cups with a cap, which rids of 90% of sippy cups in the market. And many leak horribly despite the product description. There's a sippy cup I really like, I think it's NUK, that absolutely doesn't leak, but it doesn't have a cap.This one doesn't leak at all, and has a cap. The only thing I don't like is the nipple is pretty hard to clean. But I use my little finger and get into all the nooks the best I can, and I soak the nipple once every few times. Also, the bottle itself is big enough to fit my hand, so I don't need a bottle brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"No-Spill = Yes-Spill/Leak","review":"We got two of these cups as a gift. They are absolutly horrible. They leak everywhere. I took one to a playdate with us. My son left it on the floor while playing. When I went to pick it up a few minutes later there was a huge puddle of water on the carpet. I checked to see if I lined up the little nubbies and they were. The next time was when we went to the library for storytime. My son put the cup in front of him while listening, after the program was over he stood up and his pants were soaked. Again, I checked the nubbies and yet again they were lined up. While using these at home I always thought he was drinking it and letting it run from is mouth, in fact it was the cup that leaks not his mouth!I stopped using them after the last spill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, LEAKS","review":"Love the colors and design. Easy for my baby to use but it leaks so badly that I threw them out. Save yourself the hassle of buying this bottle and just pour the liquid directly on the baby, carseat, or floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This worked at the beginning, now it leaks after a few weeks of use","review":"I was really excited to switch from a bottle to a soft spout cup and when I first got this one, baby had no trouble switching. It did not leak, it appeared to be the perfect cup, that is until it started leaking and the suction is acting funny! When my son starts sucking on this, the top gets in the cup completely, like a vacuum, I would have to unscrew it to let air in and it pops back out. Also, I am not sure how this happened but the top soft part moved from where it's supposed to stay and now the handles and the spout don't align properly.

What I don't like is that it LEAKS LIKE MAD!I don't know if it's my daughters technique, or the cup itself, but every time she takes the spout out of her mouth, a large portion of milk runs down her chin and soaks the front of her shirt.If the silicone top is not lined up absolutely perfectly (and my baby has a way of causing it to become misaligned) then it leaks from around the gasket. Also, whenever she drops the cup it always seems to land with the weight of the cup pressing on the spout, allowing the contents to flow out onto her tray or the floor. It is a huge mess maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks like mad! Absolute Rubbish!","review":"I had the Nuby 5 ounce sippy and my son took to that but I wanted a sippy with a lid to keep the spout clean during travel.

But this leaked from the spout from the get go!I ended up buying a new one, such a waste of money this was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to drink from!","review":"We tried this cup and when my daughter bangs it on something hard it leaks. Furthermore, the suction valve is so tight my daughter inverts the silicone top while drinking because she sucks so hard, and then the top is all folded over and she can't drink at all! I am always undoing the lid to release the suction. We have another Nuby cup that has the same problem. You can fix the problem by opening up the valve a little with a sharp knife or blade, but then it leaks more. My daughter's favorite use of her sippy cup is \\"painting\\" with water on the bedsheets using her sippy cup. Much to our dismay!

A lot of the topical stuff is of course dated (the show was taped in early 1993, but the even older material on the earlier shows (1990 and 1987) are just plain funnier. Also, it must be noted that there are NO worthwhile extras on this DVD, despite its relatively high cost.

He is still socially liberal/moderate, but everything else sounds like a neo-con apologist. Too bad, we could have used his wit and intelligence on the left.

The handles on the sides with which you lift the pan are thinner than one would expect and they do get quite hot, even during stove-top use. The real drawback though is the handle on the lid. It looks like something fabricated in high school metal shop class and it gets terribly hot during any use. I believe this pan is currently offered at a discount price because it is being discontinued. It looks like Calphalon has corrected the handle problems in a newly designed version of this pan which hits the market soon. By the way, believe the reviews - this pan is HUGE!

The non-stick finish had been ruined and the pot is worthless for anything except boiling vegitables and pasta, as anything I attempt to cook will stick to the sides and bottom.I have never had problems with Calphalon products before, but I WOULD NOT recommend purchasing this pot.

I also love the interracial love story because diversity is a beautiful thing. I love how the women work together to support each other. Even though this is a film about African-Americans/Black-Americans, I think people from other races will be able to relate to this story 'cause they are females and love is one of the themes in this film. Unfortunately, there is racism and violence in the film, which stays true to history and the present century. It's a great film, but I returned it because of Alicia Keys. I no longer listen to her songs because she is a home-destroyer and she hates Nigerians. So I removed four stars because of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"The secret life of bees is beautiful!","review":"I have read the book, and have heard the book on audio both in English and in Norsegian.

The beginning of the movie is difficult to watch -- it opens with the story of how a young girl is left motherless and follows her as she is being cared for by an abusive father. My husband just looked over at me after about 10 minutes with a huge frown since it was so upsetting in the opening scenes. There are several other story lines that make this a movie that tears at your heart, but the movie as a whole is beautiful. There are uplifting portions that bring a smile to your face. The cast is OUTSTANDING. The photography is awesome.By the time we finished, he was no longer frowning and admitted it was very, very good. A quality film from a quality novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Perhaps Queen Latifah has made too much money and she isn't hungry anymore, but... This film was disappointing. It has its moments, but the story, as told, as produced, as acted, is cliche and demeaning. That's the worst part of it. What a tremendous, and powerful story - but, it is undermined by those who haven't a clue what they're really talking about. I can't stand the Hollywood-ites doing films like this, and doing it seemingly content with their own shallowness and contentment with ignorance and mediocrity. This book is too important to be treated this way. They never really get past the surface. Their stabs at profundity utterly miss the mark with the cliche.I was truly looking forward to seeing this film - but, it fell far too short to get even a mediocre rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little over the top but very good.","review":"I liked it but it seemed to have a need to pull at the heart strings on every single event.

This filmed travesty of over sentimentalised tripe totally misses the natural warmth, charm and fundamental honesty of the novella.

The book itself was pretty good but was so descriptive it ruined the movie for me. I finished the book on Sunday and decided to rent instead of buying the movie on Wednesday. I was excited to see the movie but was instantly disappoint. It deviated from the book a little which was fine but the story seemed to go so fast; trying to fit as much into an hour and a half as possible. I'm a fan of all of the actresses d absolutely loved the acting of Sophie Okonedo, who played the part of sister May. All in all the movie was both over and under-acted.I don't know if I would have liked the movie had I not read the book.

My thoughts before watching the movie is that it was miscast. I pictured that Queen Latifah should play the part of Rosalee. However, I have to say that, although young in age, Jennifer Hudson was very good as Rosalee. I thought that Queen Latifah was great as August Boatwright. Queen Latifah has to be one of the finest actresses around, not to mention, she's just beautiful. She lights up the movie. I thought that Dakota Fanning, although excellent in some parts of the movie, was very inconsistent. In some of the movie, I thought her acting was not good at all. However, I can't think of a young actress who would have fit the part as Lily. A few scenes in the movie were changed from the book. You will definitely enjoy the movie. However, the book is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This is Chics flick just loved this movie. All the stars in thismovie blend together perfect.

While I understood the basic themes of the suffering and compassion during that time period (early 1960's), I didn't feel as if it flowed as it should have. The main characters were all very strong but, perhaps my mind wandered at times, there was so much pain and such little redemption I wasn't sure I comprehended the piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matches Up To the Book Well","review":"I loved the book to start with. The movie followed the book closely. All of the actors and actresses played their parts well. This movie will be liked mostly by ladies. It kinds fits into the chick flick- drama category. I felt the movie was heart felt, and kept my attention. My favorite actress was Queen Latifa. She plays a great strong older sister. The DVD its self played well. It was packaged well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one pulls at your heart strings","review":"This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. I think I had tears in my eyes through 75% of the movie. This is Dakota Fanning's best performance. Jennifer Hudson was spectacular. Queen Latifah delivered like never before.

Set in 1964, this is the story of Lily Melissa Owens, who lives on a peach farm in South Carolina. At four years of age, Lily accidentally killed her mother. Her father is a harsh and cruel man, and Lily craves her mother's love. She does have the friendship of Rosaleen, a Negro servant, but when events put Rosaleen in jail and in danger of her life, Lily decides they need to escape. Lily follows the scant trail left by her mother and they end up living with the eccentric Boatwright sisters, farming honey and learning to understand the world and themselves. Queen Latifah does an excellent portrayal of August Boatwright; Lily is superbly played by Dakota Fanning, and a special mention to Paul Bettany as the troubled T. Ray and Sophie Okonedo as May Boatwright. The screenplay is mostly faithful to the book: a pleasure to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie...loved it!","review":"My daughter read the book for school and recommended we watch the movie.

One is swept away by the story and only on rereading Betty Blue does one realise with what skill and subtle mastery Djian has transported one to the tale's powerful emotional climax. On the first reading I was awed by the story and on the second reading by his use of language. Simply put, I love it for its passion, I love it for its use of imagery, I respect the author for simply telling and not philosophising. What a shame that it should be out of print!

The pillow height seems wrong, too. I am not petite, and the pillow is too high. Because the pillow is so hard and too high, my neck bends in a very uncomfortable way.

An eclectic but effective mix of songs unified by the common theme of having something to do with summer, the album starts off with an almost \\"smooth-jazz\\"\\"-like mechanical-sounding percussion sequence that had me dreading what was to follow. But I listened beyond that intro and was intrigued by the blend of styles and influences she acknowledges in the instrumental accompaniments, while maintaining her own distinct imprint on the vocals. Her interpretations sound unlike any other you've heard of the same song, so some of them might take some getting used to if you are familiar with other more familiar covers.

It fits in the cup holder on my jeep although it may not fit in your car's standard drink holder. However, don't let that stop you. Toss it onto the passenger seat, ready for those long thirsty stretches of road where you can't pull over and stop. The instructions say \\"no hot beverages\\" and \\"no carbonated beverages\\", but for an ice water lover, this item is ideal. I love this item and will use it on all my trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"great water bottle","review":"based on the previous reviews, I purchased this bottle.

Because of food allergies, I bring it whenever I leave the house, so that I do not get hungry and eat foods that are off my diet. This has been a real health benefit, and the pop-up straw makes the thermos extremely easy to use when on the go.Now for the bad part: After only a few months, the thermos began to leak, which can create a real mess. Several months later, the plastic parts inside (the straw and gasket) began to split and break down. However, the company tells me there are no replacement parts available. So this otherwise fine steel thermos becomes unusable due to the fact that Thermos fails to offer replacements for the little plastic parts that break easily. Sounds like planned obsolescence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another 5-star product from Thermos Nissan","review":"We purchased the black version that comes with a neoprene travel bag (made exclusively for Brookstone). Paid around $22. Another GREAT product from Thermos Nissan. I load it with ice cubes and water at 6:00am then send my son off to school with it. When I pick him up at 4:30pm, it's still filled with ice (even after he refills it twice during the day with water). Because it's ICE COLD, he drinks a ton of water throughout the day instead of soda or sugary drinks. This bottle is meant for cold beverages, not hot ... and it's not intended for carbonated drinks. The bottle is leak resistant with zero condensation. Worth the higher than average price tag since the durable construction will last a long time. Comes with an extra straw. Easy to clean. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"out of this world","review":"I've had the Vinyl LP of this album since the late Seventies and still love playing it - it's a piece of 'Rock N Role' history rough round the edges but honest and punchy well worth a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"kent missed the point","review":"kent was right about a lot of things , but the pirates were the first power three some , he,s a yank and does not quite understand , british rock history , page beck and townsend were fans of this band , when they were kids , this recording is what the band sounded like in the pre beatles days , they were also fans , this album was recorded when they got back together for the first time in ten years , no rehearsals , just show up plug in and play love and rock dave"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE REISSUE THESE ALREADY!!","review":"The Pirates are a great rock and roll band.

The characters have an interesting depth to them, the plot has a lot of layers, and the action is suitably tense. Probably the most gratifying thing about the novel is that Hank Searls clearly realized how bad the original screenplay was, and freely added to or deviated from it in order to shape it into a much better story. This will definitely appeal to readers that liked the original 'Jaws' novel, even though it's by a different author. However, good luck finding it anywhere, it's definitely not going to be re-printed any time soon. But if you run accross it at a garage sale or used book store, pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOL- It for sure beats the movie!","review":"Surprisingly after the horrid mess of the movie, this novelization of the flopped film is quite enjoyable- and almost makes you completely forget about how terrible the movie was.In this average-sized novel, Hank Searls takes us on an adventure not only through the eyes of Ellen Brody, but also several of the other film characters and(gasp!) even the killer shark that is terrorizing her family. In the book, we find out more about why the shark is doing what it's doing, making the plot more understandable and clear.Although the plot is still pretty far-fetched(it insinuates that the shark is under the control of a voodoo witch doctor who is an enemy of the Brody's), it is for sure more enjoyable and interesting than the film, and I think all Jaws fans will breathe a sigh of relief when they read this, because it basically saves the whole \\"Jaws: The Revenge\\" topic from being a complete and utter disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaws without Flaws","review":"I agree with other postings here that the book is better than the movie. The movie lacked consistency, but Searl's novel brought more character and more depth to the story. However, I wished he would stay away from the--how should I say it?--the \\"psychological connectivity\\" with the shark to Mike Brody (or any of the Brody family). This makes the story seem unrealistic in the sense that sharks seek out revenge on its predators (man)-- especially where Mike says, \\"that shark has me tagged.\\" Despite this minor detail, I found the book exciting. I have the original copy placed on bookstands, and it is still available in bookstores (at least in my area). If you want a copy you might try out a local flea market or \\"old books sale\\" areas.

After her youngest son is killed by a shark in Amity, Ellen Brody travels to the Bahamas to be with her other son and family. The giant shark follows her and continues its reign of terror. There is more action and suspense in this novel than can be found in the movie, and there are also more shark attacks. Michael Caine's character Hoagie is actually a spy sent to the Bahamas to fend off evil drug lords. Along the way, he romances Ellen Brody and helps her family to rid themselves of the shark curse once and for all.

The crochet is also tight enough not to show my scalp through the holes, but open enough to let air through in the hot weather. They also look nice on my teenage daughters who have full long hair.

I had high expectations going in. But I don't really care how many critics praise this film, or how good the director's sense of composition may be (and I admit that it is), the pace is excruciatingly slow and the acting is generally awful, which ultimately undermines the entire film. Period. There is a fine line between using the lingering camera to capture/express certain ideas and simply engaging in self-indulgence, and in this instance, the director crossed that line so many times in this film that by the time I reached the controversial ending, I just didn't care anymore. If you are looking for a thought-provoking film that is actually worthy of the praise it has received, a slowly-paced endeavor that also offers stunning cinematography, genuinely interesting characters, and no easy answers, I would instead recommend 'The White Ribbon.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad vacuum","review":"Hepa filters are no easier to change than bags -- and you have to change them twice a year -- [the money] for the filters that's bad value.

She is an enthusiastic amateur in a world bursting with talented professionals. Composing is her real talent, not playing. Rather than sending her cds to radio stations hoping to get them played, and never finding out that she is not a good enough player to justify that exposure, she should be sending the cds to successful piano recording artists and hoping some of her tunes are picked up. And even more importantly, she should be sending them to film and TV producers everywhere, because film and TV is where her compositions can really shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"I have nothing against low budget indies. In fact, I love them. But this film...oh dear God, was just the worst quality. Everything about it. The script, the lighting, the sound, and the acting. The worst part was that they had familiar faces from 80's TV shows who were doing these degrading monologues, in bad lighting and horrible make-up...ahhh. I've never felt so bad for actors. And just for the record, there was no sex, and no one was sexy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind travels in the Scottish isles","review":"Because I have always adored The Daughter of Time, I recently spent a weekend with The Singing Sands, The Franchise Affair, and The Man in the Queue. Singing Sands I found compelling and satisfying in an old-fashioned way -- we get a deep, poetic examination of the hero's psychological journey and his Scottish surroundings. Fine irony and good jokes at the reader's expense made me enjoy this book even more.DO read this Josephine Tey -- but, if you are wise, do not expect a similar treat from her first mystery, The Man in the Queue: the world of that book is too far away from ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book of the author","review":"My favorite Josephine Tey, dreamy and gentle like a story told by a favorite elderly aunt. Alan Grant, a Scotland Yard detective, is forced to face his own fragility of body and mind, and the plot is largely driven by his imagination and his subconscious desire to resolve a mystery he is not even sure it really exists. There is always an element of beauty in Tey's novels, and here it is stronger than ever - the beauty of Scottish mountains and of people Grant encounters, and of a distant land he imagines. Plausibility (or lack of) of the plot is not important. This book, that often travels with me, always reminds me why we read: to be taken elsewhere, outside of ourselves, to places we would have never seen otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real story, mostly tedious introspection","review":"Recovering from a case of \\"nerves\\" in the Scottish Highlands, Grant finds himself obsessed with the death of a young man on the train.Never caught my attention. Grant has no reason to think the death was murder and neither his half-hearted investigations nor his interactions with his friends were interesting. I quit about a quarter of the way through the book. The title was clearly relevant to what story there was. I'm glad this was the last book of the series because otherwise I'd be wondering whether to even continue reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the paper it is printed on","review":"This book starts as a travelogue for a part of Scotland and is boring with a totally implausable plot.

This was definitely a tear-jerker in some respects; the story can grab some of the more casual readers. For a die-hard Banksian or sci-fi/fantasy fan, the book is just a mediocre story with only a menial sci-fi element.This is definitely one of the more emotional stories I enjoyed from Banks (akin to Use of Weapons), but it doesn't compare to the space opera epics such as The Algebraist.I would even go so far as to say that Inversions is an acceptable book for those who typically read fantasy and want to become introduced to The Culture series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Culture","review":"This is most definately a Culture novel and to me at least it is the exact opposite of Excessions which focused mostly on the Culture Minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rare Dull Banks Book","review":"Iain Banks's SF books are dense with astonishingly imaginative settings, well filled-out characters and rapid, complex plotting. Inversions has none of these virtues. It is long, ponderous, and dull. The events are slow and predictable. The characters, flat and with the exception of the two protagonists, nearly indistinguishable. The two protagonists are humorless stand-ins for competing opinions about the proper behavior of members of an advanced civilization toward members of a less advanced civilization. There may be a good book possible from this premise but it would need more disciplined and editing than this one shows. I hope that Banks has not become so successful that he thinks that anything he writes is gold and his editors agree. If so, and this book is an example of the result, we may have seen the last of the Banks magic. I will miss that magic but life is too short to slog through books like this in hopes of finding it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring And Completely Uninvolving.","review":"As I begin each chapter in Inversions I think to myself..\\"my god, these characters are boring and this world is unpleasant and dismal. Unless somebody is revealed as a Culture agent and something starts happening I'm out of here.\\"So far no luck. Not sure if I can finish this one. I do believe this book suffers from the Famous Writer Pulls Old Rejected Manuscripts Out of Drawer syndrome."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging and thought-provoking book","review":"Of the science-fiction/fantasy works of Iain M. Banks, this book goes high on my list of favorites. Very engagingly written, with a nicely progressing plot. Both stories are strangely intertwined, so loose yet so connected at the same time. There is a touch of Umberto Eco in the literary style (it does remind me of The Name of the Rose and The Island of the Day Before), with the close observer being biased to portray events as he/she sees it. Next to The Player of Games and Consider Phlebas, this book can be considered a good introduction to the works of Banks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snypin the City","review":"This cd wasnt dat bad.

Ms. Bowen does a good job of thinking up interesting, if completely unbelievable, mysteries. With all the experience she's had in writing, one would think she would be able to create lifelike characters who have realistic conversations, but this is not the case. It is not likely that Daniel would be attracted to Molly, and for a supposedly hard-headed, confident Irishwoman, she puts up with a lot of nonsense from him.If you're not overly picky about the style of your books, and want a quick read that doesn't require deep thinking, this is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANDYSSHOP","review":"SHIPPED FAST, LIKE THE FINGERS FOR THE CABLE TO BE ADDED OR REMOVED AT DIFFERENT SECTIONS OFTHE RUN.

Maybe it is the absence of Dre, but this is his worst album ever. I thought the one he dropped with Master P would be bad, but at least it had a couple of good songs(B**** Please) because Dre dropped the beat, but this album is so not his original style. The beats do not bump at all, everything is so George Clinton-y style. More like a funk style than a hip hop, there are not hard bumping beats or agressive, energetic songs.I have been a DPG listener for years, but snoop seems to have changed. He talks bad about Xzibit and Kurupt. I am so surprised by this album. Kurupt's last album was a lot better than this, if I want to listen to layed back stuff, I should just put on some of Ja Rule's new stuff.Do not buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT PAY THE COST FOR THIS ...","review":"This poorly made and horrible album is reason enough for snoop to retire.All the songs sound the same and he is rapping about the same old tired [material].Without dr dre or suge knight this clown would not even be famous period.The album cover art has got to be the worst ever in history.What am I supposed to be scared or intimidated?Not likely.He made one good cd and the rest of his cds suck big time.This clown needs to retire and be a comedian.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paid Tha Cost to be Da Boss _ Snoop Dog.","review":"Yes, I enjoyed Snoop Dog too.

The production is some of the best I've heard in a Snoop album in quite a while. Fredwreck, the Neptunes, Battlecat, DJ Premiere and the rest have sculpted a wonderful soundscape.

Snoop shines on songs like 'Beautiful', 'Stoplight' and 'Hourglass', and there is a quality collaboration on 'Lollipop'.

Good release."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"After hearing that he was going to release a new album,I was hoping that Snoop Dogg would come back with a nice disc full of hard gangsta stuff and some nice singles. With exception of \\"From The Church To The Palace\\" I wasnt impressed at all by Snoop's latest release. I think Snoop should do some more Girls Gone Wild videos and then when he's done he needs to get with Dr. Dre and make another great album like he did with \\"Doggystyle\\". Snoop's still young and theres still time for him to try even harder and make the best album that he can,but a project like \\"Paid The Cost To Be The Boss\\" wont help him get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snoops still runnin cali!","review":"This cd is one of the Doggfathers best in a while... not a spectacular cd but good enough.

If not then I dontt know if i would reccomend it, although the cd does feature his mainstream hit \\"Beautiful\\" featuring Pharrel of the Neptunes. The cd features a number of solid songs, as well as few songs that you may just want to skip over. Also check out \\"Pimp Slapp'd\\"... yet another Suge Knight diss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolerable","review":"This isnt that great of a cd, compared to all his other albums.

He doesn't have as good beats and hooks, and doesn't have Kokane gracing every other song making them funkier than ever. The two neptunes beats he does have are dumb and repetitive. Don't get me wrong, I'm a really big fan of Bigg Uncle Snoop, but the new album comes as a disapointment. My suggestion: if you don't have The Last Meal, get it. It's one of my all time favorite rap albums. And make for damn sure that you have Doggystyle, every song on that thing is a classic. But as for his other No Limit cd's, skip 'em.

If you want to listen to some bangin' Snoop Doggy music, buy literally any other release by the artist, but this one. \\"Paid the Cost...\\" starts off strong with the two popular singles \\"From the Chuuch to da Palace\\" and \\"Beautiful\\". Further on, there are numerous intriguing collaborations with artists such as Warren G, Pharell, Redman, RBX and s.o. Still, the album lacks content; the beats are often hilarious (in the bad way); there are numeous useless skits and countless spoken phrases, aiming to make the album longer.
