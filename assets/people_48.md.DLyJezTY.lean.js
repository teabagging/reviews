Steve Lattimore, son of the epic translator Richmond Lattimore, is very faithful to the terseness and variatio of the original while producing an eminently readable English version. One is often struck by his choice of the mot juste. Lattimore's introduction and notes are equally impressive: the product of very wide learning and decades of reflection on Thucydidean scholarship and Greek historiography more generally. I invariably assign this translation when teaching Greek history and strongly recommend it to others looking for a close but approachable version. It is equally useful for a basic or an advanced course. Why on earth do not more of the mainstream bookshops sell it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to set up?","review":"This HR monitor was recommended to me.

Also, I appreciate a good sense of humor, but I would hope that the author would aspire for something greater than using silly vocabulary to intrigue the reader.

It gives you some perspective on what can be done with InDesign as the book itself is laid out with the tool.This is not a course book with questions at the end of each chapter. It's a introductory book that starts with the basics of creating documents, and finishes with the management of large documents, like books.

It's good, but lacks the impact of the original package. Unfortunately, the sexy cover art did not break Tanya Tucker into rock radio, and did not win her a big new audience. Deborah Harry and others had taken Rock fans by storm and TNT was seen as just another cute girl who did Country & Western.I think this is Tanya Tucker's best CD. Countty and western fans might disagree -- if they never like 'rock music'. But without the LP cover art, it's just \\"the one you play in the car\\", not the version you pull out at parties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating read","review":"I have read a few of Rand's books and thought they were OK, not great, not terrible, just OK. I was never attracted to the underlying themes in the books or Rand's \\"philosphy\\". I was fascinated, however, by the fact that somehow she has become an icon because of these books and wanted to learn more about her. This book pretty much tells it all-there is no fawning or sugar coating here. She was a nasty woman with some pretty deep rooted mental problems--intelligent, yes, but warped. I cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone with the qualities she admired such as intelligence, free thinking, individualism etc. would ever want anything to do with this cult. She must have had some really potent Kool-Aid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid deconstruction of a fascinating personality","review":"I found this to be a hypnotizing read, so much so that I paused reading another book in order to start this one -- a rare thing for a compulsive like me.Walker has obviously done a lot of research for the book. He quotes both die-hard Objectivists and anti-Objectivists alike. The intimate, personal anecdotes regarding Rand are very interesting.The book is not without flaws, however. Walker is remarkably objective for writing on such an emotional subject, but he can go into Rand-bashing mode occasionally. The cover is an unnecessary gimmick.I would have preferred more depth on the philoosophical roots of her ideas as well as what may have shaped her personality. Walker spends a bit too much time simply describing Rand's temper tantrums instead of looking for the causes of them.Overall, a must-read if you are at all interested in Objectivism in particular or cults in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the relevance?","review":"Walker spent how much time researching this \\"inside baseball\\" nonsense?It is no great secret that Rand could be petty and vindictive, and that she encouraged a cult of personality among her more fervent followers.But what about the millions of readers who loved her books and built core beliefs around her ideas of political and economic freedom? At least 95% of those people never met Rand, have never attended an Objectivist meeting, or frankly ever gave a crap about her personality traits. Yet they were profoundly influenced by her work. This book contributes very little to an understanding of the appeal of her writing, or her core beliefs.And if her work is as mediocre as Walker claims, why does Atlas Shrugged rank - according to the Library of Congress - second only to the Bible as a work that most influenced readers lives?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Fiction","review":"This book has so little to do with fact and reality that it should be classified as a work of fiction. Walker accepts the dishonest attacks on Rand made by the Brandens (recently refuted by scholars) whenever it suits him and, then, ignores anything which might undermine his position. In Walker's view, Rand is warmed-over Nietzsche--the anti-reason, anti-system-building, anti-Aristotle, determinist!! One wonders if Walker ever read Rand. His attack on Peikoff is like school-yard name-calling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to get through","review":"First of all, you must be extremely interested in Objectivism and Rand to want to really read this book....Walker has his moments, some of it is funny, the Greenspan chapter is priceless (I could live without hearing about the particular contortions of the \\"market\\" at particular times). But, basically, he is a neo-Objectivist and the criticism of Rand is hardly scathing...I think, perhaps, if Walker had been around when the Collective was forming, he might have been one of the Inner Circle himself. If you detest Rand's ideas (I think they have done enormous harm to world economies), as I do, and are looking for something that breaks down her \\"theories\\" in any serious way, this book is not what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic attempt to discredit Ayn Rand","review":"All I can say to anyone wanting to read this book or have read it is to actually read Rand's works.

O no, not one, but many cults - political, religious, ideological. I wish this kind of a writing comes as less of a propaganda work with personal attacks than a scholarly work.When I was in Vietnam service in 1960's, we received a gift book-box for the troop. I could not stop reading her 'Fountainhead' in it until I finished. (I was then not a native English speaker). It made me think and question. (We think, therefore we are human beings. More than that, \\"I question, therefore I exist.\\")As to Ayn's works, no one will not be disappointed for time spent, whether one is against her idea or not.

I won't put money in Mr. Walker's pocket. I was introduced to Atlas Shrugged late in life. I don't belong to a cult. I am one of the producers - a Dagny Taggart - a fierce individualist.

Not to mention, the only testimony he offers is from excommunicated objectivists.If anyone's irrational, it's Walker. He spends 90% of the book on opinionated rants about her personal character, hardly touching on objectivism. If I didn't know better, I'd say he was excommunicated himself (that or an altruist zealot). The only thing he succeeds in proving is that Rand was egotistical (which she prided herself on, by the way).This is less a book, than a cheesy tabloid article. He should stick to writing about space men and the women who love them. If you're looking for an honest third party opinion of objectivism, this isn't it.

As Rand herself said, read her works yourself and then you judge their validity using _your own mind_.Don't you find it interesting that these writers never address her philosophy, but they only seem to address issues dear to their hearts, it seems, like cults?Read Atlas Shrugged!

Thorough and well-documented, Walker addresses point-by-point Rand's philosophy and fictions as well as those of her acolytes, who do indeed appear to constitute a \\"cult\\" as Walker's title names them. Particularly interesting (and often hilarious) is Walker's painstaking archaeology of the sources of Rand's texts, not only in her idiosyncratic readings of the philosophic tradition (although, as Walker notes, she was not much of a reader of primary sources), but, especially, in the popular (though typically now obscure) fictions and films of her day. A must read for anyone interested in Rand, pro or con.

Yet his book is simply a dumping ground for insults, where one source contradicts another, and where Walker contradicts himself. After endless anti-Rand vituperation, we find at the end, in a bizarre fable of Rand's life lived differently, that if she had only been a bit more nurturing, then she would deserve to be considered a major American thinker.

The Amazon review says printing on a PC is a hassle - not unless you know your way around XP. But the spooling software is NUTS and very slow. Moreover, the consumables are not cheap. I used to catch deals at Circuit City, now I have to buy online. I would not buy a used EasyShare. I am considering junking this machine - literally. It would be bad karma if I sold this machine to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible printer","review":"This will be my last Kodak product. This printer was very lightly used.

Both times, I purchased the printer docks to accommodate my spouse, who wanted to print pictures using the easiest method possible. I spent a lot of time patching, uninstalling, and reinstalling software on both docks, and got them to work at least some of the time. I gave up on the earlier dock when I could not get it to work with XP, SP2. The new dock (this model) worked for a while, then the paper tray started refusing to install correctly. It does not click into place, and my computer perceives it as either a paper jam, or not installed at all. I get along fine with a Canon photo printer I have had for years--nary a problem, software or hardware-wise. My advice is to buy a QUALITY printer like Canon makes and steer clear of this Kodak JUNK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice addition to a Kodak Digital Camera","review":"I purchased this printer dock to use with my Kodak EasyShare DX7590. So far, with the pictures I have printed, I have been very satisfied. No jams, no lines, no bends...just good quality photos. I wouldn't recommend however if a person has a lot of pictures to print to use the photo printer, it would probably be more beneficial to print them through an online retailer or take it to store as CVS or Target to print them out.

The pictures are okay, but everytime I print one there is an annoying line running up the left side. Sometimes stray colors get splattered on the image. And when the paper comes out of the printer it catches on the corner, so every picture I've done has an annoying little bend in it.You're much better off taking your camera to a local drug or department store that has one of the big Kodak developing machines you can operate yourself. Those work great and the photos are much cheaper. As for this unit, I can only urge you strongly to forget it. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I purchased this to replace the one I bought approx. 3 years ago.

It is fabulous for printing pictures at home as long as you have a techie geek in the house. I love the concept--kudos to Kodak for that--but, mechanically things go haywire all the time. The paper doesn't feed right, the display will tell me the ink needs changed even after I change it, now it prints with a blurry edge of red, yellow and blue covering 2 inches of the picture. Of course, all these problems occured after the warranty ran out. Thank goodness my husband is a computer geek and has helped me when these problems pop up frequently. We still can't fix the blurry edge. After contacting Kodak several times, their only solution is to mail my printer in to them and pay them $80 to \\"see\\" what the problem is. No telling how much it will actually cost to fix it.

The printer is always a little quirky, requiring constant alcohol-cleaning of the paper pick-up roller. Now it only prints 40% of a photo no matter what we do. I was very pleased with the photo quality when it did print, though especially considering the wasted prints, they were very, very expensive. The camera has had frustrating issues as well.

Very quickly however, the paper would not pick up to feed into the dock. Contacting Kodak is a waste of time. I was a fool, and purchased a \\"used\\" one on eBay. It arrived in its original packing and looked brand new. Nothing had been opened, including the ink ribbon and paper. I was busy and didn't have time to use it. When I did.....I discovered too late that this one had the SAME PROBLEM AS MY FIRST ONE!! Now I have 2 expensive pieces of junk setting here and I don't know what to do with them.

At $38.00 a cartridge, this is expensive.I finally contacted Kodak, they apoligized. They told me they discontinued my unit.

Printed nice pictures but then all of a sudden I see I am having to change the cartridge every time I turn around. So I am not gettieng the promised 40 pictures. It more like 28 pictures maybe 30 from each cartridge. Whats odd is I can take out the cartridge and pull on it a couple of times and there is a ton of film still left on the cartride. Looks like the cartridges are very cheaply made.

When the printer arrived my wife took and printed two photos using the 10 photo cartridge that came with the printer. The picture quality was very good and I told her I would buy an additional cartidge. As things often happen I did not get around to ordering the cartridge until last month. To my dismay I learned that Kodak only sells the cartridge bundled with paper and even at Amazon prices the cost a 4X6 print comes to 50 cents.

For one, it is extemely expensive per print even if it worked perfectly. Being that it doesnt work perfectly, it makes the cost per print absolutely awful. Lets face it, now that digital cameras now take better pictures (at 4 Megapixels) than do film cameras, it forces Kodak to try and make exorbitant profits off of digital. How to do that??

The warning comes up on the LCD screen to replace the cartridge when you have only used about 18 pictures. What a waste of money. Also, there is a frequent warning on the LCD screen that insults your intelligence to ADD MORE PAPER. Here you want your pictures instantly only to have your hopes ruined. I notified Kodak about this problem. The CSR told me to connect the printer dock to have updated software added. I did as prescribed, but it did no good!

When his children disappoint him by not agreeing to a family reunion beach-side holiday in Sicily, he packs his bag and boards a train to go visit each of them, for the very first time. As he travels to Naples, Rome, and Milan, trying to surprise each child with his visit, he is the one surprised to find that as the film's ironic title suggest \\"Everybody is not Fine\\". Despite the bittersweet realities Matteo Scuro is faced with, the film has much humour and the character of Matteo, charmingly played by the legendary Marcello Mastroianni, is totally enchanting. Entertaining film that will make you think about life, about our expectations of those we love, and about what's really important."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAYBE IT DELIVERS MAIL BETTER THAN IT LIGHTS OUR GARDEN","review":"It's nice looking, but even when it got full sun all day, its shell was never very bright at night.

His Dvorak cycle is superb and brings out inner voices never before heard by this listener and is competetive with Kertesz and Kubelik. The Slovak PO and the radio band fron Bratislava perform well and have the advantage of more rehearsal time which allows conductors to more heavily imprint their own interpretations. With the first and second symphonies you also get the hard to find Legends complete. Naxos not only offers good value but a superb performance. ALso try Gunzenhauser's Taniev 4th if you can find it - it was once on Marco Polo. Only complaint I have with Naxos is I've never seen a complete catalog that stayed put.Emil Franzi, Tucson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one?","review":"This book came highly recommended from a friend and it was pure let down!

Of course a poor relationship with a child's mother is no excuse for a man to ignore his duties as a father, but this is never mentioned.

Fed Up With The Fanny is an entertaining and provocative debut novel from Franklin White. The gritty characters and real-life situations are what make Fed Up such a page-turning and interesting read. Fed Up was filled with shocking and surprising plot twist and turns, which at times seemed over the top and out in left field. Along the way we encountered a host of taboo and sensitive issues which added drama and spice to the storyline. Fed Up will keep you turning the pages, hoping the time wouldn't fly so quickly, and when the last page is read you will be satiated.

The actual story was decent and interesting, but my issue is the way in which White told the story. There were not enough descriptions and imagery to carry the story. It lacked depth of character and scenery. It also lacked an advanced vocabulary.Kahill was an educated man and his vocabulary did not match. Espcially when they introduced Waylis...his language did not represent a president of a company. I also thought that there were too many stories. He should have chosen one or two stories to tell in this novel and made a sequel or just another book. So all in all I would recommend this novel only if the reader is interested in a predictable and very easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY EXCITING","review":"I think this book was exciting from the very first page!

I think the author really touched on a variety of subject matters, one in particular how black men try despretely to help their families as much as they can after they have made something of their lives but too many times family members do not listen to what they have to say. I also liked the fact that the main character really explained what he thought was right concerning the subject of homosexual relationships and raising a child.

The Conscious Exploration of Dreaming, by my husband Jay Vogelsong and myself, details observations and experiments from our own extensive lucid dream accounts and places them into the framework of a relatively little-known perceptual theory of dreaming. We critique many popular notions about lucid dreaming and dreaming in general, and attempt to integrate our ideas with modern sleep and dream research. Though laboratory research has largely superseded psychoanalytic thought in explaining dream generation, ordinary people may have difficulty relating such research to their own personal experiences with dreaming. We hope that our book will help to bridge this gap."},{"rating":"1","title":"misrepresentation in title and picture","review":"I ordered this watch (Shoppingzulla was the actual vendor) and believed it was a strap watch as advertised.

It is hard to believe that the person who wrote this book even read the previous books in the series. There are some new phrases such as \\"et cetera\\" that are used by several different characters and were never used in any of the prior books in the series.

Then if you have seen any map of the Korean War, you will notice his similarities in comparisions of the displacement of the front lines around Pusan. This is a good book with a comparision to the past and other books, but it needs reality... its almost as if NATO and the joint US-ROK forces can't stop the communists... at all until Superman(Gen.

Freeman is a combination of all the generals in WWII and Stormin' Norman..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Realistic!","review":"Ian Slater has written an excellent book.

Suddenly, without explanation, we're back to Communist China and fighting them again! There are hundreds of other small, annoying facts, but you can't help but wonder what exactly Ian Slater was thinking of when he wrote this book. Did he somehow forget what he'd spent the past half decade writing? The sudden amnesia he showed in this bok is why I haven't picked up any of the USA vs. Militia series. The only saving grace for this book is that, when removed for the rest of the series, it was a somewhat decent book, even with the inaccuracies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slater needs to do his homework.","review":"This series of books has continually frustrated me. People that he kills come back to life, air-to-air missile's are suddenly surface-to-air. He build's upon a story throughout his series yet he dosn't remember what he has already written in his previous books. The first book is good but it gets successfully worse after that. Case in point, the Submarine USS Regan supposidly sinks but then comes back to life. A submarine captain automatically becomes a SEAL and then returns to life as a captain. His premise and story line are good but his details and homework stink. It ruins the whole series. Don't waste your time, try Larry Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read better, read worse","review":"WW III presents a scenario, that if you failed politicalscience 101, might seem realistic. Plenty of action, butlots of poltical and military inaccuracies that were obviouseven when WW III was published in 1990 such as: Slater pointsout that the Berlin Wall has fallen, but for some reasondecides to say that Germany is still divided into 2 countries.Also, in the text he portays an AH-1 Cobra helicopter witha GAU-8 gun (the GAU-8 is mounted only on the A-10)!I didn't particularly appreciate the incredible amount oftypos, either.But, if you're willing to ignore all of these defects(I couldn't), WW III would be a top-notch read."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book really sucks","review":"After reading the entire WW III series I read this book and I must say unlike the other seven great books this one was no good. I only liked three charachters in South China Sea. Those being Marte Price, The oil rigg worker I forgot his name, and General Freeman.Freeman was carried over from the first set of books. This book had nothing to do with the series at all and the publisher who didn't tell Slater to keep in the theme of the original series is probably out of a job. I loved the other WW III novels and I like the USA VS Militia series so far but don't waste your money on South China Sea"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research","review":"The author attempts to write a \\"Tom Clancy\\" novel but without the research. Military thrillers usually need a certain level of technical competance to be sucessful and this book is strongly lacking. From the moment that the books mentions a US Tank platoon having 3 tanks and using \\"shoe\\" rounds (should be 4 tanks and the rounds are called SABOT). I lost all faith and took to skipping whole pages in the book. After all, if an author is going to write a book, it should not be too hard to open one and read it. The author obviously never did this. The plot was predictable and lacked imagination. Over all, a waste of my time.

I was moved often and never bored. Some pieces are especially funny and poke fun at popular culture and politics.A great book. I wish I could hear the poems performed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I have been a big fan of Ragan's via his podcast Fox and The City - check it out on Itunes - for many of his earlier shows he includes poems in this book and as the other reviewer states - hearing it performed makes the poems come alive with emotion. Great book - get it and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never thought I'd read poetry....","review":"I never thought I'd read a book of poetry, much less buy one...

Selby articulately explains the concepts presented in this book, there just aren't enough exercises for you to \\"teach yourself\\" the subject. A given section on plane geometry will give you about 15 abstract principles followed by 5 easy practice exercises. I have learned from this book, but in order to do so, I've had to make flashcards and do lots and lots of rereading to help me memorize the vocabulary and rules. This book would be okay for someone who just needs a quick refresher, but if you really want to learn the material, I would suggest buying separate 350-400 page books for each subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"good as a companion only","review":"If you want to test your knowledge of geometry and trig after reading another text book, this is good.

The book does not even mention the most important point of CDT which is manual lymphatic drainage (MLD).I do not recommend the book.

To me, contrary to an above review, Mr. Richardson is not really trying to clear his father of anything... he was trying to learn about someone he loved very much... for good and bad. It's about how often during that age we grew up with parents which often we know so precious, and I do mean precious, little about. It's seeing our own flaws and theirs... may the days of \\"Secrets and Lies (film directed by M. Leigh)\\" STOP!A Memoir isn't about accuracy nor heroism...it's about love/understanding life.

It is a wonderfully written memoir about John H. Richardson, written by his son. It really stimulated my interest in American history of the last 60 years. I was fascinated by the behind the scenes intrigue that the US intelligence organizations engage in. This country has been incredibly fortunate to have people like Richardson on our side during these very complicated foreign relations/policy episodes. The book also goes into great detail about Richardson's private life and death, this added a deep and heartwarming aspect to the extensively researched and accurately reported storyline. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it was easy to read and immensely engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Father the Spy; an intriguing memoir","review":"I found My Father the Spy to be an intriguing,finely written memoir exploring the dynamics of family, country and the internal workings of the CIA. The author takes the reader from World War II, through the turbulent Vietnam era to Watergate and beyond. He explains the burst of behavior against the sadness of his father and his generation during the 60's and 70's and raises questions about current affairs.It's written in an honest and sensitive way, drawing the reader into personal,realistic details of family life.Richard has made this book difficult to put down, combining mystery and realism so well.I found myself thinking about this book long after I read the last page and highly recommend it to readers of all ages.5 stars!Barbara G.

I'm going to have to lower my trust in Jon Stewart a notch. One useful piece of advice I've received is not to be afraid to cut bait on a book that you don't really like. So after about 150 pages, I calling it quits with this one.This book is supposed to recount the author's experience of growing up with a father in the CIA but it reads like a history lecture--and a dull one at that. I'm not sure why Richardson writes as though he's trying to distance himself from the narrative as much as possible. I'm not sure why anyone outside of his immediate family or friends would be interested in this book: the personal narrative lacks warmth and emotion and the anecdotes only hint at the gripping spy stories a lifetime of Tom Clancy has prepared me for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lexol is the best all round leather conditioner - hands down!","review":"I have been using lexol for years.

I bought the book at the recommendation of a fellow writer when I was looking for a book that combined 1st and 3rd person narration. If I could get a refund, I would.

Robbins writings jump from section to section, character to charcter, event to event, time frame to time frame with every paragraph, leaving the reader confused and disorientated. We are left asking \\"Has this happened yet? Who are these people? What does THIS have to do with anything?\\" Sadly, these questions often go unanswered.

However, this novel is vacuous, naive, disingenuous and altogether empty. Robbins attempts to employ a kind of Socratic dialogue to legitimize his rants against (amongst many other things) authority and pedantry, but he does so in the most authoritarian and pedantic manner one might imagine!

The Zillers are traveling around searching for the perfect place to put up a zoo of sorts. When they pass an old run down Mom and Pop's, they had to buy it. The zoo is made up of 15 San Francisco garter snakes, a flea circus, a bowlegged chicken, a dead fly, and butterflies. This book is very confusing, and I do not recommend anybody reading it. The book jumps around from page to page, and goes on for 40 or 50 pages about nothing relevant. The writer uses words that a normal person would not use and then goes on for a page explanining the word. This book has got to be the worst written and flowing book I have ever read.

The book is fun, the writing amusing, the ideas interesting, but as a whole, the book fails to deliver the grand epiphany it builds to (ok, this is where all you rabid Robbins fans press the not helpful button). I imaging Mr. Robbins, sitting at his typewriter when he wrote this, grinning to himself and saying, \\"wow, this is great!\\" Well . . . Not great, but four stars good, a bit pretentious and what may have seemed original twenty years ago now just seems dated. But so what.

The first 50-60 pages are confusing, but the characters keep you going; I love Amanda's quotes (\\"There's no word for what I'm going to be when I grow up,\\"). Robbins' brilliant similes will keep a smile on your face the whole way. I've read almost all of Robbins' books, and this is by far the best I've read.

I've read so many wonderful reviews of Tom Robbins books. I'm sure I'm in the minority. This book was recommended to me as a good one to read first. It will also be my last.I just don't like his style of writing. He jumps all over the place. His characters are overly sexed and talk to animals.I am not an illiterate. I have a graduate degree and enjoy reading contemporary litterature as well as the classics. I Just don't enjoy this very \\"1960's\\" style of writing. My advice to anyone that has not read any of Tom Robbins books is to take one out of the library before you invest money in one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Juice","review":"Having read a couple of previous books by TR I am very disappointed by ARA. There is no story here and while Robbins tries to mask his lack of inspiration by inserting little divertiments such as catholic ninja monks, chariot-driving fleas and the corpse of Jesus Christ, the tricks do not really work; to me they simply appear crude and uninspired. The plot is disorganized, the writing is sloppy and the ideas tired.

Hearing it again and again, and dozens more times after that, peels back seemingly endless layers of melodic intellect that never let the listener grow tired.This was one of those precious few LPs/CDs I've bought for one song, in this case \\"Life in a Northern Town,\\" only to discover that it's just the opening act in a treasure chest of music that massages the imagination.This CD will wow you, big time.

Alas, if it wasn't for LINT, this album would have faded into total obscurity long ago. Perhaps you may, like the other reviewers, find pleasure in the other songs on this collection.

But for all that, it's surprisingly well written and provides some real insight into the problems behind XP - and how to fix them.Chapter 15 (the XP Refactored chapter) is worth the price of the book alone, IMHO. But there are snippets of genuine insight (whole pages, in fact) throughout the book. In places, it adopts the air of an experienced consultant sharing hard-won knowledge on how best to develop software.In other places, the book lightens its tone with some satire and sarcasm (some of which had me laughing out loud). As long as you know the authors are laughing along with XP, not directly against it (as some people seem to think), it all works, and works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than I expected","review":"Having seen some of the reviews here about the book having bad humor and being a non-objective backlash full of ad hominem, my hopes weren't high. But as a 12-year professional software developer, I found the book to be quite good: it gives a meaty, objective analysis of the many flaws with XP, in an entertaining way. The sardonic humor helps give emotional heft to the criticisms, and there are so many serious criticisms to make of XP that without the humor the book would have seemed very negative and heavy indeed. By the way, the numerous parodies and song-manglings are clearly marked and easily skipped, if you just want to get on with business.The authors also do not shy away from giving XP credit over and over, and the book never seemed unfair to me.

What I found instead were copious amounts of sarcasm, irrelevant song lyrics, and enough icons and sidebars to make you lose track of the topic. To this you add a plethora of out-of-context quotes, web screen prints, and tales from disgruntled practitioners and you start hoping that you will soon get to the counter-proposal so that you can finally understand what the authors have to offer. After having read fourteen chapters (about time since the book only contains 16), you finally get to \`Refactoring XP'...I am sorry to report that this chapter did not make up for the rest of the book.

Besides the numerous flaws and mis-statements the authors are having such fun laughing at themselves that the reader cannot take this book as a serious discussion of the flaws and pitfalls of XP. There are a few passages where they honestly have some insight and as I turn the pages I just want to believe that they will uncover a pitfall and some ways around - instead they fall back to some form of bad \\"Bob and Tom\\" show.I would like to suggest that the authors stick to comedy since they wrote a failure of a CS book - but if this represents their best effort at comedy maybe something the fast food industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic Backlash Book, Short On Useful Information","review":"When you get new fads in technology, some adherents act like zealots, and a backlash takes shape in response. Java and XP have been good examples of this dynamic over the last few years.This book is a manifestation of the anti-XP backlash. It's very intemperate in tone, verging on the hectoring. Lots of rhetoric. So much so that the substance is hard to discern.It's a shame, because there are many valid criticisms of XP. It doesn't work for huge projects, and it's very high-discipline for starters. But the tone of this book means that it won't change anyone's mind. An XP fan will view it as snide. An XP hater will view it as wonderful. And the majority will shrug, chuck the book aside, and get on with their lives.If you do want to look at a reasoned comparison of methodologies, you could do worse than try Alistair Cockburn - I've found him quite useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to be taken seriously","review":"The software world does need intelligent, thoughtful debate about development methods, including XP. Unfortunately, there is very little in this book, which consists mainly of wild conjecture, misinformation, and sophomoric ridicule.Please, as we all try to figure out the best way to produce good systems, and to have software projects succeed much more often than they fail, can we try to keep the debate at an adult level?"},{"rating":"1","title":"modestly useful; self-indulgent and hate-filled","review":"This book presents some interesting thoughts on XP and some possibly useful suggestions on how to temper some of the more extreme practices in XP. However, it's full of unsubstantiated opinion, inaccurate statements, and unnecessary vitriol. If you hate XP and are looking for sympathy, you'll enjoy the venom in this book. But if you're looking for reasoned criticisms and objective insights, this is not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing really constructive","review":"This book makes an easy criticism of extreme programming. It is funny at times but you feel underneath the writing of two over architecturing programmers who were scared of going the extra mile and being a little constructive with their criticism.There is no useful information in this book, just some fun poking at misleading interpretations of extreme programming.If you are an ego filled, spaghetti coder, searching for an excuse to poke fun of the daring new generation of cooperative programmers stealing your job.

However this is probably the best place to start if you want to explore classic Dr Feelgood. Indeed, the band is very very tight. Wiko Jonhson's guitar plaing is excellent.

It never recognized/detected my iPod. After reading the reviews here, I went to CopyPod. That program worked like a charm. Recognized the iPod instantly. It was almost as easy to use CopyPod as it is to use iTunes in the first place. I would definitely recommend CopyPod over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as promised","review":"Given all the negative reviews, I had to chime in. This software did exactly what it said, and what I wanted it to do...which was to allow me to transfer my music both to and from my ipod. Nothing more, nothing less. Granted, I'm not a computer whiz, but I actually have a job and wasn't able to spend any more than 30 minutes (to no avail) fiddling with free downloads or shareware before the $19.95 for 'tune transfer' was imminently worth very penny.

What they DON'T want is for songs purchased from itunes to be transferrable to any other computer, which could diminish download sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's This For?","review":"Save your $20, Please... This thing does the same thing as iTunes. If you already have an iPod, it should have come with iTunes software.

One good example is that the author spends all of one page on John Quincy Adams' election to the presidency. It is remarkable that he can detail the lives of these four men, who lived through and indeed shaped some of the most memorable periods in American history without conveying any of the excitement or grandeur of these remarkable men. Perhaps the author was on assignment or had a contract to fill because his dry, somewhat sarcastic style leaves one wondering why he bothered at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat, Not-too-filling, but Ultimately Biased","review":"For a quick and dirty basic description of the famous sons of Adams, feel free to indulge in this quick and easy read. As other have indicated, it generally lacks anything unique from other works on the family, with the exception of Brookheiser's commentary. It is, as with his other works, very well written.It is plainly evident from this work and his others that Brookheiser isn't a big fan of John Adams and his progeny. For example, he clearly states that of the six presidents, only two were not reelected; John and John Quincy. Of the three presidents who did not attend their replacements' inauguration, two were Adams. These are true facts, but placed in the context of this book and the general tone of its writing, it is evident he is less than enamored with this family. He is entitled to his opinion, which at times is very well presented, but it reads more as a USA Today editorial than a piece of historical non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"I eagerly awaited the release of this book, but I must say that I am somewhat disappointed with it. Firstly, I found the book to be very confusing. I'm an intelligent person, but I simply couldn't follow it. Facts (as well as many suppositions) were there, but I found that none of it made a cohesive whole. Regarding the suppositions, I am getting more than a little annoyed an non-fiction works that use terminology such as \\"could have\\" \\"might have been,\\" \\"probably\\", etc. instead of stating actual facts. My maxim is, if you don't know for sure, don't put it down on paper. This was a good idea for a book, but I feel that it fell far short of its mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased history","review":"I'll give it one star because it does offer a concise (maybe all too brief) summary of these men's times. Other than that, it's weak. You can tell it's written by a journalist: almost like articles, the chapters are hurried, crammed and tilted toward the journalist's politics. As someone else noted, his compliments to John and John Quincy are backhanded. And I was stunned - so stunned in fact I had to read it over and over just to believe it- that Brookhiser describes Buchanan as a \\"gracious, gutless homosexual\\". And his (supposed) homosexuality has ...what?... to do with his politics? And he was gutless because he was a supposed homosexual? Don't waste your money. Read McCullough or Henry Adams instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Additional Information","review":"This book is for anyone who read David McCullough's biography of John Adams, and wants to go alittle further in their research and reading of the Adams family. The book discusses John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Charles Francis Adams, and Henry Adams.I wanted to learn more about John Quincy's children and grandchildren, and more about the dynamics of the Adams family. This book takes the reader through the early 1900s. There is an Adams family connection to the Titanic. Read the book to find out what that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"America's First Dynasty: The Adames","review":"Mr. Brookhiser dedicates this book to William F. Buckley, Jr. From that point forward, the entire book becomes his editorial on conservatism. He constantly tries to compares issues from the 18th century to today and to justify actions taken by today's conservatives as being mandated by past events. I have read hundreds of biographies, including Brookhiser's work on George Washington. This is the most one sided and least scholarly effort I have seen to date. Frankly, he should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure mainstream media bullish*t","review":"To the reviewers who say things like \\"she mentions real punk bands like Rancid, Green Day, and the Offspring\\" Get your thumb out of your butt. I was shocked at this book's inability to mention ONE real punk band who exists after 1985. The punk scene is thriving, with bands like The Casualties, The Unseen, Aus-Rotten, and Stratford Mercinaries not forgetting their roots, cutting their hair, and cleaning up their sound to attain commercial viability. Nirvana and the rest lost all their creditability the minute they traded in their souls and beliefs for a new model car and a giant home. This book does nothing but perpetuate the myth that punk is commercial radio crap. Up The Punx!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No real punk reviewed here!","review":"This book is well-written and well intentioned, but basically is well, pretty boring. There are no real punk bands represented here! The last good real punk band hasn't been around for quite some time(insert '70's genuises here). The Offspring?! You have to be kidding! They couldn't find punk if you spotted them the \`p\` and the \`k\`!One note: Punk is about attitude, true, but it's supposed to be about music,lest we forget!

I'm afraid not.If you're interested in that, however, it's not a bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book About Punk!!!","review":"Please stay away from this book, it is badly written, her ideas makes no sense.

Theresa works for the wealthy folk around her area, looking after their toddlers and sometimes walking and taking care of the owners pets.She is so tender towards her cousin Daisy's, it's totally touching. Meet Flora the toddler who is constantly under her care and whose father is a painter, and quite attracted to Theresa.....the Morans kids of Janey, Judy, JuneTony and Petey and the Kaufmans, the Swansons and the rest of the neighborhood.The story line was interesting and the characters more so, but it's a book that will keep you turning the pages as you will want to know what happens to these lovely children who spend their days on the beach and who dream about fairies and lollipops on weeping cherry trees.A good holiday read.Reviewed by Heather MarshallJanuary 15th, 2003"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Story???","review":"This book is a quick read, but it's very dull and hard to believe. Theresa acts like a zombie - I'm still not sure how a fifteen year old could relate to children so well - in fact, be very much like them, yet in the next scene, let this 70-year-old man make sexual advances or let Dr. Kauffman run on with his seductive song & dance. To spend the entire summer with her cousin and yet react to her death like she was someone she hardly knew. Most 15-year-olds tend to overreact in such situations. I kept waiting for the story to begin - something to remember, but this book is terribly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, right","review":"I muttered throughout this whole entire book. Doesn't Theresa have anyone her own age to hang out with? With an ego like Theresa's it is no wonder she only has babies, dogs, 70 year old men and street urchins to keep her company. Who her age would want to be around her? This story has great potential at the beginning then quickly takes a nose dive. Let Charming Billy be your introduction to Alice McDermott and leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just finished child of my heart","review":"I really liked the whole idea of this book. I am Theresa the one who takes care of everone elses children. And i can see how my influences has made more of an impact on the children than that of the parents. I grew up on long island and the way Mcdermott describes it is true, all the rich people pay others to raise their children( i can say this because i am the one they pay.)Like i said I liked the idea of the book, however I did not like the book. The events were vague and left to the readers imagination. What really happened between Theresa and the artist? I also didnt like how throughout the book they built up Theresa and Daisy's relationship, and at the end Thresa showed no emotion about her cousins death. When an author builds up something so much the reader should feel emotion along with the characters, I however showed no emotion. If Theresa cried I may have cried with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunday afternoon read","review":"This is the type of book I would (and did) read on a boring, lazy Sunday afternoon. It's short, lyrical in places and somewhat intriguing. I only gave it two stars because it has obvious flaws.Some reviewers have said that Theresa, the protagonist, comes across as much too wise and smart for 15. I was like that myself, so I couldn't see it as much. What I could see was Flora, the baby, being extremely articulate and acting like an adult herself. The author puts Theresa's voice into all of the characters and doesn't really distinguish them well after that.The ending was the other major flaw of this book. It was contrived and rushed at best. I realise the author is trying for that simple, innocent, dream-like quality, but instead the ending is vague and pointless. (Yes, I did catch the extremely obvious part with the baby rabbits. I thought it was overdone.)I didn't care for this author at all. From this book, I can't see how she won any awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess we missed it?","review":"This was our bookclub selection for Feb....and it was unanimous, no one liked the book...in fact we didn't even want to talk about the book at the meeting, which is unusual for this group of book lovers. We tend to stay focused on the book we've just read. I found it uninteresting. I didn't like Theresa, the artist or his absent wife. There was no depth in explaining or analyzing the characters and what made them tick. Why were Theresa's parents so out of touch with their daughter? What was with the artist? What was with the Moran family? No babysitter is that perfect! What were Theresa's hopes and dreams...lots of unanswered questions about the characters and too much flowery descriptions about the setting. I knew I had to read the book for our bookclub meeting..but it took great effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, great setting, wonderful characters","review":"Didn't want this book to end. I felt like I was living with the characters, rather than reading about them. While it was a sometimes sad and poignant book, it gave me an uplifting feeling that's hard to explain. I read a lot, and this book is right up there as one of my favorite works of fiction. Subtle in its message, it is beautifully written and a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alice in Wonderland","review":"This book was a disappointment after the first 50 pages....I guess that once you are famous anything can get published ....there was no recognizable character in this novel.The main character is obviously a loner, conceited and self-centered....seducing a 70 year old man and not revealing a child's medical condition because she's be parted from her makes her selfish....read Charming Billy and then stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOME GOOD; SOME REALLY DULL","review":"A sluggish evocation of a teen ager's summer in the Hamptons. Theresa is an unworldly 15 year old. She spends the summer months caring for a younger cousin, Daisy, who is on the edge of a fatal illness. Together they work at minding the children and pets of the rich, Some passages come to life, but there are many pages of dull minutiae. This should have been a short story, told in 12 pages of the New Yorker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and motionless...","review":"This is almost as bad as Charming Billy, in which McDermott makes a laughable attempt to get inside an alcoholic mind. She doesn't understand yet that no matter how 'pretty' the language is, it amounts to nothing if the story doesn't propel you forward. I'm not talking Tom Clancy compel, nor Scott Turow compel - but even the most 'literary' novel has to have some forward movement, and give the reader some reason to turn pages. McDermott hasn't learned this simple principle yet; she's too wrapped-up in prettification for its own sake. Instead of using language as a tool to tell a story, she lets language control her narrative. Gimme the energy of Joyce Carol Oates any day. Despite the reviewers going dumbly ga-ga, I find nothing of any substance in this book at all. I hope Alice takes a sabbatical soon...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Alice McDermott has such skill with prose. Why oh why did she not put a little more effort into character motivation? How could this 15 year old girl be such a saint, so self-assured? Why would she let a 70 creepy drunk touch her? The foreshadowing in the book was extremely heavy handed. And yet, some of the descriptive passages were so perfectly crafted, I was in awe of the sheer muscle of her writing. This will never be counted among her best novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child of my Heart","review":"15 year old Theresa, nanny to the wealthy on Long Island, comes off as Mary Poppins or Peter Pan.Everything she does, she does perfectly, and all the children and animals in her care love her more than their own families. She is evidently very beautiful and she knows it. I found the book dull. It was very flat. I never felt anything at all in reading this book. No joy, sadness, anger, humor....nothing! Theresa spoke of everything that occurred, including Daisy's situation, and the experience with the old man, in the same matter of fact tone that she used when speaking of going to the beach or walking the dogs.Perhaps I'm a little too old and that this book would appeal primarily to young adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not hold my attention","review":"This is the first review I've felt compelled to write, but I just wanted to warn readers not to bother with this book. Usually I have a broad range of interests and read most anything, but this was one book in which I struggled to make it to page 62, and then finally had to give up altogether. The characters themselves are not well developed, and the plot never goes anywhere. Definitely not a book to read if you want a book that immediately draws you in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to be lterary; is only boring","review":"If I had not been reading this book on CD in the car, I never would have gotten past page 10. It's only the reader's soothing voice that kept me going. The story is completely predictable, except for the 15 year old deciding to have sex with a gross 70 year old man! (Is this where the writer thinks she is some great literary artist??) NO 15-year-old on the face of the earth is interested in children enough to spend her entire summer babysitting, or in having sex with 70 year old men with \\"paper-thin skin.\\" The main character does not exist, anywhere. Nothing to relate to. Truly one of the worst books ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"brillliant","review":"I had no interest in the setting for this novel--a high school girl babysitting for assorted types in an upper class Long Island town. But the writer is so good at creating characters and dialogue that I was hooked. You feel that you are inside the relationships she is creating. Her characters are really alive, in that you never know what they will do, how they will resolve the tensions of their lives. They seem to be free, like 'real' people.McDermott simply is a very good writer. Try 'That Night' as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing that goes down as smoothly as the best dark chocolate","review":"McDermott writes masterfully. I don't typically especially love coming-of-age novels, or novels about babysitters (all that selfless nurturing of needy young children), but this book drew me in and held me, and although I could see what was going to happen, all the little portents and poetic metaphors worked beautifully. For a non-believer like me, I wouldn't say it was an uplifting book, but I relished every word of it. Real, soothing, deep, and full of love, which is all we have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to my taste","review":"I really expected to like this book. I normally enjoy books that get inside the head of a female protagonist. But this one left me cold. It's the story of Theresa, a beautiful 15 year old living in Long Island who looks after the neighborhood children and animals over the summer. She is also charged with the care of her eight year old cousin, Daisy.The pace is VERY slow and the book takes a long time to get going. To me, Theresa (the narrator) never felt real. She seemed too mature to be only 15. Her smug confidence in her beauty and its power irritated me, as did her passive observations of so much around her. Nor did her actions seem particularly believable.Books that I think captured this age better were \\"The way I found her\\" by Rose Tremain and \\"Joy School\\" by Elizabeth Berg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad budget game at all!","review":"First, I play budget games. I enjoy seeing what the smaller developers are doing, and this game does not dissapoint. That being said, Ive also played (and loved) most every NFS game since Hot Pursuit 2 (except porche unleashed, dumb franchise to pick). If you can get this game for around 10$, dont hesitate to play. The cutscenes are kinda lame, the cars arent licensed, the music is OK at best (mute it and play something from another media player). The actual gameplay is great. There are tons and tons of upgrades to purchase, a great physics engine with damage model for the cars and some pretty good graphics.

Also, it is very hard (wood) and not something a person would typically hand to a child who lacks the motor skills to shake it anyway.The onesie's snaps are not as well reinforced as are most of the commercially available brand onesie's are, but, by taking the time to unsnap them instead of pulling the fabric apart should avoid any tearing.All in all, this product has held up well in the wash (no fading on the graphic after numerous washer and dryer cycles), is soft and comfortable and oh so cute. The rattle is cute, but, not necessarily functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby hasn't arrived.","review":"Our little one has not arrived yet, but the quality of material and the quality of rattle is wonderful.

I am not quite sure how well it will fit in a baby's hand, and the actual parts that make the noise within the rattle are where the child will have their hand.

Period.The book is eloquent, it's even interesting - it gives a glimpse into their minds and lives. But it is also biased, and it does not tell the whole story. I believe the Ramseys are guilty, and only bought the book because if either of them (I believe) is ever idicted, they get none of the proceeds. I do not want to pay for the legal fees of murderers.This book is about the Ramseys' innocence, not their daugher's.

One might think it's because they know who the killer is.Of everything I have read about this case I gleaned the least information from this book. It is just chapter after chapter about how these parents were wronged by everyone in the world.Here's an idea - how about not making the police wait 4 months for an interview????

Her vaginal wounds, bedwetting and soiling of herself are CLASSIC examples of prolonged abuse, his pooor-me attitude sickens me to no end.A self-proclaimed Christian who cannot quote a single Bible verse wants the world's sympathy.

If they were working class, they would both be in prison. If they were Black, they would both be on Death Row. But because of their money and connections the Ramseys can not only (seemingly) get away with murder but flaunt it to the public.But they're overlooking a very basic fact here.Folks get away with all sorts of things.

The only innocent in this case was their daughter, JonBenet. Very little of the book dealt with her. The Ramseys invited media attention in the first place by appearing on CNN. Now they are unhappy with the attention they are receiving. Based on their actions and this whining, oh-pity-me tome, I find myself very, very short on sympathy for them.Perhaps rather than write this book they should have spent the time sitting down with law enforcement officials and talking about the details of the crime. The most alarming aspect of this whole business is their total focus on themselves. I don't have a clue who killed JonBenet but I think they do.

The three people they try to pathetically name as \\"suspects\\" have already been cleared by the police as have over 119 others.

They are the characters, they are the plot, and the setting is which ever town they chose to hucker down in and hide out! The book does contain some inconsistancies compared to other public statements, both Ramsey's have made, and more than likely will end up with an evidence tag number on it. The sitting Govenor of Colorado, has publically stated they are the prime suspects in their daughters death, and the Ramsey's say proceeds from the sales of this book will go to lawyer fees. Go figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Absorbed-Bull","review":"This was the worst book I\`ve ever read. The Ramsey\`s ramble on about themselves endlessly.

Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad I didn't read the reviews...","review":"I bought this book after seeing the Barbara Walters interview with the Ramseys. I am ashamed to say I too believed what I heard in the media tabloids. This book provides a clearer picture of the Ramsey family. JonBenet was not the sexy pagent princess she was made out to be, she was a happy normal six year old who was truley charished by her parents.

Go to the library and borrow a copy if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"They protest too much, methinks?","review":"This reads like one long note of denial, and the other readers' reference to O.J. is right on the mark. At this point, it looks like no one will know the truth about this case, and it will never be clear whether they had anything to do with her death or coverup.

It would never enter my mind to flee the state and ulitmately hide behind a bunch of lawyer-speak.If the Ramseys are innocent, then they are victims. As such, they should be doing everything they can to prove that innocence, in Boulder.This book has done nothing to prove the Ramsey's innocence. They present their side, but have not proven they are telling the truth. In view of their suspicious behavior, they do need to prove it, in a court of law if necessary.

The Grand Jury order was covered by a secrecy clause. If this publish KNOWS what the Grand Jury chose to do, then someone is in trouble for violating the GJ Secrecy Oath.I am particularly disgruntled with this book since I am the Woman from Wisconsin they speak of on page 310. John claims that the writer of the letters that I was being sent was probably from the killer but yet DOES NOTHING to contact me for more information, which I made well known to his attorney Hal Haddon that I had.They claim they want to find the killer.Yeah,right, and so does OJ Simpson. Perhaps they should save expenses and team up in their search.These people disgust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not about Jon-Benet","review":"Putting guilt or innocence aside, this book is not about Jon-Benet and her murder,it's about the parents. Written by themselves, with probably the help of others, this portrayal of innocence lost and tradegy obtained is nothing more than a spewing forth of their own personal reflections on themselves.

I couldn't even imagining FUNCTIONING if my daugher were murdered let only applying a flawless, full face of makeup to attend the services.

I understand when John said to the reader that nobody can understand the pain of losing a child and that people react to loss in different ways but, his overall behavior and that of his wife is very controversial.

The majority of the text is devoted to descriptions of their grief, their religiousness, and their victimization by the media and the \\"bias\\" BPD. Patsy's personality does seep through in this 400 page PR spin, and there is further evidence of her melodramatic, over the top, self centered personality. While there remains no hint of a motive for a murder, the reader is convinced that she was capable of staging the scene. Don't miss the opportunity to get a chuckle out of Patsy's attempt to claim she avoids coverage of this case. She is the ultimate media queen, and I wouldn't be surprised if she sought a regular newspaper column or radio or tv hosting op to keep her mug in the spotlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Should Have Remained Silent","review":"I've read it.

Before reading this book I did not consider the Ramseys to be suspects. Now I am not sure. The book is not convincing, not well-written nor is the material well presented.

To add to the tragedy of losing a daughter so horribly, they have been vilified by the public. Read this book and you will have to re-examine your own assumptions.

The Ramseys whine all through it about how mistreated they are by the Boulder PD, the media, people on the internet, etc. What they neglect to tell in the book is how their own suspicious actions turned the spotlight on them. The picture of the Ramseys on the cover tells the whole story. In their view, the tragedy is all about them. Unfortunately, the tragedy is that a six-year old child was sexually abused, tortured and killed. They talk of their child as if she were some abstract in their lives, not a child who had her own unique personality and spirit; rather she is seen as an extension of Patsy Ramsey. If you want to spend your money seeing just how self-absorbed and selfish the Ramseys are (and just plain kooky), spend your money. Otherwise save it for something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star minus for the King and Queen of Denial...","review":"They really believe it now.

I was probably the only person in the World who wasn't aware of exactly HOW JonBenet died, and I still had no clue even after I bought this book and read up to page 265. I couldn't go any further. This book is full of how the media and tabloids followed John & Patsy Ramsey and abused them. That's it. They feel they were falsely accused by the police since day one. They even state in their book that they were not as well off financially as people believed. Bull. They are intitled to their opinion, and sadly, we will never know the true facts in this case.

You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guilty as sin","review":"The Ramseys tried to elicit sympathy from the reader, but in my opinion, all they did was make their case seem more shady. It was obvious that they carefully chose the information they wanted the reader to be privy to. I became very tired of the !! that appeared throughout the book as if the reader should be shocked at the injustices that were done to the Ramseys. They tried to make the reader believe that this could happen to anyone, which seems preposterous. Even with the Ramseys choosing the information carefully, their guilt still shone through."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book in desperate need of a ghost writer.","review":"This is one of three books I have read on the subject of JonBenet Ramsey. Regardless of whether the Ramsey's are innocent or guilty, their book is difficult to read. One is never sure who is talking until the author of the chapter, paragraph, etc. is revealed by some masculine or feminine trait. I am also puzzled why John Ramsey spends valuable real estate discussing his work ethic and business experience. I think he should have focused instead on refuting charges against the Ramsey's or persuading us of his and Patsy's innocence. As for Patsy Ramsey, for one so accomplished and intelligent, she comes across as superficial and overly dependent on cliches. A difficult and boring read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Could Happen to You!","review":"What is so scary about what happened to the Ramseys, in their being \\"tried and convicted by the media\\" is that it could happen to any one of us. Our culture is one of sound bytes and image-is-everything. I was very skeptical - but after reading/listening to their side - and the investigator's side...I see how easy it was for the \\"facts\\" to be used as a cover up for poor police work and a decision by the Boulder police was made to not lose face - above anything else.

Here's more speculation. The ransom note is signed Victory. S.B.T.C. Investigators have speculated it refers to a naval training centre because there was a placque on the Ramsey's wall mentioning Subito Bay(?). This is likely the best explanation. Who really knows? However, it could also stand for other things. Could it be a secret \\"good-bye\\" to a beloved child from a remorseful parent or killer? Sorry Baby Take Care (didn't mean for you to die, it was an accident). Sorry Benet Take Care. Ah, the speculating never ends. Of course, I really DON'T know what S.B.T.C. stands for.

Don't let the detailed cover fool you, neither the mix nor the B-side were good. Though Annie has had fantastic CD-singles during her solo career, the Eurythmics never put much blood, sweat, and tears in their extended mixes.

It showed that there is room in relationships for forgiveness, that it is possible to get over the past and move on. It also showed that no one is perfect and that no one needs to be perfect in order to build a strong, lasting relationship.

I really feel as if Mr. White needs to develop his writing style. His writing does not grab me and it takes me a while to get into his books.

I finished the book in three days, because I was always left anticipating the next scene.

There was some love, some pain, some deception, some growth and much, much more. The characters are REAL and we all know at least one of them and can relate. Can't say who was my favorite character because they were all good in their own right. As for the story.......at times, it was so heart felt and the title (Cup of Love).....it is oh so fitting.If you're looking for another Fed Up......grow a little with the author and enjoy this book just as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr White is a sensitive, God fearing black brother!","review":"I read this book in one day, I could not stop once I got started.

Some nice new features are that you can actually see crew members not just on your ship but others, and a identification guide on periscope mode.

The program crashes whenever it tries to load up.This is supposed to be a game. It's supposed to be FUN. Paying $20 for something that simply doesn't work the way it is supposed to is no fun. Having to contend with a tech support which seems to shield itself from those who need support is even less fun.If anyone out there knows of a company that makes a product that actually WORKS THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO, please let me know.

I am more familiar with the Pacific theatre than the Atlantic theatre. The game has animated crew figures, limited ammunition, and limited fuel. I bought the game by mistake. I originally wanted Silent Hunter: Wolves of the Pacific which was sold out at the time, so I bought an alternate game. The submarines are realistic in detail. I have no experience with previous scenario editors of the type in SHIII.

I don't want to give it all away, but I'll say you're in for some seriously funny, crazy, off the wall antics when you read these books! I'll also say, I wish I knew Calvin.

Altho it was funny at times, I found the humor very 'dark\\". All Calvin really cared about was sex-with his \\"little thing\\", with Jennifer' and helping his friend. Come on!!!I can't picture that one. Grandma was not one bit believeable-too one dimensional, Dad was in a REALLY bad mood, for sure, and Mom was losing it as well. Sorry, but I won\\"t be recommending this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Sequel","review":"After enjoying Portofino immensely, I couldn't wait to read Saving Grandma. I was disappointed because, although there were some humorous moments, there was so much more in this book about Calvin playing with his little thing or dreaming of having sex with Jennifer or helping his spastic friend masturbate that the book started to get boring. I loved grandma and her feistiness and would have liked to have read more about Calvin's relationship with his grandma. The book should have been called A Teenage Boy's Preoccupation with Sex rather than Saving Grandma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotty and tedious","review":"Shaeffer's poke at Protestant evangelism is a clever enough theme, and the book starts off quite well. It's fun being introduced to foul-mouthed Grandma, her overbearing missionary son, and her God-fearing daughter-in-law who was for me the most real-to-life character in the book. The initial exploits of Grandma's grandson, the book's hero, with his spastic friend and English girlfriend were original and often humerous (with a little adolescent sex thrown in for the sake of sinful reality).But then Shaeffer started to repeat his themes over and over to the point of boredom. The end of the novel was weak, not tied into the bulk of the book. I was glad to get to the end. I thought Shaeffer had good ideas for this book but threw them together poorly, almost as if he wanted to be done with it as quickly as possible, thus destroying what could have been a very good novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I had high expectations of this novel because of who recommended it to me, but I have only been disappointed. While it definitely had funny moments, most of the characters (everyone but Calvin) were one-dimensional and extreme caricatures of their singular traits, which made them flat and predictable. Almost nobody is that over-the-top; most people (and therefore better fiction characters) are more complex than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saving Grandma","review":"I loved Portofino. When it ended, I hoped there would be more, and was delighted to learn that it was the first of a triolgy! I ordered the trilogy to keep forever and share with others! I read Zermatt. It also was delightful and insightful! Beware of what you wish for. Sometimes it is best to end with a sweet longing for more. I started reading Saving Grandma, and couldn't believe that this was the same Calvin Becker. I plowed on, hoping for some explanation of his aquired cruelty. I admit, I haven't yet finished the book. I will, but it saddens me to do so. If a reason is provided in the end for the change in Calvin, it will come too late to make me alter my mind that this book is a terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the read","review":"Second in the \\"Calvin Becker\\" series. After 15-year-old Calvin's foul-mouthed \\"unsaved\\" grandmother comes to live with the missionaries, family tension rises, especially as his father prepares for yet another church split. Calvin injures himself repeatedly while fantasizing about running off to Portofino to his friend/girlfriend Jennifer. And when Calvin realizes that his grandmother needs the kind of saving that is not at all religious, he steps in. Another enjoyable book, although at times I found the combination of coming of age story and over-the-top satire difficult to process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny look at missionary family","review":"Funny, irreverent observations from a teenager growing up in a fundamentalist, missionary family. The fictional humor may make many conservative Christians a bit uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calvin Becker Trilogy: Schaeffer","review":"While these books are well written, these semi-autobiographical books are filled with the author's bitterness toward his upbringing by his 'evangelical, fundamental Christian' parents. He paints an ugly picture.It is sad. While he may have some legitimate reasons for his anger, it is sad that he trashes his parents in this way, these well-known, well-respected people who many people admire. His books are also filled with graphic sexual experiences of a 14 year old boy which is unnecessary for good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"MTBF - about 1 year","review":"I have to give their design team credit- they've done a brilliant job at figuring out how to generate recurring revenue using the MTBF model.(See link for MTBF definition- [...])I purchased six of these about 1 year ago, give or take a month.

While I am tempted to dock this release a star for not containing the original booklets or even any sort of liner notes whatsoever, I am very grateful these superior recordings are still available.

And having both eyes open while using it isn't an option as what you see out of each eye is quite different. However, ours was defective so this is really a moot point: Regardless of which position the on/off switch is in, the device stays on as long as the battery is installed.

Then the author backtracks and describes the background and development of Airborne units. Readers learn about German Airborne attacks in the Low Countries and Crete earlier in the war, then later efforts by the Allies, particularly their successful role in the D-Day invasion.

I'm glad I read him while still in college, because otherwise I had not known how narrowminded I really was before I met Canetti.My favorite book.(PS. English is not my first language so please excuse whatever you don't like about my writing.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a perfect piece of literary fiction","review":"what a book, what a writer! having read plenty of literary autobiographies, i am still stunned at the depth and insight of these three volumes. the first, tongue set free, is the most lyrical; the other two focus more on young canetti's developement as a writer and thinker. such is canetti's art that only after reading the books several times the reader notices all the things he is not told... although this autobiography is a great source of enjoyment to everyone who is interested in literature, it should be read with a bit of caution: never to forget that this is, despite everything, literary fiction. i am not implying that canetti is lying (he is not), but he has more purpose than just presenting his times and lifes, and some scenes (like the describtion of caf�� museum) seem to be just describtions while they are full or literary quotes etc. i think it is this that sets canetti's work apart from other writers of the era."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the price it's not woth something so old","review":"This book is probebly the biggest rip-off, the engine has so many bugs it isn't funny, the windows version hardly runs because of it's bugs and the map editor crashes, and when it doesn't crash the maps it saves are invalid! Definatly not worth the money. The engine is very old, it uses WinG which is for Windows 3.1 and has the same restrictions as Wolfenstien 3D.

Lots of fun and great graphics (The best I've seen). It has four levels for a longer play time and you can customize your horse and rider which makes for a unique experience that is yours alone. The only two places that this game falls short in is the dressage, which is boring, and that you cannot free ride. However it has a multiplayer setting where you can play with up to three players + you. The cross country setting is beautiful, and the show jumping is very fun.

However, if you read the small print on the box it says it won't work with laptops because of the graphics card, so the game just \\"glitches\\" through everything.

The band's \\"light motif structure\\" revolves primarily around the differences between men and women, which they present in a hilarious, non-threatening manner. I mean it-- some of this stuff is laugh-out-loud funny. Additionally, the performances are flawless, with lots of skillful vocal harmonizing, and a great stage presence, as demonstrated in their interactions with the audience during the show at which this album was recorded. I don't have one bad thing to say about this disc. While I'm no expert on folk and acoustic music, these guys must be the pinnacle of the form; they're great ambassadors for the genre. My usual taste in music is speed-metal and hardcore, but the brilliance of this disc won me over.

A formula which does not, cannot, include objective thought, critical analysis, and constructive criticism. This formula embraces one, and only one, principle - Social Revolution. Any other time tested principles, such as truth, and justice are expendable tools in building their revolution.Mr. Horowitz takes us on a journey of his evolution and to the unequivocal conclusion that the radical movement cannot survive critical self-examination.The Radical Left must avoid the truth. Seeing the truth and taking it to its final foregone conclusion would destroy their dream, a flawed dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, Wrenching Autobiography","review":"Thank God for David Horowitz, and that he has the bravery to write this book. It deals with the most wrenching, devastating personal issues, and yet Horowitz tells his story with considerable lyrical grace. He's been to hell and back, as they said of another famous \\"turncoat\\" leftist; but we can learn a great deal from his journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"I lived through it also","review":"David Horowitz's seminal book on his conversion from \\"red doper diaper baby\\" (almost literally) to preeminent \\"traitor to the left\\" continues to spark painful memories for me of coming of age through the 60's in the San Francisco Bay Area. I too grew up committed to helping underprivileged of the flatland communities of the East Bay only to find out tragically that I was being \\"hustled\\" by the criminals and communists. No one has written has more eloquently or as insightful as David regarding the genesis and true evil of the radical left. I would have given the book five stars if it had not been so personally painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Closure on the Sixties . . .","review":"David Horowitz has written a book that will be cited and remembered for many years to come. His journey from Communist Children's Camp to a successful career in new left journalism to a prominent role as a conservative strategist is fascinating. More importantly, he puts the entire radical movement of the sixties into perspective by pointing out that ending the draft sucked the life out of the revolution. What appeared to be high-minded idealism turned out to be mainly fear of getting shot in a jungle war.\\"Radical Son\\" isn't in a league with \\"Witness\\" by Whittaker Chambers as a great political life story, but it approaches it. Not only do we get the benefit of Horowitz's unique experience as a top player on both sides of the political fence, we also get to learn from his family life, which is instructive. Pick it up and trade the illusions for the reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely perceptive and well written book","review":"Horowitz has written an extremely perceptive, well written andsometimes introspective autobiography. The book's candid explanationof the psychological roots of first communism and then the New Left are very enlightening. As a student at Cal Berkeley myself in the late sixties (although I was not a radical, one couldn't help but be affected by the swirl of events), the chapters on Horowitz' experiences with and ultimately rejection of the New Left were particularly poignant for me. Horowitz is not only insightful about politics and his own life, he has an excellent command of the English language. I just couldn't put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Left to Right.........","review":"This book chronicles the life of David Horowitz, the 60's radical who worked for Ramparts and the Black Panthers. Horowitz explains in great detail about the New Left movement during the height of the Vietnam War and it's eventual decline. Only, after a series of devastating incidents, does Horowitz come the conclusion that the New Left movement is flawed and self serving. Gradually Horowitz does a complete turn and becomes a conservative and today, is a vocal critic of the left. Radical Son is an honest look into a radical's life and his gradual change into a conservative politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey to Truth","review":"We are winning. Capitalism and representative democracy is winning. Yes, our system isn't perfect and many have been hurt. But, as Horowitz came to realize, socialism doesn't work--it kills people.

He was much worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm","review":"In college I had an overtly romanticized view of sixties radicals and was very concerned with their defection to rightwing politics. Throughout college I found that many of the so-called progressive radicals were fascist jerks into power trips and pushing their view of what is right and wrong. Humor, discussion, allowing that others might know more -- these do not a college radical make. Nor a college republican. Nor a David Horowitz.Thank you David Horowitz for confirming my suspicions. One man who goes from commie extremist tendencies to talking to American backed death squads in Nicaragua is the same person. Why do most people talk psychology with Horowitz? Because his self-righteous idiocy is the same no matter what political stripe he wears.

The author extrapolates his experiences into the wider world of wich he has no knowledge. White supremacists and jewish extremists will find also a lot to agree with but as the rednecks that periodically review this book show, the right as nothing to offer except narrowness of mind and normalization of personality. What this book and its reviewers show as well, is that Hitler's project is alive and well in the land that invented eugenics."},{"rating":"1","title":"When you get down to it, just another extremist","review":"Horowitz's book is useful as an eyewitness account of a true-believer's participation in the wretched excesses of the Far Left during the 1960's, no doubt about it. His disillusion with all of that is palpable and understandable. Yet it is still no excuse for his wild swing right into an unabashed embrace of neoconservative values and his gushing, hagiographic apologetics for the Reagans and Bushes of the world. When you get down to it, Horowitz simply exchanged one extreme ideological stance for another. He is to this day still as blind to the excesses and cruelties of right-wing ideology and practice as he was to that of the left. Just a simplistic, extremist personality masquerading as a deep thinker and moralist. The man has absolutely no understanding of nuance or moderation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Mind or Bruised Ego?","review":"In response to \\"Radically Dull\\" I have this to say:I have to agree, REGARDLESS OF YOUR OWN POLITICAL JOURNEY-anything this self-absorbed is dull-except to Horowitz himself or some poor therapist paid $100+ dollars an hour to listen to it. BTW, folks, save yourself some $ and either buy this or His new \\"Left Odyssey Illusions\\" or some other similar formula. Horowitz stays in business by recycling the same Huey Long stories again and again and getting his Heterodxy sycophants to regurgitate the same \\"reporting\\" in addition. Simply put, Horowitz hasn't had a real life since the sixties. Nor has he left the left-he is simply a part of it in negative as traditional conservatives have been good to point out. He makes me think of Gollum from LOTR in his monstrous obssessions."},{"rating":"1","title":"hilariously awful","review":"Yes, this is a terrible book, but all the justifications of it presented here are even worse and so simple minded. This whole \\"I told you so\\" justification that is presented here, as if one man's mistake should mean anything at all.

One thing though - this book is a Freudian analyst's dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bankrupt","review":"I'm sorry but David Horowitz was always an authoritarian, be it on the left or now on the right. The jump from Mao to George W. isn't as long as you'd think if you are looking for something to kneel before, something to banish thought or ambiguity. David Horowitz was one of the fellows who gave the left a bad name in the first place so it is particulary dishonest and repugnant that he should think his \\"conversion\\" tells any larger home truths about anything beyond his own pyschology and extremism. Frankly it says more about the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the right that they welcomed Horowitz than it does about a \\"left\\" that was well rid of such frightening blowhards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror-witz does it again.","review":"A Radical Neo-Conservative born of a Radical Son. Whether you love or hate David Horowitz, we all must agree he sure loves attention and controvesy. Whether he's joining the Black Panthers, citing Marx or joining the racists in trying to abolish affirmitive action and reparations. Radical Son only makes one thing clear: Horror-witz is a attention-loving Radical whose views, no matter on what side of aisle, are always controversial and inflammatory. They seek to enrage or strike great passion in people thus creating a steady market of people that love or hate him and will be good for publicity and for buying more books. This book, however, like all of his radical left wing or reactionary right wing stances, are all a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radically dull","review":"I guess there's a reason why we're supposed to care about Horowitz's journey from Maoist to right-wing hack, but I didn't discover it in this tiresome book.If people are interested in some reminiscing of sixties radicalism, and the issues people who battle the establishment (not serve it) face, I'd recommend the DVD, \\"The Weather Underground.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Truely hilarious","review":"What is more unbelievable, that Horowitz wrote this atrocity or that so many winners right such self righteous \\"I told you so\\" reviews for this piece of crap.

I really didn' t know that much about American communism and this book is helping me to piece it together. I also didn't know much about the Black Panthers. This part of the book reads as a 'can't put down' crime novel.I can believe this account of events because David was not only there for this part of our history, but he writes with such candor about himself and those around him.

Its contents take on extra relevance because of that month and the subsequent events, like the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. The text offers a sophisticated understanding of how or why increasing globalisation, due to trade and mobility of peoples, need not necessarily lead to greater conflicts.Granted, immediately after September 2001, many Americans probably felt that fewer Arab Muslim visitors to the US would be a good and prudent thing. But reading the book might cause you to reflect otherwise.Broadly speaking, the tone of the book is quite optimistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious black comedy","review":"This is Huxley's \\"American\\" novel, in which he manages to lampoon the more outrageous aspects of American popular culture- and in particular California culture- while still managing to get in a few digs at his own countrymen. It's hard to discuss in depth without disclosing too much, but suffice it to say that it's got plenty of Huxley's wit along with his social commentary and a hilarious ending. If you liked Waugh's \\"The Loved One\\" you'll find this much to your liking as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eloquent snobbery","review":"I enjoy Huxley's style, which is refreshing compared to many comtemporary books that seem short on vocabulary and long on grammatical errors. His descriptions are wonderful. But-- I found his snobbery hard to take after the first chapter. His dislike of California, and maybe all of America, is obvious.I also found his philosophical rants difficult to wade through. But most importantly for me, I could not like the main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange, obscure, and dull","review":"This novel did absolutely nothing for me. It has 2-dimensional characters - a self-absorbed millionaire, a beautiful promiscuous daughter, a young idealist from a lower class, a cynical philosophical doctor - that debate obscure subjects at great length, utterly lacking in realism or drama or even intellectual interest. OK, it is supposed to be a black-comedic statement on California's narcissistic and superficial society, but it is really little more than a crushing bore. The plot revolves around the rich man's search for immortality, with a funny climax when he discovers what it will actually cost.Not recommended. This is a chore to be studied by some, enjoyed by very few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book was great!

The Japanese did not give up, however and later arranged for the Crown Prince to be educated by a Quaker.

The writing style is easy to follow and the book flows well, even though there are quite a few plot strands to follow. The setting (Bath, Cornwall, and the main character's home in the country) are used to good effect, and there are lots of relationships among the various characters that are interesting to watch develop. I didn't lose interest as the book came towards its conclusion, as I do when things seem to be goingto a predictable end, because things here take a few unexpected turns.

Through simple scenes, such as the boys spending an afternoon at Goodwill, the reader feels like a part of their lives. The task of finding a new player forces these boys to analyze themselves and their lives. It forces them to face the past and look towards the future. It's also very humorous.

This album contains some great examples of this; Enescu's two Romanian rhapsodies, Dvorak's Slavonic rhapsody and Liszt's Hungarian rhapsody. The music is beautiful, exciting and quite danceble. Listening to it envokes images of gypsies dancing around a village in Transylvania at a celebration or holiday. This music is also quite rare and not commonly heard on the radio; hence a good buy for the price. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it TODAY!","review":"One of the best books i have ever read.did not take me long to finish. it is beter than the store price wants it. i cant wate to get another one. Read it TODAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This album fits comfortably into Santana's steady deterioration during the second half of the 1970s. Not everything here sucks, but most of it is fairly bland late 70s rock and R&B.; The best stuff on here is probably the two Steve Winwood-related covers -- \\"The Dealer\\" and \\"Well All Right\\". (Vocalist Greg Walker sounds quite a bit like Winwood on much of the album.) These aren't great, but they aren't bad.The only tune that deserves special comment is \\"Open Invitation\\": this song is hilariously awful, the kind of radio-friendly pop-metal that people routinely laugh at. I think it's worth hearing Inner Secrets just for this track.Unless you're a Santana completist or a fan of mediocre late 70s music, I wouldn't bother with this one. The best thing that can be said about it is that some of the later Santana albums would be even worse.[Note: I am basing this review on the 1990 edition, which has an identical tracklist and presumably similar sound quality.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"recycled comerciality","review":"This album was sad to me because Santana was trying to be trendy with dance numbers on one hand and jazzy numbers on the other.Stay away from late seventies Santana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!","review":"This is Santana at his/its most disappointing. If you love Santana 1, Abraxas, Santana 3, Caravanseri, Lotus, Moonflower (live tracks especially) and Supernatural, you will hate this!Apart from the rare flash of guitar mastery and the occasional latin rhythm (both of which appear by mistake, judging by how quickly they are snufffed out) this could be any second or third rate 70s/80s funky jazzy band. Avoid unless you're just trying to complete your Santana collection, and spend your money on any of the above records instead.Just goes to show how completely Santana afficionadoes can disagree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best, every song is great!","review":"First heard this album in 1978. It hasn't lost anything. Has to be his most underrated work. Every song is worth listening to. I think it's better than his greatest hits. \\"Open Invitation\\" ,\\"One Chain Don't Make No Prison\\", they are all fantastic. Johnny Black's review proves he doesn't know music. How can anyone who listens to this album say the band sounds bored? \\"Dealer\\" and \\"The Facts of Love\\" are (I hate to repeat myself) great!! Well worth the $10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated work","review":"I have many santana albums and have been to his concerts. This particular album (along with festival) is one of my favorite santana albums. I guess I like his spiritual-like wordless tunes the best (revelations, verao vermelho and others).

It looks great in with your furniture. I did not order it from this web site, but it took two tries to get one that wasn't damaged. The first one arrived in a box that looked like it went through the war in Iraq! It took over a month to get a replacement. The bottom pan was broken in the second one, so I swapped it with the one from the first crate. Between the two packages, I got an entire crate that looks good! I only hope that the rattan doesn't unravel. The first crate was delivered with a lot of it unraveled. My dog, a Golden Retriever mix, absolutely loves it! She is so happy to go in it and she isn't as eager to be to be let out of it in the morning, like she was when she slept in a regular crate. It is very airy and lets in a lot of light. It doesn't make your dog feel so couped up! I put a Midwest Quiet Time fleece pad in it and my dog feels so comfy cozy!

At the time I knew very little about digital cameras so I was disappointed to be able to take only five photos at a time because the memory stick is so small. I actually used the camera only one time in the last year. However, I recently bought a 512mb memory stick and was looking forward to using the camera. The old alkaline batteries needed to be replaced, so I bought the other kind--I forget what they're called--and put them into the camera. Unfortunately, I had a really hard time holding down the batteries and closing the cover, and the cover quickly jammed, and it is now half-open. I cannot open it, and other people I've asked cannot open it without completely breaking off the cover. Sony told me they'd fix it for $171, which is completely ridiculous, so now I'm stuck with a broken camera that I've used only once."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"an excellent digital camera.great pictures come outgreat featuresgreat compact size,love it so much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks like a good camera, but....","review":"This camera looks great and I have been looking all around for a camera too!!

Although analyzing individuals is an important facet of history, the role technology has played is also very important. For this reason, I recommend investigating this book. Well done.

For the first time in my life I considered offering my copy for destruction - I have never read copy that was so gruesome and found absolutely no saving factor therein.

I liked the 1st 2 very much. But this? I put it down after about 80 pgs- not worth reading. It's a \\"Christians & conservatives of any kind are really the only evil in the world\\" type story. Blah, blah, blah. I guess imagination is something he lost along the way. To quote Alfred E. Neuman, Yecccccch.There are many great authors out there in the mystery/suspense genre.

A man who enjoys death and has an affinity for arachnids.Connolly's writing is very blunt, and he pulls no punches when it comes to dealing with such issues as the nature of evil, redemption and revenge. There are a few very graphic scenes in this, like in his previous novels yet Connolly counters the violence of Parker's world with a lyrical prose that make the pages hum as the reader turns them faster and faster in an effort to find out how his novel ends.Very exciting very grisly, and most important very touching and well written crime novel with a hint of the supernatural."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Connolly is an absolutely superb writer","review":"This is my third Charlie Parker novel and they're just getting better each time.

Is he a mystery writer, a police procedural writer or a horror writer. His plots are very well done, but his crime scenes are truly, truly creepy... This guy does not believe the best of human kind.

The Killing Kind was good of course, but unlike this author's other books that I read, this one scared the 'heck' out me for some reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Connolly Book - But Not My Last","review":"I bought this a while back, and one day decided to give it a shot. I was blown away by both story and characters, and the wonderful quality of Connolly's prose. He paints with words, and Charlie Parker is one of the best detective/troubled human beings/ex-cops in fiction. Parker's two companions, Angel and Louis inject a sense of both comedy and darkness into the story. They are great characters. The story will, if you have any imagination at all, scare the crap out of you. In these days, the events described in the book (religious nutcases and horiffic murders of innocents in the woods of Maine) seem all too plausible. I have since read six or so Connolly books, beginning with the first, \\"Every Dead Thing.\\" My recommendation is to read \\"Every Dead Thing\\" first. The Killing Kind is actually the third book in the series. I have every Connolly book, including one I bought for the Kindle -- \\"The Reapers,\\" which I have not yet started."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Just Keep Getting Better","review":"Well, unfortunately, I got this book from the library on a day that my husband worked the night shift...and I didn't sleep a wink all night long...every time a hair touched my face or the house settled, I jumped, imagining spiders walking along my neck or Preacher Faulkner creeping silently into my abode.... This is the best book yet of Connolly's three novels I've read. You'll enjoy them more and better understand the story line if you read them consecutively, though. I don't believe in doing reviews as \\"book reports\\" so I won't rehash the plot for you, but suffice it to say that this is the most riveting, scary, intriguing, well-written thriller that I've read in years.

A tense thriller that will keep the reader on the edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Intriguing Read...","review":"\\"Just finished reading this novel at 2:00 A.M. Must admit this is the first of the Rebus series I've read. Am starting a second. The characters are nicely developed and tend to be people one can care about. The multi-level plots are expertly woven together. The vocabulary is at a level that does not insult one's intelligence, and the themes are timeless and intuitive. In this particular novel, the Penn State episode can be more understood. 'People knew and did nothing!' Can't believe how fiction can find so many parallels... I can not highly enough recommend reading this book at this time or, I guess, any time!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done! Good read!","review":"This was the first Ian Rankin novel I have read, and it will not be the last. I thought ir very well written, with a number of different themes running through the book. I was intrigued from the beginning as to how the author was going to tie all the threads together, which he did admirably. It was also a reminder of my one visit to Edinburgh some years ago. I hope you enjoy it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favourite, but still good","review":"I found this book's plot to be a bit loose and disjointed and it left some unanswered questions. It alsohad me questioning how we got to a particular point at times. But the Rebus character is still great. I like the way Rankin depicts his uncertainties and foibles. While we read of these we never lose sight of the fact that he is a very brilliant copper. I didn't much care for one of the villains in this book and I didn't like how that particular thread was left at the end of the book because I really don't want to see this particular villain again. Anyway, the book is worth reading because it is part of this very remarkable series. I love watching Rebus as he faces and conquers his many demons. And I love the underworld look at modern-day Edinburgh. Oh, and be prepared for a zinger at the end of the book. Rankin always has these in his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so Dead writer !","review":"This is an excellent book in a wonderful series. I absolutely love Rebus. This book shows his past history and makes him a real person. You do not have to read the series in order but it helps. I have not but still greatly enjoyed this book and the series"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best reads I've had this year","review":"Believe it or not, that was my first encounter with Rankin's DI Rebus, but it will definitely not be the last. A good, tight plot with many subplots and the psychological dash re Rebus is especially welcome. You can almost imagine yourself in Edinburgh - a sense of place is admirable. Oh yes, and wonderfully crafted villain characters to top it all. Get it, you won't be disappointed,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful soothing melodies","review":"Although this cd has some African rhythms and influence, its sound is primarily western, showing a strong influence from Elington. The melodies are great, ranging from lively swing to mellow and contemplative. The Wedding is a wonderful piece, as is Tuang Guru - but the cd really has no low points. Ibrahim has a distinctive piano style, and the performance of the entire septet shines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearing the ancient tones","review":"Sometimes we get to experience visual beauty by walking through a well-tended garden or viewing excellently composed art. In this album by Mr. Ibrahim he treats us to another form of beauty: he shares in his gift of melody. The individual passages he crafts in Water From an Ancient Well seem to tell the story of our lives. We hear them, they fill us with joy and gently move us with sadness. In these jewels we hear the ancient promise for a good tomorrow. My personal favorite: A Song for Sathima."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water As Symbolic For Life","review":"The music on this disc suggest that the past and present are inevitably linked together,informing us where we've been,where we are and quite possibly where we're heading.

But this, this was no simple romance novel. This book is a historical novel of the top flight. Yeah, okay, there's (great) romance in it, but it isn't the pivot of the plot. The intrigues between Henry VIII, his \\"Flanders mare\\" Anne of Cleves, his adulterous fifth wife Catherine Howard, and the over ambitious Duke of Norfolk are the true players in this historical tale. We are given the chance to see Anne and Catherine from a point of view much more sympathetic than most history books would offer. In short, if you prefer history to romance, this might be a good book to investigate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lover of historical fiction","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel. I am busy and can grab only 30-40 minutes a day with a book. It was easy to pick up where I left off, very little rereading necessary. I knew basic info re: Henry VIII, but did not know the progression of his marriages and dissolution of the unfortunate wives. Towards the middle of the book, I did have to Google the line-up of wives to understand where this wife fell."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACTUALLY 4 1/2 STARS GOOD STORY","review":"I enjoyed reading this story. I am a fan of Bertrice Small. I think BLAZE was better but this was well worth reading if you like history and romance and a little sex (A LOT Of SEX). The way Bertrice writes just keeps you interested and the story moves in many directions at times. Her characters are usually very interesting and easy to visualize. Other people tell you about the story but I just tell you why I liked the book and let you know that I would recommend this book to read if you like a good solid story mixed with a little bit of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"One or two flaws, otherwise a great read!","review":"I love English history, and have always been fascinated by Tudor England. This book is a sequel to Ms. Small's \\"Blaze Wyndham\\", and stars her daughter, Nyssa. Nyssa is a lady in waiting to Henry's soon-to-be-discarded queen Anne of Cleves.While the characters were great, Varian (the hero) was hot and the sex steamy, and the history MOSTLY painstakingly researched, there is one flaw - Ms. Small consistently depicts characters as having first and middle names. No one during this time period in England had middle names. Only in Southern Europe did people have more than one \\"Christian\\" name, until about 1750 or so. I know this is a tiny detail, but it really, really bothered me! Painstaking research is so important in historicals, and I know there is endless dispute about details, but this is a major slipup.Aside from this quibble - enjoy, it's a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LAURA'S ALBUM","review":"I WAS SO EXCITED TO FIND THIS ALBUM WHICH SHOWS PHOTOS AND WRITINGSOF MS WILDER AND HER FAMILY AND EVEN HER LATER YEARS.

There were many reproductions of letters and articles, but many of them were too small to read, incomplete or partly covered up by something else. It was interesting to see the letters or articles, but I would have liked to read the whole thing, rather than being able to see only some of it. For the parts that aren't covered up, you may need a magnifying glass! The photos were also interesting, but many of them were small, dark and in need of restoration.

How embarrassing to have to call this man a fellow American!If you want to read about how jesus saves, women are morons, and american made items are junk, buy this book.

I recommend that you do not waste your time with this book, there are plenty of other books out there with useful information. The main problem with this book is that Mr. Snyder focuses way to much on preaching the bible than he does in giving you information you can use to help you rebuild your credit. Secondly, he also quotes several other books and then gives you the name and author of the book where he got the info. If you disregard every other review you read, take this one to heart.

I was amazed on how much more information you can get from lenders if you just ask the questions the way he recommends! The author has also gone through a bankruptcy, which gives him much more credibility. I now have a credit card and am about to buy my first house and a new car thanks to the wisdom I received in this book! I also feel secure that I will not end up back in a grim situation as long as I follow his advice.The book is written in a way that you do not feel ashamed of your bankruptcy.

I also find it alarming how he touts leasing cars, and he apparently does it quite often as he speaks of his third car, his wife's fourth car, etc. Why not just buy a decent used car and pay for the upkeep?

HELLO. Is he really serious? I know from personal experience, that this is far from the truth.I also have to laugh at his list of suggestions for cutting expenses.

Yes, having a bankruptcy on your credit report has a negative impact though sometimes not as much as the excessive debt.

In this book, Stephen gives specifics as to how to obtain all of the mainstream credit that you will need and why it is so important. After you've read this book, you'll know everything there is to know about how to recover the smart way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope is a good thing","review":"This is the information I have been searching for almost three years. It works and there is nothing fancy about it. Sorry it took so long for me to find it. Wasted alot of time and efforts in the wrong places. There is hope again in my life when I was beginning to think otherwise. Thank you Stephen for writing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"If you are serious about designing your own home, do yourself a favor and invest in a better package than this one.The feature that drew my attention to this title was the plan tracer. You can load a plan graphic and draw walls over it - but the program isn't smart enough to recognize closed four-sided boxes as rooms. Additionally, the grid-snapping is arbitrary - sometimes you can move a wall at will, sometimes not. This is true when designing from scratch, too - the system is inflexible and awkward to use. Fortunately the 3D camera is self-intuitive.The other programs included in this package are equally weak. The interior photo designer is clever but unrealistic, and so on.A word of caution: if you're used to house-building in the Sims, you will definitely find this lacking. And if the construction engine in a computer game is better than in something you're supposed to use to design a REAL home, are you sure you want to spend the money on this product?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashley Rose Orr Was Great As Shirley","review":"The fact of the matter is they searched over 10,000 girls before casting Ashley in the lead role as the young Shirley, this had to be a very tough role to cast, think about it, how many girls between the ages of 6 and 11 could do it, first of all the girl had to at least look similar to Shirley, next she had to be able to do hard dance steps (especially tap) then she had to be able to sing, and last of all she had to have the IQ to be able to act the part of Shirley and have similar speech and mannerisms, Well Ashley hit on all counts in my book and I have been a fan of Shirleys since I was a child (i am 49 now) the movie itself I thought was very well done and the acting by most of the rest of the cast was also excellent (the girl who played the older Shirley in the last few minutes of the movie was beautiful but her acting was not the best, however she was not all that bad, overall this was an enjoyable movie that I believe any fan of Shirley Temple will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie","review":"I really loved this movie! I had a ball trying to copy the dances. Ashley Rose Orr is a great singer. I watched this movie over and over again! Ashley has a beautiful smile and lots of energy. You should get the movie. I want to be like Ashley when I grow up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really love Shirley Temple, but Ashley Rose Orr stunk!","review":"Shirley Temple is my #1 favorite actress. I hope I don't offend her but Ashley Rose Orr was horrible at this. First of all, she hardly looks like Shirley except for the hair! Second, she has to be 8 or 10 years old, people! Having an 8-10 year old play a five year old? I mean PUH-LEASE!. BUT.....this is my opinion! Think whatever you want, please don't feel offended, I love Shirley and I think The girls who played her as three and 15 were awesome, but I think they could have done childhood Shirley better."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my fav movies to watch , so good but wish it was longer","review":"i love this movie , the story was so amazing , i am a big shirley temple fan so i enjoy it, it wasn;t all that long about 80 mins but its worth a watch , wish they could of made it longer but i love how they protray her , she was such a sweet and inncocent star . it was a lilttle sad but very great to watch with the family. :))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is the best re-make of someones life that I have ever seen. The little actress, who took you through Shirley's young life was absolutely awesome. She nailed Shirley's voice, the pout on her face was remarkable and her dancing was incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality, but does not match description","review":"This is an excellent quality DVD, and will be appreciated by all Shirley Temple fans. However, I was disappointed to find that while the online description gives the runtime as the original 95 minutes, the DVD I was sent was the more commonly available 88 minute CUT version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good (ship lollipop)","review":"Good movie in so-so condition. Honestly the actress they picked was too annoying for words and the disk was scratched the first time I opened it but once cleaned it worked fine: you just have to clean it EVERY time. However, it was only 10 muffins so would I buy it again? Sure I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"ashley is nothing like Shirley!!!!!!!!","review":"I don't want to offend Shirley Temple(shes my favorite actress), but I did not like this movie at all. I have read Child Star, and the movie is nothing like the book! Plus, Ashley Orr did a terrable job as Shirley! Shirley had a differant, yet very cute, voice, which ashley does not have, and by trying to copy Shirley's voice she made it worse! If you want to know more about Shirley, then read Child Star, by Shirley Temple; Shirley Temple American Princess, by Anne Edwards; Or watch one of the real Shirley Temple movies. DON'T buy this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I Love Shirley Temple, But I HATE this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Awful","review":"This movie was awful! Ashley Rose Orr, while a talented tap dancer, and singer (actually a little better than Temple was in terms of the latter), is a terrible actress. She plays the character as the Shirley that we saw on screen in her movies whether she's playing her on screen or off screen persona. So what we get is an overly cutesy, and wholly unrealistic (not to mention uninteresting) portrait. If one wants to see that side of her, one can just watch one of her movies. The only bright light here is Connie Britton's portrayal of Gertrude Temple. I don't think it was terribly realistic, but at least it was well acted. The Poor Little Rich Girl is definitely a better investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"Ashley Rose Orr was nothing like Shirley Temple. Shirley had sparkle and pizazz. Ashley looked like a child trying to pretend to be Shirley. What kept me interested were the dance numbers. There wasn't very much information about her fame and life. All they really covered was how her contract changed from time to time how Fox changed to 20th Century Fox and that she didnt get Dorothy in Wizard of Oz (which im so glad she didnt b/c it would have just been aother Shirley Movie nothing big) otherwise. Ashley acts nothing like shirley would have acted off screne, looks nothing like her, sounds nothing like her, and why is a 10 year old playing a 5 year old?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I have to agree with the other two reviews: this attempt at a movie is horrible! My 2-year-old loves the real cars movie, but he won't watch this for 5 minutes without coming to me to ask for a different one. I bought it because it was only [...] bucks, but that was [...] bucks straight down the drain. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cynical and only fit for the scrapheap","review":"Wow, I think we all rented/bought this as we'd mistakenly thought it be related to Pixar's movie.Well it fooled the kid, and the adult. I'm glad it was just for 99 cent though via a Redbox than actually having bought this lemon.pathetic animation,unimaginative stories.Seriously buy your kids a few hot-wheels and have them make up the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Save your money. This movie is a cheap attempt to recreate the Disney Pixar Cars story line. The characters are all similar to the Disney Pixar Cars characters but the screen play, the writing and the animation are awful, awful, awful. Even my 5 year old who loves anything with race cars did not like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peee uuuu!","review":"I wasnt expecting perfection from a Pixar knock-off, but at least show some class. The jokes were trashy and many had sexual references that surprised me, since it it geared at kids. The characters were overly cliche and very annoying. The main character had a very low-self esteem in regard to his love interest. I understand that many kids movies have subtle jokes/references geared at adults. The key word is \\"subtle\\".Thats all I know because I turned it off after 10-15 minutes. Also there was a plot error - on the box it says the \\"champion hasnt lost a race in 8 years\\", but in the movie the # of years is different. I guess they skimped on editors... and everything else about the movie.Guess I could use the disk as a coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"Worst children's movie that I've had the misfortune of purchasing. Terrible voices, cut-rate animation, inappropriate innuendo. The voices on this film are enough to make even the most steely-jawed parent cringe. It is a disaster, even as far as cartoons are concerned. There seemed to be a lot of attempts at innuendo in here, but not in a clever way to maintain the innocence of the movie but more in a crude way such as \\"I'd like a good look at her bumper, oh and her headlights too- hehe\\". Save your time, money, and brain cells and skip this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little cars 1","review":"I brought this for my three year old grandson. His father says he loves it. My son says the quality of the animation leaves a little to be desired. But it wasn't meant for him. As long as my grandson enjoys it,that's all I ask."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a MINI ball stomper","review":"The description says nothing about it but this stomper is a mini and the ball is about half the size of a tennis ball. So it won't hold regular tennis balls, so any replacements have to be bought at a pet store. My dog is too big for the mini balls so it was money wasted. It works ok I guess as far as shooting the ball but she was more interested in the stomper than the ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Music","review":"I don't really have add anything about this CD. The performances are excellent as is the recorded sound. I would like to say that new classical music lovers who have yet to advance to chamber music, should really enjoy this great music. The two named quartets are especially good with the finale of the 3rd quartet being one of my favorite movements in all of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Great product, only one wipe used for one pair of knee-high boots, two pairs of shoes, and one purse before falling apart. Everything came out looking terrific, even the 2 pairs of shoes that I've had many years and worn alot. No smell, or greasy feel, everything came out supple, soft, and looking brand-new. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm...","review":"Quick, easy, convenient. One sheet can condition three to four pairs of my shoes.Hard to tell whether a leather conditioner is really working or not though... all I can say is that my shoe condition has at least stayed constant since the last time I used this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the WWIII series, it is much better.","review":"This is Slater's worst book ever!!! He portrays the militias as an organized fighting unit that could give the airborne guys an good fight!!! Hah! Slater, obviously do not know anything about the militia movement in America. They could never fight a convential battle with American military units because they would have been smashed. And I knew that he would portray the real Americans as the baby killers and those stupid militia guys as heroes. It seems that Slater's vast military knowledge vanished while writing this book. Stick to the WWIII series if you want to continue writing good books, Mr. Slater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as anything else... you could do better","review":"And so could I. This book as most of his others is another long drawn out adventure of some outrageous military tatics. While the threat is real, no real militia is so organized as to join up with all the others to suceed from the Union. And he always seems that every American general is either a suck-up or a flamboyant, egotistical, combination George S. Patton/Douglas MacArthur/Dwight D. Eisenhower/Stormin' Norman. And that only a real general would lead his troops from the front and lead them into the battle itself. If you want to read it, please do so with your brain turned off..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it no stars I would","review":"This book was just bad. It was poorly organized and it was easy to get confused. Mr. Slater tried to have the detail of Clancy and the blood and gore of Bond. He missed on both. Don't bother with this book.This is the first Ian Slater I have read. I was going to pick the WWW III series, but after reading this book, I don't know if I want to take another chance on Ian Slater.To bad, the concept was good, writing was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even look at the cover!","review":"I had heard many good things about Mr. Slater's WWIII series, so naturally I decided to pick up this book; what a let down. I don't know where he gets his information but the parts in the book dealing with special operations and airborne forces are totally absurd. The author sounds like he got his situations out of SOF magazine!I don't think any intelligent reader with any inkling of military ops and procedure will be fooled by this kindergarten attempt at military fiction. Reading this book was a trial. If you want to read really good military adventure, don't even look at the cover, stay with Tom Clancy or Harold Coyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"This book is not well written or researched. The author hasnot researched the militia movement in depth.He makes the miltia members out to be racist, drunken rednecks.And the government as the all powerful protecters of the littleguys."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of those Christian, conservative, gun owners","review":"Well lets see, If you are a Christian, conservative, gun owneror white southerner (he has all the militia talking like illiteratesouthern white... you know the normal stereotype from a ignorant far northerner) and don't mind being portrayed as a raciest, homophobic, gun nut that's mentally deranged and physically screwed up then you wont mined the book, if you get past the first chapter where he has the militia man useing an M-16 semi auto/automatic rifle like a bolt action you will find that the scenario and action or pretty good ( the author does figure out the m-16 later in the book). As I fit most of the first mentioned categories (not the second batch) I wouldn't pay money for this book ( a friend gave it to me to read, he must be mad at me) as for the author's other books I wont try them if this is one of his latest the others can only be worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is mis-titled.","review":"This book is probably very useful for some people, but I found it to be mis-titled and not very useful for me. I bought it after the death of my 19-day-old son, thinking it would help comfort me in my grieving. As I read it, I found it to deal more with loss through abortion than any other type of loss. Not being in that situation, I didn't find it helpful. If you had abortion-related questions, though, it would probably be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for a grieving heart.","review":"I recieved this book from a friend after losing my daughter to still birth at nearly 7 months. The comparison of my family's loss to a \\"flight that departed just a bit early\\" enraged me rather than provide any comfort. The very fact that the author could make such a shoddy comparison is a clear indicator that a tragedy of this magnitude has never touched his life.The book continues with what I am sure were meant to be good intentions( which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one) but slowly unravels to a very thinly disguised guilt inducing essay on \\" aren't you sorry now you had an abortion\\". This book deals very little with the heartbreak of a death of a baby that you had no power to save, it does nothing to assuage the hearts of the parents of miscarriage, stillbirth, or babies lost shortly after birth.I do not reccomend this book if any of those events are what you are going thru now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book, it's unsettling and a soap box.","review":"I began reading this book after the still birth of my son. I needed something comforting, this is not it. It's a \\"compasionate\\" view from a man who has no understanding of the pain he is dealing with and focuses mearly on his soap box on abortion. A tad condescending, I give him a break because he is a good man and a strong leader. He begins with a scripture out of context then explains it failing to back his explaination up with scripture (the biggest downfall of the book - since that is its main focus) or with reasoning. It really just frustrated me as you might be able to tell, and I wonder if Hayford has truely ever felt the loss of someone so close to him. Read \\"As I lay my Isaac Down\\" for a truely compassionate and meaty insight filled book on the subject. God bless you if you're searching in this subject, you're not alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"All about abortion loss","review":"Although other types of loss are meanioned, it seems the goal of this book is to focus on abortion loss and how people who have lost a child through miscarriage, still birth or early infant loss should feel bad for those who aborted their children. Although I can see this being a good book if you have had an abortion and are mourning the loss of that child, I found this book very upsetting and not helpful at all in dealing with the death of my child (since his death had nothing to do with abortion, nor did I want to focus on how I could be sympathetic to someone who chose not to have their child while dealing with the sudden death of my very wanted child)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book for those who aborted a child but not good for those who experienced stillbirth or miscarriage.","review":"This is an excellent book for those who had control over their baby's life and future. This is not a good book for those who experienced stillbirth or miscarriage as we did not have control over why our babies passed away. I would not recommend this book as most of it focused on forgiveness for those who aborted their child and answers to their questions on whether their baby would know them or forgive them for getting an abortion. I would recommend reading Safe in the Arms of God by John MacArthur instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I needed","review":"I received this book after my miscarriage. The title made me think it would help. Although he does say some things to validate my emotions. I feel he is really more focussed on trying to convince the reader of the validity of the baby. I didn't need that. My baby is as real as my other children except I didn't get to hold her. There are a few things that he says that TOTALLY conflict with my Catholic faith and pushed a few buttons. I also think he is more focussed on the healing after an abortion than a miscarriage or a stillborn. Overall I would say it's ok but not the help I needed. My baby is valid I know that it's trying to return to living my life I need help with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This book is not for anyone that has lost a child due to medical problems of the child or the mother. It's aimed more at a woman that chose to have an abortion for some reason other than medical necessity. I was hoping for a spiritual book about the loss of a child that was beyond your control. But instead I got a book focused on easing the guilt of an abortion. I found the analogies very ignorant. Like when they compared the loss of a baby to catching an earlier flight at the airport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"The book is very informative and helps with healing, but it is a little hard to read. I would recommend this book though for anyone that is going through the loss of a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I am an aspiring writer, hence this book caught my eye straightaway. Would have been much better to give it a miss. The writing prompts are incredibly cliched and .. boring. None of them inspired me to write two words. Fiction writers might find this useful, although I hope they wouldn't use any of these in any of their writing. The only inspiration I got was to warn others about this one. Give it a miss![...]permanent signature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Write Brain is Right On","review":"The Write Brain is very clever and entertaining. It is definitely the sort of filler activity that an aspiring writer would enjoy including in their day. While I very much enjoy the book for its entertainment value, I have yet to reach a point where the exercises have inspired my creativity or motivated me to continue to write when some sort of writer's block is plaguing me. Still, I want to surround myself with the toys, tools and implements of my craft and for that reason I will rate this book pretty highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Kingdom for a refund","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. Out of 366 exercises, maybe five were helpful. It was silly. Very silly. If my writing were a type of food, what would it be?? Is she serious? The first lines she gave as beginners for the exercises were, quite often, lines that I would hope NOT to see in a book I was reading. I almost expected to come across the line \\"This one time, at band camp, I...\\"Her encouragements may be helpful to others, but I personally would not be helped by standing in my shower and yelling \\"I am a writer!\\" at the top of my lungs. I'll admit, at least part of my irritation is that the writer of this book is entirely too sunshiney for my taste. A positive attitude is a good thing, but I think she went overboard on the \\"self-love\\".This book was not my idea of helpful. Not at all.

The first time I met him he was well into his eighties and he was a very interesting man and full of life even though he loooked and was old. As a layman as far as birds are concerned I find the book very readable because of the author's descriptions. Even someone not at all interested in birds scientifically would find the book interesting and as another reviewer has said the colour illustrations in the 1971 edition are very good. George Henry was a brother in a very diverse family which included adherence to several different religious groups and anything written by any of them would be interesting to read.

Simple yet absolutely effective moves, make it easy for anyone to follow. No wasted time learning complicated choreography here. Instructor can not keep beat with the music or herself. When the angles change so does her tempo. A few editing gliches, poor camera work and of course the whole her right is your left issue.

Do not buy this video if you expect a nice, high-quality workout DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout dvd for anyone","review":"I love this DVD and still use it even though I've been married for several years. While engaged, I used this DVD whenever I couldn't get to the gym due to weather etc, and this combined with occassional gym workouts helped me lose about 10 lbs in 6 months. I tried a few other bridal workout DVDs and found that those either required too much floor space or props. This DVD worked well in the small living room of my apartment. There is a lot of stomping/jumping though so you might want to avoid it if you have neighbors living below you.

The story is somewhat predictable. The special effects were dismal. (WIth the exception of Keira knightley, the acting was not anything special. The scene which saved the movie was the archery scene. It had a predictable ending but an unpredictable way of getting there. With many plot twists it holds your attention but the ending you can predict.

Doesn't even remind me of chocolate, I tried each flavor and the horrible chocolate was so bad I could't even tell the difference between each flavor. I literally spit it all out after biting into them, and I do not consider myself picky in any way.

The Circular Polarizer filter didn't fit the HOYA UV filter, so I managed to make the Polarizer filter just stick to the UV filter. But once I tried to remove it, it just wouldn't move at all.

It i essentially just a \\"tube\\" of latex with a small opening at one end but it worked. We did not let him submerge the arm, but he was able to float in an inner tube, go fishing, play in the water at the beach, and even tube behind the boat in the lake...we were just careful NOT to throw him off this year! The Seal Tight is great for keeping the cast dry-even in vigorous \\"splashing\\". I don't think it would work if submerged but, like I said, we were never brave enough to try it!

We haven't used it in the pool yet, but he has showered with it, bathed, played in the sprinkler and run around in water fights and it has stayed completely dry inside.I initially planned to purchase one with a vacuum seal, but this has done the job perfectly. I don't think he'd be able to put it on by himself, but he can't really put a shirt on by himself right now. He has a cast above the elbow and I nearly purchased an adult small, but the pediatric version fits just right!

There were no directions for use in the box, so I googled it. Basically, you have to stretch the tiny opening over a huge cast---with one hand. I called the 800 number hoping for a logical and reasonable way to use this product. The person on the phone not only was unhelpful, she was rude and patronizing. She said that if I couldn't do it myself, I'd have to get help from someone. The whole point of the product is so another person isn't needed...if I had someone to help me, I could save myself $25 and use trash bags and duct tape, or just have them wash my hair.

It should have been offered as a freebie with her latest novel. I admit I am also disappointed that her increasingly right wing political views and disgust for Washington DC and sometimes convenient disregard for accuracy in regard to the District are finding there way into her Kay Scarpetta books which despite the author I still enjoy. However, this so-called cookbook was thoroughly trivial and little more than a pamphlet. At the same time I bought another compilation of mystery writer recipes entitled \\"A Taste of Murder\\" which was a \\"real\\" cookbook and whose profits went to help the hungry. Quite frankly I think Scarpettas winter table was quickly written for a quick profit. I also realize the author is developing a reputation for going after her critics so I guess I stand a risk by criticizing her.

Of course, I'm a very visual person so this really appeals to me.I loved that you included sample prayers and vows - it gives them a chance to realize that this is an important ceremony, as well as a sacred time in their lives, and presents each of them with the opportunity to seriously think about how to make it meaningful for themselves on a personal level.The book is also casual and relaxed and the writing nice and big so it really has that workbook feel instead of the 'how to do it the right way' type of message.

He didn't understand everything he was told and that's okay. We don't either. He was in Silicon Valley, looking for the economies of scale in medecine.

I think he is right about the way technology will transform healthcare but I don't believe people will opt for do-it-yourself testing and treatment so the idea that doctors will go away is nonsense.

There's even a song called J for Jules on it. The Third Party is Jules answer to EDN.

That in itself was what made the book interesting to me, but the characters were not well-developed and the plot line seemed a bit chaotic, as if the author was simply trying to add length rather than substance. I kept reading hoping it would get better, but the ending was the most disappointing part of the whole book. I definitely do not recommend this book to those readers looking for a great paranormal romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed In This Book","review":"I bought this new book as I was looking for a new author to review. I was very disappointed in this disjointed story. There seemed to be a lot of work up in the beginning trying to get the reader interested in the main characters. The book was simply a let down from that point on. I found no suspense, no romance, no point in much of anything in this book. I will not read this author's books again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Windwalker","review":"\\"Windwalker\\" by Natasha Mostert is a well written story of star-crossed soul mates finally getting together. But broken apart by their separate destinies to live in England and South Africa. Not as good as \\"Season of the Witch\\" published this year. Natrasha keeps improving and is unparalled and unrivalved by any other writer. Great fantasy made absolutely real and sensuous. I want to read all her future books. Also please reprint all the books in paperback. . Windwalker would make a good movie or BBC -type TV program. three episodes. Even more so would \\"Season of the Witch\\" as a movie or BBC miniseries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Romance","review":"How this book ever got called a romance book I will never know. Half way through the book the boy and girl still had not met much less kissed! And when they do meet Adam stay around for a few days and then poof he's dead. Now tell me what kind of romance is that!? If I had not been stuck on a plane I never would have finished reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars.","review":"There is something distant in the telling of this story that makes getting involved in the action, and thus caring what happens to those involved problematic. It is the story of two souls, separated by distance, Justine and Adam, who are in love though they have never actually met in this life. They have in others though, and are destined to again. Yet, their love is shadowed by doom, by a cycle they are destined to repeat again and again. If you like reincarnation romances and don't find them basically offensive, then perhaps you will have better luck with this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Classic","review":"Trixie Belden and Nancy Drew dominate the search engines for most mystery stuff written for young adults. I suppose the reason may relate to their both being timeless classics. If you like these stories, you also have many more to choose from.In this book, originally published around 1934, Nancy is faced with solving a mystery concerning a pair of adopted babies. As usual, Nancy sticks her nose into somebody else's business and comes out smelling like a rose. This is a good story, with dated dialogue, but a likable, wholesome character. I recommend this to any mystery lover aged 9-12, and perhaps beyond. I'm an adult, and still enjoy reading about her exploits."},{"rating":"2","title":"the locket adventure","review":"you should get this book and fast before someone elsedose it is filled with lots of adventure it is a experienceread it at your best intencetion it is a thrill of alifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"odd odd mysteries @ Misty Lake","review":"Nancy Drew and her friends are involved in a line of odd events when they visit Misty Lake.the very same day they arrive, they meet a beautiful, red-haired Cecily Curtis.

Nancy's investigation lead her to Pudding stone lodge where ,the Driscoll family lives.Elusive humming noises,a flashing light in the attic of the lodge, the periodic apparition of an excrsion launch which had sunk in Misty lake years ago ,and the fleeting appeances of a scared girl who looks a lot like Cecily gave Nancy plenty of chances to test her sleuthing skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"Loved the book!

Lel and his black buddy, Bok, make it into the gang and are introduced to drugs as well as the lifestyle they yearn for -- until an encounter with the Dirt gets out of hand. The characterization is quite good, the dialogue is believable, and there's actually a Beginning, a Middle, and an End -- unlike so many graphic novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"good knives for the money","review":"I purchased these to replace my tools of the trade set I had for years, these knives are very sharp,which is what I wanted, the steak knives handles did lighten when I washed them in the dishwasher.that is my only complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!","review":"Very Cheap and dull.

Serrated knives are not good for that.The big knife has a regular edge but it is not sharp. It has a rough edge. Will NOT cut a tomato . Just smashes it.The paring knife is serrated.

I'm very confident that they will last a long time, as there aren't any signs of tear, although I use them very frequently. I haven't encountered any problems so far. It's easy to cut all kinds of stuff, from meat to vegetables and whatnot. The wooden case is also very useful and nice looking.

First time using one of the knives to cut meat a piece of the plastic handle broke off and all I was doing was cutting meat. I decided that if they broke this soon I was not going to be happy with such a cheap set. I will now look for another set at a little higher price point. Needless to say I returned these and am still waiting for a credit from Amazon but I am sure they will give me one I have never had a problem with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they claim","review":"I did read the reviews and that's why I choose these knives.

And not with another Ginsu set."},{"rating":"2","title":"For it's price! It's a great product!","review":"All the knives are good and work the way you'd expect them to work. The only con of this knife set is the scissors that came with it. It's made pretty cheaply and doesn't look like will hold up for too long.I'm not sure how long the knives would hold their sharpness but for now, it'll do the job.1 star taken away for cheap scissors."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Knife Set","review":"Well this is my first knife set and I like it well. My only complaints are in the quality of the knife block and the craftsmanship of the knives. First, the block is a bit shoddy. The knives fit very loosely and they don't slide in well. I feel like the knife slots may have been crafted by a high school shop student.Second, the knives seem to be made well but some of the handles are awkwardly shaped, this may be a mark of a handmade product or it may just be a flaw in my set. Overall the knives seem great and for a first set I'm happy with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp and attractive","review":"After having mismatched knives for the last 20 years, that constantly needed to be sharpened, I am thrilled with my ginsu knife set! The blades \\"cut like butter\\" and never need to be sharpened. The butcher block and black wood-like handles are more attractive than I expected. I am not anything close to a professional cook, so for someone like me who needs low maintenance but sharp knives, these are perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose and rusted within a month!","review":"I loved these knives....:( Unfortunately within a month the handles were loose and even after religious hand-washing/drying...rust!

Too bad really as they started out a dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the Chopping Knife and Scissors Work!","review":"The set looks beautiful, but that means nothing if the knives don't work properly. The fillet knife can just go right in the trash can; it wasn't sharp and did not cut at all! The only two items that work adequately are the chopping knife and the scissors. I know it's a little superficial, but when I received the set, the wooden block was cracked on one of the lower corners. This is not a solid wooden block. Looking closely...it's just laminate glued to a particle board frame. Another thing to point out is that all of these knives are serrated with the exception of the chopping knife (the only one that works) making them impossible to sharpen. I would not buy if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last less than a year!","review":"I didn't know that after only 8 months these are rusty as crap and I don't even soak them in water.

I was trying to get as much as I could for as little money as possible. I was lucky enough to accomplish both! I had heard of Ginsu knives before as being sold on TV, but had never actually owned any. These are some great knives for the price! They come razor sharp out of the box and so far they have stayed that way for me. The knife block was a huge attraction as well. I am really happy with these knives, and while there are certainly much better quality knives out there, you will also be paying an arm and a leg and get half of what you get with this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Sharp, good balance, and good handles","review":"These knives are very good.

Serrating these both make sense.The tip of the handle of my chef's knife broke off during regular usage, so I use it sparingly -- mainly for cutting tough vegetables. Because it's serrated, it doesn't really work that well for cutting meats anyway. Or maybe I'm doing it wrong, but when I use serrated knives to cut meat, I get tears/strings. It's much easier to use the Santoku knife.My ex-roommate took the shears when he left, so I didn't get much use out of them.

I've had mine for a month now and the only time I've been disappointed is when I noticed a spot of rust on one knife, but hey, I've been putting them in the dishwasher too. Regardless, I've cut tomatoes, chicken, carrots, etc., and have been pleased with them. Every one of these knives are serrated which would have been disappointing, but I already have a good quality chef's knife. But oddly enough, I haven't used that knife in a while, I keep going for the Ginsu knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusting after only 4 months","review":"These knives are rusting after only 4 months of regular use. I did think they were going to be the most amazing knives in the world, but I did expect them to not rust within the first months of use. Not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal!","review":"I bought these knives for my son's college apartment. He wanted me to return them because he has Cutco knives which are higher quality. I pointed out to him that he didn't have steak knives and all the knives were nicely arranged in a wood block whose small footprint was a perfect for his limited counter top space. It also included a handy shears. I was impressed with the quality of the knives. I have no idea how Ginsu can offer this product at such a good price. This would make a nice housewarming or wedding gift that wouldn't break the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharp but rusty","review":"I bought these knives for my new house and have had them for a month or so and half of them are already rusted after just a couple uses. They are pretty sharp and cut great but I dont get it how can they rust so quickly. I wouldnt recommend them because I am sure you can find better knives that dont rust this quickly and this easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good!!","review":"First of all I only recieved the knives...it was missing the block. Then...although the knives are sharp and do cut well...the first knife I used rusted after one use!! If you dont wash and dry these knives off directly after using them you probably wont have them long. Overall I would not recommend buying these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for Starters","review":"The affordability of this set makes it a great buy. The knives are sharp, simply styled, and make cutting easy instead of a struggle. However, these are not top quality knives, and you should already expect that. A little more TLC will be necessary to make sure these knives last longer.With most stainless steel items, oxidation will occur and you will start to see rust. These knives are no different, but don't think that you are going to be getting giant blotches of rust out of nowhere. No, that doesn't happen. A tiny spot will appear eventually, and when it becomes an annoyance to you, go get some Bar Keepers Friend and clean it off. Looks new again, that easy. To help prevent rusting, dont leave your knives submerged/wet for long periods of time. Hand washing and hand drying often will definitely slow the process down.So if you're on a budget, a college student or in need of a starter kit... then this set is probably perfect for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy!! Excellent set!","review":"We are in love with these knives! The combination of wood, stainless steel and black really give the set a sharp and elegant look... and, the best part is that they work awesome!! We've had these for the better part of a year now and they are still wonderful!Only thing I wish they had included was washing instructions. I have never put these in the dishwasher because I do not feel comfortable doing that without the expressed okay from the manufacturer. Unfortunately Ginsu did not include directions one way or the other about how to wash them.Anyway, they are awesome - and very much worth hand washing them all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what happened to the quality ...","review":"I bought a set of these knives for myself but they were in the Black and I love them.

I expected the quality to be terrible but it's actually really good and they stay sharp for a long time too. These are serrated on both sides and cut straight. Very sharp though - take care.

Wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusting already!","review":"I don't need anything too fancy which is why I bought these. However, it's totally unacceptable that they're rusting already.

I've had it for about 2 and a half months. It's very sharp and cuts the food perfectly. I love the bread knife. Set also has 6 meat knives. We eat a lot of steaks when we have guests over. And it's only natural to serve the meat with the proper utensils. So these come in handy. Knives are really easy to clean - no stains, very compact. I was able to cut myself 2 times because I wasn't careful enough, so yes.. they are SHARP. But that's good. I strongly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"Since I do not have that big of a budget these knives ended up being perfect. They are extremely sharp, however, the one thing I do not like about them is you can not put them in the dishwasher. I put one of the knives through the wash once and it looked like it started to rust a little. In any case, I just wash them by hand now and they are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about sharp!","review":"Look, I just moved into my first place. I have no utensils and I need to be able to cook. I saw the Ginsu set and remembered all the old infomercials from back in the 70's. I figured, if they're still making them, at that price ($27.00) how could I go wrong?1st, the block is attractive I love having it on my countertop.2nd, the blades are full length running all the way through the handle.Finally, I was able to butterfly a steak that was fully defrosted with next to no effort.For my next trick.. unrolling a turkey breast. Flawless.A good part of that is the blade design. Serrated all the way to the tip. This is a much more efficient cutting edge than smooth.For the price I don't think you could find a better set. Will they be around in 5 years? I'm not sure I care at that price. I'll enjoy them thoroughly until they die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Purchased item and received quickly from Amazon. Unpacked the knife set and recycled the packaging material. Hand washed all the knifes and placed them in the block. Pulled out one the next day a noticed rust on the knife already.

These knives are pretty good for the price. Their most likely made from (420 stainless steel)not the best for corrosion resistance,and maintaining sharpness, but for the price can't be beat. I was pleasantly surprised by the thickness of the metal, I thought it was going to be very thin and flimsy, but it's not.

We are guessing they are somewhere near the Earth's molten core by now and wouldn't be surprised to find out they cut through it completely and appear somewhere on the other side (China??). If you are in China and you see my GINSU knives pop through the ground, please contact me as I want them back.They are gone forever.

After washing them a few times, they have started rusting! There is no way I would use these knives to cut anything anymore, in fear rust may get into the food i cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Cut It","review":"I was looking for a good inexpensive replacement for my old knife set (inexpensive Tramonitna knife set, 10 years old). The Ginsu's got good ratings, so I thought I would give them a try.I cannot vouch for the Ginshu's. They seemed to be solidly made but I found my old knives cut much better than the brand new Ginsu's. So the new set is not worth it even though they were inexpensive. Not sure how they got the high ratings.On another note, I also found an interesting design problem with the wood block. This probably applies to a number of different knife sets, that might be of concern when you are shopping. The problem is that the slant of the block is not very great. This produced an interesting problem in that it was awkward to pull out a knife from the block when the block was under the kitchen cabinets. The cabinets got in the way blocking removing the knife. So I learned to appreciate a good block angle which this set did not have. My old wood block does not have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUSTED IN 3 DAYS!","review":"I purchased the set based on the reviews in Amazon.

Than two of the larger knives got rusty around the base of the blade, near the handle on day 4. Mind you i hand washed and dried them both times i washed them. Very poor quality, and they are supposed to be stainless? My $2 knife from Walmart has held up for 4+ years and a $30 set rusts in 3 days? No thanks, I sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay for What you Get","review":"Pros: Price. Sharp blades.Cons: Lightweight (feel cheap). Poorly constructed handles - 2 knives arrived with cracked handles and a third cracked after the first use.Yes, Amazon has a great return policy, but for a $25 purchase I don't want to deal with the hassle. With a brand name like Ginsu I expect to receive a quality product the first time.Ginsu also has a warranty on the knives, but at $3/knife for the return service it hardly seems worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knives for any price!","review":"I bought ours 3 years ago and they are still sharpe. I wouldn't know how they work on meat since we are vegetarians, but they cut fruit and vegies with ease.

Knowing that Ginsu is suppose to be one of the best cutlery sets you can buy for a decent price. They are suppose to never need sharpening and to be honest they are indeed very sharp. The knife block is nice and looks great up on the counter in the kitchen and there is a knife for most occasions. The issue is that they rust. We have only had the set out for about 3 weeks and already the blades are rusting. We use them and immediate hand wash and dry our dishes thoroughly. There is no reason to have rust appearing on the blades in my opinion. So if you want a cheap set that will get the job done, you should get these, however be ready to deal with rusting issues a month after you purchase them! I am very displeased in the product simply for this reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great set for a sweet price.","review":"Bought this as a gift, and it is the best knives we've used.

I even tried a couple on a dishwasher to see if it would do any better but it was the same (the Dishwasher actually dried them better but it didn't fix the problem).I am considering throwing the entire set because of this. Really, you don't want rusty spots in your knives!I took a photo to demonstrate how bad it is, but Amazon won't let me place links.Despite that, the knives and the whole set is nice, and if you don't have anything it ought to be a nice starting (and cheap) point.

Near the beginning of the movie there's two 1873 Winchester rifles that also are from almost 10 years later. It would have been better if they had Colt or Remington percussion revolvers, although the South used revolvers manufactured by companies like Griswold & Gunnison and Leech & Rigdon.

No real examples of window or door trim, crown molding, etc. As such, it's not really a companion to The Abrams Guide to American House Styles. I thought it would show the interior architecture that accompanied the exterior architecture characteristic of different periods, but no such luck.Second, while the book may be fun (for some) to browse, it shows itself to be surprisingly incomplete once you start to look for specific periods. What I was looking for was Greek Revival. A fairly prominent American style, and yet not even mentioned in the book.Overall a disappointment for someone who wanted to see what architects did on the inside to complement the outside of major American architectural styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised!","review":"I ordered this book having never seen it - based soley upon the reviews and description (which was risky).

This card holder is of good quality, remains very thin despite all the cards and bills I'm fitting in (ID, student ID,credit card, transport cards, bills). Each side has 2 slots, and there is a space in the middle for a few bills I honestly don't think it can be thinner. Extremely happy with the purchase, in particular for that price!

Looks just like the picture, has two slots on either side and a slot in the middle. Very good construction and nice leather. I ordered a second one more recently though and I'm not sure if they've changed suppliers, manufacturing or what, but the size was just slightly larger, and had squared off corners, not rounded ones like in the picture. Not a huge deal, but annoying because it didn't fit as well in a compartment in my purse. Also, in the squared off version, the stitching didn't go all the way to the edge on the top. This may be good because it allows for easier access to the middle slot, but I worry that the stitching will start to pull apart (hasn't happened yet though so it may be okay). Overall though, this is very good for holding a few key credit cards or a few folded bills.

I have no cons to this product but will offer the disclaimer: Give it a few weeks to loosen up."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid quality but doesn't hold money","review":"overall the quality of the materials and craftsmanship appear solid and it is very small to say the least. The only issue for me is, this wallet does not fit bills- they would either have to hang out of the top about a 1/2 inch, or you would need to fold them twice (doubling the bulk). So, if your goal is to have an absolute minimalist wallet that can hold some cards and hold a $20 bill folded twice as a backup, then this is a great option for the price. But if you normally carry around cash that you would keep in your wallet, this isn't the best fit. The picture that is used for the product is very accurate, they are not just showing you where the cash slot is- the money would actually hang out that much. I'm giving it 4 stars because if you do want exactly what it does it's a very solid product for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"tight fit","review":"love the leather, but the cards have a tight fit.

In the morning I washed it off and it did not give me any irritation or itch like some of the 1-star commenters said. During the week still no itch and no bumps!! So my routine after my shave is to use it once overnight, wash in the morning and have no worries =). That's what works for me. I don't know why someone would apply this everyday or leave in on until it dries. I really do not suggest to do that. I say try the way I do it once and if still experiencing itch, try it once more during that week. If nothing seems to change or makes it work for you. Then this product is not for you.

This rash is also itchy and hurts when scratched. I've stopped using the cream and the rash seems to be disappearing. I think I'll just throw away what's left in the bottle.........not impressed by this product, I was really hoping it'd clear my shaving bumps but I guess I have to keep looking hopefully, there's a better product out there.

A.D's experience reflects the values of his time and place on earth. It's very Westernized.. I have to believe a soul from the Indian sub-continent or one from a recent life in China, would be unlikely to reflect similar experiences to Margaret Flavell in the same circumstances. In fact, I'd love to hear their stories as well. A cynic from a conservative, controlling religious viewpoint might suggest the entire book is a hoax used to justify political positions such as pro-choice, gun control and world peace.

It wasn't that the moves were too dancy or difficult, I just didn't feel like Emily gave much warning when she was going on to the next move. Another problem was that the music wasn't much quieter than her talking. Also, her rhythm was different - she marched on the upbeat instead of downbeat, and that bothered me a bit.Like I said, it wasn't my favorite, but if you're a firmie (especially if you need more videos with this length), I'd still get it if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need some serious practice to master this DVD","review":"No, this workout DVD isn't hard but you may want to sit down and watch it a few times before trying it.

Yeah, it IS too fast and I believe a really good workout DVD will have an instructor who can lead you through from start to finish, sweaty and feeling accomplished.

It's not hard physically but hard to follow. Why can't instructors understand that you don't have to have a difficult choreography to have a great workout.

There's one section I just can't seem to do (I call it the 'cheer-leader jump'), if you can't either, just pyramid down to jumping jacks, you'll still get a great deal of benefit from it. I highly recommend this DVD for those times when you're crunched for time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Sync","review":"I can see that this workout would be very effective if I could follow it! This girl has bad rhythm... she's not in sync with the music half the time... and the moves are not repeated enough for those of us who are not dancers to be able to catch on. Once she starts a sequence, it ends so quickly and she moves on to something else and I'm still left behind trying to figure out the other move. All the FIRM workouts are great, but this one should have been edited better before being released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated","review":"I have around 30 firm DVDs, and usually love Emily Welsh. The choreography in this one is by far the most complicated of any Firm DVD I have ever done. Everything moves very quickly, and I found a lot of the moves awkward-- many just didn't seem to naturally flow together, and/or involved too many directional changes. Personally, it would take me more than a couple times through to catch on, if I ever did. This one will be going on the shelf for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"No cues, No explanations","review":"I bought this in order to change up my regular workout dvds. I've never tried anything by The Firm and was wanting to give it a try. I'm sure this dvd is great for people who have been in The Firm program. However, for newbies like me, I was at a total loss. In the beginning it was okay, but as the workout progressed I could not keep up. I kept having to stop the dvd and rewind so I could try to figure out what the instructor was doing. I eventually gave up in frustration. I'm sure this may be great for people who have been in the program and know the moves but it's not a pick for an outsider like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"I purchased this in a store on a whim and I wish I had resisted the impulse and checked the reviews here first. But it said \\"beginner modifications, anyone can do it\\" so I took a chance. I'm sorry I wasted my money! This workout might be great if you are 20 years old, but if you are 46 with 30 pounds to lose, this is NOT for you. They go WAY too fast, cueing happens at the exact second she does the move and she only does it a couple of times before adding more to something you don't even have down yet. It's insane. The camera hops around from girl to girl at an equally breakneck speed, so you can't even watch any of them doing the moves all the way thru. Anyone not already in top shape is going to get hurt trying to follow this."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but could be better","review":"I like very much Emily as a Firm instructor, but this DVD is not what I expected from her. The instructor usually cues very well, but in this one she goes so fast it's almost impossible to follow. I know its only 30 minutes but that should not interfere with her cueing. The first strengh segment for me was the worst(the part of the squat then turn then lat rows) in one point she even kind of laugh, I guess she knows its too fast. I had done the DVD more than 5 times, since I want to give it a chance and still find it a bit off. I have more than 35+ Firm DVD's and find this one just ok. I should had rent it first instead of buying right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast half hour","review":"This was a pretty good execution of a half hour workout. There were a couple of cuing issues but I'm sure if I did the video a few times, I wouldn't notice anymore. I worked up a good sweat and I'm not a novice, so I think it's worth an add to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructor moves to fast","review":"I did not like this workout the instructor moves too fast and goes from one move to another way too soon.I wish I did not waste my money on this dvd because I am sure I will not use it, because it is too difficult to learn the moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Pace","review":"I bought this for my wife and it is a good workout but it is a little too fast! She is 51 and in good shape but the routines are switched up too quickly before you learn them. If you do this regularly, you will learn to keep up though. It is a tough 30 minutes so get ready to work and sweat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointing!!","review":"not much more then a toy...very small....runs only on battries and they lasy only 45 mins or less!!

It is full of humor and surprises. Good and silly to the very last page. My children loved it.As a mom, I love that Ronald Dahl does not 'talk down' to children in his books.

The more often you hear this stuff in more different ways (various CD's/speakers) the more you will be ingrained with a self-motivating script.Yes you do have to take action, but i find that action can be more easily sustained on a fairly regular diet of motivational material. The brain is novelty seeking by nature, and a narrow, though repeated, range of exposure to anything (a single CD) will be habituated and lose effectiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live with Passion","review":"This CD series is really good.

I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good essays -- but Bernal is mostly right","review":"The hysterical reactions to Martin Bernal's book \\"Black Athena\\" are puzzling to me. What did Bernal actually claim?(1) Classical Greek civilization was heavily influenced by Egyptian and, to a lesser extent, by Semitic civilizations.(2) Scholars for the last 200 years have denied the African and Asian influence on the Greeks for racist reasons.I don't find either of those assertions explosive -- in fact they seem quite reasonable and Bernal presented enough evidence to persuade me that he was making a plausible case. To be sure, Bernal made some agitating comments, such as the title of his book \\"Black Athena,\\" and gave extreme Afro-centrists ammunition for their arguments. But I don't really see what all the fuss is about.This book has a number of essays which cast doubt, one way or another, on Bernal's assertions. Most of the essays were interesting and well done, but didn't really refute the two points aboveSmallchief"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the facts ma'am","review":"I am more of a medieval history fan, but this little controversy-want-to-be caught my attention.

The window the game was quite small and didn't take up the entire computer screen which made it eye straining to see. The graphics and animations were old and not very interactive.

Barnes, a wealthy drug developer and art collector, founds the Barnes Foundation with a great collection of Impressionist paintings and other masters. He plans his art to be used as an art school not a museum. He writes his will hoping his wishes will remain intact. This is a fascinating account of how the will is slowly broken almost literally line by line. On one side is Barnes and his wish that the collection never be moved, loaned or sold. The other side is filled with politicians, charitable trusts, boards of trustees, and wealthy individuals who want the collection moved into downtown Philadelphia. Learn about Barnes, the Barnes Foundation and its fabulous art and find out who wins in the end! Great art and a fascinating story about a little known collection worth big bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant! A must see!","review":"A story for all art lovers around the world.

I was initially very sympathetic to the deceased owner's wishes until I thought \\"why shouldn't this work be shown every day?\\" It's absurd not to.

It's more fair that they stay in Philly than NYC, LA, or Chicago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done documentary","review":"A well done documentary with the perfect balance of back story, interviews, and footage. I must admit that I am appalled at how corrupt the city of Philadelphia is and that more people in power choose to profit instead of preserve. So much for liberty, Philly!This man's sincere vision for these wonderful works of art were stripped away by opportunistic social sceners and their political cohorts. The fact that Henri Matisse stated: \\"The Barnes Foundation is the only sane place to see art in America.\\" obviously meant nothing to the people at the Pew Trust. The P-eww Trust's corrupt maneuvering reveals that it was never about honoring the art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie defends a silly position","review":"This could have been a good movie if it were not so absurdly one-sided. I just visited the new Barnes in downtown Philly and found it to be splendid. This is the museum that according to the movie is a travesty. Art is still displayed in the idiosyncratic manner intended by Barnes, but now people can actually visit. The movie glorifies the fact that practically no one could see the collection. The art in the old Barnes, according to the logic of this movie, was there for the benefit of a rarefied, elect few, and that was a good thing. That strikes me as a peculiar position to defend."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"Wonderful boock. This was a gift for our five year old grandson.

Secondly, it's quite handy and tiny that you can fit it in an average pants, coat or even shirt pocket. Finally, the warranty is simply amazing. This past new year's eve, during the fireworks and festivities downtown, I slipped the device into my pocket along with the car keys. The car keys punctured the quick-view window, BUT HP kindly replaced it with a brand new camera! Yes, the warranties don't last long, but it certainly offers great coverage in the meantime.

Even with Earle in the depths of his drug addiction when this CD was released, there are some quite impressive tunes here. The prophetic, rocking \\"I'm The Other Kind\\" defiantly proclaims his refusal to conform or find success traveling well-trodden paths. The ascerbic \\"Esmerelda's Hollywood\\" and \\"Country Girl\\" are biting satires of west coast LA life, drawn from Earle's LA days. One of his berst tunes is here, \\"Billy Austin,\\" a powerful ballad posing this question-who is better: convicted murder or executioner? (A theme later revived for the soundtrack of \\"Dead Man Walking.\\") His voice is less than stellar, but given the circumstances, the fact that he produced anything musical at all is miraculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs, too much bombast","review":"Steve Earle was coming off the release of \\"Copperhead Road,\\" before he made this album. That disc showed him turning from a countrified Bruce Springsteen to a straight-out rocker with an eye for the mindset of the underdog. \\"The Hard Way\\" continues the trend - detailed story-songs like \\"Justice In Ontario\\" and \\"Billy Austin,\\" an anti-death penalty tale that is among Earle's top works. The Dukes sound like bobcats in a bag snarling to get out, all broken glass and motorcycle engines (one of which would have better if it had been absent from the song \\"This Highway's Mine\\"). Some of the production seems done just to made Earle seem big and bad, and Id be rather interested in hearing how a song like \\"Hopeless Romantics\\" would sound if it were included on one of his later discs. Listeners get a sense of some of Earle's personal problems in songs such as \\"West Nashville Boogie.\\" It's a wonderful album, but with some flaws not present on other Earle discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CD only for die hard fans","review":"There are a few diamonds in a lot in rough on this cd. This is one of those in between album's that you can do with or without. For a true fan it just opens another door into showing Earle's promise that was filled in his earlier albums and that shines through brilliantly on all of his recent cds. With Earle producing some of his best work right now, I'd get in tune with any of his newer cd's (my favorite El Corazon) or start off with The Essential cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"These reviews are...a little off...","review":"All these folks giving this record 4 and 5 stars are nuts. This one is well known as being Earle's worst record, and it lives up to the reputation. Now, I am not putting down Earle. Anyone with such a wonderful and long career is going to have a clunker or two. You just simply cannot compare this record to his first three (Guitar Town, Exit 0, Copperhead Road) or the four studio records that followed it (Train a Comin, I Feel Alright, El Corazon, and The Mountain). If you are new to Steve Earle, try any of those seven first. If you ain't hooked after that, then I can only guess it's because you're a fan of crap like Pat Green."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary theft","review":"The title story, \\"After the Plague,\\" takes its plot directly from George Stewart's great novel, Earth Abides.

The premise is that, to know God's will, you must be living obediently and reading God's word and praying. When you are close to God, his will is obvious and your choices are his choices.

You then have to pry the rest of the lid open with your fingers or actually use pliers or some type of other tool to get it open. Not good!!!! It also states that this opener accomodates \\"tall\\" cans as well. Uhhh not the cans I have tried to open. Also the magnet that is supposed to hold the can up while it is opening the lid is very flimsy and has no strength to it, so the can constantly falls until you can make that first hole with the top of can opener.

They are so dull, except the point is really pointy. It's dangerously pointy when you are having to push on the knife so hard to get it to cut through anything. There is no way of sharpening these knives since they have a pretty scalloped edge like you might find on a gingerbread house.

Very poorly made block, decent knives, terrible customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked wood block","review":"I'm normally not someone to complain about a product because I am understanding that no one or no machine is perfect. Upon opening the box and unwrapping the contents I noticed a rather large and noticeable crack on the left side of the block. For a brand new product, I was rather disappointed. The only saving grace of this knife set is the set of knives - so far I haven't run into any problems. Due to the combo of the cracked wood block and wonderful knives, I give this product a measley two stars. Oh and you're probably wondering why I didn't return it - well, I needed the knives for cooking for my new place of residence and therefore, I didn't have the luxury to return the knives. Oh and the price too, but still besides all of this dos estrellas from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"These knives left a lot to be desired. The block was scratched, the slots for the knives were uneven & the name plate was glued on crooked. For lack of a better term: the whole product just had a cheap, flea-market appearance to it. They aren't worth the money, I returned them right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get serrated","review":"Serrated knives are the lazy man's choice in knives. I bought this Ginsu set right after college and have struggled to cut almost everything after the first month. These cannot be sharpened without a special sharpener that costs as much as the block.Upon some research, I realized that Ginsu knives have low quality steel, and that real German and Japanese knives have much harder steel. I decided to invest an extra fifty dollars in a good set with smooth edges, and have never regretted it. Imagine only needing one cut through thick steaks, honing that only happens once a month, and shaprening that only happens once a year.The first review was obiviously written by a Ginsu company rep. How anyone can love these knives after trying a good set is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Awesome knives you'll ever buy for the price","review":"I have not written a review before, but I am so satisfied I have to tell you about these knives.I wanted to show a friend which knives I use and have used for a few years now and told him I only now need to sharpen them.Then I noticed that I have owned and have used these knives since 2007!!!I have used them every day and for almost everything even fishing haha.These knives are the best you can get for the price and you can use them everyday without getting dull easily.Hope this review is useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT product!","review":"These knives are amazing! I have used some more expensive knives that I have bought individually before, and these cut far better than anything I have ever used! I feel like a cooking pro! :) They feel good- heavy, nice gripping handles, and cut through everything from meat to oranges like it was butter. I would HIGHLY recommend them- even though you can't sharpen them, for the price, you could just replace them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp knives, makes you love cooking!","review":"I love this knife set, I'd had these for over a month. They were much cheaper than the ones I was looking at at Target and Kohls.I read the other reviews for this set and always dry them by hand before putting them back in their black holder. I don't want these to tarnish! They look great in the kitchen and work wonderfully. I'm actually very picky when it comes to these items in my kitchen and I was very surprised and pleased with their functionality and appearance. I'd buy this set again (in case tarnishing does occur), but only of course if the tarnish does not appear within the first year. If this does tarnish on you the first year, then don't repurchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with my purchase","review":"I purchased my knife set a few weeks ago and they are great. I wash the knives by hand and dry them immedialty. I read some reviews were people out them into a washing machine and they rusted so I wont do that. It takes a second to just wash and put it away. If I get any other emails asking for an update I will let you guys know but this is a great knife set. Cuts nicely and I no longer cut my fingers with a dull knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knifes!!","review":"I just wanted to say I got these knives quicker then expected and they work great. The look and feel high end. I have bartended for about 9 years and cut end less limes, lemons, pineapples and oranges. This is the perfect knife for it. I had a dull knife for a while and my hand was starting to get tired and feel the effects of that. But now i look forward to slicing the fruit so easily and am not tired at all after. They also look pretty and i can't believe the price for the quality!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Not to love?","review":"These knives are beautiful.

The knives fit poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THESE","review":"The knives look good; however after a few uses and washes (not in the dishwasher) they have rust spots. I specifically bought these because it said they don't rust - not true!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","review":"Do not buy this knife set unless you are looking for a set that will rust and one that has no balance. Such as w/ the santoku knife, the handle is heavy but the blade is paper thin and extremely light weight. If your on a budget there are other sets out there close to this price range that are 10 times better. The steak knifes rusted with in the first month and they were not even sharpe out of the box. I am a knife snob and I only purchased this set for my friend who doesn't do much cooking. But when I purchased these I thought they would at least work for him since he does very little cooking but they didn't. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy and rusty","review":"I bought this set seeing an overall good user review. The cons I can see are:* Seems a bit heavy to me.* The knives also don't seem that much sharp. The serrated blades are not helpful for me. I find the the Santoku knife helpful though for regular use.* After getting them out of dishwasher, I could see yellow stains, though it says dishwasher safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite The Quality I Had Hoped For...","review":"I only tried 3 of the knives in this set, but they didn't seem super sharp. I had to use plenty of pressure to get the job done. But what bothered me even more was the block. Firstly, the block that came wasn't the same block that was pictured in Amazon's ad description. Secondly, the block I did receive was designed in such a way that the weight balance was in the front of the block rather than the rear, allowing it to tip forward easily, thus spilling out all the knives. I gave it two stars only because it was attractive in appearance at an inexpensive price. But I was hoping for better functionality. I sent the knife set back to Amazon, and they were great about returning my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knives okay, block doesn't fit knives properly","review":"Most of the reviews of this product are very old. Have they changed the block design or just have a bad batch? Hasn't anyone else had this problem> Very few recent reviews. I returned the first set of knives because the steak knives did not fit the bottom row. They are so tight that they are hard to remove; they rub on each other when removing and surely will scratch over time. Thought it was the wrong block. I talked to customer service, returned first set and received a second set. Same problem. Knives were fine so we decided not to try again and just make do by leaving one knife out of the bottom row."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer Sharp!!","review":"After a year and a half I no longer have sharp knives. I have tried to sharpen them manually and they just won't sharpen. I expect more from Ginsu knives. I would not buy this item nor tell others to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Very nice knives. They are sharp and look great. Much better than the crappy knives I was using before. Easy to cut meat, fruit, vegetables..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ginsu Knife Block","review":"I ordered one set of knives, and the knives did not fit in the knife block. The holes were not deep enough and the blades were sticking out. I ordered another set, and the holes in the knife block were in the wrong order. What do I mean by that? If you see in the photo, the scissors should be above the steak knives and the shorter knives should be above the steak knives. The block I received, the holes were all wrong, and the longer/taller knives were above the steak knives and the scissors and the shorter knives were above those... It looked weird, and made it hard to reach. I set both sets back. Also, the second set I received came in just a plain cardboard box and not in a ginsu box. But, the knives looked cool. Too bad tha blocks did work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best knives up to the $150 price range!","review":"They do everything professionally. They tend to tarnish ever so slightly if you keep them submerged in water for long periods of time. Other than that the steak knives are world class and the other knives are sweet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust, Rust and more Rust","review":"What else can I say, if you like rusty knives buy them. Each and every knife rusted within 60 days and of course the seller would not offer a refund or replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent back","review":"I bought this set for my father for Christmas. It looks terrific. I cannot judge the knives as they were never used. The block easily fell forward with the slightest tap. We considered it quite dangerous and packed it up and returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality, but some issues","review":"I like the knives, they are good quality. However, disappointingly, there are issues. For some reason the Santoku was missing from my set - two chef's knives were sent instead. Also, the block is a mismatch for the set. Be careful with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like cutting through Butter","review":"Love these knives. My daughter was given a set last year and I tracked thee down and snapped them up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for the price","review":"These are great knives for the price. They work very well for the left handed user. I hand wash them to prolong their lifespan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China Stainless steel rusts within an hour","review":"When I opened the box, I was literally thrilled with these knives. An all stainless steel knife and handle set that should survive years of dishwasher use. The dream ended quickly. They rust within an hour if not kept dry. These \\"Japanese\\" knives are stamped made in China. After a year, I'm still using them but regularly have to scour them with vinegar and scotchbrite to remove rust. I've worked and welded many types of stainless steel but have never seen it rust so quickly. I wonder if they've scrimped on chromium content.They are very substantial and functional but not worth the upkeep. I've heard others describe them as \\"Gypsu knives\\" and wholeheartedly concur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a life time knife","review":"Bought them almost 18 month ago,the sharp part has already fell off the handle on most of them.I would not buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and nice-looking knives","review":"I've had these knives for a few weeks now and have no complaints so far.

Their blades will cut through food with smooth precision.

It works just like I expected it to. I reviewed a lot of them, and for the price you cannot beat this one. I needed a black block and it doesn't matter that the name is on the block. That doesn't stop the knives from doing what they are supposed to do. I also dry them as soon as I wash them so I don't have a rust problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable Knives","review":"Great Knives, feel balanced and sturdy in your hands. The bigger knives seem sharper than the steak knives, but no big deal. The base can also be kind of unstable, but I haven't experienced any problems after setting it up and putting it on a shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect kitchen tools","review":"I am so happy with these knives. They are strong sharp and heavy. They cut so well and are so nice looking sitting on my counter. I have had people go right to them and comment. I love to cook and most of what I cook is from scratch. SO I have people over often and these are exactly what I needed to add to my work space. The one thing I always do with knives and will always do is right after use I wash and dry them and repalce them back into there slot. If you ever notice on the cooking shows the chefs always wipe there knives off straight away after use on there apron. I would hate to have mine rust becasue I did not take care of them right. I mean you can always clean them with bar tender cleaner once in a while. Or if rust appears for sure. However I have had these only a month and they are pefect everytime. Take care of your stuff what ever it is and it will take care of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SET!!!!","review":"I have had this a few weeks and have used almost every knife.

I ended up buying two more for my mother and mother-in-law because they liked mine so much. I suggest that you insert the 6 steak knives into the wood block with the blade facing up, instead of down like in the product picture. Otherwise, the blades tend to cut into the wood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty damn good","review":"I ordered this set of knives hoping to give my bachelor pad kitchen some much needed culinary power. The knives are great and sharp as hell. When you have bad knives, you hesitate to dice things like tomatoes and lettuce which require clean cuts. These babies blast through anything. I'm no expert on steel and which kinds rust, etc., but just sponge em off with some soap and water, wipe dry and it's done. I took a star off because the block is not *perfect*, i.e. the steak knives aren't all exactly aligned, but I don't really give a hoot. People only notice how awesome they look and how well they cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stainless steel knife set","review":"I am very pleased with the quility of this knife set but not happy with the block, which the steak knife holes are not spaced right and therefore do not fit in the block as they should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking","review":"Just opened up the package. Super fast shipping as usual. Excellant packaging, each knife individually wrapped with a end protector on them. Very sturdy heavy duty looking knifes. Love the stainless color. Bottom row of steak knives is VERY snug getting all of them into the holder. On another note to me when you pull a knife from the top row the whole block wants to tip forward. Maybe this will stop after the knifes go in and out a little and loosen up the slots.

I continued using because I had no other knives. But what was my surprise?I am very disappointed because I've never seen stainless steel knives become rusty. So, are you selling knives for one week only? They are the worst knives I bought in all my life.Made in China!Of course that I no longer have the receipt or the box and I couldn't return to Amazon.I am appalled to see that Amazon or customers (who are these customers?) place 5 stars for this low level of product.I'm very sad because I'm using the worst knives in the world.I would like to put pictures here, but I do not know how to do that.I feel robbed because they overpaid for a product that is not worth $ 1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is my order?","review":"I have never received the product which I ordered.

The slot in the back for the bigger knives were smaller than they should have been so some of the smaller knives had to go in their spots... and one slot in front was just big enough to hold the 'bigger' (more longer than bigger) knife.

I was looking for a black and stainless steel look that would last a while. I do notice that these knives have a tendency to rust more than my previous knife set, but it has not been much of an issue. The big issue with these knives is how the blades are set in the handles. The pictures may make it look like the handles are solid metal, but they are made of black plastic with a metal veneer. This may be expected in this price range, but after 4 years of use most of the blades in the steak knives are loose and I actually had to throw away 2 of the steak knives due to the plastic handles cracking, completely releasing the blades.

Despite her love for his music, it's her extraordinary musical comprehension that makes her one of the strongest interpreter of his piano music. Besides her sensibility, her sharp technique contributes for the immense success of this disc. She has a very special way for playing those massive chords while not making them sound pedantic. The sonatas here are stylish, colorful, firm in passages of bravura, intimate in lyrical sections, filled with a deeply satisfying contrasting dynamic range. The passionate result of the 1st movement of the 2nd sonata is a delight. I didn't have luck trying to listen to this sonata before. Some pianists (including some world wide famous names, such as Richter) were unable to display the outpouring of passion of this early work, leading to boring performances. Now I know that the 2nd sonata, though written before the 1st, is of equal strength of the other: a quite enjoyable genial piece for an early work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reasearch by the author. very detailed","review":"This may be the only book you'll ever need on Neil Young.

There's nothing to really like about this movie. It's a terrible plot even by formulaic plot standards. Poor pacing, erratic directing, and abysmally bad acting. Even by B movie standards this is a grade A stinker. It's no wonder the director and lead actor haven't done another movie since. They'd be better off leaving this turd off their resumes completely and starting from scratch. The good news for them but bad news for you is that this movie isn't quite bad enough to be good in the way some horrendous efforts are. You never find yourself laughing at the acting, though the scene near the end where Murrah starts quaking and looking at his hands while having some sort of breakdown is darn close. No, in the final analysis this is just an incredibly bland and utterly forgettable waste of time.

Jenny Sparks: The Secret History Of The Authority answers that question and shed some light on the untold tales of the superhero team formally known as StormWatch.As he did so well on the The Authority series, Mark Millar's sarcastic dialogue is hilariously dark and witty. John McCrea's artwork was a pleasant surprise. His equivocal and caricature-esque style on Hitman has kept me away from that series but he demonstrates with this book that he can also pencil in a realistic and polished manner.In the end, this collected edition is a must for Authority fans and represents a great starting point for new readers who are unfamiliar with The Authority.

There are two flaws that disappointed me. The silver paint on the camera body started to rub off after two weeks of light use indoor. The flash is very harsh; it makes every light colored surface appear shiny, resulting in over-exposed photos. These flaws (especially the harsh flash) were mentioned by other reviewer here. If I didn't send the UPC for a rebate, I'd have returned the camera. By the way, mine was made in Japan. Don't believe the myth about Japanese manufacturing.

My only complaints are the battery life and the size of the included memory card (16MB).

It contains remixes of several DCB classics, and I think that all of them fall well short of the originals. In general I am a big DCB fan. I think the band is very creative and has done a wonderful job of bringing their unique sound to the modern Christian music scene. But I think this album was a mistake.I have heard great things about their latest release, so I am hoping for the best. I do not recommend buying this DCB album. Can You Hear Us and Illuminate are much better than this one. I did not realize that it contains only remixes when I bought it. Now I am disappointed that I made that mistake.

Prima has made a few of them. Their guide to Super Mario Sunshine for the Nintendo Gamecube, really doesn't seem all that helpful. Although the designs as nice and very well put together, it really doesn't coursely enough show the maps and hints in there, to get through certain areas, and to find shines needed to beat Super Mario Sunshine. All in all, it only seems like a must have, if you don't have the original guide from Nintendo. Instead, I absolutely suggest you get the Nintendo Power strategy guide of Super Mario Sunshine. It is a much better guide for that exact same price as the plumber gets the pipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"book of basics, not opinons","review":"The needs assesment and the forms on the companion disk were very helpful in our first search for a nanny. We did not find the consumer information about agencies to be offensive, and in fact felt the author was giving us a choice to hire an agency or do an independent search. We found an agency that met our criteria and the agency found our nanny. We thought the author's experiences as a nanny was the reason the book was written. On the author's web site abcnanny.bizland.com she makes it clear she is not against nanny agencies and is announcing a directory of nanny agencies to be posted on the site in June. The book is a handbook and gets down to business quickly which we appreciate and did not consider a cold approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and challenging book for healthful eating.","review":"This is not only a cookbook, but an interactive journal. The author offers a 30-day challenge, based on whether you are a beginner, intermediate or expert at healthful eating. You then go through the journal, focusing on a new aspect of healthful eating every day and journaling your progress. So far, most of the recipes I've tried have been wonderful. I took the 30-day challenge, which for me was a meatless diet, and ended up with lots more energy! I'm not going back. I'll try it again soon with another 30-day challenge. Note: there are a few recipes I just couldn't stomach, but perhaps as I get more used to healthful eating I'll appreciate them someday.

The confused and very human caracter, was easy to feel sympathic towards, as she struggles to find out about her recently discoverd family. She digs deep into the family's past, uncovering many deep and unforgotten angers. As all this is happening, she herself is trying to decide what this means to her, she has a family now but will it be one for long?The Day of the Storm was a thoroughly enjoyable expirence, an unforgetable novel. I could not put the book down, it makes you want to find out just like she does.A journey through someone elses life is always a good escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call me crazy but I read this book twice within six months!","review":"First of all, I love Rosemund Pilcher. The main characters in her stories are all so good and sweet (I know, this one did have a villain) AND her books always have happy endings. Sometimes, when I want to escape into a good book, I want a fairy tale and DAY OF THE STORM is definitely a fairy tale. This book is such easy reading--I read it on the airplane--very easy to get into. Pilcher is the best when it comes to character development and while reading this story, you will come to love Grenville, Joss, and especially Rebecca."},{"rating":"1","title":"The day Of tThe Storm","review":"This is the third R. Pilcher book I have read. I so enjoyed the Shell Seekers and Winter Soltice . I am afraid this book was a let down for me. It has beautiful descriptions of the countryside , which I love. But the book did not pull me into the lives of her characters as the other two books did. I will now try September and hope to have another good read !"},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific, light romance","review":"This is not only my favorite Rosamunde Pilcher novel, but one of my favorite novels of all time. In it, 21 year old Rebecca Bayliss searches for her estranged relatives shortly after her mother's death. On the way to her relatives, she meets a mysterious stranger, Joss Gardner, an attractive young man who at first seems almost like her stalker, but winds up being her hero. The descriptions of Cornwall are breathtaking. There was just one disturbing scene to me, when her cousin kissed her dead on the mouth and when she tried to get away, he grabbed her and slapped her. Luckily she was a strong enough young woman to not put up with that or fear him. You will fall in love with all the characters in this book. Well, maybe not the violent cousin, but everyone else. Buy a copy off amazon today. You won't regret it. I think this book appeals mainly to young women. I fell in love with it at 22."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"After reading September and Coming Home, this was a real letdown. The characters were not well enough defined to show the motivation for their behavior. I never believed anything they said or did. It read, to me, like a Reader's Digest version of what she could have written. This won't discourage me, however, from continuing to explore her books, as the others were most enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Plot; Needs an Editor","review":"I had to struggle to keep reading this book. The plot is good, but the writing is so overdone, it was hard to get through. Every utterance is characterized by the author, rather than letting the character's words let us know what's going on with them. People never just \\"say\\" or \\"ask,\\" they \\"philosophize,\\" \\"blurt,\\" \\"snap.\\" It seems they are all over-caffeinated and under-medicated. It also seems that somewhere along the way, Nussbaum heard of the Ciceronian Triplet. Unfortunately, he didn't learn to use it sparingly. He often ends a sentence with three adjectives to provide emphasis. The effect works once or twice, maybe. Also, the whole \\"fate\\" theme is a bit heavy handed, but I've never been much into that idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story","review":"This story has a little mystery, coming of age, mid-lie crisis, plight of the homeless, and closted gay men. Mr. Nussbaum does an excellent job in dealing with these issues. THE BOY IN THE BOOK is a real delight to read. And yes, you will learn the identity of the boy in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Rich, good-looking and good-hearted Rick Bradley runs into a homeless boy outside a bookstore in his hometown of Seattle and takes a shine to him, bringing him home, cleaning him up and trying to get him back on his feet. Unexpected consequences arise from his good deed, of course. The plot sounds more interesting than \\"The Boy in the Book\\" in fact turns out to be--Tom Nussbaum has written and published work before, according to the biography on the jacket, but on the evidence of this effort, still needs a good editor and some review of fiction-writing basics, such as: avoiding telegraphing characters' thoughts and emotions when they can easily be discerned by the reader from the narrative alone, using coincidences and adverbs with a sparing hand, and not using melodramatic incidents such as a man blowing his brains out to re-energize a flagging plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"Sorry - I swear I'm not a snob - but I tossed my copy rather than pass it on like I do with most books. I got through it but in my opinion it was rather predictable and childish. I would have been more pleased if I found out the writer was in high school.

I've read other reviews so I think there is still more to learn about this tragedy, but the great thing is I want to learn more now...thanks to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible purple prose","review":"This book was written in the late 1800s, and unfortunately during that time authors often wrote in a maudlin heroic style that makes the author the center of the attention at the expense of the story itself. It makes many of the books written then, including this one, unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaotic and overly subjective","review":"I got this because it was free, and I figured, how could you screw up such a riveting story? You get what you don't pay for. It is indeed an example of period-style writing. This would be fine- even endearing- if the author had been a good writer and had some sense of plot flow. Events shared seem to be pulled at random, and without a sense of clear, objective historical accuracy, the reader is left feeling pulled about in many directions, following the author's inconsistent thought process and piecemeal rendition of the story.

The only tragedy was the money we lost by buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book is riveting, hard to put down, and incredible.","review":"It's hard to believe that what is written down in this book ir real. But, real it is. Once you start reading it you can't put it down. It holds you spellbound. Pulls at your heartstrings as you read what this party had to go through. It would be impossible today for people to stand up to what these people did. This book is well worth the reading. These people had the strength, fortitude that is seldom found today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read... Very Detailed.","review":"This book on Kindle, gives eye witness accounts from survivors and rescuers of the Donner party's unfortunate endeavor to reach California and their trials and tribulations. It is a very detailed book that contains a few quotes from one of the people who traveled with the Donner Party who kept a journal of the events taking place at the time. It is a very detailed account and I would not recommend this book to young readers or readers that don't have a strong stomach. I would recommend this book however if you want to know what took place at that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book and what a great CD","review":"I used this book and CD over 9 years ago and wanted to use it again in the school I'm teaching at now.

It does a great job of getting one familiar with all of the new features, though, as noted by other reviewers, it is not intended to be an in depth reference. The chapters on generics and concurrency could certainly be deeper, but the book provides a good grounding in the basics, opens the door to more complete study, and provides enough sample code to get one writing code."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the ones who know java","review":"I bought this book and I will recommend it just if You know java very good, and what to learn just what is new on java 5.The good thing about it is that you do not have to jump from stuff that you already know. the bad thing about it is that it can be out of the context.I bought this book while working on a site I was building (...) and wishing to write it on java 1.5, and not 1.4. The truth - In the end I wrote it on JDK 1.5 but with any new feature of java 5.Old habits are hard to change.Another thing that disturbed me with the book are the headlines, which are all the same in the book, and not subject dependent.Other than this, this book is very good, and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Specific to the new features of 1.5","review":"For what it is this book is focused and great. So it's important to understand what this book is and who it's for. This is not, with it's thin 170 page frame, a book that covers all of the Java language syntax. It is very specific to the features of 1.5. It covers generics, autoboxing, enums, varargs, and more. All of the new features added to make Java compete with C# are covered here in a terse and aggressive form. This book is for people who know Java well and want to learn more about 1.5.I recommend this book for Java professionals and architects who understand the new features conceptually but want details on how they work directly in the code. This is not a book for someone who just wants to start with Java. For that I recommend O'Reilly's Learning Java or Java in a Nutshell."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow","review":"I found the book shallow.

No narration...just Paul talking to the camera, but mostly you're eavesdropping the whole way, especially since the people being seen aren't posing for the camera or trying to put on a show for it.

A lot has changed in 10 years; Paul was still a widower, and had not yet married golddigger Heather Mills, much less Nancy Shevell (when I saw the moment in the film where Macca meets up with Barbara Walters, little did they know that one day they would be (sort of) in-laws (Shevell is Walters' cousin)). Also, George Harrison was still alive, though not for long (he passed away on November 29, 2001). Paul is interviewed by Dan Rather, Howard Stern, and others along the way, and his interactions with the people on the street are quite entertaining.

All the quality in this one went into the superb mastering work. You feel like the musicians are in the room-and I don't have thousand dollar speakers, folks. Five Stars on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"J Lo brings out the best single on the album.","review":"Jennifer Lopez brings out her best single yet, surpassing her previous hits Love Don't Cost A Thing (Okay), Play (Good) and Ain't It Funny (I like the whole gypsy thing in the video) with the radiant I'm Real. The song sparks with attitude and a great beat, and the amazing remix (with Ja Rule) provides a cool duet with a more laid back vibe than the original. The Ja Rule Remix makes the CD worth it, plus there's great remixes bt Dezrok (has worked with remix producer Hex Hector) and the Dreem Team (UK garage crew).Overall a great purchase which should stand out as Jennifer's greatest songs yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over all a pretty good bike","review":"The Schwinn Delta Sport is over all a good bike. Here are what I don't like about it. It wasn't packed well, there was a big chip in the paint. The wheels don't ride true. The rear gear cassette wobbled a bit. The front shock doesn't have a full grommet cover. The seat is a little hard. I would have liked plastic pedals, (they are metal.) There is no kickstand. It comes with bottle mounts but no bottle or cage. The front gears have no cover.Here are the things I did like. The suspension design is pretty effecient. I liked the Shimano Acera, and products. Dual suspension is all together more fun and comfortable, but probably not more effecient.In summary I think I was expecting more for $300. But it's a pretty good bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it zero stars?","review":"Pure garbage.

From the beginning to the end of this video,if you are unmoved then you are truly without any humor. The ability to make people laugh without sex, profanity, or at the expense of some one else is a lost art. The section who's on first is a masterpiece in it self. Just trying to keep up in the beginning was funny, and to turn words of t into names, inter change them and not fumble was hilarious. great video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to be missing something","review":"Many people allude to the commercials, not to mention the title-related \\"Who's on first?\\" bit.

It said it was in the last episode, and it is. The first time through the DVD I turned it off in the middle of that episode due to lack of interest in the A&C; show in general.Still doesn't change the rating, though.

An amazing foreign film, in this case \\"Nueve Reinas\\" from Argentina, suffers through the \\"creative process\\" inside the American studio to emerge as a pale imitation of the original - witness \\"Criminal\\".Claims that \\"Bielinsky co-wrote this screenplay with director Gregory Jacobs\\" are exaggerations at best. Bielinsky both wrote and directed the original; Jacobs' contributions to the re-make involve setting changes, adding scenes which don't actually add to the story, and the \\"dumbing down\\" of the plot.\\"Brilliant\\", \\"Entertaining\\", \\"Diverting\\" should be applied to the original, as the only thing this re-make offers is an American accent, a confusing ending that reflects attempts to make the complexity of the story into a simpler story, and performances which are lacklustre by comparison.Do yourself a favor - rent the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent movie with a REALLY bad ending","review":"This movie is reasonably well written, directed, and acted for 90% of the movie ... until the \\"big twist\\" at the end which makes absolutely no sense, is unbelievable, and ruins the picture.

He's great, as proved by his work with PT Anderson. I also saw Soderbergh's part in it; I loved his Solaris.But this film, which promised a 'suprise' ending, is incredibly predictable. Just remember the \\"Usual Suspects\\" rule (another film that people rave about the 'suprise' ending which I saw a mile away); the least likely suspect is THE person in question. That way the writer, who is not that talented, thinks he/she is talented, because you see, they INVERTED what was expected. Of course, they are only capable of this simple reversal of formula, not with anything truly original.The film's endings is stupid beyond belief: ask yourself, did all those folks do this for such menial cuts? And did you not see this coming? Come on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing too special here","review":"Criminal was a good little independant film with a couple of con men doing a job. The plot twists and turns are slightly predictable, though I have to admit that I didn't forsee the ending. Well, not exactly how it ended. I saw some aspects of it coming, but not all of it.There are basically no special features on this disc. So if you pick it up or rent it, don't expect any behind-the-scenes info. You're getting nothing more than the movie itself.Nothing too special here. A decent rental, but don't bother purchasing it. You're better off with something of more substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT SEEING THIS FILM SHOULD BE............CRIMINAL!","review":"This is a very good film with some terrific performances and an interesting story. It's about time I saw a movie that totally blind sided me and I was completely baffled to the very end. It's short and to the point, but it doesn't feel rushed for being under an hour and a half.

It's well worth checking out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise Ending Not Too Surprising","review":"This is a very likable little picture - only 1:27 running time - by virtue of an excellent cast and direction. It is also a visually appealing film having been very nicely photographed and edited. Early in the story I concluded that Reilly was scamming Luna or vice-versa. I won't spoil the conclusion except to say I was correct in my guess as I assumed the audience wouldn't have it any other way.Structurally, this film reminds me of the old classic \\"A Big Hand for the Little Lady\\" (1966) also with a twist ending except the twist in the older film is handled more adroitly and really is a surprise.Still, this is an enjoyable picture with cast principals Reilly, Luna and Gyllenhaal all superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made and great fun!","review":"I play fiddle with an Irish band and use my spoons during percussion breaks. I just love beatin' the heck out of these spoons! I'll often hand the spoons to someone in the audience and they amazingly figure out how to play in time with little effort. Especially fun with kids!

That meant I got in for free, thank goodness - because if I'd paid money for this dreck I'd have been batting down the box-office door and asking for a refund. Now, I know this flick is supposed to be an art piece - an homage to and satire of the Spaghetti Western - but *only* because the museum literature said so.

The makers of this film try to pass off as \\"artsy\\" a film that has no plot, asinine dialogue, thoroughly detestable characters and an unredeemed attraction to gore and ugliness.

I would imagine that is one of the main reasons that many people will buy the DVDs, in order to see their favorite bits, sometimes over and over.

But you run out of building space reasonably quickly. So, you can't add buildings, you can't move on, you're just stuck making tremendous profits and changing nothing.

I couldn't have been more wrong!First of all, this game does NOT come with an instruction booklet or anything that would help you learn to play or even what keys do what. I had to scroll through a readme file just to figure out some of the most basic things, and then I had to search through online walkthroughs to learn how to play. Very time consuming!Next, the game just isn't that much fun. If you are able to build and manage a prison at a low custody level without problems (can be done) then just make sure not to make even one mistake! That's all it will take to get a riot started that will go on and on despite any logical responses.In short, this game has a good concept but poor design.Not recommended to any avid gamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and drawn out!","review":"Well, first of all, I have to give this game a VERY low rating, because it seems to ME, you have to use the money cheat JUST TO GET STARTED in the game. Otherwise, you will wind up not even having enough money to house the inmates.Secondly, all this game consists of is pretty much waiting for the next parole period to come up so you can decide who stays, and who gets out (based on length of time inmate has been there, how many rehabilitation projects he's completed, how many fights he's been in, and what, if any, gang affiliations he has). There's really nothing you can do about the fighting that goes on in this game between inmates. I have yet to see a guard break up a fight.

This game is obviously GARBAGE!I've played Prison Tycoon for about two days now and I already want to break the disc in half! When the game does decide to work (about 1/3 of the time) it's NO FUN WHATSOEVER! You can't navigate the screen anywhere (which makes it impossible to see anything), the other controls are just as awful, this game ranks in the top five MOST BORING GAMES OF ALL TIME!

Everything was so random. You could build the prison but it didn't really seem like you had much control over what the prisoners did.

I charged both batteries once with this charger and both have completely died and will not run the machine longer than 5 minutes.

On every trip the DVD player slips - at least once - disconnecting the plug forcing me to find the place where the movie left off before the disconnect. On our last trip, we hooked up the Travel Case. The straps are a little challenging at first, but after you have it all figured out once, you are set. The straps fit easily over the back of the front passenger seat and are adjustable. My son was able to watch his movie without interruption. The case is sturdy and has lots of pockets for plugs, remotes and even DVDs. I would have liked it to be a little less expensive, but I feel like ultimately it will end up paying for itself.

It works. The skip mechanism is a little touchy since the skip wheel is also the select button if pushed but I do not skip more than a few times a day so it doesn't bother me. The menu is a little more complicated than some others I have used but it has everything I need and only takes a few more minutes to learn(if you do not use the manual).-Best: it does play music with good sound, has an easily readible display, is extremely light and a good shape(simular to a pack of gum), and pretty good battery life( for a single AAA battery). Overall I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, small unit","review":"This unit works well when you figure out how to use it. The documentation that accompanies it is so scanty as to be almost nonexistent; one has to figure out how to use it oneself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, right price","review":"I bought this player after comparing it with many others from a PCWorld article. This is a good overall MP3 player for those that don't want to go the Ipod route. Easy to install and load songs. I get about 250-300 songs on my 1GB player. Excellent for listening to podcasts on the go, particularly at the gym since it comes with an armband. One caveat, ditch the earbuds that come with the player, however, as they are not very form fitting and they seem to constantly fall out. I bought a cheap pair of Phillips earbuds for $10 that worked much better. The FM radio and built in microphone are two other nice features. The microphone is great at parties with friends or for recording bands live at a concert. The microphone automatically saves them as MP3's which is nice. The sound quality and price make this a good buy for your buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Better Value For Money","review":"I wanted to present my kids with a flash disk MP3 player before we left for the holidays. Reason? Flash based players have longer battery life and can withstand the rough and tumble of 7-12 year olds. Also did not want to spend a fortune as this age groups tend to lose things quickly.After a lot of research, zoomed in on the Creative Nano Plus 1GB player for two added benefits, Mic Recording and FM tuner. Also uses commonly available AAA batteries and lasts about 12-16 hours. Features a software to transfer songs but can also drag-n-drop because the player is recognised as a hard drive in windows.Now sound quality coming from Creative is excellent. User inteface can be better but actually is sufficient. Onlt complaints are poor build quality and ill fitting headphones.When my Dad saw the kids with their Creative Nano Plus, he loved it and wanted one for himself. Just bought a fourth player today. Highly Recommended as a sensible buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Zen owner","review":"Well I've just received the Zen Nano Plus and I must say first impressions count. Straight out of the box it works as a simple USB drive to drag and drop your music to the device (no SYNCING with proprietary software).As the controls become familiar, you realise how intuitive they are, it even makes for easy control while driving. I almost thought I'd have to deduct a point for weak bass, but a little experimentation with the EQ settings fixed that.I realise that as at July 15 I've only owned it for a few days.

This is exactly what I was looking forPositive features: Small, compact, backlighted display, convenient controls, smart software interface was a snap loading the MP3 player using Win95SE, offers smart compression to choose best formats when saving to player. Sound quality is fantastic. No mixing necessary. Great FM. I ran the 'auto-scan' feature for FM stations, it found every one in my area. Comes with armband which web package contents did not list. Nice surprise that saved $20.Negative features: Manual has only 10 pages and leaves you without a paddle. If you can find the CD manual it is better or you can download manual from web. Left-right rocker switch also selects when pressed and you often do the wrong thing. Ear buds troublesome to keep in ears and you need to buy better ones at first opportunity.. I couldn't be happier with mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"This is my first mp3 player and I love it. It is very small, easy to operate (the user's manual is on the installation CD), and the sound is terrific. The headphones were not comfortable so I replaced them with the Sony MDR-EX71SL/WK Fontopia Headphones, which are excellent. I use it at work on Windows XP and at home on Windows 98SE without any problem at all. Even better, I can use it in the car: I have only a cassette player in the car so a few years ago I purchased a Sony Walkman portable CD player automobile edition which included a cassette that is inserted and then attached to the headphone input of the player. It works perfectly with the Zen Nano so I can now hear all my favorites in the car also!

I like the replacement battery feature, because I don't have to expect a major repair bill when the battery fails. We use this machine with a little battery powered speaker.

While the authors' opinions seem to be all over the place, they basically suggest that you'd get better results by buying index funds and forgetting about them.There are many better-argued books that make that point. Personally, I think that you'd gain more information by reading a few magazines articles than by bothering with this book.If you want good writers on passive investing, portfolio construction and asset allocation strategies, supported by extensive facts, read books by Wiliam Bernstein, Larry Swedroe, Richard Ferri and John Bogle -- any of their books would truly be far better investments for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"It leaves you begging for more.

I'd recommend giving it a read for an eye opener! I read this then purchased it on Kindle for my Girlfriend... She was having a hard time at work with the culture and this helped her understand more of how she fit into that larger picture. This did the same for me while working at a consulting company and we fixed a lot of problems related to what is discussed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Responsibility Virus","review":"This is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the underpinnings of defensive communication that results in failure.Case studies are used effectively to illustrate the responsibility virus at work.

His graveled vocals and hard hitting style have attracted some of the industries best known performers; all eager to do something, anything, with him. It Ain't Easy includes input from Rod Stewart, Elton John, Bernie Taupin and Madelene Bell (a.k.a. Marion Bell the female voice from Gimme Shelter). The story-telling and musical accompaniment are superb. The \\"drive\\" in his music is unmistakably angry and soft at the same time. Check it out.

Tell me - how do you deal with annoying authors who try to push their beliefs onto other people?

THAT is what annoys me, not stupid things like \\"people going too slowly\\".What an idiot. Go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really what I expected...","review":"I wish I had seen some of the reveiws about this book's religious nature. The author is not heavy handed in his approach, rather unable to understand the fact that not everybody has read the Bibile back to back. There are several sections where I was simply reading the words to get to the next non-religious section. It is absolutely useless for me to read examples based on passages in the bible or working in/attending a church because I don't do either of these things. Each chapter has a little quote as a subtitle and I count 10 of the 30 being directly from the bible. I probably would not have bought the book if I had read a more accurate reveiw of the material. I am about halfway through, and will finish it... but I cannot help but write comments in this book as I pass through the more obtuse sections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn who you are, understand how people see you.","review":"One of my new favorite \\"hmmmmm, that's interesting\\" type books. It's not one that helps develop a way forward (e.g., changing who you are) but it helps understand where you fall in the four broad categories of personalities. What was helpful was identifying the personality types of the people you know and why your interactions with them are good/bad. So the book didn't make me change who I am, but it made me more sensitive to the priorities/motivations of other \\"types\\" around me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't cover communications at all.","review":"Let's start with stating that I create HMI's/SCADA systems for a living. I have used all the major commercial software including Wonderware and iFIX. This book was interesting. But as far as I'm concerned it left out the most important information. The author wants you to use a demo version of the software that 'talks' with the PLC. For me it's the reading and writing to the PLC that is important. There really needs to be a section on serial or TCP/IP communications to really make it worth something long term. The driver you would have to buy to use this more than a fun activity cost about $1000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance","review":"I'm sorry but Idils versions of these masterpieces is the really poor.

The fact that she is \\"plus-size\\" is dealt with in such a manner that her being big is, indeed, a plus. Sam, the single father of three-year-old Jake, is handsome, wealthy and likes his women thin. But he, too, can't help but fall in love with Nella. In Nobody's Perfect, Ballard has created a heroine who has learned to love herself despite living in a society that inundates us with the message that thin is better. Ballard addresses stereotyping without preaching. Very quickly, size is no longer a character in this fun, fast-paced romance that the reader will love."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT---READ it twice so far","review":"I loved the story and how Sam the snobby business man lures Nella into falling in love with his child and ends up falling in love with her.

Or so he keeps telling himself, but life and human hearts have unpredictable surprises in store, in this charming, witty, and tender love story with a twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story is ok, but the writing is terrible","review":"I can't believe this author has published so many books. I thought for sure this book was the first book written by her. This is stuff I'd expect from a high school creative writing class, not an established author. The scenes are so short, jump from one to the next with no transition, and the sentences are too simple. I won't even get into how annoying Jake's speech was written. There are better married for convenience stories out there and better books about plus-sized women. Skip this one unless you can get it for 1/4 of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpretentious Fun","review":"I'm really getting a kick out of the folks panning this stuff.

To compare \\"Party Hard\\" with Nirvana is the most noxiously inaccurate ridiculousness I've experienced in a LONG time. This band is a joke, whether they intend to be or not. The video is at least worth a laugh though, once you get over the initial slack-jawed reaction of horror that everyone I know had when they first saw it. 1 star if they mean it, 3 stars if this is a \\"Spinal Tap\\"-style jab at everything that's wrong with the world, and I REALLY hope it's a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding...right?!","review":"Wow.

I didn't do my homework prior to purchase, and for once I was pleasantly surprised. I have had absolutely no issues with the quality of these phones. The sound quality is excellent, battery life is more than sufficient, the range is beyond all other cordless phones I have had and these phones have outlasted all other cordless phones I have purchased for other phone lines. These handsets have been dropped, wet, used by teenagers, left in 100+ heat for days at a time, and they have bounced right back. One handset didn't survive being ran over by a truck, so I was happy to purchase 2 more to take its place.If you need a good quality cordless 2-line phone, this is an excellent use of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless book","review":"This book was too complicated for the beginner and too superficial for everybody else. While all the photos of plants contained more than one type of plant, the caption failed to identify more than one type and it was never clear which plant the caption was referring too.

I called ecampus and after waiting on hold for 15-20 minutes, a representative finally answered and told me since my order was placed through Amazon, they could not help me and I would have to contact ecampus through email via Amazon and she told me they would respond within 2 days. I told her I would not hold my breath on that, and luckily I didn't because I sent that email on Thursday, September 2nd and still have not heard back from them on that either.

As a history buff I collect these type of books for modern warfare. The condition of the book was poor at best. I knew before ordering it would be a used book, but I didn't expect a used library book that is falling apart. I am not sure that all of the pages are included. Be careful when ordering a book from Sun Media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story, Too Wordy","review":"This book is about a great story that shows the bravery and sacrifice that our soldiers and special operations teams are forced to make on a daily basis. I am an Army officer and takes great pride in what these soldiers do. However, the author could have done a much better job telling such a sad, but important story. While telling the story, MacPherson goes too much into detail about every character. For example, he delves into the high school lives of many of the characters and tells things such as the sports they played and things that they did as teenagers. While this is great to know, it does not add to the book because it is mostly irrelevant, and adds tens of pages to the book.This battle is one that is overlooked on the Global War on Terror and is one that every American should be aware of. The book tells a great story, but in a verbose and lengthy way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roberts Ridge","review":"Read, Not a Good Day to Die, and this book cleared up some lingering thoughts I had. Being an AF vet I still marvel at how our young men and women show the civilian population true heroism, day in and out.

It tells of a gut retching fire fight and is a study in courage and determination."},{"rating":"2","title":"That their deeds not be forgotten.","review":"Very moving story! I am glad that Mr. MacPherson did not give up and saw this book through to its conclusion.This is a story is taken from multiple viewpoints to form a more complete understanding of what happened atop Takur Ghar. As this story unfolds you are able to see in your mind everything that happens. Also interesting is the benefits and ills of modern technology and how it affects modern warfare. A great book and a must read!!It will surely remain a lasting tribute to all those brave soldiers and airmen who lived and died through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honour of the commandos' spirit","review":"This book pays a great tribute to American commandos during a battle on a mountain high altitude, ice, wind at night in Afghanistan lead by special forces commandos.

Brave troops can't overcome poor leadership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting contrast","review":"This is a very different story than the one told in other books, and several news sources. That in itself is a pretty dubious fact. I will leave it at that!There are three types of books coming out of the Afghanistan conflict - Army Books, CIA Books, and SEAL books (Forgive me but I have not seen or read and USMC/USAF books). All charges of bias aside, it is natural for the author to write about that which he knows - CIA guys tend to focus own universe etc. My point in all of this is: this, is undoubtably a SEAL book.If you are looking to fill in some blanks from resources available in print, or online by all means pick this up. If you are looking for a more definitive look at Anaconda - I would check out 'Not a Good Day to Die' by Sean Naylor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrrible job writing","review":"This Book is not written by some one who was there but an interviewer. His story must have been to short and that is why he had to lengthen it is a bunch of fluff. I saw that a few of the other reviews has been written by family and friends who had given interviews. I am sorry that the author did not do these stories justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"roberts ridge","review":"I do not recommend this book!

I salute all that have served and been in harm's way on our behalf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy job on capturing the essence of the fallen soldiers","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. Malcolm came to our family's home to interview us to try and capture what type of man my brother was. I must say he did a very poor job. In all the personal facts written about my brother, the only thing he got correct was the fact that he carried his daughter's ponytail ties in his pocket. Even though he tape recorded the interviews and took notes, he did not come close to portraying the essence of my brother. Malcom got names, facts and timelines incorrect. With so many errors written about my brother, I can only assume he did a poor job with the other fallen soldiers as well.As for the facts about the battle, he got some of it correct but other areas he embellished or guessed.I believe there was only one person in my family who read the entire book. The book was that far off, that it was not even worth finishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of Texture","review":"This is THE book to have on Dubuffet.

But is missing one key track: \\"Flash, Bam, Pow\\" by Electric Flag (played in the film as Wyatt and Billy ride away from New Orleans after the LSD sequence and before Wyatt concludes, \\"We blew it\\" during the final campfire scene). The missing Electric Flag track can be found only on the CD soundtrack to \\"The Trip\\" -- a Peter Fonda film written by Jack Nicholson which itself contains some pretty cool music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of my youthful rebellious stage.","review":"The movie was one of the defining motion pictures of my teen age years. The music augmented perfectly the movie. The soundtrack was a bit less than satisfactory with the omission of \\"The Weight\\" by the Band and the substitution of the song by Smith, but it was only a minor flaw. I had played the vinyl album a multitude of times so that it was pretty much unplayable and it was with some satisfaction that I was able to find it on CD. I would recommend the movie and the sound track to anyone who wants a taste of the '60s."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY listening.","review":"Man, this one is even better than the \\"Graduate\\" and \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" soundtracks. You don't have to have seen the movie to love these songs, but it sure helps. This has got some of everything from the time, and it's all equally good. You get country-rock with \\"Wasn't born to follow\\" and \\"Ballad of easy rider\\". Stoner-rock with \\"The Pusher\\" and \\"Don't bogart me\\". And just great classic-rock with \\"If 6 was 9\\" and \\"The Weight\\". Oh, and there's this other song called \\"Born to be Wild\\".

The wire is round gauge, not the sickly, oblong, flattish shape you're used to in ethernet cables. It almost feels braided, like a high-end audio interconnect. It has a nice coat too: feels good to hold, but is surprisingly flexible and doesn't get tangled in the rat's nest of wires by your modem. As you can see for yourself, it comes in a full compliment of lengths and colors. The gray is darker than it looks here, almost a charcoal.

It is a bit difficult to unplug because of the design - the plastic bar that you have to press down to release it is below a bubble in the plastic covering, but once you realize this and do it a few times you just know what to do to get the cable released. I purchased a 50 foot cable to give me flexibilty and I could not be happier with this cable. I purchased the red but it is available in many colors that could match just about anything.

This is it but with better graphics. All They did was remake the very first Pokemon games. To me that is just a waste of money but my boys wanted it and so I got it. They have now beat it within a few weeks of playing because they already had beat the red blue and yellow versions of Pokemon years ago.

I was browsing Amazon, looking at pokemon games when I realized that I could buy pokemon FireRed cheaper than I expected. I play it on my ds, and I love it. I just wish I had been into pokemon when I was younger so I could've grown up with the craze rather than jumping on just now. It took some adjusting due to the changes made through the years (like the fact that pokemon faint due to poisoning when not in battle in FireRed but no Black). I think the game is worth the money, and it might even be worth the money if I had bought it for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"according to my son","review":"We bought this last Christmas for our 10 year old.

But I like how Nintendo went with today's times and did the graphics, sound, sadly no missingno (or is there).I love it. It's today's kids experience of what we experienced when we were kids. Perfect! 5 out of 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great Game","review":"This video game really brings back memories of when I first got into Pokemon. The only thing I don't like about this game is that you can't visit the Johto region or the Hoenn Region. The game starts pretty much like the old Red and Blue versions did... you'll go outside, try to go into the grass, when Professor Oak (remember him?) stops you and tells you to come to his laboratory, where you will get to choose your first Pokemon and battle your rival Gary (name sound famillar??) for those of you who haven't played the game before, I won't go into details with this one, you will need to find out for yourself. If you have played the old Red and Blue versions, you pretty much know the story so I won't bother you with details... all you pretty much need to know is that there are more missions to complete than there were in the regular Red and Blue versions, and the graphics are a lot better than before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Satisfied","review":"I was worried i had purchased a counterfeit item, (pokemon Firered gameboy advance game) but when i received the package it was 100% authentic, and in great condition!

The good thing is that for the main part, the game hasn't changed. It has been updated with color, buildings have a different structure, 2 on 2 battles, and some new areas to be explored but for the main part it is the same game. I really enjoyed using it as a sort of expansion to go along with Pokemon Pearl because with Fire Red, Leaf Green, Sapphire, Ruby, and some other games, you can transfer those Pokemon to Pearl. So, get it, reminisce about the good old days and if you are new to the Pokemon franchise, where better to start from than the beginning? Enjoy the solid gameplay Fire Red has to offer and become the Pokemon Master once again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game is on FIRE","review":"Its a Pokemon game so you know what to expect...lots of fun.

Konigsburg, especially The View From Saturday. While I was interested in this story, it did not measure up to some of the author's other books, including The View From Saturday or The Outcasts From 19 Schuyler Place, although those are from a different genre.The best part of The Second Mrs. Gioconda is the historical details that it incorporates. While it is historical fiction, it does allow the reader to learn a little about the life of Leonardo da Vinci and Italy during the late 1400s. The character of Salai is very entertaining through his mischief and candor, and helps connect the historical figure of da Vinci to everyday people from this time. The self-absorption of some of the royalty is also pretty funny.Overall, this is a book I would recommend to readers with an interest in history. It is interesting, and provides opportunities to learn or to investigate more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sali was stealing money and Leonardo cuaght him.","review":"There was a boy named Sali and He lied to people and stole from people. One day Leonardo caught him when he was getting away and Leonardo Da Vinci took him with his father's permission to take Sali to work for him and to learn not to steal or lie again.As you read this book can make you cry and Laugh. This book made me cry two time. I never cry for books but for this one I did. In this book it tells of how it was named and \\"The Second Mrs. Giaconda\\" and how life was back then. This book is good to read when you are Reaserching about Leonardo Da Vinci."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun interesting reading","review":"I really enjoyed reading this. It was a very interesting story.

Lifetime guarantee on these, unlike the ones I bought from Memorex, which only have 1 YEAR. Can write on the surface with dry markers for temporary labeling; will erase easily with Magic Rub eraser. Good for testing prototype recordings without wasting CD-R's. Only drawback is record speed is 4X maximum. The only reason I didn't give a 5-star rating is the hubs in the TDK jewel cases barely hold onto the discs-if you barely drop them they will fall out of the case.

Otherwise no performance issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"TDK CDRW 10 packs","review":"I purchased the 10 pack of TDK CD-RWs for my JVC CD audio recorder and have found they are of excellent quality and would highly recommend them as they are excellently priced as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product a little pricey","review":"Thanks to the RIAA they're a little price but they work great in my Phillips music CD recorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"TDK Musical RW","review":"TDK CD-R80CB100 CD-R 80min, 700 MB, 52x (100-Pack Spindle)'I am extremely disappointed.CD RW's are supposed to be just that - rewritable.

If the media and politicians would act upon these ideas, our national life would benefit immeasurably. Rancor and discord would be replaced by harmony and dialogue. Senator Hilary Clinton embraced this book, and her espousal of its ideas no doubt helped her win election as our junior senator from New York.Dr. Lerner is in the forefront of Jewish thought today.

Its so quiet and loud at the same time. I still cant believe it was released in 2000, its ageless. I'm not going to go into it too much because the proof in on the record but this album is important...to me, you and The Cure. Oh and its better than thier new self-titled, sadly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite impressed by this one...","review":"I have been a Cure fan for a long timebut I don't have as much music by themas I would like at this point. I planto accumulate more. I have \\"Staring atthe The Sea\\", \\"Wish\\", \\"Disinitigration\\",\\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\", \\"The Cure picture show\\"and a DVD with \\"killing an Arab\\" on it and\\"Faschination Street\\". Then I bought\\"Blood Flowers\\" and heard and felt somethingdifferent...It had a richness to it that Inever heard in his music before. Aging isnot necessarily a bad thing. He sounds to melike he reached some kind of pinnacle in hiscareer. In \\"Blood Flowers\\", he reminded me of\\"an old man poet\\" who accumulated more depthand richness which comes with age. \\"Blood Flowers\\"is definitely worth buying in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best but still has something","review":"This does seem to have some things in common with Disintegration, but times have changed, and the cure isn't riding the top of their wave anymore. After Wild Mood Swings they lost their magic touch altogether, and at least this is an effort in the right direction. There are some classic cure songs though like Out of this world, there is no if, last day of summer, the best being Bloodflowers and its highly emotional, goose-bump inducing part where Smith begins \\"between you and me...\\"there are terrible songs like 39 and watch me fall that I will never like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect (4.5 stars)","review":"For me, Pornography was the 5-star... with everything else by the cure a 4.5 star... Bloodflowers included. Some absolutely terrific richly layered guitar soaked imagery here. Must buy for Cure fans... but Cure fanabies - don't expect any \\"Friday, I'm In Love\\" tunes here! An album for the fans. A swan song? Hopefully not! I'm not sure if Mr. Smith could stay away for that long."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as dark as disintegration but more accessible","review":"So this is the conclusion to the pornography, disintegration, bloodflowers trio. Excellent......so, what do you expect with such an album, vast intros, seven-minute love ballads with the reverb cranked and stark basslines that build upon each note almost apocalyptically, the poetic cries of Smith as he weaves a tale of love lost and gained, the occasional crunching riff and phasered drum beats? Well all elements are included in this achingly beautiful album. For the final bow out, if it be true, I commend the Cure's return to form."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I have been a huge fan for years but this album is a disappointment. Not only do the songs all sound vaguely the same but there all just a little too dark. As usual Robert's words are eloquent but the tunes don't do them justice. Give me more of 'Trust','Letter to Elise' and 'Wish impossible things'. Good luck guys in your retirement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweetly Melancholic","review":"Robert Smith's voice smacks of sweet melancholy--so real and tangible. We can feel his pain, and we are brought back to our own somber moments--and we can't help but smile at the irony. Bloodflowers is a beautiful album--mature and thought-provoking. You can't help but listen to \\"Out of This World,\\" \\"The Last Days of Summer,\\" and \\"Maybe Someday\\" over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD will grow on you","review":"I didn't like it at first and then the album started to grow on me. Now I think it is by far the best Cure album. Several friends also agree...we keep playing it over and over. Hell, the first five songs alone could have stood on their own as an incredible EP! A lot has been said about the lyricism on Bloodflowers, but there is much more here -- the musicianship is first-rate and the melodies are deep, soulful, honest, gut-wrenching at times and totally infectious. This album is on the same level as Who's Next, Selling England by the Pound, Rumours, Nevermind...really one of the great albums of all time. Radio is idiotic for ignoring it because the songs have great hooks even though they just don't fit the current pop scene. Note: I don't think that there has been a band since this honest with their audience since The Who....there is not one ounce of image-making or plastic here."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLOODFLOWERS sounds just like heaven","review":"After the radio-readiness of WISH and WILD MOOD SWINGS it is nice to see this band get back to its roots. BLOODFLOWERS surely blooms... I will be going to see The Cure in concert this June and I can't wait to see -and hear- how these songs will transfer live. This is by far their best work since DISINTERGRATION. Like many of the other customer reviewers have noted, if this is their final work it is an excellent way to go..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're All In Denial!","review":"The good news is, the Cure has left the happy stuff behind and is back writing the sad, moody songs which they do best. The bad news is that this is a very weak collection of tracks. Although some hark back to the Disintegration/Wish era, these songs would have been B sides if released back then. Even Robert Smith seems to be admitting that \\"the fire is almost out\\". The songs are overwrought and lack any kind of hooks. Only hardcore Cure fans (like myself) will find this listenable. Anyone else will be bored to tears. These nine songs are the best they could come up with in five years?"},{"rating":"1","title":"should we really expect more?","review":"The cure can overwhelm you with depression,desire and even nostalgia yet for one reason or another cant seem to conjure up an album one could consider great since the fall of the eighties. should we expect more from them ? No,i dont think we should but i do believe when you compare this album as a whole it is still far better than 95% of modern radio music thats forced down are throats as a daily routine. A purchase worth its wheight in donuts id say as a music fan,a purchase for the mere fact of adding it to the collection for a cure fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cure can't help it","review":"This albums sounds to me as The Cure trying to make another Disintegration. It's sad coming from a band with such great moments like The Head on the Door and Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. I think the real highlights in today's Cure career are Burn (from The Crow soundtrack, and More Than This (from THE X FILES soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"not classic cure","review":"Everyone seems to have joined the party a little late..11 years. Hell, the cure have been around much longer than that children. ANd THey were truly great visionaries and unique in the late 70's early 80's...try their early stuff and then comment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old School Cure Fan Disappointed","review":"I knew Robert Smith & his band had a new sound. I didn't realise it was a recycled, unworkable sound. The songs made no sense, the music didn't seem to relay any emotion, and overall, it sounded chaotic & choppy. I don't know if Robert was in a hurry to get this album together, but I didn't like it. However, in their defense, they've had a lot of years of writing songs, & perhaps this is just a minor backlash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garage Sale material","review":"I am not a great Cure fan but have a couple of their CDs and VHS of their early stuff. I have read all the other 128 reviews so what else can I say? First I liked Wild Mood Swings right from the opening track. I must have walked in then out of the store a hundred times over the last month or so trying to decide whether to buy Bloodflowers or not. I decided to buy the cassette and save a few bucks just in case. A good decision. Got home popped the mc in the player and about half way through the opening track thought what *hit is this. Ejected it put it back in to its box and shelved it. May try again a few months from now when I am having a garage sale and looking for stuff to pay to be taken away. Sorry Bob and the boys you've done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smith, lets get back to the music please","review":"I think Wish was the last truly great Cure album where the music was complex, enchanting, hypnotising. Ever since then however, Smith seems to have gotten caught up in putting the lyrics first, and the last couple discs just come off as Robert reading with some bland accompaniment behind him.Robert, or anyone out there who can get a word back to him, PLEASE -- LETS GET BACK TO THE MUSIC. Do an instrumental or something, anything, but give the words a rest, go write a novel or something. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"16-year old Cure fan LOVES THIS CD!!!!!","review":"I bought this cd when it first came out(I've been a fan since I was 13) and when I put it in the cd player and listened to the first notes of \\"Out of This World\\" I was in total amazement. There's not a bad song on the album. \\"Last Day of Summer\\" is my fave because of the great guitar work in it, which I think it's their best ballad since \\"A Letter to Elise\\". The Cure is simply the best band ever(well, along with Depeche Mode) and this is their best cd since Wish."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cure have created another intensely beautiful album.","review":"On Bloodflowers, the Cure help to remind us that there is a beautiful side to music, through Smith's vocals and songwriting. The album took me a while to get used to since it differ's alot from the pop anthems on Wild Moods Swings, Bloodflowers captures, once again, the dark side of love, but this time not as poppy as the previous one did. Bloodflowers compares alot more to such Cure classics like Disintegration or Wish. This album is highly recommended to die-hard Cure fans, or fans of Radiohead, Depeche Mode, or Days of a New. I love it and it is one of my favorite albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and very depressing","review":"1) wake up in a saturday shining morning, full of life2) going to a market and remembering you liked Cure and Dark Music at 80's3) finding and buying this one, 3 euros used it's good4) trying to listening it all, to give a chance.5) going depressed and deceived.ok, 3 euros is worth, for collection.don't suggest it, buy the old ones!p.s. sorry, english is not my first language..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloodflowers-- trilogy with ... and Disintegration?","review":"No. Give those two albums another play and skip this one.. other than possibly Watching Me Fall, it's just another reminder that even the relevant and interesting artists are no longer relevant and interesting these days. Here's hoping Robert Smith can find something productive to busy himself with, because The Cure has already done all that it needs to and is probably able to do -- see above two albums, Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, and Staring at the Sea (the Singles)."},{"rating":"2","title":"whoops :)","review":"In my first review Yes I know I messed up I meant Bloodflowers in my opinion if I had to compare it after hearing is closer to \\"Wish\\" than \\"Desinigration\\" by far. To me anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"i wish i was robert smith","review":"why can i not give this cd a million star rating!?!? this cd is one of the best things the Cure has done in a long time. i know that this cd is in the \\"trilogy\\" but it stands on it's own as an amazing piece of art. this cd will move you to tears if you listen to the words and allow the music to sweep you away. one of my favorite bands of all time...one of their greatest cds of all time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cure relives past glories","review":"Robert Smith has once again produced a sterling album with the release of 'Bloodflowers'. Its in the subtlety of 'Out Of This World' and the sheer tragedy and scope of 'The Loudest Sound'. 'Bloodflowers' accesses the deepest emotions in a raw state, like 'Disintegration', but without the layering of keyboards, and the heavy reverb of the vocals. Whilst this, on the first listen can sound sparse, as usual if you give The Cure your time and your imagination, you will profit from Smith's vision. The six string bass is back with a vengence, and the clever keys of Roger O' Donnell's return add the smooth velvet touches. The production values are excellent with Robert once again producing.There is no obvious pop songs here. But please note: the Cure has never been about a single with some album filler, and it's clear here. This effort is designed to be listened to as a whole movement.... So sit down, turn the lights off and be immersed in the beauty of Smith's innermost thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disintegration Revisited","review":"While this is not the late 1980s masterpiece which graced the store shelves, \\"Bloodflowers\\" is a hypnotic and compelling collection of songs. For those who were disappointed at 1996's \\"Wild Mood Swings,\\" \\"Bloodflowers\\" is a return to the melancholy and dream-like which Robert Smith and co. perfected with \\"Disintegration.\\" Is \\"39\\" indicative that this is the final release by The Cure? \\"Songs about happiness murmured in dreams...when both of us knew how the ending would be...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"bloodflowers-the cure's legacy","review":"well, here's another cure album. After listenng to \\"disintegration\\", \\"mixed up\\", and \\"the cure\\"(2004) i think this is one of the best they've ever come up with. as usual, robert smith gives us a gloomy, dismal ambience, but with a little bit of happiness- bittersweet, just like the love he sings about. This mood is probably most evident on the track \\"there is no if?\\". while it seems that the album is reminiscent of \\"disintegration\\", i believe this is an excellent addition to the cure's large discography."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant album","review":"an amazing album. a music fan from washington DC is just spouting off the idiotic Rolling Stone review. OOTW is a great song. Bloodflowers is an a amazing track, There is no if is a great slow song. they are all great - they sound like the bsides off of WMS (It used to be me, Ocean, Home, and Adonais) Get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Please Don't Go!","review":"Bloodflowers is the strongest overall effort from Robert and the boys in many years. If this is indeed Robert's swan song I am infinitely sad. Ironicially the the happiest days of my life are reflected in the echos of Bloodflower. These echos are of the best of the Cure, echos thought to have been lost many years ago.How sad it is to think that these newly found old echos will be the last. Bloodflowers is the band being evocative of itself at its' best. If you like the Cure at all you will want this CD. While it is hard to rank any of the ten Cure CD's that I have, Bloodflowers is certainly in the top four. The fact that it is Robert's good bye message - thus Bloodflowers (has it really been that painful?) - makes it that much more important.Robert don't leave us - the flowers will never die, the dream never goes away, the sun sets but it always rises again - and we will always love you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This really surprised me .....","review":"I have listend to the Cure since I was in highschool & they still sound great. At first I thought this album would be good, but I was pleasently surprised it was excellent. My top two favorites on this one are \\"Watching me Fall\\" & \\"Out of This World\\". This album reminds me a lot of both \\"Desinigration\\" & a bit of \\"Wish\\". I would recommend this album highly & hope they keep making great ones like this. There music will never be outdated to me I still play it loud in my car :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cure is my favorite band, but....","review":"While Pornography stands as the Cure's greatest triumph, the other two albums in this so-called trilogy, Disintegration and now, Bloodflowers, are what I would term \\"generi-mope.\\" Nearly every song on Bloodflowers sounds the same. And it's not a terribly interesting song, musically. Lots of acoustic guitar too high in the mix and no musical breathing space. What Bloodflowers needed was more songs like the epic \\"Watching Me Fall\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good the first time you listen to it.....","review":"....but after that it just gets old. Sure, the instrumental work is good, and Robert Smith is a fine lyrics writer, but why listen to music if all it's going to do is depress you? The songs are WAY too long considering the fact that all that goes on in each of them is suicidal moping. I swear, if you listen to this CD all the way through you'll feel like killing yourself. If you want truly good music with a gothic edge buy Marilyn manson's Holywood album or Dusk and Her Embrace by Cradle of Filth. Sure, neither is pure Goth (Marilyn Manson has a big heavy metal influence and Cradle of Filth shows a large dab of black metal) but these two art pieces are alot more enjoyable than The Cure can ever hope to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their three best albums ever","review":"How many bands are able to release such intemporary music as The Cure do ? Bloodflowers will stay in the history of Pop/Rock music as Disintegration and Pornography stay. Each song is incredibly intense, as to make you really conscious about the The Cure is : simply brilliant, making no concessions to commercial side. Bloodflowers is also very homogenic and represents the best way to go to a Cure gig. The sound is always that great and Smith sings extremely well on it. Nothing left to say : buy it just because they're different, and the best !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Classic Cure!","review":"A new Cure album is always cause for celebration, and \\"Bloodflowers\\" is no exception. A very concise, strong set of songs, moody, textual and lyrically brilliant! Not as good as \\"Disintegration\\" but better than either of the two 90's Cure studio discs. \\"Where the Birds Always Sing\\" is one of the more beautiful Cure songs, while \\"Watching Me Fall\\" and \\"Bloodflowers\\" are brilliant epics. The Cure definitely has a recognizable sound, but they continue to produce interesting and innovative music! I hope this is not their swan song, but if so, they've left behind quite a legacy. Highly recommended..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully not the last","review":"If this is really the cures last album then they are going out with a bang. I love the new cd. I am a new cure fan but have taken a huge liking to them. Okay maybe you could call it an obsession. I own 15 of their cds and wish that there could be 15 more. Bloodflowers has the best musical vocal mix you could ask for. With Robert Smith's awsome voice you can really feel the emotions he pours into his lyrics. My favorite tracks are \\"Maybe Someday\\" and \\"39.\\" So with the new cd in hand or in the cd player lets all hope there is still more to come from one of the best bands ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of the Best","review":"this is a great cd, typical The Cure music, deep, dark, pensive, my personal favorate is The last day of summer, have heard such affective, emotional, powerful for a while, the cure rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"One long beautiful poem set to beautiful (but not sappy) music. Thats how i'd describe this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's Not It!","review":"Well, with being maybe one of the Cure's biggest fans, I would have to say that this CD is sweet and true. Compared to \\"Wild Mood Swings\\", this CD is getting closer to being like Disentigration. No, it may not have the same capturing tunes, but then again...it's not a duplicate. Listen to this CD as it's a first...not part of a trilogy...and you'll learn to love it just as much as I do. And please remember, this WILL not be the last CD. Robert's always got something up his sleeve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Album!","review":"I am a new fan of The Cure all i have is Show and Bloodflowers, but i must say that Bloodflowers is terrific! My favorite song is Out of This World. It and all of the other songs on the album are great, and if you want to hear some great songs i recommend that you check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite Cure cd so far","review":"I only got into the Cure through this CD. I bought it last year and I have to say I didn't like it. I thought it was boring..But then I got Galore, Wish and explored the Cure more and became more familiar with their style, and now Bloodflowers is my fav Cure cd. So all those who don't like it now..just give it some time.The songs are poetically beautiful, my favourites are Out of this World, Watching me Fall, Bloodflowers, There is no if and Where the birds always sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smith's voices ring clear","review":"I can't think of a finer goodbye statement, as this clearly is meant to be . . . not that he can't change his mind.I'll add to the other comments, that Smith never gets enough credit for his guitar work, which is not only excellent, but unique. I'm hard pressed to think of another guitarist who's voice is so instantly recognizable, in the league with B.B. King for example. The guitar lines in Bloodflowers are striking and beautiful. A shame if he puts his axe down for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Cure CD in the Last 10 Years!","review":"In a word, Bloodflowers is breathtaking. After listening to somuch crap that is on the radio these days, it is so nice to hear some really emotional and powerful music. Bloodflowers is a tour de force of emotion and Robert has never sounded better. Musically, Bloodflowers is dark and lush, and in some parts very beautiful. All the songs are great with wonderful arrangement. Personal favorites include Watching Me Fall, Maybe Someday, 39, and Bloodflowers. The only thing that bothers me is that Robert is literally saying goodbye in his lyrics. Don't go yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Cure CD","review":"There is an interview with Robert Smith in the April 2000 Guitar Player magazine in which he indicates that for this CD he was heavily influenced by the guitar sounds of the Scottish band Mogwai, particularly their first CD. I've checked it out here on Amazon and it is very Cure like."},{"rating":"2","title":"old school sounds refreshing","review":"An album released on a CD- it is great to hear something that was not meant to spend three summer weeks cradled between Mariah Carey and some corporate assembled vocal master race soaking up dreams of a Blockbuster Music Award...Bloodflowers is no return to classic Cure- then again no one should be that troubled for an entire life... The Cure misses the members who have left but Robert Smith's voice remains a welcome friend and a brilliant artist..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I followed the remix to greatness","review":"The first Cure song I ever herd was on the American Psycho soundtrack, it was the remixed 'Watching Me Fall'. I soon became obsessed with this single song on the soundtrack and thought I must seek the origin, and I found Bloodflowers. Bloodflowers is depressing, yes but it is a joy to listen to becuase of all the irony. None of the songs sound alike, they are all unique, and my favorite is 'There is No If...', call me a sap for love songs but I think how Smith describes the very first spark and the fall of two people combined in eachother is enormously powerful, i also like, of course 'Watching Me Fall', Probably becuase I love really long songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"And I paid money for this?

This movie isn't good enough to be aired on SciFi or Chiller TV. The budget for this film must have been about $5.00. There were no sets or costumes. The script was written by someone in 5th grade.

I wanted to get her a rocking chair initially, like her older brothers all had, but the way she loves to sit and look at her books made me look at this type of chair. I spent hours comparing this chair to every other chair out there. The price on this one couldn't be beat for the quality. It's cute, she talks to the smiling face on it, and it's colorful enough to fit in anyone's decor. It is a very strong, quality built chair. My oldest son, going on 16, even tried it out! She climbs in and out and jumps and it does not tip. She LOVES sitting in it ALL THE TIME. She knows it's her special seat. I do not regret not getting the rocking chair.

What should have been a touching story ended up seeming like someone's term paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Disorganized, and Highly Repetitive","review":"I have read over 40 books about World War I, and this is the worst book I've ever read on the subject. The book is boring, disorganized, and relentlessly pursues it pacifist agenda. The book is repititous ad nauseaum. In the author's attempt to convince his readers that the ordinary soldiers didn't want to fight, he presents a huge number of barely discernible short stories and excerpts throughout the book. The text is erratic and disorganized. This unconvincing book seems not like the work of a published author, but the work of a human psychology student's term paper. Much of the book simply consists of word-for-word extracts from other published media. Ignore the positive reviews on the back cover - it's clear these reviewers didn't read more than the first few pages. This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put It Down After Page Thirty","review":"The title of this review says it all. At page thirty you have the entire story. At page 38, I recall wondering what the remainder of the book was about. The author had already described the Christmas truce at a few locations on the battle line and added that headquarters was not in favor of the temporary peace. The remainder of the book is devoted to giving more and more examples of the same. A nice magazine article, as a book it became tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get it from the Library or borrow from a friend","review":"What is happening to Non fiction .... Time and time again I find myself buying and then reading a great story for 30-40 pages then its downhill fast .. Having read many of the classics associated with WWI ,I was looking forward to an extra dimention to an extraordinary event . The book delivers early on then becomes a series of random references and is repetitive . I dont blame the author , the editors and publishers must accept responsibility for this occurring .Get it from the Library or borrow from a friend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and repetitious...","review":"Another promising book that is marred by repetition of the facts (the same story is told over and over again by the German, British, French and Belgian troops). It seems that I've been running across this far too much lately in these short historical books, and it's disappointing. I've read some of Weintraub's longer works, and they are very good, but this time, he really dropped the ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Not Always?","review":"The book was, in my opinion, well written and thoroughly researched. Much of it included letters home written by soldiers of both sides, which I found interesting to read.This book, without intending (I don't think), makes the point that politicians and old men declare wars, while it is the young who must fight and die. Most of the soldiers had no qualms with the other side, and some even made friends, as you'll learn through reading.I read this book in only a couple days. It's a fast read, but not the type of book to read in one afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, but book is hard to follow","review":"This is a great story for the holiday season and is a great anomaly in what was a horrible war of attrition. However, the book is more of a collection of thoughts rather than an oral history or an actual story. At times I couldn't tell which side I was reading about unless the names were totally obvious. Also it may be tougher to understand if you don't know the geography or the history of the WWI era and how it came to pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little heavy on facts, but a good read","review":"The author went to great lengths to make this book an accurate account of this historical event. This account makes it a difficult read at times, but knowing how this event unfurled is the point of the book. After reading this book, I would recommend the movie \\"Joyeaux Noel\\", a beautifully filmed account of the event starring Daniel Bruehl (\\"Goodbye Lenin\\") and Diane Kruger (most would know her from \\"National Treasure\\", but she is truly an international star, speaking in her native German, English and French)."},{"rating":"1","title":"silent night","review":"There is a great story here. Unfortunately, it is not in this book. It feels like the author did a huge amount of research, and then just put it in order and published it. There is little \\"story\\".

If you want that extra kick of protein, I suggest mixing it half and half with a better tasting cereal. The protein did leave me feeling more full throughout the morning, but I took no pleasure in eating it. To make matters worse, the flakes are very thick and large, which makes them even harder to swallow. If you're going to make a bad tasting flake cereal, please have the courtesy to make the flakes smaller so they don't scrape my throat while I'm gagging on them. For some people, the ends justify the means. If you are one of these people, go ahead and buy it. I like a little more flavor in the morning, so I don't think I'll be buying it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovemyhealth","review":"I have been searching everywhere for this product. No stores around me carry the Protein Plus version except for one store 30 miles away. I purchased 8 boxes at that store because it is the best cereal I can find. I eat it with no milk (out of a cup), so I don't know how milk affects the flakes. My nine year old daughter even likes the plain flakes. Yes, I eat more healthy food than average people so I enjoy non-sugared cereals. I LOVE the nutitional makeup of Special K protein plus! LOW CALORIES, HIGH PROTEIN, MED/HIGH FIBER!!

Big waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incorrect Nutritional Information","review":"The nutritional information listed on this site is incorrect, and does not correspond with the labeling on the package. The error is, however, quite understandable, give the the deliberate effort Kellog's has made to mislead consumers in the product labeling.In your web table, it indicates 10g protein for cereal alone, and 14g protein with 1/2 cup milk. The box label indicates only a single figure (10g) and the percentages (12% without milk, 20% with milk) and does not supply recommended daily protein for the 2000 calorie reference diet, though it is indicated that 1/2 cup milk supplies 4g protein.If you work out the math, the 3/4 cup cereal serving must have only 6g of protein. (x=0.12*y, x+4=0.20*y, so 0.08*y=4, so y=50, and 0.12*y=6).Just FYI."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Stuff is Nasty!!","review":"I'm not a fan of High Protein Low Fat foods but I thought I'd give this a try since regular special K and the other special K flavors were all so good. I can't eat this stuff, I even tried mixing it with other special K flavors...and in the end I still wince when I have to eat this Protein Plus stuff. It's no wonder it's 10X more healthy than the regular stuff. It has this odd flavor to it that leaves a nasty feeling in my mouth. I really don't know what other reviewers are talking about and I can't imagine trying to eat the other worse cereals they're talking about. Unless you're a health nut, this stuff might be hard to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"If you're looking to buy this item online it's probably because you love it and can't find it anywhere else. So, I won't try to change your mind but let me just say that as a health-conscious, natural food nut, this cereal seemed worth a try, especially since I love the regular special K, but I found it to be tasteless and roughly the texture of chopped particle board.For someone on a low-carb diet, I'm sure this probably beats some other low carb cereals, but I couldn't tolerate it without an extra 1/2 tsp. sugar in the bowl. I tried giving it to hubby, without telling him I hated it, just to see if I could get rid of the box, but he won't eat it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!","review":"This cereal with soymilk (vanilla or regular) makes this a great breakfast in the morning packed with protein and very filling."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this!

I definitely think that I overpaid big time for them. If I were to see them in the shop I would have passed on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea in concept, bad in execution","review":"I ordered these along with \\"Curley Cue Twisted Spiral Sterling Silver Hook Earrings\\" from Silver Insanity. I am not sure if they are the ones who manufacture these or if they buy them from somewhere else for resale, but they are VERY flimsy and were not symmetrical at all. When I started to bend them to symmetry, it was evident that any new bend was going to be irreversible and permanently kink the metal. I thought they looked very cool with a hint of sci-fi, but they looked awkward when I tried them on. It reminded me of misshapen paperclips with a silver BB glued at the end. I ended up returning them. They are an interesting pair of earrings, but be prepared to get exactly what you see in the picture -- they don't line up. That's only noticeable as the wearer; other people who see you wearing them will most compliment them. There were no problems at all in getting my refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"love em","review":"I bought these on a whim because I use this seller all the time and I trust their products I got them today an I love them they work real well with my oval face and long neck.

Unfortunately to my mind what is happening with .NET jump on the market that programmers looses the skills and start thinking in terms of wrappers where .NET just adds one more layer of it. It is nothing bad but I personally was looking for information what is happening at the core of .NET framework and not just to read how easy things can be done these days.

In it, she seems to be veering toward the \\"torn bodice\\" romance genre, concentrating less on the medieval aspects of the time and the development of a good mystery.

I stumbled upon this song on my cable station's Soundscapes channel, and fell in love with it the first time I heard it. Bruce's music is pure magic. I never knew the pedal steel guitar could produce such a full and sensuous sound until I heard this album. He is a master of the pedal steel guitar.Like a true pioneer, Bruce takes you down several paths, ranging from a couple of eastern-style tracks, to more traditional 'new-age' compositions. Not to leave country & western totally ignored, his 'High Desert' explores the lost art of western music. 'Outpost' conveys a sense of loneliness and isolation that its name implies.Don't take my word for it. You can listen to every track on this CD from his website - www.brucekaphan.com.

Paying 60 bucks, I was expecting more.Overall: Meh, get an ipod or somethin' else.

My focus was log4j, and I found that most of the information is freely available from apache. No real value was added here. I expected at least an in depth compare-contrast between log4j and jdk logging, but this section was very terse. What would be a nice add would be a technical reference that would be one stop shop for syntax. The book didn't even provide a PatternLayout key of codes for logging items, that would be useful.What we really need is a practical bridge between javadocs and this book, which is a high level academic overview.I should have just gotten \\"The complete log4j manual\\", but I thought this might have been more extensive.

This paint is similar to working with epoxy glue, but using the spray can is better than the quart cans. It is very thick in order to produce the hammered effect, which by the way it does so-so. It certainly doesn't look like the label suggests. More importantly, there is no brand of rollers known to man, including Purdy, that doesn't get lots of fibers stripped and embedded in the paint. The paint gives you mere seconds to work with it, and if you go over the same area twice within a few seconds like a normal painter does, it produces long strings that become embedded in the paint. It was just a hideous mess. It ruined my project, cost me immense time and expense to strip and repaint, and I complained so bitterly to Rustoleum that I told them to yank it off the shelves. I strongly suggest to others that they use another brand if they want this effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what everyone is hyped about...","review":"First of all, this new album of theirs is hardly worth me taking the time to write this review.

No album will ever compare to their heavily revered EP. During the time of the release of their EP most hardcore was good and Bane was one of the best. Now, I regret to say, is the death of many hardcore bands including Bane. This new album is terribly boring. It has sappy breakdowns. And most depressingly, the vocals are tired and forced, as opposed to their EP. Everyone, if you haven't already, buy the EP. It has truly amazing breakdowns with a beautiful structure of verses, heart felt lyrics and vocals comparable to those of the most sincere hardcore band ever...Trial.

I was fortunate to know three Hornet aviators, and the two who lived to read this turkey were appalled that any author would think that the arresting hook goes on the flight deck rather than the airplane! Furthermore, the title is wholly misleading since it refers to a brief period of little activity in the Guadalcanal campaign when the Hornet was the only carrier available. The embarrassing story of the Hornet at Midway still remains to be told objectively, but the bottom line is: the US Navy fought its most crucial battle with two useful carriers against four Japanese veterans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't realized","review":"For the person who doesn't realize what their government has been up to for so many years.

I'm very disappointedI'm going to contact Garmin and Amazon tomorrow to see what to do.

Up until now it has worked nearly flawlessly. This unit was not abused, dropped, emersed in water or put through anything negligent. Just normal usage - 75 to 100 miles a week - mostly dry rides. I was very happy with the unit - it has all the features that I need for basic cycling without the 705 bells and whistles. I've tried the FAQ's at the Garmin site and the unit does respond (reset + mode) - but only with it hooked up to a computer via a USB cable. Without the cable, nothing!

One of the features that interested me was the altimeter which unfortunately didn't work - kept registering 65000 ft. I checked the firmware which was up to date and then called Garmin. Was left on hold for about 15 minutes, before receiving assistance. The rep was helpful until we determined that the unit was defective and needed to be returned. Garmin wants me to pay for shipping which I could sort of accept if this was an inexpensive device, which it's not. I've had it less than a week, it doesn't work, so I'm at a loss to understand why I need to pay to have it replaced. I'll be taking it back to Target for a refund, and will no longer do business with Garmin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality/Service Poor","review":"I had my Edge 305 for less than a year before it started having problems. The unit just simply powers itself off during high speed descents and rough road patches. I thought this might be due to excessive vibration...so I tried to come up with some different mounts to remedy the problem. The next spring the power issue became overwhelming and I contacted service for repair. To their credit, even though I was about 3 months past warranty, they agreed to cover the repair. I FedEx'd my unit and was told there would be a 10-day turnaround. After 3 weeks I called to find out the status of my RMA...at which point I found out Garmin had LOST my unit. They sent me a refurbished unit. The refurbished unit arrived on a monday. It worked that first day. On Tuesday, the GPS would not acquire any satellites and was worthless. I called Garmin the very next morning and they have agreed to send me a new \\"in the box\\" unit. However there will be another 10 day lead time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I have owned many GPS' and this acquires a signal faster and under more cover than any of them.

I checked the device's elevation indicator against a topo map and found it to be quite accurate. Another nice thing is that the 305HR syncs up with satellites quite rapidly where the other device took up to 15 to 20 minutes longer to sync and in some cases, not at all.Finally, the device can be mounted on the handle bar stem so that you can reference it at all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works","review":"I loved everything about the 305, except for its proclivity for ceasing to function.

The first one went back to the store where I bought it, the second one was returned to Garmin, the final one was exchanged for a Suunto T6 which I have been very happy with (i.e. it works.)Garmin has released several firmware updates that did address the early problems I was having with the unit, but after the third one simply turned off several times on a commute home I gave up. The low (MUCH lower than the advertised) battery life per charge was frustrating as well. I could have lived with that if the unit had been reliable, but as is, I could not recommend this product. Hopefully the new version will work better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cycling Computer Yet","review":"Garmin really has a winner with the Edge. Heartrate and Cadence information is right on.

Superintendents Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James have been called to investigate. It appears the death may be linked to a number of small burglaries which have occurred.However, the as they investigate, they find Gilbert was not a popular man. Complicating the investigation is Gemma's discomfort with the personal relationship growing between her and Kincaid.It's nice to find a police procedural that is a traditional mystery. The characters are realistic; not over-the top or angst ridden. The relationship developing between Kincaid and Gemma is well handled with her concerns being understandable.Crombie knows how to plot a story. I thought I knew where the story was going.

It's HORRIBLY formatted and you'll be lucky if you can get it to play all the way through on your player. The menus are also AWEFUL. The video quality is VHS quality as this is a \\"video to DVD transfer.\\"3. The instruction is HORRIBLE. Boring, non-repetitive, very hard to learn from.

If one actually reads the essay they will see the thin \\"Weenie Mentality\\" of this seriously flawed conceit. Saying that there are no interesting ideas in contemporary Japan and therefore the artists cannot be judged harshly reeks of suspicion. Based on bad-boy HELLO KITTY Murakami and NAra are just undeveloped \\"manga\\" characters with no story line. considering that the role of Manga in Japanese society -underground as well- is minimal.

It seems like the book has a lot of forms, but the text on the forms is very useful. The child care reference form is very good, I wish I would have asked those questions when I hired my last nanny. Downloading forms from IRS saves time. The section on job descriptions and schedules is very helpful. The CD-Rom makes the book good for several uses because you don't have to fill in the forms in the book. The only thing missing is simple recipes for the nanny. The best thing about the book is the author sticks to the presenting straight information. She created terms like parent employer and childcare trio, she does not offer her opinions nor does she tell stories. The ABCs of Hiring a Nanny is really a step by step program. This is a great gift for a co worker at the office shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD was unusable","review":"This book is an outline with a bunch of forms.

Fortunately, he figured out how to use the clippers with the perfect setting for his hair after only a few minutes of fiddling with it and barely glancing at the directions. Then, after several tries, he managed to cut his own hair, with me guiding him to only a couple of rough spots that needed a little bit of refining to match the rest of his hair. He likes a very short, military-type haircut, and this works very well for that.It was probably overkill getting a kit this fancy for only my husband's use, but the price wasn't all that high compared to what it will save him over time in the cost of professional haircuts--not to mention the convenience of not having to drive to the barber shop.All in all, it's a great value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"I purchased these clippers to cut my dogs hair & perfect.

Really disappointed with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"why :(","review":"never thought i would have to give a bad review for an amazon sold product, this clipper works really good, smooth, cuts clean but omg !! wahl i am certain it cost just a few cents to produce these guards, for crying out loud its an American product, i gave my two sons a hair cut today and the guards kept opening out and leaving patches, i feel like throwing the whole damn thing in the garbage, i had a con air before that worked fine for years and the only reason it gave up is because i thought i would give it a tune up and dulled the blades, yes some people will say you get what you pay for but i could have gotten a no name brand for the same price, but i went for the name, i am sorry wahl this is my first wahl product and it will be my last, very very very disappointed customer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far","review":"After 12 uses it still works as good as new.

It's been working great. It has a wide blade, so it may not be ideal for precision trimming. But I use it regularly to keep my beard consistently short.

No complaints with these clippers. As others have mentioned, the guards are all made out of plastic, so I do wonder if they might wear out before too long, but so far there have been no show of wear and tear.

We had to replace the original only because we dropped the clipper while cleaning it, after my wife finished cutting my hair. We were a little concerned that the quality of the new unit would not equal that of the older one, but we were both pleased to see that if anything the quality has improved. The new clipper has a solid feel in the hand, it is more easily adjustable, and the kit of plastic parts, combs, scissors, and case tops the paper box we got with the earlier product. We paid a little more for this clipper than we did for the one we bought 20 years ago, but then isn't everything more expensive now? The good news is that Wahl still offers an excellent, US-made product at a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm!","review":"It's an awesome product, easy to use has a good amount of accessories for the price, totally recommend it.

Do not purchase!","review":"Short and simple. Do not purchase! On first use, it left metal barbs in my skin.I thought it quickly cut me twice, as is always possible with any kind of razor, but there was no blood. The pain didn't go away, and the barbs were small enough that they were barely visible to the naked eye. I had to use a jeweler's loop and tweezers to get them out. Under magnification, they were clearly metal barbs lodged in my skin. I'm just glad they didn't go deep enough to get completely underneath. Consider this your warning. I don't know if Wahl had a bad manufacturing batch, or if this kind of quality is the norm, but it has certainly turned me away as a customer.Aside from the metal barbs, my impression was poor in the couple minutes I used it. Loud, heavy vibration, etc. Poor quality to say the least.This is without a doubt, the worst product I have ever bought on Amazon - and I do a lot of shopping here. Credits to Amazon for making the return effortless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunctioned after 5 uses","review":"I bought these clippers less than two months ago to replace my old Conair clippers that I left behind while traveling. I use my clippers exclusively for beard trimming. After no more than five or six uses the blades got misaligned, causing an extremely loud buzzing and painful pulling of my beard. I whacked it back into place the first few times it did it, but now that doesn't even work. Extremely disappointing and a waste of money. I never should have left the Conair brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful! I'm currently bleeding from a defective one!","review":"We have years of experience using hair clippers in our household. We just bought this locally to replace a lithium cordless Wahl that died in 10 months after only 10 uses.This Wahl color pro looked fine but when my wife trimmed my neck we found out the hard way that the metal blade guard was screwed on slightly crooked and one side of the blades teeth were exposed to saw into my skin. I had high hopes for this with all the positive reviews but this one is dangerous. I am going to go with a different brand after owning two defective Wahl products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice kit except for the trimmer itself","review":"I want to like this trimmer. It is attractive and has a wonderful user friendly design with lots color coded trimmer guide attachments with a convinient legend printed on the trimmer itself. Corded means it should have no shortage of power unlike the cordless trimmers I have owned in the past which can run out charge mid trim - awkward!Alas it is not so. This trimmer is so ridiculously underpowered it struggles to cut my hair. Brand new fresh out of the box with supposedly sharp blades. What happens over time as the blades lose their edge? I suppose the upside is that it is so weak it won't hurt much when it starts pulling my hair.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kit for a great value","review":"This Wahl 20 piece kit is a great set to have for personal hair grooming. It comes with tons of clips and even ones for those pesky behind the ear ones. The shaver itself is pretty heavy and comes with a decent length cord and the blades are adjustable with the little lever. So far I've used it about 15 times and I did have one time where it made a louder sound, but once I turned it off and on again, it was back to normal. It cuts pretty well. Normally with my last buzzers I had to go over 2-3 times, but This usually gets everything the second time. It comes with all the other normal items like oil, scissors, brush, and combs. It doesn't come with a hair schmock thing or whatever you call it. The container is great but sometimes it can get a little tight inside making it hard to close the container. Think of this...This one purchase is equal to one haircut. I've saved a ton of money with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great clipper","review":"This is a very good hair clipper, great for the price. It doesn't snag or tangle the hair.

I bought this replacement this year since that other unit's blade was starting to tilt, making it crooked.We cut his hair once a week, but don't use any of the guards on it so I can't speak to how well the guards work. The older razor held up for around 150 home haircuts (saving us around 3000.00!) and was still functional when we bought the replacement. We only oiled the blade one time.This razor holds up extremely well and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to save money by cutting hair at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clippers were sent to us USED and full of someone else's hair!!","review":"The clippers arrived a day earlier which we were thrilled about. Unfortunately, as soon as we took it out of the amazon box it was obvious that the item had been used and returned. The box was scraped, worn, and poorly taped. We crossed our fingers that just the packaging was damaged, etc and the clippers would be new and unused....Not the case, in fact it was quiet the opposite. The body of the clippers (plastic) was dinged and scratched, and the blades were absolutely filthy and disgusting full of hair and God only knows what else! The seller should NOT be allowed to resell clippers, or other items that have been returned USED! To say that we were offended by this would be putting it lightly! I wish that I could write a positive review or add some feedback as to how the clippers work, but unfortunately I can't do that until we receive new unused clippers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got an used product.","review":"Noticed finger prints and stuck hairs on the blade after opening the package.

They seemed to work just fine, and the price was right. After five or six months, they were no longer cutting hair evenly. Today, eight months after purchasing, the clippers won't stay on. They just turn off mid-haircut, and come back on after a minute or two. I understand that they weren't the most expensive clippers, but I did expect them to last for more than 8 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible durability","review":"When I first got this product it seemed to work great, however after having only had it for about 6 months, it's already broken. I'm not sure what the problem is, but the on and off switch no longer works properly. When flipping the switch it's like I had to hover it between off and on in just the right location to make it work, and even then it eventually just gave out and the switch wouldn't even move.They also don't use stainless steel so the metal blades rust. I noticed this almost immediately. One time, because of this, after turning it on, the blades seized up and wouldn't work. After moving the height adjustment switch (which moves the blades), all of the rust broke off and it started to work again...I mean what the hell!?This product is cheap but you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I love this haircutting combo.

It's going to take a little practice to get the bit over the ears right, but I went over my entire head several times with the 1\\" comb and the motor didn't get stuck once.

This being my first time cutting their hair, I was pleasantly surprised. The motor is very strong and the clippers are easy to handle - not has heavy as many high quality clippers. Their cuts usually run $10-$12 each bi-wkly, and I purchased the clippers for $19.97 - I have already profited from the purchase as my bill for the boys is usually $60 per mos or $30 per mos. if their hair is cut on a monthly basis. The only issue that I have had is when I tape/outline their hair, the blade is not very friendly with my sons' hair grade (African American). I have been checking out You tube and am searching for a site to adjust the blade as I read on another comment, but overall, I am very pleased with my purchase (and shocked @ the high cutting quality of trimmers that are under $20.00).

If I raised the taper just a little bit it worked though, so no issues finished off the haircut. It's super easy to take off the blade and empty the hair.Though it did say in instructions that if your hair is too long to cut it with a scissors first, something I didn't do.So overall, I am super happy with this purchase even though I don't really look good in a buzz cut :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value and the clipper guides fit my old Vidal Sassoon clipper","review":"Great Value for the money.

The clipper does not cut evenly with the guide combs and leaves my hair stepped when using a No.1 or No.2 clip. For a simple trim just using a No.2 clip I have to spend nearly 30mins going over the same areas over and over again to try to get it smooth.Recently I purchased a No.1-1/2 guide comb. I did not think I could get more disappointed but I was wrong. The No.1-1/2 clip leaves my hair more uneven than before. The problem is that the teeth on the guide bend as easy as a sheet of paper, and the clip continuously falls off during operation. Twice it fell off and I nearly dug the metal trimmer in to my scalp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely rusted out after only one use","review":"I can't say how bummed I am that this happened.

We were so pleased with the cut when we used it the first time and were happy with the product...until a month later. We reached for the Wahl kit, stored under the sink, only to find it completely rusted out and unusable. Before you say \\"it was probably too damp,\\" I will tell you that under our bathroom sink is very dry, and it was only there for storage for about 2 weeks (was in the closet before with his things).

I grew up in a house with parents who ONLY listened to classical music, so I was slow to explore other genres and am still filling gaps. Luckily, junior high had schooled me enough so that I was already a huge Erasure fan, and I plunked down my allowance for their Abba covers without a second thought. I loved it immediately -- it was in constant Walkman auto-rotation for weeks. And cheesy as they are, these Erasure covers led me to discover the originals... and now I love Erasure AND Abba equally and unreservedly. I realize, however, that I'm in the minority. But hey, I think you either love this little album or you hate it. I hope you love it. I do, I do, I do, I do, I do (ha, couldn't resist)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally not something made for the novice!","review":"I have been looking for good textbooks on this subject for quite some time, as most texts don't have much to offer me.

It can be difficult to get through all of the information, or dig out what you may find useful. Her emphasis on some problem behaviors being the consequence of an imbalance in neurotransmitters is not shared by everyone, as a good majority of these animals can be considered normal when evaluated in an ethological sense.The handouts at the end of the book are very useful in getting a history from an owner, as well as handouts for the treatment of problem behaviors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone who has a cat should own this book","review":"I have 6 cats with very different personalities this book helped me in understanding them and actually helped in creating a lot more harmony in the house RECOMMEND!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff in awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I am a person who loves her \\"Hot\\" hot sauce!!!

I like to sling it over my back like a guitar - you can't do that with some bigger bags. Only problem is that the pad on the strap doesn't move up and down the strap.

The characters in this book are much like those in Tolkien's \\"The Silmarillion,\\" with a slight reference in each story to the bible. The alphabet devised by Christian is also very similar to that of Tolkien's. Also, the character names are made to confuse. Every name has random accent marks on it that I've only seen in a dictionary, and that are inpossible to pronounce.The drawings in this book are the stereotypical fantasy drawings. If you go to a bookstore's fantasy section, you will see the identical pictures on the covers of various fantasy novels. I would much rather read Eragon because at least that book is long enought to develop a plot.Save your time and go to the source--Tolkien. At least people will know what you're talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully expensive for not much content","review":"For the price I was expecting an expert level, in-depth analysis of the travel industry.

Maddox is well qualified to take on the task. One aspect I appreciate in this book is Maddox's input to a growing trend of Wesleyan scholars that see Wesley's theology as more of an attempt at synthesis (Protestant, Roman, Eastern) than blazing new ground. This removes Wesley from the fringe of historic Christianity (much to the chagrine of reform theologians) and places him smack dab in the center.Does Maddox accomplish his task? You be the judge of that.ONE WARNING: As you can tell by my review, this is not light reading.

Cops and robbers are not King George's men, an urban landscape is NOT an inn and purple moors.I think your own imagination does a better job conjuring up the images described in this poem. There is no need for a comic book version just because it appeals more to the mass market. The trend towards grabbing the attention of young people by shoving this kind of story out to the public in the marketplace and libraries ranks right up there to me with Shakespeare done as a graphic novel.

The advice is based on a careful blend of well know frameworks from leaders like Professor Michael Porter and years of experience from the authors and leading corporations. The descriptions of how to use CRM to increase competitive advantage and improve profitability are particularly intriguing, as they elevate CRM from a business initiatve to a business imperative.The authors have included plenty of examples of real world successes and failures, and hence keep the book rooted in practical and actionable guidelines.

Up to this point I've avoided Mystery Writers of America Grand Master McBain (too popular and too many other books waiting to be read) but this little 1976, non-87th Precinct, gem was time well spent. The story is about the aftermath, told from the perspective of a small time New York City armed-robber, of a Bronx liquor store robbery gone bad. The writing is fairly fast-paced, the story unsentimental and the attitude hard-boiled. McBain, best known for his police procedural 87th Precinct series (54 books since 1956 and still counting) is worth a look if your literary tastes tend towards this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track List","review":"Heilig-Meyers proudly presents The Spirit Of Christmas! / Heilig-Meyers / 1997 //Track list:1} Oh, Christmas Tree - Appalachian Instrumental2} Silent Night - Eddie Rabbitt3} It Came Upon A Midnight Clear - Instrumental Sax4} Joy To The World - Boxcar Willie5} Away In A Manger - Tony Orlando6} O, Holy Night - Jennifer Wilson7} Carol Of Bells - Hammer Dulcimer8} Deck The Halls - Stella Parton9} God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen - Mickey Gilley10} We Wish You A Merry Christmas - Eddie Rabbitt11} Go Tell It On The Mountain / Ben E.

The book is excellent, exploring everything from some of the controversies and concerns of PMC's, what it takes to get with a PMC, what you can expect being a PMC, and thats only the first third of the book, the personal stories about the truck drivers, trainers, and security contractors is the heart and soul of the book and gives you a interesting and deep look into these men and women who still serve their country in another capacity and perform tasks that put less a burden on our already strained military, while making a nice profit for themselves, all in all a excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bloody Business","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this book.

The book spells out what type of contractors serve in Iraq and what I enjoyed the most, gives personal accounts of the contractors who serve. I am considering taking a position as an International Police Officer in Iraq and I found the personal accounts of the officers who served there quite compelling.The author remains very politically neutral, unlike recent books I have read about this subject, and lets the reader decide how he or she feels about the involvement of \\"civilians\\" in the warzone.

He brings a Green Beret commander's quirky, realistic, pragmatic, view of the world and its people to his story and tells the tale in a graceful, disciplined way. His admiration and affection for the people he describes does not prevent him from an honest evaluation of them and their roles on the modern battlefield.

Tempo, etc. Being a lover of classical and most Baroque era music, I had to add these to my collection. They make for good background music, but lack the depth of any symphony.These recordings are really good and this orchestra plays these pieces extremely well. If you want a change of pace once in a while, these are a must. Even though I don't fancy these German dances, I do like them.I think you will start to feel the lack of emotion and depth that I feel.

It does the trick. There's no longer a need for me to use moisturizer, wait for it to be absorbed, and then apply foundation.Should mention up front that the natural look is my preference so I'm attracted to formulations with just a hint of color. Of course, the addition SPF 20 is a very real and practical bonus.When using this skin tends to have a very natural look but \\"better,\\" if you will. My skin is fair so I use \\"Porcelain,\\" which takes away the paleness but does not camouflage skin tone. It's best for me to apply the tint with fingertips and gently smooth.Wouldn't give up my foundation as it's needed for evenings and special occasions, but for daily use this Tinted Moisturizer really saves a step in the morning and saves my face all day."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"Read great reviews about this product but it just wasn't that great. too watered down for me (older skin).

It's very light and doesn't make me feel like I have any makeup on. I'm a big fan of the natural look and no one can tell that I have this on. Most people just comment that my skin looks nice. I workout alot and this stuff doesn't run or streak, which is nice when I need to wipe all the sweat off my face. Since I hate foundation this is perfect for me.

It's thick, greasy and looks very artificial. Perhaps the oil-free version works better, but this product was like applying paint. I've used foundations in the past but now like tinted moisturizers because they are light, easy to apply and have a very subtle look. This product was like applying grease paint. If you want a thick cover than this is the product you might consider. I bought another product from the same line, the brightening powder and it's o.k., but don't think I would purchase it again.

It does not cover the red spots on my face, only diminishes it and evens out minor unevenness.Con:consistency - it does not feel like a moisturizer. Instead of slippery, it feels a little watery, therefore difficult to blend and must be applied a little at a time. It is good for my combination skin or in the summer and does not look greasy. I would recommend a moisturizer underneath for dry skin or in the winter and I think it works for oily/combination skin.wear - it is somewhat long lasting.

I have very normal skin -- doesn't take much moisturizer. The first time I tried this product, I applied it three times and it STILL lacked the moisture I get from my drugstore stand-bys like Oil of Olay.The name of this product is incredibly misleading.

The coverage was not too little or too much. My skin just looks better, even though it looks so natural that nobody would know I was wearing makeup at all. That is ideal for some days.

I've played everything from Zork to Bard's Tale to Diablo 2 LOD to Oblivion (all of which are great games)Then I attempted to play Enchanted Arms. I knew within the first 5 minutes that I was not going to like this game. One of the main characters uses a saxaphone as his weapon, \\"blasting\\" enemies with song notes. The combat system is confusing and unfun. It's as if the people who created this game had never played an RPG before, because it doesn't seem to borrow any of the good attributes of the many great RPG's which have gone before it.The fact that this game comes out on the very advanced XBox 360 system makes it expensive, but believe me when I say that you will quickly regret dropping $50.00 on it.

For example, he mentions how his love for another character is an ingredient in everything that he bakes. And after playing the game for a few hours and listening to his constant mushy remarks made with a horrid lisp, I had to shut the game off and I will be selling my copy to a poor unsuspecting soul who thinks that this game might be as fun as Final Fantasy games.

I found this to be another excellent addition to the Father Koesler series. The Detroit now-retired parish priest solves the crime once more calling on his knowledge of church politics and scripture. The plot deals with a famous and popular Anglican priest, who decides to sacrifice it all and be a Catholic priest. His reason for doing so remains a mystery to the end. Neither a Catholic nor Anglican I found the narrative fascinating. The murder almost becomes a backdrop to the hate surrounding this sacrifice and a black priest. The author presents us with several red herrings to this complex puzzle. I can honestly say I believe that The Sacrifice has breathed new life into the series.

What you get here is essentially Stu Spasm solo recordings. Unfortunately, these versions just highlight how much he needs his band. Sure, there were always an evolving cast of players in the Goat, but all of those players brought an energy that Spasm could work off of.

First thing that I noticed is that they are very irregularly sized amongst themselves. The cotton is rigid, and not as soft as what you can get for the same price elsewhere. The fit around the shoulders is small and awkward. Though these shirts are tagless, hanes produces other kinds of shirts in a tagged variety. That they don't combine these things seems a bit contrived to me. Overall, I still have two of them as work shirts, and they probably would have lasted longer if I could have dealt with the awkward fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think","review":"These shirts are not really what you think if you are looking for something to lounge around in or work out in they are more form fitting.

I thought this would be a fascinating book, but the author has a weak, erratic style, and I found it all frustrating and long-winded. Even the author's theories of the true perpetrator were a bit vague.

This book offers excellent confidence for young parents-to-be. I knew nothing about pregnancy, but soon found myself feeling like an expert from this book and the classes.Dr. Bradley did so much to help make giving birth a family experience and not one just for the mom. I admit that having been his patient may have been an advantage, but this is a great book with timeless advice and encouragement. One thing though. If you do decide you want, or need, meds, by all means don't let yourself feel any guilt.

I wanted to read it first in order to pick out the most useful tidbits for my husband, but I got increasingly frustrated as, nearly 70 pages into the book, I hadn't read anything worth repeating. The author spends most of his time rambling and relating anecdotes about natural birth mothers. Basically he tells you that there are ways to help your wife through childbirth, but then refuses to tell you what those ways are. I felt like I was reading in circles.

The tone caters to the lowest intellectual common denominator with overly simplistic, obvious commentary. The language and voice are stilted, and Bradley ruins content that could otherwise be useful. His statements regarding the impact of diet and drugs on the fetus are in many cases inaccurate and misleading. In addition, he makes continual references to god which are unnecessary and add no value.I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Husbands that will read it!","review":"I purchased this for my husband to assist me in the birth of our fifth child naturally.

We knew a lot about the method and were very interested in using it in the birth of our first baby. We expected that the book would give us more information on the principles of the Bradley method than it did. The book's basic motiv is just to convince you that nonmedicated natural childbirth is the best way. We already knew that; we just wanted some literature beyond lamaze to show us how to manage the pain more effectively.

Thanks Bradly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously awesome!","review":"I didn't read this all the way through but my husband read the vast majority of it and I think it gave him a lot more confidence in his ability to soothe me through our first baby's birth. I would recommend also taking a Bradley Method class in your area because of the couples I know who just read the book and the ones that read the book and took the class, the results are staggering. The couples who did both were much more likely to not need intervention. So...if you want to make it through childbirth without medication and other interventions, read this and take a class locally.

Along with the first comes the fears. This book has helped increase my knowledge, which in turn decreases the fears. To me, it is very informative. However, many times the author mentions exercises or activities that happen during the Bradley classes.

I would say that only 10-20% of this book was useful. It is hopelessly outdated, despite being a \\"revised edition\\"; Bradley spends the majority of the time railing/advocating against \\"standard\\" birth practices (heavy use of anaesthesia, no dads in the delivery room, etc.) that may have been the norm when he first began developing his method, but are no longer. In short, he's preaching to the choir. I read the whole thing and promised I would pick out the salient parts for my husband...those parts would comprise maybe 10 pages. So, my advice is: skip this and get McCutcheon's book instead, which is more up to date and more practical."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pregnancy Must Read","review":"I am the mother of seven children.

But even with my homebirths I was searching for something that had been missing in my past births.On recommendations from readers at this site, I bought McCutcheon's book instead of Bradleys. Later, a friend lent me her copy of Bradley's book. I enjoyed Bradley's book so much more!

If you don't like it go ahead and do it yourself. All I've heard about this record is Somebody to Love. First thing I thought was, What is the date of this? 2001..No wonder why Geoff performance is so lame here as he was struggling with a smoking habit.

In fact no one really gets anywhere near to nailing their track.

And speaking of laughable, why am I listening to the Nelson Bros.sing \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love?\\"\\"Fight from the Inside\\" is the only song that really kicks it right. A very good version here w/ Tonys Levin and Thompson as a rythym section. Jason Scheff singing \\"Your'e My Best Friend\\" is awesome too. It's like he wrote tthe song.

Here we have distinguished performances from all involved, especially Jeno Jando, who has completed traversals of the Haydn and Beethoven sonata cycles for Naxos, as well as recorded the lion's share of other projects (such as Liszt's complete piano music) for the label. His work at the keyboard is beyond reproach: assured, dynamic, emotive. The strings give a good account of themselves as well, and all are captured in a fine, slightly recessed but very truthful recording. Not a stellar performance, perhaps, but one that is highly competitive, especially at Naxos' price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bargain","review":"In theory there probably really is nothing much wrong about this performance, but then again, there isn't that much that is exceptional either. What IS noteworthy is the lousy engineering (Naxos has done MUCH better). The woodwinds are in your lap, the percussion, especially the timpani, are hiding behind a thick velvet curtain, and the strings are muffled under water. Janacek's music is there, but you can hardly hear it. Lenard doesn't pay that much attention to details, and tends to homogenize the spiky textures of Janacek's orchestration; he also phrases so that the motifs are choppy and not well-connected. However, the clarinetist is worth hearing in V for his/her big melody line, although the piccolo s/he is paired with is well below par. Your bargain CD dollars are spent better elsewhere. Even well-engineered mono recordings would outclass this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistakes","review":"There are some mistakes in Sinfonietta.

Consequently almost all black singers were comfortably snuggled into either one of those niches. Nancy Wilson was a singer, period. She had her share of popular hits such as \\"Now I'm A Woman\\" and \\"Guess Who\\" but she pretty much stayed true to her own muse more of a jazz singer. If you are familiar with Nancy, listening to \\"The Very Best of Nancy Wilson:The Capital Recordings 1960-1976\\" is like seeing an old friend for the first time in twenty years. You smile and laugh and hug and want to know what ever happened to this song or that song. If you are new to Nancy and only heard \\"old heads\\" talking about her, lay back, relax and absorb. Nancy Wilson is listening and feeling music. In popular parlance it's \\"grown folks music\\". This is a grown woman singing about feelings and experiences through a grown woman's prism.The only thing missing from this cd is a loaf of bread and a jug of wine."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is one of a kind--Perfect","review":"I've been listening to Ms. Nancy Wilson since I was 12-years old.

I love all of her music the old and the new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Nancy Still Reigns","review":"I have loved Nancy Wilson since I was a teen and I was overjoyed to finally find one of my favorite songs \\"In A Long White Room\\" on CD.

Five days later still hurts. I should have known with all my yoga experience that spinal rolls so early in a practice is a really bad idea.\\"15 minutes results\\" might sound like a miracle because it is.

The training is excellent, as always. I think I just prefer for him to work solo. Others may find the exercise less threatening and more user-friendly when he has a yoga partner.It also may be that I was bored with this one because I've advanced further and need to stop buying yoga for beginners! I just have a habit of buying anything Rodney Yee puts together.

There is too much time spent jumping up and down and that is way too high impact for me due to foot surgery. I have been to many yoga classes at the gym and I have never jumped up and down and I'm OK with that. The other yoga poses are way too quick for me. I understand they wanted to get as much yoga in 15 minutes, but it didn't seem like a good 15 minute practice. The chatter between Rodney Yee and Mariel Hemingway was extremely distracting for me. I could never do this practice more than once since the talk was so annoying. Some people may not be bothered by that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for when you have greedy top-dwellers and shy bottom-dwellers.","review":"I really like this brand of food, and these sinking pellets solved my main tank problem.I have an aquarium that houses two oscars and a catfish. They all get along wonderfully and have for years now, but a big problem I ran into is that the oscars tend to devour all food within sight before the poor catfish even gets a chance and most foods float, at least initially.I put in the floating pellets first and then strategically drop these out of sight of the oscars, which allows them to reach the bottom without being intercepted. The oscars do not realize they are down there, and they catfish is able to eat without any issues.

However, while it shows superb writing skill and a wonderful use of words, I found the stories a little too cynical and depressing for my liking. I did laugh out loud now & then... but not enough, and that's what I'd bought the book for.If you're looking for fine Irish literature, this is probably a good choice. If you also want a lot of laugh-out-loud humor, you might want to look at other titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genealogist's Guide to Discovering Your Female Ancestors","review":"I have this book, find it very helpful and amazingly easy to put into action.

The whole show takes place within a short period yet four people fall in love, a little boy wins the hearts of two people, and a liver transplant gets diagnosed, an operation takes place and a recovery all just a few weeks before Christmas. It is not realistic at all. The writers didn't even show time passing to make it more believable. Also the man goes home because he decides he doesn't want to be a doctor anymore. Well it seemed like he lived a long ways away (at least in another town). Yet when someone is sick he takes them to his hospital where he worked even though it is a life and death situation. Also the little boy goes to the hospital to see his teacher and how does he get there?

He is enigmatic and people often misunderstand his paintings. Vanished Splendors is Balthus' memoirs that he was working on at the time of his death. In it he puts forth his philosophy on many subjects such as art, modern art, life, religion, family, love and history. He's known or met most of the important artisians of the last century. Picasso, Camus, Artaud, Monet and more. This is a quick read and gives insight into his world and how he painted (he often took years to finish one canvas).

In this book, Sandy Breckenridge and Kirk VandenBerghe are a brilliant team, supporting and providing an arena for the ancient heart vibration, which calls itself Alana to come through and teachtrue knowledge. In The Seven Sacred Steps, Alana speaks on the very thing every human being hopes to find once they realize they have been looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gold Coast Cure REALLY Works!","review":"Four of my friends and I ordered The Gold Coast Cure on the recommendation of a fifth friend. We couldn't put it down. We call ourselves the Gold Coast Girls! The book explains everything so simply and I have never found an eating/exercise plan so easy to follow. What I noticed first was that the water weight I carry in my hand and feet disappeared. I feel lighter and so much healthier. I retooled my pantry and my entire family jumped on board with me. The changes in our diet were really easy to make because they did not seem drastic. The kids love the soy nuggets. I can't believe such simple changes in my diet made such a difference in how I feel every day. I have so much more energy. It feels good to feel good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smartest diet book for long lasting results","review":"I think that the Gold Coast Cure is by far the sanest, easiest, most delicious approach to dieting and good health out there. You dont have to count calories, points, carbs, or weigh your food. You just follow the authors formula for nutrient -rich foods, exercise and remember to take the right vitamins. If it can reverse the symptoms of MS, imagine what it can do for a reasonably healthy body. And, I love the idea of only working out only 3 times a week for 30 minutes each workout! I also feel secure in knowing that a doctor co-wrote this book. The science is there yet the approach is really simple. Just take a look at the picture of the authors and youll get inspired!! Its great to lose weight and get healthy without the gimmicks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gold Coast Cure","review":"After reading the book it was refreshing to see a balanced and straightforward approach to a healthy lifestyle. The plan is easy to follow and so far has been effective in lowering my blood pressure and reducing my weight without me feeling deprived like so many other diets had left me feeling in the past. In my opinion this plan is for everyone not just those with debilitating diseases. The fact wholesome nutrition is the emphasis and eliminating commercially processed foods loaded with empty calories would benefit all concerned. Considering our country is facing a major health crisis due to our poor eating habits this book is just what the doctor ordered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goes with Kitchen Staple","review":"This is a great book full of information and help.

The only thing I DID NOT agree with and that I feel they DID NOT research was the substitution for sugar-using SPLENDA-..SPLENDA IS NOT healthy, it is in the same category as Nutrasweet, Equal, Sweet & Low Etc..It is a Chemical and therefore our bodies CANNOT utilize these, alot of people have had life threatening illness from these..They say Splenda is different, made from sugar, which is true BUT after the processing (bleaching etc.) it ends up a chemical just like the other sugar substitutes which is NOT healthy so changing your eating habits without eliminating this from your diet is NOT helping your health...Thanks for listening...Lee Wicks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good way in.","review":"Excellent introduction to French poets, but would have been improved by inclusion of translations for poems cited, for convenience of those who don't know French."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor: Made in China, Not Italy","review":"The product description for these slippers states \\"Made in Italy\\".

I used it about 10 times, and then it stopped recognizing disks and wouldn't work at all. It was still within the 1 year warranty, so I called the company to get directions on how to send it in for repairs. I was informed that I'd still have to pay $80-90 labor, because the product is only warranted for labor for 3 months. When you include postage to send the product in, the cost to get JVC to repair it would be about $100, or more than half the cost of the product new. Online reviews I've read since I bought this indicate that this malfunction happens a lot. I thought readers would like to know that the warranty is basically useless, unless you want to gamble $100 on a less than $200 product that will probably break again when you get it home. I will ask more questions and do more research when I go to get another DVD burner, and it won't be a JVC product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Waste Waste","review":"I was hoping for something between Backyard Brawls & GGW.

Even then, my depth of knowledge of the subject was superficial, just vaguely being able to recall \\"Franz Ferdinand\\" and \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\".I picked this up from my dad's shelf, and within the first 2 chapters had a deeper, more intense understanding of World War I than I ever had before. This isn't just a chronicle of the last day of the war - this is a wonderful document of the buildup, reasons, and truly sad side effects of the Great one. It is also written in a very understandable and involving way (my fear was that I would be inundated with anonomous faces and names, blurring together with an overload of information - that was far from the case).I can't recommend this highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Anthology of Great War Accounts","review":"It is difficult, perhaps impossible, at this distance in time to add anything original to the Anglo-American literature on the Great War. The protagonists are dead, so primary source research is not really an option. Under the circumstances, Persico does the best he can with secondary source material. But the result, for readers even somewhat familiar with the literature, is an unoriginal book that adds little, if anything, to what one knows about that conflict. The book ends up being a kind of anthology of other people's writings on the War. The only way out of this conundrum is to write from a truly neutral perspective, or even from the perspective of the Germans. As long as the perspective remains Anglo-American, where the Germans are the bad chaps, I don't see how anything new can be said about this subject. That.... or, we have to hope that someone discovers long-lost documents of state in a proverbial attic that shows the protagonists in a whole new light!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still wondering what happen on the last day","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book. It has a catchy title. It may me wonder what happened on the last day. I saw part of a show that I think was made by the BBC on the stories of the last men to die in WWI. I thought this book would be along those lines. Of course my assumption was wrong. After reading this book, I am still wondering what happened on the last day. I hate to do this but I can't recommend this book. It has a few values. You will learn the story of a few men but it seems to read more like a socialist rewritten version of WWI. There are some socialist writers waiting for the last WWII soldiers to die, so they can rewrite the history for WWII. They are waiting so there wont be anyone left alive that was there. No one left alive that can repudiate their socialism revision. This book has that feel.

This is true with aural force on \\"No Time for Silence,\\" sort of an experimental journey into the realm of space music (though by no means can you limit the definition of Secret Voices to space music - it's merely that there is much in common with trad space music ... atmospherics arise and consume!).

I can't say I love it as much as some of my friends do (maybe it's because I'm a woman, and sometimes the misogyny gets to be too much) but this is definitely a smart and well-written show.

Season 4 even underlines, italicizes & bold fonts the \\"unlikable\\" premise. Of course this makes the series even more addictive; like watching a train wreck. The continuity in presenting the 60's chronology is so dead on that it looks like it followed the day to day work life of my friends & me. I see this show and question why I didn't just punch my boss in the nose - he certainly deserved it.

The less relation to the truth, the better. Peggy's successful campaign for Playtex gloves, promising love, romance and intimate moments, is the perfect example in this episode. But Peggy is a small stakes deceiver. Roger Sterling descends to his lowest level ever in this episode. Loathsome is the best adjective for summing up his character. And except for the recently deceased woman in California, Don Draper has yet to meet a woman he can't two time. But he's not loathsome. He's a much more complex character than Sterling. The actor to watch this time out though is John Slattery as Roger Sterling. It is rare to see an actor willing to play such a bottom feeding character without a single flinch.

I've also often streamed videos from hulu and netflix and never once had a problem with them, so I have to conclude the issue lies with amazon. Finally, when I tried to report the issue, I just got a form email back saying my internet must be slower than their required 1.5 Mbps (again note that my connection is nearly 10 times this fast according to multiple speed tests).I'm tempted to conclude that I've wasted twenty bucks and should just go back to buying shows from iTunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning","review":"If you live in European Region you cannot watch this DVD.

I researched to make sure the packaging pictured on Amazon was the actual packaging for the dvd set- it was, so I placed my order. It just arrived yesterday, but instead of the shadow picture of Don Draper falling, the cover has a picture of Don Draper standing by a window looking out.

The fourth season ends with hints of things to come for several characters especially Don and Joan.Since I like the show no matter what, I sometimes focus on the more subtle trappings included on the dvd. Like how they change the little intro setups from disc to disc each season. Disc one starts off with the main characters just in black and white then adds hints of color as the discs progress bringing the 4th disc into full color. Also I like the change of music on each disc. I'm not too crazy about the commentaries though, for some reason it's like listening to a lecture.All in all I think it's a great dvd, interesting season with changes for a lot of characters.

Some parts of this series are magnificent.But this episode should never have been written and never have aired. Most of it seems to comprise characters getting drunk and behaving irrationally and out of character. Getting drunk may well be enjoyable, but it's extremely boring to watch drunk people talk like idiots for 40 minutes. Furthermore, they aren't actually talking about anything - it's one of the \\"relationship\\" episodes where characters moon (drunkenly) about their latest relationships.Matt, there are literally hundreds of TV series we can watch if we want to see people whine about their relationships.

While there really were gangs in that era, most of New York's immigrants were busy building hospitals and schools like St. Vincent's, Fordham, St. John's, Manhattan and Manhattanville. The vast majority of the city's population including its immigrants didn't riot in 1863. In fact New York City's 200,000 soldiers and sailors, more than half of whom were immigrants, won over 100+ Medals of Honor during America's Civil War.It's a tribute to the persistence of prejudice that this book isn't more widely recognized as the nasty practical joke that it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern blueblood from Texas","review":"This absolutely is one of the worst books I've ever read.

I'm a professor with a Ph.D. in English; I read a lot of different types of books, but l don't think I've ever subjected myself to anything this horrid.

It's mostly unclear in which time some events take place, while indications of place are mostly too detailed. It may have been difficult to come up with enough material for all the illustrous characters, but if there are gaps, why not just say so? Asbury makes clear at the beginning that this is not an academic treatise, but that does not give him the right to become unclear.The best parts are the minute descriptions of the Police and the Draft riots, and I found the beginning quite gripping, but the book soon lacks its initial zeal and focus, and the biographical descriptions did not live up to their subjects. There is a surprising lack of enthusiasm on Asbury's part. You don't have to love your subject - you may even hate it -, but your interest should, to a degree, affect the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to see this classic re-released","review":"Here is Asbury's book, back in circulation, and all is right with the world. Written during the roaring 20s, when New Yorkers wanted to live the good life, Asbury's book came along to show the dirt under the carpets: the crime and savagery that made up so much of New York's history. With neighborhoods like Hell's Kitchen, the Tenderloin and the Five Points populated with such criminals as Monk Eastman and Humpty Jackson, the reader is introduced to a New York City that contemporaries cast a blind eye on, and our generation will never see. True, some of Asbury's sources are undoubtedly questionable. But this is an \\"Informal\\" history, remember.

The first half deals exclusively with Irish gangs, and while it's flashy and exotic, there isn't much substance in the original book. It's good, but it doesn't explain the fighting traditions and rituals of the Irish gangs, it simply describes them in a sensational way. Hurley's book remedies this problem by providing first hand accounts of Irish gangs and fights, written by a 'reformed' Irish stick-fighter. It vividly describes Ireland's fighting culture which was goverened by a code of honour which Hurley rightly calls 'Shillelagh Law'. If you are Irish or have an interest in Irish gangs or Scorcese's film, I'd say get 'The Gangs Of New York', but to understand the hype behind the myth, get Hurley's 'Irish Gangs And Stick-Fighting' - you will really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about the movie","review":"I don't think this book would have a chance at notoriety if not for the movie.

I was sadly disappointed to find the book to be part history, part lore, and a good part boring!Throwing light poles half way across Manhattan? Swimming around Manhattan 5 times (or whatever the crazy story was)? Please, give me a break, not at all what I expected. A down and dirty, true account of what life was really like back then would have been far more interesting if it had not been interlaced with ...tall tales..."},{"rating":"2","title":"NYC is a picnic now","review":"Gives a welcome perspective on NYCs problems. Things were a lot worse 100-150 years ago when the politicians and police were really for sale. I love reading about the things that went down in the streets that I walk through every day. The book was written in the late 1920's and the attitude of the author is not very analytical; sometimes he seems to be repeating gang folklore. But that in itself is interesting - how people thought about these guys in their own time. He does seem a little breathless in his descriptions - makes me wonder if the general population of NYC felt as threatened as the author claims. But I read it with interest and am about to embark on another book about the five points that seems more historical and less hype.I can't imagine how Scorsese is going to make this into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is it with sequels","review":"This is a fun book, but like many sequels, this one took the original story a bit too far.If I could, I would rate this one 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable and Fast Read...","review":"Having read and enjoyed two novels by Paul Maier, I looked forward to reading \\"More than a Skeleton.\\" The book certainly didn't disappoint. The novel is a quick read as it isn't as technical as the book that preceeded it. Once again, some pretty well written satire comes into play (especially when a fictional televangelist \\"prophet\\" sues the main character). I agree with another reviewer that the scenario presented in this book is even more far fetched than that in \\"A Skeleton in God's Closet.\\" However, this dosen't detract from the novel's enjoyability. Maier is able to keep the reader wandering whether Ben-Yosef is really the returned Christ or a diabolical imposter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near \\"A Skeleton in God's Closet\\"","review":"I loved the book A Skeleton in God's Closet, the novel to which this is a sequel of sorts. I read the last 200 pages in one sitting; it was that gripping. When I heard there was a sequel, I got excited. Big mistake. This novel is subpar, and contains some of the most awkward, clunky prose I've ever read. Honestly, I couldn't get through it. I gave up. Most of the complaints I have are similar to the ones listed in other reviews, but I will reiterate: none of the characters seemed like real people, especially when they opened their mouths. Maier aims for hip, semi-humorous dialogue, but it falls flat with too many \\"darlings\\" and \\"no problemas\\". Maybe, just maybe, some of the dialogue would have worked on screen, but in a novel moments where the characters joke with each other by taking on accents they don't normally have don't work. Everyone got to be so annoying that I just gave up. There are tons better books for you to read. Don't waste your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing","review":"Not worthy of its predecesor, \\"A Skeleton in God's Closet.\\" Implausible plot, inane dialog, too many obvious flaws in the storyline, virtually no credible support for the highly improbable scenario not to mention its unraveling, etc. Explanations given regarding how the hoax was pulled off made little sense. Disappointing effort by this highly capable author. I had viewed this book with skepticism just based on the story description but wanted to read the entire series in sequence. Not worth it. Hope the follow-up, \\"Constantine's Codex\\" returns to the credible and magnetic virtues of the original \\"Skeleton\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a Skeleton","review":"Very interesting read.

I just purchased a new copy for my baby girl to grow into - might be a couple years, but this is a book I want around the house for her. I imagine it is probably best for ages 4 and up. As a kid I loved this book for its illustrations, circular poems, paradoxs, word-play and sensitive wit. I would pour though it over and again, catching a different nuance with each read. As an adult I can only admire the contributions I believe this book made to helping me think in an unrestrained, \\"out-of-the-box\\" and creatively analytical fashion.

I have never forgotten this book and have given it to many of my good friends with children. It has delightful illustrations and rhymes that not only inspire wonder and imagination, but also seem to play with you as if the book itself is somehow alive and pulling your leg.Remy Charlip has a masterful way of holding a child's interest, not to mention an adult's, with his play on words, memorable rhymes and storytelling, as well as his playful use of color and unique illustration style.

It is tedious. How many times can you read about a much younger virginal girl in love with a much older man with tons of sexual experience and after problems (i.e. sex, another evil women and her insecurities) live happily ever after? It seems that this men cannot handle a grown women so they become invlved with girls barely out of their teens.

This old three masted vessel was captured by the Germans and converted to a shipping lane raider. The captain, von Luckner is of the old breed, honorable, intelligent, devoted to duty and most cunning. His crew is a collection of skilled sailors (of the old sailing school), tough German Marines (used for boarding enemy ships) and able seamen with one goal - capture and sink as many enemy ships as possible before the Royal Navy finds them. The research is top notch, the characters are truly amazing and the actions of the Sea Eagle are most incredible. Von Luckner's handling of the scores of captured enemy crews is terrific as is his style of 'bluffing' the enemy to submit to his will. Great old sea faring story set during World War One with plently of action, great adventure in distant places and a subject not usually associated with the Great War. Highly recommended.

Thirty-five years have passed since the heyday of the genre and Gilberto's voice is just as it ever was. I had to laugh when I read one review that said it sounded cool in Portuguese but lyrically banal when translated into English. Well, this is Brazilian pop, and most pop music in any language tends not to be deep. But compare this pop with its contemporary American counterpart and I'll take the Brazilian every time. Joao is smooth, relaxed, and soothing here and thus is the perfect thing to listen to while sitting on your patio with your morning coffee watching the sun come up. My favorite cuts are Voce Vai Ver, Chega de Saudade, and the all-time classic Desafinado. If you are a Bossa Nova fan, this album deserves a place in your collection. The CD may be short, but it sure is sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"exquisite","review":"You'd have to be dead not to love this exquisite album.

Now that I've listened to it a few times running, all I can say is \\"GIVE ME THE PROZAC!\\" I'm sorry, but the recording sounds so exhausted and lethargic that my mood immediately descended about 40 fathoms. It has its moments, but for the most part it is so tired and dull that I kept checking my CD player to see if there was something wrong with the tempo. My heart will always hold a warm place for Joao Gilberto, but this music sounds like a lone, private practice session on Gilberto's rear veranda, recorded after a long and tiresome day that he would rather forget. Those who want to learn more about the worthy place held in music history by this wonderful musician should look elsewhere first; otherwise, I fear, they will be turned off to Gilberto and bossa nova altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"intimate","review":"its as if he's singing especially for you but, almost whispering in your ear. a warm, embracing, light and romantic work. beautiful piece of brasilian music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Espresso","review":"We really like this brand of Espresso.

I can't bring myself to care about the characters because I never know who is next on the chopping block. Plus, it's pretty obvious to me where the story is going with Ty and Jessie's daughter and Ty's ex-wife Tara. Tara's going to steal her affection from her mother. Also, I always loved Kat but in this story Janet Dailey all but made her Tara's partner in crime. I almost hated her! The only highlight was Laredo and Jessie's relationship but even that was hard to get into because of Ty and Jessie.

This book surprized me and even though I had figured out before the end who the killer was...I couldn't put the book down.I agree with the others who have wrote reviews...Janet locks you into the fantasy of wanting to be a part of the Calder family or at least we can all dream of a living on a ranch in Big Sky Country!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment","review":"This book keeps you interested from page one to the end.

Freedman. My disappointment in \\"Against the Wind\\" was profound. Although the plot itself was interesting, the descriptive sexual exploits in the book made it almost repulsive and, in my opinion, verging on pornography. The lawyer's constant flopping into bed with other women took away any admiration I might have had for him as a hero.This author could be one of the greater mystery writers of our time if he would leave out the sleazy and \\"more explicit than is needed\\" sex talk. He does not need to cheapen his novel in this way as he has enough writing talent as it is to write a best-selling novel. It almost angered me to see him degrading himself in this way.

But in the book, the Little Critter character doesn't do anything constructive to deal with his anger, he just festers in resentment and anger, and proceeds to do more destructive and inappropriate things, and finally decides to resort to expressing his anger in a very inappropriate way, by running away. I don't think he makes for a good role model. It immediately gave my granddaughter the idea that running away was a potential way to deal with anger, and that then just added to her anger problems that we had to deal with. I'd pick a different book, if you're trying to find a book to help children deal with anger.

I particularly like the fact that, as he moves from one interesting experience to the next more interesting experience after running away from home, the child must remind himself to stay mad. I am sure that most children can put themselves right into this story. In that light, I do have a concern about the message of running away. This is a fairly young child, and the story makes it appear that it is okay to run away from home, and that after a long day of several adventures talking to both aquaintances and strangers, and going downtown on the bus without asking permission from a parent, our \\"hero\\" returns home safe and sound. This is not a safe presumption, and children hearing this story may think it is okay to run away.

It's astounding they make students by this book when publishers obviously spent little time prepping the book for publication.I found my prof's tests on this book were very hard because this book dabbles in SO many mundane details without building on any of them sufficiently.

Main concepts and themes are unclear and are not emphasized.Many large sections are the book are statistics, one after another. The statistics occasionally directly contradict each other and even the accompanying narrative. Although only a small percentage of the statistics are flawed, any noticeable amount of inaccuracy in a published work by a PhD is dangerous.And don't even get me started on typos.As a student, I feel lost as to which points the author feels are central and which are just meant as background information.

Yeah it's low budget and some of the effects are laughable. But so what? This movie delivers on everything it promises to be. A gratuitous serving of action, violence, gore, some laughs, and nudity for good measure.

I fell in love with Cheryl Strayed after reading Wild and Dear Sugar, so I was looking forward to consuming everything I could get my hands on. It's clear, though, that Torch isn't what made her for a reason. There is nothing wrong with the book, it just isn't very compelling. After reading the other books and being familiar with Strayed's story, I can't help but think of this as more of a therapeutic writing project for her to explore her feelings about her mother's death than a story that we are all to share. Maybe if I had never read the other books, maybe if I didn't know it was the same author, maybe then I would like it. But for now, I'm admitting defeat and putting this one down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing new voice in contemporary fiction","review":"Cheryl Strayed's premiere novel is a gem. The characters are incredibly complex and startlingly human--you cannot completely love or hate a single one of them. No matter how terrible or beautiful their thoughts and actions, they are narrated by a voice of unabashed honesty that explains without apologizing, suggests without digression. The book explores some of the darkest emotions we all feel at some point in our lives, in a way that will make you blush, laugh out loud and cry, all within the same page. I loved the way the novel picked up on such slight details that told such monumental stories about who we are and how we are bound together, such as a cassette tape daughter Claire swiped from her fleeting lover's home that ends up playing a pivotal role in her stepfather's grieving process. Torch provides hope without being saccharine, remaining entirely real through the end. Definitely a must-read this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story as Wild","review":"This is a well written and compelling book.

Although Rudess seems to be an expert at getting what he wants to achieve sonically from his electronic instruments, the album will only entertain those whose musical tastes are amazed by childish displays of virtuosity and showmanship. With the album's closest attempt at seriousness looming in a solo piano piece entitled \\"Interstices\\" which, like most of Jordan's stylings, is awash with crude embellishment and improvisation, \\"Feed the Wheel\\" will otherwise manage to flounder at the far bottom of record store discount bins."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's Mister Jordan Rudess to You!","review":"If you enjoy technical keyboard wizardry or think you might be interrested in what the heck that is then this is the CD for you. Jordan Rudess pulls out all the stops on this energetic progressive rock flavored album with the help of some top musicians. Terry Bozio adds his glorious drumming which really steps this up a notch IMHO. There is lots of fast playing, quick time changes and amazing keyboard work. Jordan even throws in a little \\"game show\\" patch will surely get a grin out of the listeners. If you buy this and like it, then I highly recommend another Jordan Rudess CD, Rythm of Time with Rod Morgenstern on the drums.

The talented guest musicians include Terry Bozzio on drums, Steve Morse and John Petrucci on guitar, and Billy Sheehan plays bass on \\"Crack The Meter\\". The bass on the remainder of the disc is played via the keyboards and you hardly notice the absence of a dedicated bass player.

Anthony Bourdain's video at [...] demonstrates a better representation of the art that I know then the type of Kendo that this person professes to understand.

Grossman is a skillful writer and propagandist and the work is very artfully done. Nonetheless the work is a one- sided piece in which he makes the Palestinians far more moderate and humane in relation to the Israelis than their own media or their own terrorist actions have ever evidenced.One particular moment of the sentimentalization particularly offended me, when Grossman sees in the face of an old Palestinian the face of a grandparent of his from the Shoah. Perhaps he should have seen in the face of the descendants of survivors of the Shoah murdered by the Palestinians( Of which there are not a few in Israel) the face of his own grandparent.That might too have been sentimental but at least it would have reflected a true historical reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"California pure as driven Joad","review":"John Stewart was an accomplished writer, folk singer when asked to take over the lead vocals/writer for established and proven hitmakers, Kingston Trio.

Bell readily admits borrowing from his own family's history to detail everyday family activities and the grind of what it meant to be working in the steel mills of Western Pennsylvania. These are the same stories I have heard from my friends as they have been passed from generation to generation. The book is engaging, gritty, heart-breaking, honest and filled with history. Anyone who has had family members work in the steel mills could read this book and likely see their own family's life unfold.

Lots of pictures and diagrams, printed on glossy paper, easy to understand and follow, this book is a good primer for those who are looking to improve their air combat skills in flight simulators. It follows the history of air combat from WW1 to today's modern jets, and for each conflict it highlights the tactics used by pilots as they match their plane against the enemy. Norman Franks selects particular dogfights in each war to serve as examples of how fighter pilots put their aircraft's strengths to good use when battling in the skies. Speed, maneuverability, guns, durability ... all of these are taken into account.This book knows its audience - mainstream America - and seeks to entertain and educate at the same time. Its a good book to keep around and appeals to fans of aviation of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The search continues....","review":"This was a great idea. But the sound quality sucks.

The band personnel, recording dates, and titles of all the tunes are identical to Vol. 7. The Front Cover of this CD completely lacks the visual excitement of the cover on the REAL vol.2. The music itself is very enjoyable, with an unusually strong presence of Paul Gonsalves. Clark Terry and Johnny Hodges shine, as usual, and the selection of tunes shows a nice bit of variety. The sound quality on the original is slightly better than the Kaz copy.The original vol. 2, by WEA International, is available on the Amazon website."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid built!","review":"Got every hard to reach bolts out as I needed done without a problem.

Every page is an independent unit, with review, explanation of new material, and new problems to solve. The explanations are concise and always understandable. This book could be used as a reference if you've forgotten how to do certain kinds of problems (for schoolkids).My only criticism is that is does not have an answer key, although the back cover claims that it does. I guess they mean you can buy a SEPARATE answer key? So to check the work you have to work through each problem yourself.Also it's only black and white and has no pictures, but I'm sure that helps keep the costs (& size) down.I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource!","review":"I am a middle school teacher in an inner city.

Seven of the 10 broke in the same location (the wheel fork)where it is welded together. The manufactuer was very unwilling to help us replace the parts. Obviously the location of the break has been caused by faulty manufacturing. I do not recommend this trike and question the company's commitment to quality, safety assurance and customer satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely magnificent. A bit heavy on the Semitic though","review":"This book is probably the most comprehensive work on the languages of the ancient world, including even the only recently-deciphered Epi-Olmec script of Mesoamerica.However, there is no good definition provided of what is 'ancient' and what is not: should Old Japanese and Old Korean have been included? What about Old Nubian?Surely more could've been written about some of the as-yet undeciphered ancient languages, such as Rongorongo, Meroitic, Linear A, Zapotec, and the Indus script?It's also a bit heavy on Semitic languages: while some languages are grouped with other languages into a single chapter for all of them, each of the ancient Semitic languages has a separate chapter.Some of the ancient languages of Asia, Africa, and the Americas are omitted completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource for Preschool Sunday School","review":"I ordered this book to help me come up with simple crafts to do with preschoolers during short Sunday School sessions. There's a great variety, and tie-ins with Bible stories from both the Old and New Testament. I especially like that there are two or three craft options for each lesson, so I can pick the one that will work the best with our small group. The crafts are all fairly simple and require minimal, easy-to-find supplies. This is a great book at a fabulous price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource","review":"This is a good resource for children's church or sunday school crafts.

It had 4.5 stars, but I was leary when I couldn't search inside. I thought that the crafts were lacking. Some seemed a little hard for preschoolers. I have found better results just searching the internet and getting free ideas. Overall, I thought the book wasn't that great and shipped it back the day I received it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"There are lots of crafts in the book, but very few that I thought were very engaging. If you're looking for something that will be finished in 15 minutes this may work for you. The most disappointing thing was that out of 200 crafts, there were only one or two that provided patterns. I'm planning to return it for a refund. I liked Preschool Christian Crafts a whole lot better. There were only 37 crafts in it, but patterns were provided and they were fun, yet simple enough and engaging enough to satisfy preschoolers."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"I love that this book is entirely for preschoolers. Often, when looking for crafts to go with a Bible lesson for my preschool class at church, I find nothing but really difficult, involved crafts. These are fun, easy, and relatively quick. Very age appropriate! I also love that each one includes scripture references and enough material to use as a lesson all by itself if so desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Great!","review":"Simply put, this cabinet looks great and does the job.

I haven't done that because I no longer have the original driver disc and Panasonic wants me to pay for a replacement (no free download).

I tried the laser hair removal, and it wasn't permanent, so now I'm back to finding a solution. I thought I'd try this because it was inexpensive, and I couldn't find the old one. It takes FOREVER to do my legs, and I have to go over it 3 or 4 times to get one hair. Maybe because my hair is so fine now from all the previous removal efforts? In any case, I'm now in the market for a different epilator and am looking at the \\"Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator Body System, Rechargeable\\" which seems to get really good reviews.I gave this product two stars instead of one because it does work well under the arms. It's a small enough area that I can tolerate going over it 3-4 times and all the hair is gone. Definitely better than shaving or waxing (no more akward elbow-on-the-door-frame waxing tug of war with the underarms!) But if you're looking for one epilator to do it all, keep looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Epilady Pocket Corded Epilator","review":"I was very disappointed in this product.I would discourage anyone who is considering buying it to just forget it.My sister bought me the OLD epilady on ebay and as always it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"This robe will work for a small child.

I would not recommend this toybox to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a happy camper.","review":"When I bought this toybox, I was warned that it was a little difficult to put together and the quality wasnt great. The person warning me was correct. It took me hours to get it together because some of the holes didnt line up correctly to put the screws in, and it doesnt stay together so it isnt safe for children unless it is glued secure. I wouldnt have gotten a toybox that had to be glued together the 1st time it was moved from one part of the room to the other. On a positive note, once the glue dried, it does look very nice in the childs room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the expensive models","review":"We went to several local toy retailers and checked out features of the expensive models first and almost bought one for our grandson until we found out how much it would cost to ship out of state. In order to cover the shipping costs we decided to buy a lesser expensive toy box. The sales person suggested this toy box. We looked at it in the store & actually liked it better than the $150 one we had intended to purchase. Being able to ship it directly to our daughter via Amazon made the transaction a \\"no brainer\\".The safety close mechanism is a MUST to protect those little fingers. The unit went together like a dream and the little guy climbs all over it and it doesn't sway or wiggle when he does. All I can say is it's nice to see a product that delivers on every promise & this one does. If I ever need another toy box you can bet I'd buy this one all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically, its junky","review":"My son, and my niece both had this toy box...It is a pretty toy box and it held a lot of toys. We both had the same problem though, the lid broke off the hinges. My sons got thrown away, and my sister just ripped off the hinges and lid and uses it for dress up clothes. Its sad that they didnt last long. They were just junky. I am looking for a new toybox, and will probably get a big plastic one.

You can look up things like \\"Lying\\", \\"Hitting\\", \\"Disrepectful\\", \\"Inappropriate Humor\\", \\"Not Sharing\\", you name it, and it's there! Under each topic, she lists a section to \\"think about\\" the motives of the child, and then she gives you at least 5 or 6 different things you might do to correct the problem behavior. I could not believe how many different things were listed in this book. The reference in the front was great too. VERY EASY to use, this is not a \\"chapter book\\". It's more of a reference book, but I can hardly put it down! I already read Elizabeth's other book Kid Cooperation, and I highly recommend it as well . . .

Just about any problem, scenario or action that you can ever go through with a child is addressed in this book. The best part? Finding that there is always more than one way to deal with anything and realizing that there may be more than one right way to handle yourself.I have recommended this book to my readers many many times and will many times more."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book","review":"Don't think twice... just buy it! The tips are awesome and they work. You'll see immediate results. One of the strengths of this book is that for each situation, the authors step back and put the reader in the childs shoes and then offers a number of solutions. I now have an arsenal of ways of handling the kids in a loving, yet firm fashion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Single Parents","review":"A wealth of information covering the broad spectrum of parenting issues. It is especially helpful for single parents. Single parents have precious little time. The book is organized in an easy to use format enabling a parent to find answers to their questions quickly and effortlessly.

This book is a must have for a single parent's parenting library."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I had actually received it...","review":"...it would have been AWESOME.

The price was great and he was quite pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Voices","review":"Terkel's genius is in letting others speak. This book is an amalgam of his other books, all \\"written\\" by average Americans who have had ordinary, yet unique, American experiences. It blends the best of his other works, including stories of the American workforce from CEO's to auto assembly line workers; oral histories of the Depression from people who remember bread lines and hunger pangs; thoughts on the division between poor and rich from the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have nots\\"; remembrances of WWII from front line soldiers and the loved ones they left behind; and reflections on racism from Black, White, and mixed race people. This book makes for excellent bedtime reading, as it is separated into five to ten page vignettes. At times, it can be infuriating, at others, it can move you to tears. This is an authentic record of being American in the twentieth century, put together by a man who shows great sympathy and affection for his subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real People, Real History","review":"After reading Mr. Terkel's book, I realized our great country is shaped by the average folks next door (unless you live in Beverly Hills!). I was drawn to this book in a desire to read about how average Americans live their lives and make decisions that affect us all. I get tired of hearing about the rich and famous (athletes, entertainers, etc.) who really add little to our lives. How can they relate to parents who do their best to raise children without obscene amounts of money at their disposal? I showed this book to my 80-year mother who loved it! She relayed some WWII stories of her own when she worked in Long Beach at an aircraft manufacturing firm (McDonnell-Douglas). A wonderful book...do your mind a favor and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought-provoking, painless way to study history","review":"I want to recommend a book I've read by Studs Terkel entitled My American Century. It's a collection of edited interviews with a wide-ranging assortment of people, organized by major time periods/topics (for example, the Depression, WWII, the American dream). It is remarkably well done, allowing each person to tell his or her own story. Terkel is adept at letting the individual's voice come through, and the stories are sometimes startlingly interesting. For example, one man talks about his personal journey from leadership in the KKK to reaping kudos for human rights activism. It's a painless way to understand the history of the United States in this century, brought to you by the people who lived it. It's as good a read as any novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"a heartbreakingly beautiful book","review":"This book is not for the squeamish. It's a heartbreakingly beautiful story told from the point of view of a 19-year-old boy who is in a home for kids who are drug addicts and/or have tried to commit suicide. It is the \\"journal\\" he is asked to keep that forms the novel. It is devastating in its honesty. The point of view is extraordinary, both raw and lyric. The narrator has an intensely personal sense of humor and of the absurd. As tragic as the novel is, it is also very, very funny. I think this is one of the best and most intelligent novels I have read in a long time. It is certainly one I will never forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"One of the worst books I've ever read. There was really no plot, just some really messed up and retarded kid writing in a journal, rambling about his horrible life. He does alot of dumb things but never learns from his mistakes. It then ends suddenly, before we learn whether he ever gets out of rehab or makes up with his father. It's a terrible book with no depth or focus to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Maria Callas on DVD!","review":"If you are a fan of Maria Callas, then you undoubtedly own the Hamburg Concerts on VHS format. If you love Maria Callas, then you're probably an audiophile, too! It's about time that Maria Callas' repertoire become available on DVD. The actual DVD is fantastic. A full menu allows the audeince to choose subtitles (in three languages) to the arias. A good stereo or digital stereo gives new life to these familiar concerts. This DVD is a must have for Callas fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGNIFICENT!","review":"This live performance video gives us the opportunity to see and hear Maria Callas in concert. She is magnificent! Every gesture, every phrase, every nuance of her finely honed performance is here for us to enjoy. I only wish that someone had possessed the foresight to videotape one of her legendary opera performances in it's entirety. That would have been something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"La Divina of All Times","review":"If her voice ever conquered you, the image will do more! She is not only a soprano with supreme teceniques, but also a prima dona living in every characters she sings through her dramatic make-blelieve artistry. Without any knowledge of the lyrics, you understand the characters and the whole story behind them through the gestures and the facial expressions she made while singing in vivid emotions. You will never know Callas fully enough without seeing her singing.

Then read this book.Are you a fan of technological development, especially persistent effort on expanding and improving a flawed concept? Then read this book.Are you a fan of light, entertaining history? Then Read This Book.O'Connell's Sacred Vessels reads like beach-towel history, but this is merely the sugar coating that lets the otherwise bitter medicine of piles of historical facts slide down easy. In any other author's hands this book would have been dry, dull, and dense. In O'Connell's hands we get the same in depth analysis of the development of the battleship (even after its proven vulnerability) without that bitter, stodgy historical aftertaste.A Great Read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I didn't even sell my copy","review":"O'Connell is a well respected name in military history. This book is so one sided and flawed that I felt I needed to keep my copy not sell it to a used bookshop, so that others without the access to more balanced histories and references wouldn't purchase it and think that it represents anything resemebling a correct analysis of the history of gun armed capital ships in the USN. Others have already cataloged the plethora of technical errors in this work. I can only agree with them. I am adding my voice here simply in the hope that readers will steer clear of this and seek better written and more honest works."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad history at its worst","review":"A very unimpressive book. The author simply ignores 1) historical examples which don't support his theory; 2) differences between the various competing design philosophies in the class of ships generally referred to as \\"dreadnoughts\\"; 3) increasing accuracy of fire control, and its effect of increasing effective range; 4) rapid pace of technological chnage during the pre-WW1 timeperiod, and its effect on ship design assumptions; etc., etc.In general, this book is better researched than your average undergraduate essay, but the analysis is comparable. It's only saving grace is the sociological examination of the mindset of American naval officers in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and that is tempered by the complete lack of comparison with the greater contemporary society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically flawed","review":"On my initial reading I was fairly impressed by this book. However as I read more detailed, technical accounts of the time period O'Connell covers I began to see large holes in his theory. His biggest failing is treating the battleship's rivals (torpedeos and aircraft) as technological constants. In actuality both required extensive development before they had any chance of rivaling the battleship as potentially decisive weapons. To look at one example, O'Connell condemns the US Navy for failing to pursue the concept of a torpedo armed capital ship. He neglects to mention the fact that the torpedo of the time was short ranged and that the fear of the Navy was that a faster enemy could simply stay out of torpedo range and sink the torpedo battleship with long range gunfire. In addition, the torpedoes would have weakened the hull structure of the ship making it easier to destroy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A persual indicates that at least 15% is from McNeal's book","review":"I read the book with interest and found that a major portion, including its title, it taken from James McNeal's two books, Children as Consumers, and Kids as Customers.Most of the remainder is taken from other sources.

Luckily you can pull off a cheap plastic template piece and still use it with a case, but it won't hold it very securely and it would pop off once in a while when I hit a big bump. This thing worked great for a few weeks, great sound. Then one day I tried to turn it on and it wouldn't power on. I checked all the plugs, but it still wouldn't work.

It fried both our iPods. So now I'm out the cost of my Ipod and so is she.

Paul's bass work is a little muted and reserved here but still comes down as the backbone of the bands epic rock sound. The best song on the disc is the instrumental song that comes right after the song The Egg. That's sad that the best song is an instrumental. Listening to the rest of Shiner's album's and then buying The Egg when it first came out was dissapointing. The Egg just sounded to me like a band running out of musical ideas.

You just know the reason she has no friends is because no one wants to hear about it all the time.I have no sympathy for this woman. All she did was make bad choices. I can't figure out if the purpose of this book was a bid for sympathy or to complain about Sammy Gravano, who, for all his faults, seemed to find a better writer, as well as editor, for his own book.

If every wife of a Mafioso wrote a book there would be a book written every minute.

You'll be happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Booted me in the - - - !","review":"What an intense workout! I like that there are 3 seperate workouts, so you can choose if you feel more like sweating from boxing or from drop-and-give-me-twenty. 4 instead of 5 stars because it's lacking a good warm-up/cool-down. And because I'm jealous."},{"rating":"1","title":"The method dvd","review":"I owned this on VHS years ago saw it on DVD and thought might b good for a off workout day but I now remember what I got rid of this years ago this is horrible !!! Terrible cuing not fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Workout","review":"I have had this video for about a year, and have just recently started using it. I work for the military, and while I wouldn't necessarily call this very \\"Boot Camp\\"-like, it is nonetheless a very good tape. I really enjoy the fact that the workouts are divided into three, equally challenging, segments. I've been working out now for several months and I find that if I do two segments at a time I still feel it the next day. It's true that there are no real warm-up or cool-down segments, and that some of the background dancers look like they could have used some more training, but I still like the video a lot. Overall, I'd say it's great for those who want a high-intensity, sweat producing workout. Depending on your level of ability, you can do one, two or three workouts and feel like you are burning a lot of calories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit brief","review":"While I do like the concept of Cardio Boot Camp and I do enjoy the enthusiasm of Tracey Mallett and her moves, I believe this workout with it's 3 brief segments, doesn't give ample time for a real workout. I find myself fast forwarding through the warmup of the following section in order to maintain the momentum of the cardio intensity. A much longer cardio routine, with less segments would work great. The other drawback of this video, is the warmup and especially the cooldown section, is almost non-existant. These things are crucial, especially for a beginning exerciser, who doesn't know what to incorporate to bring the heartrate down when the cardio section is through. These few additions would make this video good. I do like Tracey's combinations and she keeps you psyched throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good sweat","review":"Its an ok workout, but its not a favorite. I used it a couple times and i sweat but i just do not like this dvd. Its boring and the video quality is poor. I think this one is just about preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!","review":"I bought this video because I wanted a video that wasn't \\"dancing\\" aerobics. I thought it would be a basic calistenics (sp?) workout. However that is not the case. I am sure that this video is very good for someone wanting a traditional aerobics workout, but not for the people who want a basic military style workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout video","review":"This is one of my favorite exercise tapes- one that I do time and time again and it's good when I am in shape or out of shape. There are three good workouts on this video, all have moderate cardio and strength training, plus stretching. The \\"boot camp\\" aspect cracks me up because I would love to see military instructors wearing something like that and then popping off with that crazy accent and a big grin. It's fun to make fun of the instructor as she orders you to do pushups and whatnot (not that I would ever be catty and make fun of the aerobics instructor). Just do the 20 minute segment or the whole video, depending on how much time you have. This workout will definitely whip you into shape though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the Inexperienced","review":"I thoroughly enjoy this workout, it's challenging on many levels - cardiovascular, strength building and dance. That being said, a word to the wise, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS WORKOUT IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER. While the instructor gives good cues, she does not explain any of the moves before she does them nor does she give any pointers regarding how to do them properly or avoid injury. Between the kickboxing, dance sections and strength training, there are many opportunities to perform a move incorrectly and hurt oneself. If you've already done some dance, kickboxing and strength training, go to it, but if not you should stick to something more introductory with more instruction and work your way up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"This workout has no warmup and no cooldown. It's the worst workout I've ever bought. I actually threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I bought this video, and did the work out for a few months. I don't really like the way that the sets are layed out. There are several sets, with a cool down after each. One set is too short, and if you want to do two you have to fast forward through the cool down and the warm up to get going again.My biggest problem with this video is the crazed Aussie instructor. I can put up with almost any aerobics instructor, but she really really grated on me. I have done all kinds of videos, and liked this one probably the least, because mostly of her.One funny side note. There is a big out of place guy in the back that never keeps up, and is usually dancing to his own beat. That was the hilight of the video for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardio Boot Camp","review":"I was excited at first when I found this video. I was in the military and really got in great shape at boot camp. I was disappointed though. It wasn't very motivating at all and became boring very quickly. It turned out to be not much of a challenge. I probably won't ever watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Effective !","review":"This tape has boxing and kicking moves besides lunges and calisthenics. I found it to be fun, invigorating and effective while not too long. There are 3 workouts on the tape for a total of 50 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I've taught aerobic type classes for 15 years and purchased lots of videos over the years. Without a doubt this one of the worst ones I have ever purchased. It has nothing to do with a boot camp class other than the two camo-clad guys in the production.The music was a constant beat of jungle drums and annoying, again nothing to do with a \\"boot camp\\". Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dorky guy alert!","review":"This video is horrible! The instructor is SO incredibly annoying and theres this dorky guy in the back who is totally out of step and just does whatever the heck he wants. If you want a laugh, then buy it and watch this guy, otherwise, get something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused martial arts","review":"I did not like this workout because: 1) One of the guys is not with the others, 2) Her accent was hard to understand, 3) The cuing was not good, 4) The changes were very abrupt, 5) It felt short cardio-wise and long interest-wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR WORKOUT VIDEO!","review":"I actually bought this because I thought it was what it said \\"Basic Training\\". Of Course, I was thinking military and it has virtually NO excerises that soliders in the military do. I found the instructer VERY annoying! My husband is in the military and he said it was a very poor excuses for excersise tape. And for the men to be wearing BDU workout suits is beyond hillarous.......TWO THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS ONE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Book by a Master Craftsman","review":"I followed the guidelines in this book, submitted my first novel, and had a sale in six weeks. That is not an exaggeration. The book wasAt the Mercy of Her Pleasure [A Tarthian Empire story] (Antonello Brothers), and sold to Liquid Silver Books in February of 2004, and was released that July. It's now in its second printing with a new publisher, Loose Id. Multiple books later, my writing has won national awards and gained four and five star reviews. If you are willing to work and learn, this book will make an excellent guide. If you only read one book on writing this year, make it this one. If you're only going to read one book on writing ever in your life, make it this one. If you plan to write and you want to be read, read this book first. You will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Have\\" For Any Author","review":"I rarely write reviews of books I've purchased--a book must be truly superb (or truly awful) to be worth the effort. This one is superb.I bought it because it was required for a course I'm taking; I will keep it because it is easily the most valuable book NOT on my shelf (I refer to it constantly!) and because each page is packed with gems of wisdom and examples.No aspiring author can afford to be without this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words Right Print Wrong","review":"This book is difficult to read. Period. The type is too small and the print is brown. The author presents basic rules of writing, but is wordy himself,a bit pretentious.

Two years later we still love it, Linda Arnold's work has been re-released and we're getting them all!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for long-term use","review":"The first one was broken and the automatic rocking would never work, so we purchased the same one again because I really liked how it looked and hoped the broken one was just a fluke. It's just kind of a pathetic swing overall. It's cute and very attractive, but not very functionally sound. Our baby had to stop using this swing at 6 months because he was starting to reach out and grab the legs and pull the swing to the side. Obviously the swing doesn't work right after that point. Also, the seat is just too small. My baby's feet were hanging over the front much sooner than they should have and he just appeared to be too big for it even at 4 months. We got a lot of good use out of it from newborn to 4 months before we realized it wasn't gonna work for us any longer. I wouldn't purchase this again if I had another baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for!","review":"I highly recommend this CD!

Every battle fought by American forces from the Colonial Wars of 1758 through Korea (in my edition) is reviewed with a tightly worded, fully descriptive and reasonably objective narrative on the page next to the map of the battle. Combat units are broken down with clear unit designations and movement lines indicating disposition. While the maps are not topographic, they do indicate terrain features which help the reader understand the impact terrain had on a particular battle's outcome.Our military history study group finds the text and maps easy to follow and interpret. While many books go into greater depth on any given battle (i.e., leadership, morale, logistics, the political environment, etc.), they lack sufficient maps that illustrate various troop movements at specific times during the engagement. This book solves that problem and does so brilliantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affirmative Action is Complicated","review":"Well, after struggling to get my plans in place I decided to buy the book. I have learned a great deal more and have developed my plans using the book and a simple and inexpensive software called AAPMaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"meaning in the American context","review":"The contributors to this book make a concerted effort to define what this participation means, at the grassroots level. We also see how various US federal agencies and state and local governments have done, in terms of allowing public input into policy issues. Interestingly, the book explains how there is often little incentive for agencies to have too much public involvement, especially if this gives rise to opposition to proposed plans."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring and applicable tool","review":"I hate business books that drone on and on and don't leave you with any practical advice. That's not this book. The engaging anecdotes -- each with a \\"moral\\" at the end of the story -- make for easy reading. And the variety of situations covered by the authors should ensure that everyone has at least a few ideas they can take away and try. I am sure I'll turn back to this book for the inspirational quotations that begin each chapter. I find having the right quote can really make a communication about organizational change. David Baum's first book, Lightning in a Bottle, was equally useful in this regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawrence Welk with banjos","review":"I know Roy Clark is an icon in the country music world, and I was really looking forward to hearing some good old fashioned country and bluegrass music, but I really didn't get that on this album. Most of the songs on this compilation reminded me of the songs I'd hear at the dentist's office when I was a kid: soothing Big Band era melodies played by a string quartet at a slower than normal tempo in order to put the waiting patients into a tranquil mood. Maybe Roy Clark is well deserving of his legendary status in country music, but this album doesn't help me understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dose of reality","review":"This book is essential reading for those who have a family member or friend with Parkinsons. It is not a pretty story, but a real one with the author being very candid about his wife's disease, his role as the caregiver, and their lives as a married couple. Although the blurbs on the back cover jacket describe the book as uplifting, in reality, it is difficult to read as Millie's health deteriorates early and ends with a feeding tube being inserted. In fact, it is so brutally honest, that I decided not to share the book with a family member who has early Parkinson's Disease. What makes the book special is that it follows the history of Millie from the beginning and stays within the context of how Parkinsons affected the entire family."},{"rating":"2","title":"thank you for writing this book","review":"Thank you to Morton Kondracke for writing this book. My mother was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease two years ago. Morton and Milly's story is heart-wrenching and I appreciate them sharing it with the world. It was difficult to read in that I cried and cried, but it inspired me to try and do more early on in the progression of my mother's disease. God bless the Kondracke family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving Milly","review":"This book brought back a lot of buried memories of what my poor father went through with this horrid disease. It also shows what the caregiver has to deal with and opens your eyes to what true love really is. Mort provides his wife with what no doctor can, the security and constant reasurance that he'll always be there for her and that he truly loves her. There may be nothing in the medical world at this present time that can help her, but at least she has the love of a man that stands by her when she truly needs him the most. This is a wonderfully sad love story that everyone should read. For those that have never had to deal with a loved one with a terminal disease, this book may seem a fantasy, but for those that have, it is reality. Everyone should have a relationship like the one that Mort and Milly have, but no one should ever have to deal with the outcome that they will faced with. Good luck to them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondeful, worth the reading, great book !!!!","review":"I first saw the movie, I admit. I then read the book and it is wonderful. I was riveted. You will not be bored or disappointed. This man loved this woman so much. When they first got married, he was impatient and when she got the diagnosis, he really came through. It is not an easy thing to be caring for an invalid, which is what she literally became, changing her diaper, hand feeding her, etc. This book made me realize that everything is not just about me, but about those I love. The problem with most folks is they think everything is about them, when in reality, no one cares. Think about it folks. If you are a person that \\"always worries about what people think\\", trust me, they don't care. They're too busy worrying about what \\"other people think about them\\". LOL. Truly, think about this. THIS BOOK IS WORTH READING!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupendous!","review":"This is 'Tuesdays with Morrie' with a political twist. You will not be able to put it down. Morton pours his emotions out on to every single page and spares nothing to tell this amazing story about an amazing woman named Millie. Somehow, Morton makes it both heartwarming and heartbreaking. The best book I've read in years. If you don't bring this on your summer vacation, you will be VERY sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Brutally Honest Feelings","review":"Morton Kondracke's book moved me with his brutally honest expression of every feeling he has experienced since he met Millicent Martinez, and his journey through the abyss of Parkinson's with her. He holds back nothing and in so doing, reveals all the emotions, predominantly hope but also, her despair at times. It is a sobering story, especially to anyone, like myself, who is also an early onset Parkinsonian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dealing with Parkinson","review":"My name is Alton Bloomfield, I was diagnosed with parkinson in Nov. of 2003.My early symtoms differed some from Milly's in the book. This was probablydue to the difference in our ages when we were diagnosed. I have been able tocontrol it with medication to the point where I can still drive and do most anything I want to do. The book Saving Milly was in excellant condition whenI received it. I highly recommend Amazon Books.Alton Bloomfield"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written book by self-absorbed author","review":"Kondracke's book is more about him and politics in Washington than it is about what it's like to have a wife with Parkinson's Disease. He commits the fatal writer's error of telling about feelings and reactions rather than letting the reader discover them. He and his wife are very unappealing people. The writing style is tedious. Not worth the price or the time it takes to read it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Littlest Pet Shop...Biggest disappointment","review":"The Little Lovin' Playhouse playset from the Littlest Pet Shop toy line was a huge disappointment and awaiting return to the store. I love the little pet shop pets, however this playhouse did not make it 5 min without the hamster getting stuck in the tube on top. The tube also keeps coming apart as well as the lid popping off. Not very well constructed for children to play with. After popping the parts on and off the first 30 or 40 times it just starts to look like junk.I was really hoping for better, but I am returning it and probably will think twice about the line of playhouses that go with these pets."},{"rating":"1","title":"The other playsets are a better buy","review":"I bought my daughter multiple playsets for Christmas from the LPS series. Round round pet town was vy far a more sturdy set and has more to do.

Personally, I feel there are better built sets than this one, and this one has the least amount to do as far as pretend play goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome toy - for young boys & girls!","review":"Love this toy. I'm truly amazed at how my fun my daughter has playing with this. I never write reviews, but after cleaning up for the evening, and setting it up for tomorrow, I caught myself having big fun. So I felt compelled to write the review and give it 5 stars. Even though the little hamster door falls off. It's easy enough for my 3.5 yr old to fix by herself. Just pops right back on. We've also got the hamster set, and an additional set of dogs. All the little bobble-headed animals are freakin' precious.

They were made well and none of mine ever broke. These, however are a totally different story. Before I could even get it out of the package, the hamster tube's door fell off, and so did the front door.And in very little time, the dog's head popped off. The door to the hamster's tube falls off every few minutes, and it's really annoying. Unless you want to spent half the time you play with it reassembling it, don't buy this toy!
