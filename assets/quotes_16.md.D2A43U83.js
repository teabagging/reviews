It's a fun mixture of characters and the tricky, comical and embarrasing situations they get themselves into and the subterfuge they engage in to redeem themselves.

Having seen the substantive criticism from experts, one could hardly believe the bad reviews were true, but they didn't reveal just how badly this is done.

Harmony on the song \\"Hymn\\" alone is worth the album, but you won't be disappointed with her obvious talent in singing and writing blues. Her sense of humor shines through on \\"Boy, I Really Tied One On\\" (recorded also by Esther Phillips). A few songs foreshadow her struggles and disillusion with the Business of Music, and the angst of the performer has always been a theme for her. There's real quality work here. You wonder how she can get better, but she does. Fortunately she stayed in the business and is still writing and producing quality CDs against incredible odds.

Soon - 7/10 (loses points for lacking in depth lyrics)10.Forget Myself - 9/1011.La Da Da - 8/10Overall, this is not a bad album but I'd have to be in a certain mood to listen to it. It's not a GREAT CD to sing along to. It's a good album to play a party or when just hanging out because it's fun.

I thought it was just going to be another boring movie but to my surprise is was excellent! The movie provided an excellent view on the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the prejudices that were faced by the people living in Alabama at that time. The movie presented me with a clearer understanding of the boycott as well as the moral issues that were faced by those who were affected by the boycott. The characters in the movie were captivating. They were so strong in standing up for their rights. Odessa despite the long walk refused to ride the bus and Miriam despite her husband continued to drive in the carpool. The movie proves that one person can make a difference and change the way others think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good history lesson","review":"This film is first of all a good movie with fine acting. I also use it in the classroom to show 8th graders what was the situation in the South at the time of the famous Montgomery bus strike for African Americans.

This movie is an excellent depiction of the time period. While there is some harsh language, violence, and racial slurs, these three things really help to depict what the feelings towards the African Americans really were. This movie even shows how a person could be moved when they find out the situation of another person.Another thing that was enjoyable about the movie was there was the absence of two prominent figures of the equality movement, Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks. This movie really helped to show the situation of the normal person, who had to go to work and church as well as take care of their family.\\"The Long Walk Home\\" was a very good movie and was really moving. I would suggest it to everyone, especially because it shows what some people had to go through for their freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Montgomery bus boycott told","review":"A young girl narrates the story of her maid walking home after workduring the bus strike in Montgomery, Alabama in the mid '50's.This boycott was the start of the civil rights movementthat came to a head in the 60's with the murder of Martin Luther King.The white middle class family could afford a maid in those times,but they lived in the colored neighborhoods far from the suburbs.most blacks on those wages even with two jobs in the family couldn't afforda car, so the bus was their way to get to and from work.When Rosa Parks was put in jail for not sitting in the back of the bus,the African Americans were solidly behind the boycott.These events happened nearly 100 years after the Civil warand became a second civil war in the deep south.The effort to shut down the car pool, that was set up totransport the servants to their work,with the mother and her little girl there is the big climatic scenein this movie and is well acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Heartwarming Movie","review":"I saw this movie in my morality class. I was not expecting such a gem. This movie made me realize the hardships that those African Americans living in the south had to go through.

When a range war breaks out tht takes the life of his best friend, he is torn between his duty to his friend, his need to keep his past a secret, and his fear that his wife will reject him if he straps on a gun. And when it becomes clear to him that the killer is a professional gunman that only he has the skills to defeat, the conflict intensifies.Add to that an element of mystery.... was the killer hired by the logical suspect, or are there more dimensions than appeat?Clinton is a good writer and a master plotter.If you like Westerns, this is well worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not Faulty Towers","review":"I was hoping that the movie would be along the same lines as Faulty Towers.

For someone like me, also a keyboardist, it is a cause for the celebration of supreme music-making. The sheer rhythmic drive of Pogorelich's playing even in the quietest, slowest moments reveals one master expressing another. Each sonata is revealed as a highly concentrated universe. Listen to the regal command of K. 450. Listen to the sheer exuberance of K. 159. Listen to K. 87, its quiet, intense expression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice!","review":"The greatest moment of all, was K380 and the excellent ritenuti he did right before he starts!

Not only because they are non conformistic, but also because I think they are very clever and sensitive.This album with, some of the nicest Scarlatti's piano (yes, no fuzz, simply piano!) sonata's is very nice and light to digest I think, even if you're not a classical music fan and sets new standards, despite this album being a little older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great option","review":"That's a great option for everybody who wants to know a little about Scarlatti's sonatas played on the piano.

Once the notebook is inserted into the carrying case, it is nearly impossible to zip close. My wife uses it mostly and though the case appears durable and padded, getting the notebook inserted and the case zipped closed is difficult and very tight at best, the case needs more room to fit most 17 inch notebooks. We feared that the notebook would get damaged while trying to zip the case closed (we've owned numerous notebooks and cases over the last ten years). The Sony carrying case also does not carry much extra either. We've since bought another brand (Targus 17 inch) that fits much better and carries more items/accessories, this second one was essentially the same price.

Leak-proofness is critical for \\"travel-size\\" items. The other design problem is that the cleanser, scrub, and toner are in bottles with too small a base, so they tip over very, very easily on a countertop. Some minor design improvements to packaging would have earned this a five-star review. I'd suggest buying regular sizes of the items you want and transferring a small amount to your own travel containers."},{"rating":"2","title":"For that hard rock/metal sound","review":"Of all the guitars I have or have played, this one will always stick out as my favorite.

The appearance screams rock and roll, and the price is perfect for metal heads such as myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Exciting and Thought-provoking - an excellent book!","review":"I first read this book when I was 14 or 15; now that my daughter is about that age, we made it a family read-aloud and I was surprised at the pleasure the book could still provide. Told from the point-of-view of a typical adolescent male, this story also features one of Heinlein's (in fact, one of Science Fiction's) most adorable pets - Willis, the martian \\"bouncer.\\"This book contains many of the typical Heinlein themes - alien climes, the risks of power abused, the nature of sentience (an important issue in these times) and the hazards of assuming too much.A terrific book with surprising depth"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"My first introduction to Heinlein was \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" in junior high. I was hooked. I thought I read most of his early works, but a co-worker mentioned \\"Red Planet\\" and I didn't remember reading it. I downloaded it on my kindle and took off. The book was even more adolescent than I remember of other Heinlein earlier works. However, Heinlein was always fun and the plot was exciting. Heinlein had a knack of taking a boyhood escapade and turning it into inter-planetary incident. The scenery of the colony buildings, the canals, and the martian structures were vivid. His description of Mars at night was really beautiful. The images of the two boys speed skating on the canals to reach shelter before night falls and escaping from authorities were memorable and exciting.In summary, the book was a lot of fun. It was not the best book that Heinlein ever wrote, but some of the images and landscapes rival his best books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic and now uncut","review":"When I read this as a child I just loved it how I wanted to go there. So I was worried rereading would ruin my love for the book. Well it holds up better than most of his works.Ok, so we know Mars much better, it is still a fun read. I think they might of made a cartoon based on this book at some time, if not they should it make a great CGI for direct to DVD -IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible digital conversion, should be pulled from catalog","review":"Bottom line - get the preview first and see the horrible conversion and many many typos before you spend the premium to get this version.I bought this higher priced version hoping to get the author's preferred version, and I was very disappointed. The digital conversion was done terribly badly and apparently there was no proofreading done at all.For example, every single time the book should say \\"I'd\\", it converted as \\"Fd\\". Every single time it does that, and there are many other examples of glaringly obvious typos.The quality of this does not justify a price one quarter of the premium price tag this one carries, and the book should simply be pulled from the catalog and should not be sold at any price until proof-read and fixed. I can't imagine either of the Heinleins wanting a book so terribly badly edited to be sold in their name, and this horrible conversion gives the entire kindle idea a black eye and ebooks in general a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only For Children","review":"I'm not impressed with this book.

I was captivated and continued reading. I found the book to be \\"comfortable\\", and I felt as if part of the plot. I finished the book within a matter of days, and then asked my mom where she had gotten the it. To my shock and disappointment, she told me that it was a library discard that she rescued from a give-away box. Take this from a picky reader: Give this a try.

Blending the ramshackle grace of the Stones, Free, the Faces, Humble Pie, and early solo Rod Stewart into the Southern rock sound of the Allman Brothers Band, the Marshall Tucker Band, and the Outlaws, then distilling the whole thing down to the bare-bones basics, the band packs a one-two punch with the songs \\"Twice As Hard\\" and \\"Jealous Again\\" while also making room for such great ballads as \\"Seeing Things\\", a song which, with its message of \\"the old days weren't always good and the future's not as bad as it seems\\" ethos, inspired me skip my old school's Thanksgiving dinner in order to keep myself looking good for pretty actresses.

I was horrified to see that the accompanying literature pretty much gives away the surprise, right on the box.

He is a bigger than life PI, and she is the strength that guides him in times of need. They work great together in a normal and refreshing adventure. It has been awhile since anyone has written such a fun and exciting novel. The plot is great with a real setting that makes you feel as though you are a part of the story.

Right....","review":"I personally am tired of outsiders creating screwed up fantasized realities about the LDS church. If you want to read something about a church then read something close to objective. This book does not accomplish that. It is right away assumed that the Book of Mormon is simply Joseph Smith's great work of fiction that he incorporates himself into. As if the life stories of oh, 20 people or more would not otherwise resemble Joseph Smith's life. And to sit and treat a prophet of God as a mentally ill or just psychiatric patient that needs psychoanalyzing is simply absurd. Most would agree it sacreligious to do so to Christ or Muhammad. The same is applicable to Joseph Smith. There's a certain amount of respect that the dead have earned. Award it to them. But of course, I'm just a teen ager, so what do I know, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Speculation and wild fantasies and half-truths","review":"The only thing good in this book are the quotes from Joseph Smith and the people who were there. Speculation and wild fantasies and half-truths have no place. The anti-Mormons cannot stand it that Mormons have the restored gospel, and will try anything to discredit Joseph Smith. All anyone needs to do is read the Book of Mormon for themselves and pray to know it is true. This book against Joseph Smith will not change anyone's mind who's mind is made up.

She is ever bit as good as Jessye Norman, Barbara Hendricks, Kiri Te Kanawa, Lesley Garrett at el.Geting back to my review, well her voice was definetly a ten. The only reason that I rated this cd a two was because most of the songs were from the classical venue. Don't get me wrong, I really like classical music, but my preference is classical music that is performed instrumentaly not vocally.I didn't think it helped that this cd was recorded live.

I was wearing reading glasses at 1.25 before I started using the pinholes, and thinking I needed to increase the strength to 1.50. Now I am wearing 1.00 reading glasses and feel like the pinholes are responsible for that shift. I can't compare this particular brand of pinholes to other brandss, though, because these are the first I've ever had.

I have to hold them to my face even after following the directions for warping them to fit your face. They're also uneven, lopsided on my face, and were that way initial to the adjustment. It is extremely hard to even see through the glasses this way, and defeats the whole purpose if none of the pinholes actually line up with both of my pupils.

Compared to Solti's recording, it was a bit more exciting, but less melancholy. But the performance is very fine: the orchestra, the choir, and the two singers, a bit finer than Solti's, even though he's a very excellent conductor himself.\\"The Wooden Prince\\" is pretty fine too, even though this is the only recording I heard so far.

There's a collection of Bartok's music conducted by Boulez."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic set!","review":"Pierre Boulez, as the good wine seems to improve through the years and enhancing exponentially in what Bartok concerns. This work is another additional sample of his magisterial enhancement through the years. The particular emphasis in the architectonic lines and the astonishing handle of the dark dissonances, confers him a well deserved seat of honor. This Wooden Prince is one of the best you can get in the market, as well as Cantata Profana, that you may easily consider the best version ever recorded to date.A golden album. Absolutely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Offering by two of my favorites.","review":"Long before I started appreciating Stravinsky, Bartok was my favorite 20th century composer, mostly on the strength of his piano concerti and his Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta, plus his adaptation of Hungarian folk music (being 1/2 Hungarian helped a lot here). So, it's surprising it took me so long to discover these works, but what a discovery they are, especially in the hands of the preeminant conductor of modern music, Maestro Boulez. I am not a great fan of ballet performances, but this music (as with Stravinsky's 'The Rites of Spring') really make me interested in seeing this 'Ballet pantomine' performed. This is also easily more interesting than some of Bartok's other works, such as the first piano concerto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice big fan that blows a lot of air with little noise.","review":"We were looking for a floor fan to move air around the house. This fan had good reviews so we decided to buy.It is BIG but really does everything we expect it to do. Cooling down the house in the evening is a matter of 10-15 minutes now with the fan strategically positioned in a door or window and by opening and closing other windows throughout the house.The fan has a fairly long cord so placement is easy. The power/settings switch is centrally located in the back which is a little awkward. It is fairly light and is easy to carry and position. The pivoting option is nice to direct the flow of air.It has three speed settings and even on the lowest setting it moves a good amount of air. In the lowest setting it is surprisingly quiet and even at the highest setting noise is acceptable.

Here was an Elvis that was entirely down-to-earth, a man who performed and sang with real conviction and real faith behind his words.

The problem with this nice DVD is that it's filled for more than 50% of people who are talking about Elvis. The one thing I did not like was that the songs, which I think are the most important, are cut into pieces with people who are talking about Elvis. There is no way that you can listen and see Elvis perform without the talking. For the diehards it's a real must, but for me who like the songs the most, will give this DVD away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept - Poor Execution","review":"The concept is good- Elvis singing gospel with commentary. What will leave Elvis fan very dissapointed is the fact that his songs are cut off for the sake of commentary. This is a common complaint.

Considering that his Gospel music was the only music that won him Grammy awards and is arguably some of his best and most inspired work- Elvis fans deserve better.

If the remixes were better, or of different songs, or if there was an unreleased song on the disc, it'd be a must buy. But it's not.I think this was released by the label to squeeze a few more bucks out of a new band using the then popular Marilyn Manson.

Instead of spending more time on the \\"why\\" and \\"how\\" of Giuliano's campaign for Sicilian revolution, this film wastes time on smaller, less important scenes.

It's a good book in the same way that 'The Godfather' is - exciting and rousing - but that isn't enough to make a good movie. Whereas Francis Ford Coppola and Marlon Brando made what many consider to be the best movie of all time, Michael Cimino and Christopher Lambert made a real stinker here. Actually, the problem less with Cimino than it does with Lambert.

People who have problems with Christopher Lambert's performance obviously see him then immediately stop watching the movie. His character is out of place in every aspect, he rears his horse at a woman in the window, skids across the floor like he's flying to start a dance, and continually makes a point of how different he is, Lambert seems to fit the role perfectly. Aside from him we have John Turturro in the performance of a lifetime and an interesting contribution by Terrance Stamp.I sincerely hope a special edition of this DVD comes out in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"ReadPuzo","review":"The casting in this film was terrible.

Zimerman is outstanding (and he even conducts), and the thing I like the best is that you can really hear the piano and orchestral detail very clearly. The recording balance of the soloist and orchestra is close which brings fantastic sound. The concertos Bernstein conducts with Zimerman at the keyboard are also quite good, with Bernstein avoiding some of the slow speeds that seemed to plague the last few years of his recording career. The playing of the VPO is peerless as expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Krystian Zimerman is a true genius.

I read the first chapter and part way into the second chapter and was so disgusted, I threw it on the couch. My husband looked it over a bit and threw it into the waste basket. I have read books that had bad words and bad scenes before, but this was written purposely to shock like an elementary school child that has discovered he could shock people with certain words.

Unfortunately, the book is not funny and not well written. The graphic (or pornographic) thoughts and actions of the main character as well as other characters didn't even seem to fit into the story. I suppose they were thrown in for humor, but like a comedian who must resort to using foul language to get a laugh; it was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"LJB fans stay far away from this!","review":"A clever parody imitates an author's style but this so-called parody is more like a personal diatribe against Lilian Jackson Braun. Makes me think of the line in Hitchcock's Rear Window, spoken after a woman discovers her little pet dog's been strangled. She shouts at her neighbors, \\"Why'd you have to kill him?

I can't even figure out why it is about her. The book is filled with sex and disgusting body references. It is funny - especially chapter 11, but I was terribly disappointed after reading all the five star reviews. I wonder if those people actually have read all about Mr. Q and Pickax. I love the 'Cat Who' books and expected this to be in the same vein. I had no desire to endure so many sex scenes, and had to struggle to even finish the book - ever hoping for some redemption.

I do not think that Robert Kraplow is talented enough to understand that discussing his sexual preversions and tendencies is not really a parody of Lillian Jackson Braun, but of himself.

I do understand what a parody is--but I feel it should retain the qualities that made the original pleasing to its fans. Mr. Kaplow obviously failed to notice that Lillian Jackson Braun uses no obscenities and creates her major characters [aside from the criminals] from civilized, basically decent molds.Ms. Braun's leading male character is an intellectual gentleman, not a lascivious ruffian--and I did not appreciate being told--on page 8, mind you, that, after ogling a busty young woman, heviolently indulged in self-gratification.This book should not be listed by Amazon beside books by Ms. Braun with the comment that people who bought her books bought this one--because few of her fans are likely to appreciate this travesty of her scene and characters.I am bitter over having wasted money on it that I could have spent on a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUT THERE!","review":"A deliciously subversive novel.

I read the first couple of chapters and skimmed through the rest. Did read the ending though. Spoiler here in case anyone actually decides to finish the book:Philip Roth as the murderer? Oh, please.I got this book from the library. At least I didn't pay actual cash money for it. I'd rate this as one of the five worst books I've ever read.

Robert Kaplan settles for the coarse, the vulgar, and other hammer-on-the-head adolescent humor in a supposed spoof that suggests he hasn't read anything more of Lillian Jackson Braun than her titles. He repeats his jokes, e.g., the list of gay bars, the violent masturbation, and the character who farts, three times in as many minutes--pause for ever more hilarious laughter after each fart. Gosh.

I have a sense of humor, and can appreciate someone poking fun at some of the absurdities of LJB's book series, but this book was disgusting. It wasn't even a parody! All it was to me was an excuse for the author to talk about the male reproductive organ at every opportunity. That requires no imagination. The author more than made up for the lack of sex in LJB's novels, and sent me rushing back to them to clear my mind of the mental images left from his book!!

A successful parody requires wit, erudition, a sense of play, a shrewd selection of targets, and some actual humor. None of these are displayed in this sorry and needless massacre of innocent trees. If the author seeks to display venom, he has certainly achieved that. Unfortunately for him, he has also displayed the \\"fulsome settlings\\" of his inner mind.The Cat Who books are certainly not above parody, and they may indeed annoy some people enough to make them angry enough to write a biting satire. However, throwing a bucket of random names and manure over a general subject does not constitute a parody.Readers, Braun fans or not, can save money and have an equivalent experience by standing in a cow barn on a hot day and taking a deep whiff."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Who Killed Lilian Jackson Braun","review":"Don't waste your money.

Ms. Braun may not be everyone's cup of tea, but after you read her books you don't need to take a shower nor attempt to somehow flush out the filth from your brain. She actually was quite instructive about several different topics as well as wholesomely entertaining!

My son likes to play his when we go on vacation (and the hotels never seem to have RCA connections), so that's why we're looking or one.

As far as with the PS2 Slim, I cannot connect the power cord to my system because the XB360 part of the cable blocks the port for the power cord.

I read Louis work several years ago, and found it \\"anything but\\" plain and simple. The chapter ordering seemed confusing, introducing complex topics early in the book, and explaining them only later.Frawley takes a more traditional approach, adhering more to WIlliam Lilly's methods. After all, Lilly was the acknowledged master of Horary Astrology in 17th century England. Frawley has the gift of making astrological concepts easy to understand, and he is also blessed with an entertaining wit.I'm sure others may prefer Louis, but Frawley's book (published in 2005) has more to offer, as far as I am concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far From Simple","review":"This is not a book for a novice. Mr. Louis has a niche for writing technical jargon in a non-complex manner, but without having the basics down, the reader will most likely feel like a fish out of water. Horary astrology is much more complex and I feel forced to argue the title of \\"plain and simple\\" as I did not find anything simple at all about horary astrology. I must admit though, that Mr. Louis made it seem less like a whole new learning practise and more like the extension of astrology that it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astrology at its best","review":"I found this book easy to read, very clear and understandable. It is not a book for a novice. You have to know some basic astrology before you study horary. But when you are ready to learn horary, this this the place to start.

I would recommend Giorgi Latsabidze's interpretation of Debussy's Preludes where you find and discover a great range of varies colors and make you really forget that a piano is a percussion instrument.

Conservatives have long been resentful of the popularity of Doonesbury, which they feel is a left-wing comic (it's not - Trudeau takes swipes at those of all political persuasions). In Prickly City, they feel they have a standard-bearer. I have to admit that at least it's not as obscenely single-minded as Mallard Fillmore, but clever? Insightful? Not really.

Reading through it reminds me of several expos��-type programs I've seen about surprisingly inaccurate school textbooks. I'll give one concrete example here; you can find the rest if you're unfortunate enough to own this book.According to p. 168, 1 quadrillion (1x10^15) BTU = 170 million barrels of crude oil. From p. 167, we see that 1 barrel = 42 gallons, so a quadrillion is about 7,140,000,000 (7 billion, 140 million) gallons.On p. 169, we're told that 1x10^15 BTU = 180 million gallons. There's a pretty large difference between 180 million and 7 billion.

I actually appreciated that the sex scenes were very hot by this genre's standard, but I understand this isn't for those who want a tame read. Typical of Holly, there was less traditional elements of homosexuality and bondage, all which added to the story.The reason I didn't give the story 5 stars, is the ending. (I'm not giving too much away, I promise) The story focuses primarily on the \\"couple\\" of the novel all the way through, but the end is more about brotherly love and acceptance. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad there was a HEA for specific characters but it annoyed me that the main \\"couple\\" was short changed at the end, and the overall ending seemed rushed especially since rather mundane events took up entire chapters. I found myself looking to see if my copy was missing pages, which sadly, it wasn't.I still think you should pick this up if you like the genre at all or if you like Emma Holly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seductive, sexy and a great introduction to Emma Holly","review":"For those that aren't aware of her more erotic titles from Black Lace, you'd think Emma Holly's historical was just another prett cover on the shelf but in fact, her words capture and combine prose with poetry for a genre that's largely lost on people like me (go for the modern times!)While I do prefer her Black Lace series books, \\"Beyond Innocence\\" still caught my attention, turned me on, made me care about the characters and deal with the oddities of Edward's brother.Emma Holly manages to sneak in a few life lessons as well, while sticking to the central point of the story, the hot romance!Bravo Miss Holly,S"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Around Great Book","review":"It is love and lust at first sight for the hero, but he has to restrain himself b/c she is supposed to marry his homosexual brother to save his reputation, unbeknownst to her though.

Although, the antagonist, his jilted mistress, tries to make trouble in her own way it is insignificant and has no major negative impact that frustrates you.

Even the [physical] scenes were stilted - no romance or love, just mechanical [physical scenes].Edward plots to launch Florence upon society as his cousin in an effort to have her marry his brother, Freddie. The problem with this is that Freddie [prefers men], and although he loves Florence, he could never be in love with her. Edward is a different story, however. He spends the whole book lusting after our heroine, of course he getting her in the end.But the characters were so shallow. Ms. Holly tried to make Edward strong and sensitive but she only seemed to be weak and naive. And as for Florence, she isn't treated as a person for most of the book. Edward lies to her, spies on her, uses her and she just takes it.

It was a wonderful story of Edward and Florence. The love scenes were hot and imaginative. Many words were used to describe the scene and make your blood boil. Emma Holly knows what it takes to stretch the lovemaking out just far enough and when to draw you into the story. You find yourself caring for Florence with her shyness but underlying strength. If only she can convince herself what she truly wants instead of what is proper. Edward is like many men-arrogant, prideful, honor bound. But passion is more powerful as soon he finds out.

This takes place in Spain and the twist is one of the boys begins to fall for the other. I could see an American version of this turning into American Pie 3 but not in this Spanish version. All aspects of the film are handled in a sensitive and realistic way. The natural awkwardness and shyness of the boys combined with their very childlike excitement of being on their own comes across as very natural. The young actors did a great job. This is a great buddy film and if you liked Wild reeds or Beautiful Thing you will like this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"Nico and Dani is a fresh and delightful story of two teenage boys spending several weeks together. The director (Cesc Gay) showed remarkable skill at bringing realistic and understated performances from his young actors. The camera feels invisible as we experience intimacies between the boys and the two girls they hang out with. One of the extras the dvd offers is a look behind the scenes, amazing to consider such natural performances occurred with such a busy set. An interview with the director reveals the original work on stage was with an older cast. Casting younger actors really adds to the poignancy of the story.How different most European culture is regarding sex from the prevailing tone in the USA. Perhaps viewers will find solace knowing there are places people come of age without all the angst and homophobia of mainstream America."},{"rating":"1","title":"oddly homophobic story of gay love","review":"Dani, who belongs to an affluent family somewhere on the southern coast of Spain, gets a summertime visit from his old friend Nico. They hit on some girls at Nico's insistence without giving up their old pastime of krampack. When Dani realizes that he is in love with Nico, he begins acting like an idiot: he grabs at Nico's privates when he is having sex with a girl, tells the girl that Nico is really a maricon, then pushes himself onto the local mature, sophisticated writer but runs out before they hit the bedroom.What I find insulting about this film is that the boys never say the \\"gay\\" word, but they express their hatred of \\"maricones\\" quite often. I don't mind the director trying to pretend that gay history and culture don't exist, but it is offensive to tell a story about same-sex love that simulataneously preaches hatred of gay people."},{"rating":"1","title":"No subtitles, and my high school spanish is rusty!!","review":"The boys are beautiful, but my spanish is very rusty.

But it's not a stellar story, or performances, and there is a flatness to the production which some might see as understated but comes off as film-schoolish in parts. There is a preachy backnote to the film, too, which is always a turnoff. It has it's moments, but not enough to recommend beyond a rental.

It may be just a phase that Nico is going through but Dani figures out, and is comfortable with his feelings, that he would rather spend time with Nico than with anyone else. As he tells Nico on one occasion: \\"I would watch you all day long.\\" The film is in no way exploitive and shouldn't offend the most conservative of viewers. The sex between the young men hardly exists; the small amount of nudity is tastefully done. The naturalism of the film is refreshing and totally believable.The two young men spend a lot of time on the beach in scenes that are beautifully filmed in this sweet coming-of-age film that will not disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nico and Dani","review":"Nice little Indie movie...good acting from the principals...nice little story...very believable...nice coming of age story of the two boys involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"good stuff maybe, bad program","review":"Maybe there's some good stuff inside, but the interesting thing is you cannot even run the software smoothly....

I have seen dime-store hibachis with up to four grilling heights, and no worries about making a quick switch in height. The grill's iron legs tend to get very hot in use, so beware of placement on wood or other heat sensitive surfaces. The door to stoke/service coals is a useless feature.

Doc Holliday was a tubercular gambler and gunman who ran around with a whore and lived a bloody life on several levels, including in his lungs. That Bruce Olds could take such unpromising material and turn it into a work of art is an act of genius. I don't even like \\"Westerns\\"--a friend recommended this book to me--but this is no \\"Western.\\" It is a poetic meditation on mortality and loss, love and sex, art and violence, and it sings and dances on every page.

If you know very little, like myself, you will enjoy it not only for what you will learn about history of this character, you will bask in the language, which often reads more like poetry than prose. You don't have to be a Wild West fan to appreciate this novel, you only have to be a lover of serious literature.

Do NOT put a Poptart in there! Because of the method used to imprint the face, it squeezes the food--Poptarts get stuck, broken and then fall through to the bottom. What a mess. The final straw was when one of the knobs broke off the front. We've had our toaster for only 1 1/2 yr. and use it 1-2x/wk = not enough to warrant breakdown already.

All of these songs are great songs, and Maysa adds her own little style and touch to make each song her own, eventhough many of them have been remade by many other singers in the past.

Surpised at all the 5 star reviews! There isn't a cut on this CD that is as good as the original version. I love listening to Maysa, and have all her solo albums as well as the Incognito albums. This one is just fair, mostly because the songs, while good, are not given the extra life or energy required to justify a remake. Maysa shows up, but I was waiting for that one song where she would break out, like she does on so many of her better cuts. The backing band, is just OK, and sounds mostly electronic. Betcha by Golly Wow is an example of a song that plodded along without coming to life. And the Roberta Flack masterpiece at the end, remains Roberta's. Still, not a bad CD.

The new adaptation reduces the story to nearly nothing and the characters to stick-figures. Montgomery's novels could introduce today's readers to a different writing style, to new phrases and speech patterns; but this author ensures that will not happen.

This book would not be interesting to anyone that likes more dialog between characters in a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is interesting at some parts, but it gets repetetive","review":"The character John relies way too much on the aid of the female mage. Even though he loves her and attempts to rescue her from the clutches of the Ancient Dragonlord, he tears her apart from a love as strong as his, maybe even more. John's tendeancy to act before thinking puts them in many dangerous situations that might have been avoided if he were mentally competent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...

The characters were extremely well done, though Trey seemed sort of flat because she only existed as a comparison between Jenny and Zyerne, and you could feel the nuances, emotions, rationales and flaws in their characters. Also, like whoever said below, the depth of human nature portrayed here is extremely moving. The title, \\"Dragonsbane\\" does seem aptly appropriate, in more ways than the obvious. Though if I have to nitpick, the emphasis on descriptions of light hitting random objects wasn't something I ever got used to..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bane of dragons","review":"A book that takes many standard ideas of fantasy and looks more deeply. How does one slay a dragon? What is love, true love? Will the young hero succeed in his solitary quest? What, exactly, is civilized?This book also has valuable things to say about human living in any age... What is love and what are its costs and rewards? How can we resist and overcome the cruel and the greedy? How can one be true to ones own self? How do we treat with respect one who has not yet earned our admiration?This is a superb book with an interesting take on dragons, excellent characterizations, and wonderful answers to all these questions and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad dont buy","review":"really bad.... i love clay but this show suckes.. the intro takes way to long.. not funny anymore..the show is recorded somewhere in the 80s.. so allot of bad hairdo,s.. dont buy.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ever","review":"It's reassuring to know that this bozo was just a flash in the pan, now all washed up, appropriately.

Maybe because it charts DeDe's courage and incredible transformation. Maybe it's the way Mouse mulls over whether he's following a cookie-cutter concept of being gay. Or maybe it's the way Maupin revisits his earlier theme of creating one's own \\"family\\" and turns it upside-down.Maybe it's just Mary Ann's TV job as a Martha Stewart prototype.In any case, Maupin's ear for dialogue is sharp, and his ability to communicate his characters' frailities really start to gel in this one!

She does not even sound as if she is into the part. Pavarotti was ment to sing Alfredo, just not here! He is still one of the best Alfredo's around, but this recording he sounds bored and not into his character. Juan Pons is great as Germont, but just because he is in it, its not worth buying this bad recording. The orchestra under James Levine sounds, for lack of a better word, weird!

While performing in a play aboard the Enterprise he is transported to another reality. In this other dimension the play is reality for our unsuspecting first officer. Out of all of the episodes I've never seen the Riker character so frightened and unsure. It's a testament to the under rated acting ability of Frakes. I think that he could also carry the show as ship's captain and it's unfortunate that the powers that be didn't make Riker captain and kept Next Generation going a few more seasons.This is another one of those episodes that you can see over again. It has scenes where Riker can't believe the fact that he may be imprisoned forever.

The singer, who sings \\"light music,\\" is just awful, and there was no sophistication in the execution of the pieces. The jathis in the varnam were a joke, maybe one step above an adavus class, and the singer just killed the song.Likewise, when I actually saw the DVD, I was just appalled. She hardly had any stage presence and her face always seemed frozen. Her movements were mediocre, and she didn't really have much maturity in her dance as one would expect of a performer her age. There was no bhava in her abhinaya, nor did she exude a sense of enjoyment out of what she was doing. Perhaps she couldn't stand dancing to the music ;)Conclusion, please do not buy this DVD...if you are interested in learning bharathanatyam, seek out a teacher. do not use these items in an aragetram or you will surely kill the audience ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth it.","review":"I purchased Padma Chebrolu's 2 DVDs many years ago. The vocal music is not great, and her dancing is not up to par with professional dance Guru's that I know personally (in the USA). Regardless of where you live, don't be fooled into settling for this instructional DVD.As a dance teacher, Padma's expressions and dancing are very sloppy. She does not appear confident and is off-beat sometimes. You can find plenty of other amazing quality Bharatanatyam dancers in the US. Padma Chebrolu would not even be on my Top 25 list. Hopefully I can re-sell my DVDs one day because they were a waste of time! The only thing that the DVD does well is explain the meaning of some songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"customer","review":"i was very dissapointed by this dvd. the music was not good and the dance was horrible. there was no expression and looks like she was in a frozen state and it was like a 60 year old trying to dance,very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"cd quality ok but the vocals and quality of music is bad!","review":"I just got this cd and it is just pitiful. The all the musicians except for the vocal are great. The vocal woman sounds like she is in pain and does not at all express the strength of the the musical pieces. She know the pieces but is not able to convey them in a pleasing manner that carries teh messages of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent DVD","review":"First of all, even though I don't find this DVD is specifically \\"instructional\\", I must say the quality of the picture and the sound is very good. I disagree with the reviewer who wrote \\"DVD with such an substandard music and performance\\" because its standards are pretty good if you live in the States and don't have a chance to attend special performances in South India. I would say that this DVD was made for those students who are learning Bharata Natyam as a hobby rather than as a career.For those who are not familiar with what \\"Arangetram\\" stands for, it is basically a \\"graduation Margam\\", or the same as a any other full traditional recital. In this sense, it may be compared with any other Bharata Natyam DVDs like the ones featuring Medha Hari, for example. I hope David Morrison will continue to produce classical Indian dance DVDs, although he should pay more attention to the musicians' dancers' mastery and performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bharatanatyam video on DVD","review":"You should buy it if you are seriously interested in the Indian Classical Dance as this is one of the first three Bharatanatyam videos that can be bought on DVD. It is professionally designed and filmed, and the dance performance is better than the one seen in Anita Ratnam's DVD, although the varnam part is less authentic and rather simple compared with far more elaborate elements seen in Medha Hari's DVD, as these elements require to be performed by a real virtuoso.All in all, unlike the other two Bharatanatyam DVDs, it is a good and clear introduction to Bharatanatyam done in the classical way, even though some elements of the technique may not be the purest Bharatanatyam, as Padma Chebrolu's style of Bharatanatyam, a US-based dancer, was heavily influenced by her studies in Kuchipudi, Andhra Natyam and Mohini Attam.I believe it is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared with other Bharata Natyam DVDs, this one is definitely not a bargain!","review":"Arangetram is supposed to be a complete margam. Basically, you can watch any full recital and get an idea of what an arangetram is.Among the Bharatnatyam DVDs, P.Chebrolu's DVD is the most expensive. Unless the image/sound quality is your primary consideration, it cannot stand comparison with, for example, some of the Drishya Bharatham DVDs, which are priced at 3 times less.As for the perfection of the technique and the demonstrations, well, P.Chebrolu's DVDs cannot stand any comparison with some young virtuosos' like Medha Hari's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub standard performance for an expensive DVD","review":"I am surprised one can even venture in making an DVD with such an substandard music and performance.There was not even one teermanam displayed correctly by the dancer leave alone by the mridangam.All the main items are cut short so badly(tillana 7 minutes give me a break).....If this is the intention ,it is better be priced accordingly.I didnot enjoy even one item ...My strong suggestion is not to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better try before you buy an expensive item","review":"You may wonder why, unlike some other similar Bharatanatyam DVDs,- the durations of this entire DVD and of individual items are not listed;- there are no online DVD trailers available for previews.If you are absolutely new to Bharatanatyam, I must tell you that a standard arangetram/margam includes at least 70 minutes of dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIFIC SMELL","review":"This tunnel smells beyond toxic!

My children (almost 2 yrs. old, 6 yrs. old, & 9 yrs. old) absolutely love it! I was thrilled at the quality too! It's very durable not like many collapsible tunnels & toys I've seen (& purchased).

The metal spiral has poked through the fabric and is sharp. It is no longer safe for use. The stitching on the other side that contains the metal spiral has also started to come apart. I am very disappoint in the quality of this tunnel. When we first got it everything looked great and I was hoping to get a lot of use out of this. I guess not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and portable!","review":"My 21mo old son got this as a gift from his Auntie and he loves it! I like how easily you can set up/collapse and pack the tunnel.

It makes a great gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Good product, easy to use, attractive, and my daughter likes it. Need I say more? We also rigged it to our pop up club house tent, it just took a little creativity. My daughter really likes that she can keep track of us while in the tunnel, because she can see out of the netting. It not being completly made out of netting, to me, makes me think it is more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor quality","review":"There are so many loose seams. When you drag one seam, it comes apart fast. I already find hole in the binding area showing inner padding within the first use on my soft carpet(5 minutes). It is NOT durable!!!The tunnel I received also contains blue ball pen writing on the tag. Is it a used or returned product? I don't know it was previously used by a pet or not. There was an area of light yellow stains I'm not able to wipe clean. Is it urine from a pet? I need to clean it before my baby use it. Baby likes to taste the tag. I cannot clean the ball pen writing on the tag either! Who did that?It is sooo cheaply made. It shouldn't be 30 dollars. I have to go through all the hassles to return the product. What a waste of time!I cannot believe the other good reviews. It seems as if my pacific tunnel was made by a cheap low pay factory with poor sewing ability.

Someone had finally gotten it right, I thought. It focused on T'Challa as a king, first and foremost. However, the story soon degraded into something else entirely. Hudlin completely distorted established characters, and even completely changed others. This offended me as a comic book continuity freak. The stereotypes offered for both white and black characters managed to offend me as well. The art in this book is pretty good and if you dig a little, you can even find a palatable story. My recommendation is to skip this book. Pick up the collected Kirby Black Panther and the Priest books and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Take on an Old Superhero","review":"Black Panther has been around for many years but has never been embraced by the comic buying public. He is a great character that should be as well known as Spider-Man, Superman or Batman.When Christopher Priest was writing Black Panther's adventures the series became one of the best reviewed comics around but still failed to find a significant audience.Now we have a new writer (Reginald Hudlin) taken a shot at plotting the exploits of Black Panther and he is off to a good start. We get an exciting new origin and plenty of background information in this tale. Once you read this you can understand the character and his motivations. This is only the beginning. Hudlin provides plenty of thrills and surprises in the subsequent stories that follow this one in the series.Some will continue to reject the adventures of Black Panther but those with an open mind looking for a good story and a great hero will embrace it."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"I thought this book missed the target in many ways. Among them, there is an excessive amount of the author going to the extreme. What I mean is that instead of the Wakandian's having advanced medical techniques, they instead throw around casually that they have the cure for cancer. These kind of throwaway lines occur again and again; it gets old fast and eventually starts ripping the reader out of the story. Another extreme is that Hudlin makes the world outside of Wakanda out to be completely ignorant and horrible while Wakanda is shown as being a perfect paradise; again, middle grounds on both would have been much more believeable and effective. Also, it seems the title character is now retconned into being the son of the Black Panther that readers have known for 40 years now. This comes off as confusing and, to me, unecessary. Romita's art is as always gorgeous but I don't feel it comes close to making this book worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss the good old days","review":"Simply put, this book is not good. Anyone looking for quality BP stories should buy the trades written by Priest. It throws away much of what happens before and is very confusing.

The plot is a simple story of a couple who become farmers, which is interesting if you enjoy learning about farming. But there are no subplots. There is nothing else going on besides the farming. Nothing to make you want to keep reading. It basically is a bit boring and nothing at all like the quality writing of Jan Karon."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!

I am from a small town and dairy farming has been in my family for generations. I too have had to hide behind a few cows.The characters reminded me of real people in my community. Real people and real issues. The story reminds me of something I would see from Hallmark Presents.The story was very moving with \\"down to earth feel good\\" situations surrounded by issues real people encounter on the farm and in everyday life.If you don't have a farm background or not even interested in farming.

It was a little slow in the beginning, but once I got into it, I was hooked.

Rather than being \\"rife with pleasant repetition\\", the book is rife with clich��s and rip off.

I have to grip the handle VERY firmly in order to prevent this from sliding all over the counter top.- The wooden pestle is already all dinged up and even has a chip in it.- The inside of the press is all scraped and dinged upIt does work fine, but the craftsmanship is very low.

OK, I agree that life makes me sad too, but the bitter deapair that permeates the lyrics and music is just too much to stomach. Keep it to yourself Bob (and Daniel Lanois); who needs it?

Its producer should win a Grammy award for most tasteless and indiscriminate use of echo. The playing is amateurish and sloppy: none of the musicians seems to have a solid grasp of where \\"one\\" is (or, for that matter, \\"two\\", \\"three\\", or \\"four\\"). The songs are utterly vapid, completely devoid of lyrical inspiration and tune (needless to say); their chord progressions are the moldiest, tritest chord progressions you can imagine. I think it significant that no one who praises this album can seem to point specifically to anything in it to bolster their claim of merit. I recommend \\"Time Out of Mind\\" to all of Douglass Adams's \\"electric monks\\", those with a desperate desire to believe anything anybody tells them about anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"This CD is no good. I thought I would like it because I'm really into people like Niel Young, Emmylou Harris and Lucinda Williams.

I've been through a lot as a fan, from the brilliant Sixties to the mostly dead Eighties to the stunning release of \\"Love and Theft\\" last year. Of all the things I've witnessed in his career, the acclaim \\"Time Out of Mind\\" has gotten is the most puzzling.I don't like this album. I've listened to it many times trying to let it grow on me, but it won't. It's so dreary, monotonous and suffocated that it is a chore to listen to. None of the songs run in my head and compel me to play them again and again as do the masterpieces on \\"Love and Theft.\\" Yet it is praised to the skies.Sorry, I just don't get it. Even Dylan himself has said that he couldn't get what he wanted while making this record. It's pretty obvious he's surprised that people like it; he doesn't.Skip right over this one to \\"L&T\\" if you're looking for Dylan's real comeback album. Or get the one before it, \\"World Gone Wrong,\\" another Dylan album with some real heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"AS IF HIS VOICE ISNT HORRIBLE ENOUGH","review":"...HE HAS TO SHOW HIS ''THIS IS WHAT DEATH LOOKS LIKE'' FACE ON THE COVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! bob is no musical genius (no ''O'' in genius,people !!!!!!!!) but he is a genius exploiter.he duped a generation of hippies into believing his junk.its been said before,put some other drunk guys name on any of bobs cds and not one person would buy it.except for tom waits but that goes without saying."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY HEARTS IN THE HIGHLANDS, BABY.......","review":"I bought this in '97 on cassette, I had a long bus trip ahead from Vermont and needed something new to pass the time. I had heard that Dylan had just come out with his best in years.My initial reaction was: Is Dylan singing through a treche?Needless to say the sound very quickly grew on me and this is one of Dylans spookiest sounding albums for sure.LOVE SICK is crazy good, so spooky, I love the fact that they put him in that Victorias Secret commercial. Dylan is SO COOL! DIRT ROAD BLUES is also very cool, MILLION MILES, NOT DARK YET, TILL I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU, COLD IRONS BOUND and especially the sixteen minute ramble that tickles the god damned brain stem HIGHLANDS are my favorites here. Everything is great though, I really enjoy the feel of this album. SOLID WORK.Get LOVE AND THEFT his 2001 follow up too, its completley different yet is also amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His Dark Masterpiece","review":"Bob Dylan's comeback album has some of the best lyrics in a long time. This is probably some of the saddest music to listen to also. These songs seem they could be from BOTT or Desire. Plus some of the songs our epics including over long classic Highlands. Favorites include Standing In The Doorway, Tryin' To Get To Heaven, Not Dark Yet, Make You Feel My Love, and Highlands. Highly Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The world weary Mr Dylan - sounding great.","review":"This album sees Mr Dylan in a melancholic mood (nothing unusual here)with a strong blues presence permeating the entire album. Wonderful guitar laden melodies. Lyrically strong and wistful tales here. The whole album just goes on to illustrate that Dylan is still THE man both as a lyricist and musician. All tracks are gems with my personal favourites being Lovesick, Not Dark Yet, Trying to Get to Heaven and Standing in the Doorway.Dylan fans will no doubt already have this album. New Dylan listeners should not hesitate in grabbing this one.Thank you Mr Dylan."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album for the times","review":"This is Dylans best since \\"Blonde on blonde\\", the first track \\"love sick\\" finds that thin wild mercury sound that only Dylan can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan's Masterpiece","review":"During his lengthy career, Bob Dylan has produced four masterpieces: Highway 61 Revisted, Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks, and this one. Time Out of Mind is my third favorite Dylan album, behind Blood on the Tracks and Highway 61.On this album, there are four unforgettable songs: \\"Standing in the Doorway,\\" \\"Trying to Get to Heaven,\\" \\"Not Dark Yet\\" and \\"Highlands.\\" These four songs alone make this album a masterpiece.This album is not top 40 pop music. It is also not like Dylan's earlier work. It is something entirely different, but that's the wonderful thing about Dylan -- he keeps on reinventing himself in new and magical ways. Please give this album a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless","review":"having just revisited this album recently, I am amazed at the voice, poetry, and instrumentation (that \\"live\\" recording that Dyan insisted upon...with all instruments going and mikes hanging from the ceiling; the \\"old fashioned way\\") that breathes such an incredibly unique sound.Can you hear anything like this anywhere else? That was my driving thought...is there anything like this, anywhere today?In conclusion (this is short)...I think that Time Out of Mind rivals anything that Dylan has ever done. I don't know if he could give more than he does on \\"Standing in the Doorway\\", \\"Not Dark Yet\\", and \\"Highlands\\", which sounds so much like he has his heart in eternity.Dylan is so much more self revelatory than he is credited with.this album is a work of genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time out of Mind review","review":"As is typical with Dylan,if there is at least one or two really good selections on the album it is worth it.....my two favorites are \\"It's not dark yet\\" and \\"Standing in the Doorway\\".

Time Out of Mind is the album that could have been if Bob Dylan would have been the major contributor in its production. Having said this, the talent of Bob Dylan comes through in spite of the hypnotic weavings of Mr. Lanois and \\"Trying To Get To Heaven\\" is one of the best train song analogies both lyricly and musically I have ever heard. Bob Dylan is a well traveled man, both personally and artistically. His voice and experience are part of the American landscape and that is what makes his singing so rich, seasoned, pure, truthful, and more, and more, and more... What an awesome album this could have been, only to have been followed by \\"Love and Theft.\\" Remarkable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glass Of Razor Blades","review":"God! Who the heck ripped his heart out? But that's the beauty of Dylan on this album. Everyone can sympathize in one way or another. Great music, and the usual prophetic lyrics. Ear candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MASTER STORYTELLER RETURNS IN FINE FORM","review":"Bob Dylan is easily the most influential rock/folk star of this century and his music will never die. On \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" Mr. Dylan explores love, loss, death and life in songs like \\"Love Sick\\", \\"Million Miles\\", \\"Not Dark Yet\\" and the magnificent, sixteen minutes long epic \\"Highlands\\". Each song is beautifully arranged by veteran producer Daniel Lanois and Dylan's rock scarred voice sounds soothing and spooky.It is a phenomnal CD by a musical genius and a legendary hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively 4th Rate","review":"It takes a fair bit of critical contortionism to declare this any kind of masterwork, especially considering it comes from a man with a few genuine classics under his belt. Despite popular opinion, Dylan's lyrics here are uniformly horrid, travelling the short distance between trite and awkward with less flourish than your garden-variety Hallmark card. Melodically the songs are indistinguishable from one another, with Dylan's cracked honk blending into the thick soup of Daniel Lanois' ponderous soundscape until it sounds like one of Brian Eno's ambient albums as mewled by a goat. I'd actually prefer the goat. Do Dylan a favor and pick up a copy of \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" or \\"The Basement Tapes\\" or even \\"Love and Theft\\" instead of this over-praised steamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment","review":"This album is like an old man's version of Love Gone Wrong. I found the arrangements on this album so bad that I couldn't even listen to the words.Dylan should have gone back to his roots and listened to the blues artists from the Mississippi Delta that influenced his original pre Vietnam Greenwich styles.This is an atrocoious attempt at doing blues without a blues harp. At least I couldn't discern one or a saxaphone. It sounded like the guiter playing was stuck in the same cord the whole album, a listless put me to sleep melody. I discerened an ocassional attempt to bring out some blues chords from the piano but way to weak.I have been a Dylan fan for 40 years and this is one album that deserves to gather dust. If I want blues I will stay with Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Jimmy Weatherspoon, Bo Diddley Little Walker, John Mayall and CCR.This album showed his age and in may opinion would make for background music at the Saturday night bridge fest in a Nursing Home.Yuk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Out Of Mind","review":"This album is a dirge. And a mess. The Academy was out of their minds to award it a Grammy. If you want to hear the power and brilliance of Dylan, PLEASE forego this one and skip to his 60's and 70's work. This is one of the artists poorer efforts, and the fact that it has garnered such accolades is a testament to the pitiable state of current day music.

After a short while (less than a year), nothing worked on either lamp ~ neither the light nor the operating train. Made of pure, cheap plastic with parts that probably burn through (I purposely used low wattage lights to make sure the lamps didn't overheat but they still burned out WAY TOO SOON). BUYER BEWARE unless you have the tools and know-how to carefully break open plastic components & rewire/replace with lamp parts that will actually last. This is not a knock against these Amazon sellers; the product itself looks sharp but is poorly contructed due to cheap, electrical parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this one a miss","review":"Despite the fact that this lamp looks solid and classic (looks like a real wooden base in the photo with a glass shade), it is actually 100% plastic. We have had it for 7 months and I would not buy it again, nor would I recommend it to anyone with children. The lamp makes a low crackling sound for several minutes after we shut it off, like it settling down after getting too hot (though the bulb we use is the wattage specified by the manufacturer). I never feel very safe when this thing is on, and certainly won't ever leave it unattended or on for too long.

The gasket fit the lid of my pressure cooker almost perfectly. I say almost because when I first placed it inside the lid there was what seemed to be a definite excess of gasket material that I thought would likely cause problems. However when the cooker built up pressure for testing (15 lbs) it held that pressure for 30 minutes with no leaks as the excess material was forced out around, and against the canner, and lid.I gave it 4 stars because I've no idea how many years, or uses I may, or may not get out of it.

The 'Way to Eden' makes the mistake of trying to be trendy, and so dates badly. What the real problem is though is that it makes the Enterprise crew seem to be the disapproving establishment, especially of all people Captain Kirk. 'Requiem for Methuselah' is at heart a reasonable story with the assertion that one man could be responsible for the work of Da Vinci, Brahms and others. What it completely fails to do is have any appreciation for Kirk's relationships with women. Threre is no way any woman would have Kirk obsessed to the point he would fight for her, he is far to full of his own importance for that. This effectively trashes any credibility that the story would have had because this is the crux of the whole episode.

Well, I lost that tape a couple years later in 1999 when I threw away my tape player. Then comes 2002, the album and I reunite with all those catchy songs. There is not one on there that I don't like. Each song has catchy lyrics and great music. And beautiful voices. A variety of slow songs, fast paced songs, some that I wanna dance to even!

It is hard to tell by the sample, too.The best part of the book is the intro, where Lubkemann discusses knife selection.His other book, The Little Book of Whittling, is much better.I may try his other book, the one with 'Big' in the title, as it appears one can at least make old-fashioned country games with directions in that book.Chris: if you read this, please write another book with nothing but *practical* projects. You'll make a million bucks.I wouldn't buy this one again, but it might be good for woman whittlers or even men who are making gifts for women.

It follows him from his childhood to his late middle age. This is done with the authors typical style of hack and slash sorcery.Not one of Gemmel's best but not his worst either the author always had a tendency in his longer books to have characters who were formerly a friend of the main character \\"go bad\\" for a poorly defined reason that is never fleshed out. Reversely bad characters \\"go good\\" for equally poorly defined reasons. He can always be relied on for a good battle scene so consequently its not really noticeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Gemmell really makes the ancient world come alive. His characters are vibrant, realistic, and powerfully well written. His battle scenes are first rate and his plot is rich, turbulent, and fantastically entertaining.

There was a lot of action, but not much insight as to what the characters were thinking or why they did what they did, or frankly, why I should care. Some graphically described sex scenes thrown in (not well-written or interesting either) which juxtaposed with the rest of the book and its theme. None of the characters were really likable or interesting, in my opinion, either. Just when I was starting to get into a character, two more were added, until there were too many to keep track of or want to. Perhaps it would have been better experienced reading and not on tape.

Big parts of information were left out until the end and it was hard to feel the emotion needed to really get in touch with the film. The acting seemed too artificial probably because the characters had not really gotten to play opposite one another very often except for Melanie's and Patrick's characters. It just didn't allow your feelings to build and grow. It just went from one conflict to another, until it just seemed to far-fetched. I really do like all the actors, Melanie Griffith, Patrick Swayze, even the young boy who played their son, loved him in Sweet Jane!

Yet while he skewers the collectivists, he also points out that some Libertarian positions are overly simplistic. His book helps you think, even when you have reservations about a few of his positions.The book has 4 parts. Part 1 is devoted to defending Human Rights in property. Part 2 is devoted to ideas for reducing the influence of goverment. The chapter \\"Buckshot for a Socialist Friend\\" is precious.

Treemonisha waited 60 years for its first professional performance, by Houston Grand Opera in 1975. Apparently it's going to have to wait another 60 years for proper recognition of its remakrable music. And the music _is_ the thing. Sure, the plot is simplistic, the characters are two-dimensional... but then that's true of many an opera, yes? The music, the music. Gunther Schuller's vivid period orchestration provides a solid foundation for a fine group of singers and an outstanding chorus. What is alas necessarily msising from the CD is the dancing. Rags were _dance_ music. And what carried the HGO production from the fine to the sublime was the dancing. A commercial video of the original HGO production was released on Sony which caught a great deal of the celebratory energy released by the dancers. --Douglas Milburn"},{"rating":"2","title":"All that Joplin wanted was for it to be recognised","review":"Throughout Joplin's short 49 year long life, all he wanted to do was put forward the seriousness of ragtime, such an effect was achieved in his great ragtime opera \\"Treemonisha\\", but it was never recognised during his lifetime. With the re-emergence of ragtime in the 1970's Joplin's music and its sometimes elusive melancholic power came through, inspiring this great recording. Carmen Balthrop and Betty Allen are superb, and the recording from the orchestra is first class. Joplin's goal on writing this opera was to mix ragtime with opera to show that it could be just as \\"serious\\" as others. It is fair to say that Joplin's attempt, as a ragtime writer and not an opera writer is impressive and admirable, just as noone would expect an opera master like Puccini or Verdi to write ragtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"UN BARBERO DE PRIMERA CATEGORIA","review":"Inexplicable como muchos aficionados a la m��sica encuentran esta gran versi��n deficiente, por que no les gusta como lo hace Placido Domingo.

There are few excellent recordings of Barber out there, and this definitely passes as a good one. While there are those who find fault with Battle's light vocals, none can deny that her's is one of the most beautiful soprano voices ever recorded. Yes, the role of Rosina was written for a mezzo, however, the part is so desirable that it is far from rare to see it performed by a soprano rather than a mezzo, and Battle does it very well. While Figaro is not Domingo's best role, his deep and rich tenor voice is unusually suited to singing the lighter baritone part.(Domingo studied to be a baritone as a young man before making the transition to tenor.) I may be inclined to agree that the role of Figaro is somewhat \\"beneath\\" this great tenor artist, however I like just about anything Domingo sings. Gallo's Bartolo is absolutely superb. By far the best I have ever seen or heard. Lopardo's Count Almaviva is also excellent. You could do worse than this Barber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Domingo's Barber","review":"Despite its excellent sound and the enthusiastic, well-paced playing of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, this is a dissapointing release. Lopardo very much excepted, the singers cannot cope with the considerable demands of authentic belcanto style and deliver Rossini's showy, florid tunes in a bald, literal way (Battle and Domingo are the major offenders). Although the recitatives are slightly pruned, the text is almost complete and even includes and extra aria for Rosina (borrowed from Semiramide). Recommended for those who like Rossini to sound like Donizetti or Verdi. Others beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rossini: Il barbiere di Siviglia","review":"Rossini: Il barbiere di Siviglia is a 1992 Deutsche Grammophon recording starring Pacido Domingo in the role as Figaro in this comic opera in two acts.

It should be noted that this book is not intended as an introduction. If you don't know who the Hittites are you will be hard-pressed to understand them afterward, although you would be able to explain their fall. This book is basically an argument about the cause of the collapse. His argument is compelling but he doesn't skip on the other theories just because they disagree with him. While he points out their various flaws he gives them a chapter each to give their points of view. At no point does he seem pretentious and he's never boring. Although he pushes his views he doesn't deny the others their points. So if you want to understand how the Bronze Age ended this is an excellent book to read.

Sadly, at first the religious aspect detracted from a very good storyline. As the book goes on, however, the religious perspective gets out of hand.For example, one of the characters is accused of adultery by his wife and thrown out of the house. Despite the fact that he has not committed adultery and has no intention of doing so, despite temptation and opportunity, his wife (and others) believe that he has. Why? Because he thought about it for a minute. His thinking was, 1) it would be nice 2) it would ruin my marriage 3) I love my wife too much to even seriously consider this. To me, that's not adultery.As the book goes on, the religious aspect takes over the majority of the story. A real turnoff for me.

Blackstock pulls no punches as she shows us Christians and non-Christians living out their lives, \\"warts and all.\\" It's not just a mystery that has been \\"christianized\\" with \\"god-words,\\" it is an look at believable characters who struggle with their faith, yet perservere. Bad things do happen to Christians, yet the promise of Romans 8:28 is evident throughout the book. If, like me, you are used to Patricia Cornwell novels, you will find that Blackstock is not as developed, but her characters still have a depth that makes them believable. I approached the novel with a bit of skepticism because I'm used to the likes of Cornwell; however, I came away with my spirit lifted in a way that I've never gotten from secular mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish it","review":"I was intrigued by the title and the synopsis and, what the heck, it was free so I grabbed this book. I found the characters to have no personality whatsoever and couldn't buy into the marriage problems of Mark and is unreasonable wife. But, the reason I quit the book before finishing was frustration with the way the crimes and investigations were handled by the writer.If you are portending to write about crime and law enforcement, please try to learn SOMETHING about either. I am a police officer and I was so incredibly distracted by the inaccuracies regarding how the investigation was being handled. As a murder mystery goes, it almost seems as if the murders were an afterthought so that the publishers had something to write in the book description. The murders were kind of forgotten about for a period while we took a break to discuss God, faith, marriages, break-ups...The characters were flat and there was no drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"duped by all the stars...am I missing something?","review":"I didn't read the synopsis first as the title interested me enough, plus it was free, so I can't complain.At first I didn't realize it was a Christian novel, but once I started I committed to finishing even if it was torture part of the way.Halfway through I was wondering how the title even fit into this novel as I couldn't make any connection until almost the very end.Too much marriage drama, and not enough real character and plot development in my opinion.Not understanding why all the high ratings...it was o.k."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for improvement","review":"The plot was appealing, but unfortunately, there were artistical flaws in the writing. The dialogue was awkward and many times unnecessary for moving the plot along. It was rife with religious references that at times seemed to be the author's only motivation for writing the book.

The plot was an OK idea, but I could not get into the characters at all, as there was no background and no information to get a feel for them. The Christian development of the characters was totally self-serving and I would think serious Christians would be insulted by characters who are stupid and use their religion to justify their dumb actions.

I started the Newpointe 911 series and have not been able to put them down. The day I get finished with a book, I have to get the next one. Private Justice was very good, and I was lead to believe a certain character was the killer throughout the book and found out that I was wrong.

Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite!","review":"I've been using this product for years and get tired of having to go to the mall to get it. They finally started selling it at Target, but they never have this size or they're out of stock. The price is also much better here at Amazon. I love it because my hair is blonde, straight and baby fine. This hair spray holds my hair but without feelint like I have a helmet on my head. No residue left over and if I get home from work or a night out, can just run a bruch through my hair and it's back to super soft."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best hair spray ever!","review":"This is the best hairspray I've ever used! It goes on with a fine mist, that dries fast, so you can shape you hair, then spray again to set it. It's not stiff, yet the hold is amazing and I have very hard to hold baby fine hair. It's not cheap, but once I tried it, I can't live without it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT A HAIR OUT OF PLACE !","review":"I've just tossed out those cans of hairspray that held my hair in the Texas winds - they held it so tight that it looked like a helmet. I didn't know there was an alternative until I found Sheer Hold Hairspray from Frederic Fekkai.This hairspray holds the style without setting it in concrete. It's a light weight spray, sheer, leaving hair shiny. You can spray a little for just a gentle hold or more for a lasting hold. If my hair is tossed about in the wind, after using Sheer Hold it can quickly be restyled and there it stays. With other sprays you didn't dare put a comb to it!The can has a very small nozzle which makes it easy to shape and control however you wish without weighing down hair.A neat trick is to use a round brush on hair, spray Sheer Hold on it, and then apply heat with your hair dryer. Presto! Added bounce.The addition of Avocado Oil serves to protect hair and add luster. At last, hair that's brushable and touchable even in a mini Texas twister."},{"rating":"1","title":"sent the wrong hairspray","review":"I was sent the sheer hold hairsprayversatile hold and shine with avocado oilI used it a couple of times and realized I was allergic to it.

I have very fine, straight hair and needed a product that would hold the style without damaging my hair. I had gotten a sample of their glossing gel and loved it so I decided to splurge on the hairspray.PROS: smells nice, does not \\"build up\\"CONS: the price!!! NOT worth it!!! Does not hold my hair style more than a few minutes and I was constantly using more and more hoping it would!!! I have found three other brands that are half the price, do not contribute to a build-up and actually hold my hair.It's probably ok for someone with thicker hair who feels it is ok to spend this much on a hair spray only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates of the Caribbean","review":"I purchased this ship for my nine year old grandson last year for Christmas.

Customs and traditions dismissed by the young man are embraced new. Words and phrases not heard for thirty years cause a shiver of recognition. In an uncertain world we look backwards for the certainties of our youth. In a fractured society, we realise that we are not, in fact, isolated individuals but an amalgam of our family and the place we were born. In short, we feel a need to belong.Bryan Gallagher's book is a doorway to the past. Its stories display a deep understanding of his people and a cheerful harmony with them. It reminds us, in our headlong heedless rush through modern life, to place value on the things that make us who we are."},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute FAVORITE","review":"That's pretty hard to say, I'm a pretty tough fantasy critic.

From the opening scene it wraps you in magic and mystery.The plot has more twists and turns then a pretzel. Yet the book is easy to follow and makes perfect sense. Everything that happens couldn't possibly have happened any other way.The finale left me hanging out for the second book in the trilogy. Having read book 2 I can honestly say it won't disappoint anyone who likes this oneThis book is an absolute must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a book, but a masterpiece. Honestly!","review":"Well, I've never wrote a review before, but this time I had to do it. This book hooked me from the start, the \\"world\\" is so huge and rich that you never know when another surprise or character will show up.

This first book of the series has made me look forward to the rest of the series and her new book coming out very soon!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly interesting, somewhat amateurish though","review":"I found this book to be mildly interesting; it held my attention more or less long enough for me to finish it. The detailed description of witchcraft was good, I thought, and there were some interesting touches like the skeelie woman who held Isabeau captive in her hut, but honestly, I've seen Celtic mythology done so many times before it's just not that new anymore. I did feel a certain lack of depth to the characters, and there were some amateurish touches--for example, the entire book being written in dialect was, I think, the mark of a new author and I felt the torture scene was somewhat unskillfully handled. It's good enough light fiction; if I want something more serious, I'll read Stephen R. Donaldson or Michelle West's Sun Sword books (Broken Crown, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I lost interest after about two days...","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend, who had nothing but good things to say about it... I had only time to read it in the evenings, after work and before I had to go to bed... and it just didn't hold my interest. Plus, I didn't care for the decidedly pagan atmosphere of the world the book was set in... but that's my problem, not the author's. That's all I can really say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic and preachy","review":"While the characters aren't completely unlikable, their adventures lack depth.

To add to this, the book reads like a morality play Wiccan style."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have read recently","review":"The author does not seem to be able to develop character or plot in a way that engages one's interest. The book is poorly written and to be frank, I would not buy it again. I have only given the book one star because if I do not do so the computer will not accept the review. The book does not merit even half a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"The subject matter in this book is Xrated for violence.","review":"This book is poorly written, moving leadenly and predictably along. There are several pages of detailed and graphically described mutilation and torture of a young girl and boy with sexual violation added gratuatously. This is not a book to stumble across as a good read because the images may sicken you for days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we speaking the same English?","review":"I've read thousand of fantasy novels, but this series is definitely one to avoid. The author has fallen in love with a handful of old English words and she uses them ad nauseum. I think I've read the word ken about 3000 times and there isn't a Ken character in the book. If you love the words ken, laird, och, ye, and bairn then by all means buy this series. Kate Forsyth uses them liberally even though they went out of use centuries ago. The multiple characters have as much depth as a pancake. I'm not sure who we're supposed to be rooting for here. You can almost read the first and last chapter of each book and just skip everything in between. Nothing happens that you'll need to know for the next book. I've been rooting for the adversaries in this whole series. If they could wipe out all these characters maybe the new cast would be more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Flutey","review":"I like this cd, especially the Patrice Rushen and Beyonce covers.

This is not the start of my carrier, so my needs are a bit more advance. But, the book will not offer you the sort of information that you really need.

The music was beautiful. The second cd, although not quite as good, was still very nice. The melody was still there, the beat was still good, and you could sit back and enjoy. I'm sad to say that the 3rd album seems awful to me. The only song i really liked was the 'media luna'. The voices were beautiful, espeically the woman's. The other songs were pretty lame. No beat, no melody, nothing to draw the listener in.

My only critique is that for those unfamiliar with the snake style, the DVD lacks a step-by-step breakdown of how to execute each phase of the form. Some of the techniques and postures are rather complicated, and may require extra time and patience in order to be successfully digested.

Was put on thyroid medication which can cause bone loss, so I decided to try to counter balance with these. Another plus that most people don't realize is that calcium will help you get a good night's sleep, sort of like that warm glass of milk. Two an hour or two before bed and you'll sleep like a baby! (At least a nice quiet baby who actually sleeps through the night and doesn't wake up screaming every two hours.) If you're looking for calcium, give this one a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here Comes The Past Again","review":"Wow. That's all I can say. This book has instantly become one of my top picks. The opening lines of the first chapter read like a novel. Jeffers does an amazing job of taking you back to that world and filling in some of the blanks. Though I am still absorbing much of the book, and have been using it in M.Div papers and teaching scripts, I think the best section in the whole deal is on Greco-Roman education and the existence of house associations, burial, business and other associations, which were avenues for the church to legal \\"be\\" Christians without necessarily proclaiming their new religion. What a page turner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Load!","review":"This book contains 1/4 fact, 1/4 repetition of those facts, 1/2 off base, unsubstantiated opinion.

I can't say that I am awe-struck, but I am not disappointed.This double CD has a great collection of Ravel's work, as you can see. My only complaint is the version of Le Tombeau de Couperin. At times it was as though the orchestra had trouble keeping up with Mr. Ozawa. Ravel liked to conduct his music at a breakneck pace, but I'm certain that he would have slowed down if he were extending beyond their limits. Other conductors that have done better versions of this piece are Andre Previn and Charles Dutoit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Ravel","review":"To me, this is precisely how Ravel would have envisioned his music sounding. Ozawa remains objective enough with his interpretations that I am not left feeling like I'm listening to Ozawa's Ravel, but rather simply Ravel. The Boston Symphony is at the top of its form throughout all the performances. Having played for as long as they had previously under Charles Munch they have a nicely appropriate French sound for the music, but with a complementary American roundness to the sound to go with it. The excellent sound of the Boston Symphony Hall is well known enough as to not need comment. As far as I'm concerned, I'll not be needing another recording of this music. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Landscapes","review":"Another Wm. Powell book for my granddaughter. Again his instruction is clear and very easy to follow.

As other reviewers have said, this is not for preschool kids. Each day includes a short story with an illustration and a couple of questions.

If you have school-aged children, you won't regret this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bedtime Bible Story Book","review":"I did not like the pictures and illustrations.

I read a page or two to my 5 year old every night. The stories are a page or less so they do not overwhelm her. I think they are a little too condensed at times though. If you are looking for a brief over view of the bible these stories are good. I actually use the book as a way to create discussion about the story. After we read the story and answer the questions I restate the story in my own words so that I can fill in the blanks.My 10 year old overheard me reading to her sister and now asks for us to wait on her so she can listen also. The questions at the end of each story are great. My oldest daughter patiently waits for her little sister to answer the questions and loves it when her little sister does not remember so she can tell me. They are a great way to reinforce the story.It is a great teaching tool and I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read reviews","review":"I was dissapointed with the book when I got it. I have seen similar books at the dollar tree for $1, so I feel like I let myself be took advantage of. I also \\"assumed\\" that since it has a bright front cover it would also have bright pictures inside for my 3 year old to look at as we read the book. What I found was poor quality paper with black and white print and only a few black and white pictues. I will not send it back because I have already paid shipping once and wont do it twice. I will still read the books to my kids, but definitely not what I would have chosen if I had of picked it up and looked at it in person."},{"rating":"1","title":"B&W limited illustrations","review":"I purchased this Bible for my 8 year old daughter. I was hoping for an illustrated, easy-to-read version of the stories in the Bible. Maybe I was reading too much into the description and reviews. The type is larger ... fine. The illustrations are few and ONLY B&W drawings!!! No interesting or colorful illustrations or photos. So, in summary, if you are looking for a paperback Bible with a few illustrations and larger type, then this may be for you. But, it you are looking for color and interesting pictures to go with Bible stories, you may want to choose another version."},{"rating":"1","title":"something is really \\"not quite right\\"","review":"I agree with one of the other reviewers, most of the reviews here have to be about another book. I got this book with high hopes and much anticipation, however, there were some \\"issues\\" with the content. I'm not sure what version of the Bible these stories are derived from, but there is something wrong with almost every story. At first, I thought that I was just being a little nit-picky but as the days progressed the inconsistencies only got worse. I'm not talking about just some added dialogue to \\"fluff\\" the stories for children, but facts and story lines were completely off (not to mention weird). In the end you will spend about 3 min reading the text and fifteen trying to explain to your kids \\"what the fruit\\" you just read. If you value your children's Biblical foundation at all, You REALLY want to take advantage of Amazon's peek feature and read through the first five or six chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"One paragraph stories","review":"It isn't what I expected. The stories are mostly one paragraph and a picture. It's not horrible or anything, but the stories feel way too short to me. It's kind of like reading only the headlines on the news.

I had been reading from this book for years.There area over 100 illustrations in this book, but they are not colored. Each Bible story is one page or less. Of course, there are 365 stories--one for each day. There is not enough color and too many words for preschoolers; however, it is perfect for grade-schoolers.The Bible reference is at the top of each page. At the bottom of each page is a question about the story.I have read a few children's Bible stories that were slanted toward a certain denomination's beliefs or practices. This book is nondenominational It is strictly Biblical. This is a great way for parents to incorporate religion at home. The words are simple enough for beginning readers to sound out. \\"365 Read-Aloud Bedtime Bible Stories\\" is a great book for your grade-schooler.Book received free of charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was a bit disappointed in this.

Each story is a page long with two questions at the bottom. The questions are usually simple, but help to reinforece the story. I can also see why others have said this would be a good book for adults wanting to learn about Christianity.I don't know if I would recommend this book as an introductory to Christianity, but for a new Christian trying to understand the Bible this would be a great book. Many new Christians have felt intimidated going to church and seeing others who seem to know all the Bible stories by heart. This book can be a quick introduction to the stories. But I would not recommend this to be your only source. Get an easy translation of the Bible and rad along with these stories and that will be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bible stories stripped to the bone and dried","review":"Low quality paper and line drawings aside, there is something a little too \\"stripped down\\" about this book. The stories are told so briefly and matter of factly, and so much 'feel' is left out that the Old Testament comes off being a story about a brutal, arbitrary God ruling over a bunch of primitive tribes.

I see other reviews commenting on the tightness of the ankles but the waist band is nothing more than a small bit of elastic string that literally digs into the top of my hips and stomach while I run.For my money, Target makes a pair of cold weather insulated tights in their C9 line that are fantastic.

I ordered medium and they fit fine but they could and should be a lot tighter on me so I'm ordering a small now too.The ends are tight in a good way not uncomfortable at all , they pucker a little at the end as there's a bit of extra material so if your a few inches taller than me they will be perfect too.They are very warm and cosy the material is thicker than I thought . I don't rate these as highly as Brooks tights I have but price wise they are good value and will most definatly keep you warm , not the most flattering as waist band is very high but I think if mine fit tighter they could be just fine in the fashion steaks also :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great running tight","review":"When I first got these, I was really worried about the tightness around the ankles. I have relatively small ankles and the leg opening still felt tight. HOWEVER... I really wanted these to work and was able to stretch the opening out a little bit. Also, I found that layering them over socks made my ankles even more comfortable. I've had these for several months now and would definitely buy them again when/if they wear out (I've been running in these approx 35mi/week and they are holding up really well). The warmth they provide is surprising, given the fact that they seem so thin. The only downside, no pockets... but then again, running tights don't usually have pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these","review":"These are perfect! They keep me warm and aren't bulky!

They are not super loose, but they are not like my other compression tights. A size larger than I normally wear and they are like regular sports tights.Second, I would definitely recommend layering them under sweatpants or warm ups if your temps hover at around 0F. They are warm, but not super warm for that weather. I'm sure once Spring comes, they'll be fine for running and staying warm in temps around freezing.I appreciate the extra elastic around the ankle. They don't hike up and they keep the cold air from coming in at my ankles.The only addition I would make is to add a small pocket. My other compression tights, from another company, have a zippered pocket at the back which is perfect for a house key."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia galore...","review":"I grew up reading these and the possibility to ready them again is awesome.

(No one else in the class liked it anyway.) I always wanted magic to be real, and I read voraciously about children for whom it was. Most of them gave up witchcraft by the end of the book.I can honestly say this is the first book, at the ripe old age of eight, that made me actually consider being a witch. I played at being Alison. I had garlic bulbs in my attic because of her. Years later, I can blame my \\"conversion\\" to Wicca on that same, weathered, torn copy I pilfered all those years ago, and that graces my bookshelf now, along with other, less fictional books on witchcraft. Books that made you who you are, you don't throw away. Now, if only Hildick didn't keep forgetting that Alison was only 12, I'd give it a full four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all religions!","review":"I borrowed this book from my sister one summer vacation and never gave it back. I have to say it's right up there with Watership Down, Island of the Blue Dolphins, Wrinkle in Time and The Great Brain (another underappreciated book) for pure enjoyment for kids and adults alike. I didn't become a witch but truly related to Allison's quest to assuage her summer confinement and her passion for ceremony and mystery. The author's style is wittier and more sophisticated than most preteen stories and I appreciate the humor to this day. I hope people can get past the \\"witch\\" and enjoy this story for what it is, a charming, hilarious account of the mishaps and \\"miracles\\" of this imaginative and exasperating girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A GREAT IDEA","review":"Most of the time you can't get all the nuances in the political back and forth that sometimes passes for debate on television. This book is a printed version of the debate. it is both far more absorbing, and it captures some of the details that televison overlooks. Not only have I enjoyed this book, but I find the resource lists at the end of each chapter useful. But I'll admit, it hasn't changed my mind about anything. I pikced up this book because I am a liberal Malveaux fan, and I remain so. I heard Malveaux and Perry on NPR, though, and I was intrigued by Ms. Perry, and by Dr. Malveaux's assertion that we on the left need to know what (and how) the enemy is thinking. This is absorbing, thought-provoking, useful. The collaboration is a great idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Superficial","review":"This book had no substance behind. Information was thrown out as fact with no supporting evidence (on both sides), e.g., the wage comparisons -- where did this data come from?, what groups were studied?, etc.I am not sure how Julianne Malveaux got her PhD. Her writing is awful. She has no concept of personal responsibility. I am pro-choice but her argument for it is awful!!!!! Nothing about when a baby can be considered an actual person, etc.. I really am not sure how she got her Ph.D. -- by her accounts it may be through affirmative action but this is the fault with affirmative action -- it makes one question a persons true quilifications.

Christos also hates his cousin Alex so already he and Becca have lots in common and the book should have been a great read right? Wrong. After the first few chapters it just goes down hill. Becca can't keep her hands of Christos and she gets pregnant. He more or less forces her to marry him and the woman is annoying. I like female characters in the book to have a voice and back bone but Becca turns from a smart school teacher into an argumentative ass!! And that's putting it mildly. I didn't care for this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Very Well","review":"I used to have another mask from this company, which worked fairly well but had cheap elastic/velcro. The elastic band on this is much higher quality, and the Velcro closure is in a nice position on the side, so it doesn't create a lump on the back of my head. I love the carved out space for my eyes, so the mask doesn't press at all on them while I sleep.I only gave 4 stars for 2 reasons: 1) while the elastic is stiffer than the old mask, it still slips a bit, causing shifting while I sleep, and 2) the nose guard that blocks light presses a little too hard on my nose, so I have to shift the mask up for comfort, allowing in a slight amount of light. Still, the issues are very minor. This is the best mask I've ever used, and I'm quite happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too stiff","review":"Although the light blocking is adequate if the mask is perfectly positioned on your face, the mask is too stiff. Therefore, when you turn onto your side, the whole mask shifts sideways as it's pushed up by your pillow, letting in light. It's also uncomfortably firm for side or stomach sleeping. Where this mask would excel would be if you were trying to sleep on an airplane, facing forward in your seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"It looks good but it's not. Yes it's true that it has holes where your eyes go, so there is no pressure around your eyes, but as a mask it's not flexible at all. It's only good when you sleep on your back and don't move at all the whole night. As you turn around and sleep on the side the mask will be pushed off of your face and if you place it back on it, it won't stay and it'll be inconvenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Essentials Escape Sleep Mask","review":"Cuts out all light and is very comfortable on my face. It received 4 stars and not because it does retain heat and gets warm. The warm face is very acceptable and I would buy this again if I needed to. This was bought when I worked nights and slept during the day. No worries about letting light in the windows and creating a dark room with these on. My wife liked them because she could still have light in the bed room if she needed to get anything while I slept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"I've been using these for the past three nights and there won't be a fourth. I actually never made it through a full night with them on. They do a good job of blocking light but not great. The rigidity of material allows light to enter around the nose, although it's minimal. However, the comfort factor is terrible and if you sleep on your side forget it. I would say these are slightly more comfortable than swim goggles with the bulky feel of ski goggles. Sorry, but I feel like a ton of the reviewers on amazon could only be working for the companies or are the product makers themselves.Amazon, please make these reviews for customers who have no ties financially or otherwise to the products. A simple disclosure certification for the reviewer would do. Otherwise they are 100% useless. That goes for competitors as well.

Blocks all light, extremely comfortable and it stays on all night.

I originally had the \\"Sweet Dreams\\" model, which I really liked, but figured I would try different one. I think that this mask is well made and probably better at blocking out ALL the light, however, I am side sleeper. I don't mind wearing this when sleeping on my side, but it is not as comfortable as the \\"Sweet Dreams\\", which is more flexible."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like wearing your ski goggles at night!","review":"Wow these are bulky, and stiff. It feels like wearing a pair of ski goggles while you are sleeping. I got these because of the good reviews and the strap connection that isn't in the back. But these really aren't that great. They let in a lot of light around the nose, they feel really stiff and they feel HUGE on my face, not heavy, but huge. I am still looking for something that beats my Bucky 40 Winks, which I am not wholly happy with . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jut as useless as I feared","review":"I had heard decent word-of-mouth reviews of this blindfold and decided to risk it despite the fact that the eye cups made it look horribly uncomfortable. I should have listened to my instincts.The top half of my face is blazing hot with it on. The cups that are supposed to prevent direct contact with the eye cut into the eye sockets themselves and are too rigid to flex with the natural movements of the head, essentially making side or stomach sleeping impossible without constant pressure on the sides of the face. Worse, the velcro strap does not attach at the back of the head like a baseball cap, but rather closer to the right ear, which results in a scratching sensation and a necessary adjustment.If you're a back sleeper, this is perfect, but it was clearly NOT designed for use in unique sleeping positions. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIGHTMARES!","review":"I should say, if I slept on my back this would get 3 stars...I give it 2 because light still creeps in through the nose area, due to the obnoxious padding around the eyes...the padding is NOT soft...just fiber fill...NOT SOFT!

Comfortable and does a good job of blocking out the light. The only thing in noticed was the velcro elastic head band could be a little longer. I have it fastened at the very end.

I've tried washing the mask which helped but did not solve the problem. I would buy a color other than blue but the only lighter color is pink so no sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sleep mask","review":"We moved to an apartment in the city, and the light from outside was disrupting my sleep (no curtains, only blinds). When I first received the mask, it was a little snug, even with the strap as loose as possible. However, it has stretched to be comfortable. It is also a very comfortable mask, as others have said, with small pockets around your eyes so you can open them without you're eyelashes hitting the mask. Also, the shape around the nose is very comfortable and doesn't dig in to the bridge of the nose at all. You can see some light around the nose, depending on how you set the strap around your head, but that is far preferable to having it hurt your nose throughout the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"Ordered a black one for myself and this pink one for the wifey. The pink one simple does not work well. The black is not much better either, however the pink color makes it worse b/c it is so light. There is definite light leakage that comes from the bottom, particularly around the nose area. Just not made that well. They should have tested this product first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible eye mask","review":"I was looking for a complete light blocking eye mask and bought this after doing some research. The mask is unbreathable, bulky, and worst of all, the velcro straps cut into my ears in the night and continually woke me up from the pain. This mask should only be used for back sleepers, not side sleepers. Bulkiness does not transition well to any movement in sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-priced and bulky","review":"Pros: If you sleep on your back, this is comfortable and the extra padding on either side of nose helps cut-down light. The strap is fastened on the side, and the velcro connection is not too thick to be uncomfortable when I sleep on my side. It has good eyelid clearance.Cons: When I sleep on my side the wide mask shifts, resulting in light coming in. It's also a bit bulky.Compared to other masks on the market, this is way over-priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Dark Sleep","review":"If you have to sleep where there is any light or noise, these Dream Essentials are your ticket to the Dream World !You might want to take an Herbal sleeping pill and 3 mg of Melatonin when you go to bed, for the best results.Buy them Now !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the Line!","review":"I've been using the Dream Essentials Escape sleeping mask for quite some time now, since January 2011, and now it's August.What I like most about this sleeping mask is that it is highly durable and well made. I've used two other sleeping masks including the Sweet Dreams countered sleeping mask from Dream Essentials which was good but not as durable or light-blocking as this mask. Durability is key for long term use, and the Escape does just that.The mask is very large though, and heavy so to say. It is quite a bit of material on the face but does the job well. The convenient adjustable straps are a plus too!The fabric is high quality and will definitely last you over time. The BEST feature is the contoured shape for the eyes which puts NO pressure on the eyes when you open them at night.

Gorden Liu's superb skills show, especailly while he trains in the pond at Wu-Tang mountain.The costumes and sets give this film a higher visual standard, putting it a different arena than other old school Kung Fu films.The fights in this film are designed beautifully, filled with plenty of traditional kung fu, incredible staff(pole) handling, and a few wire tricks as well.There's even a fight where Gorden Liu takes on a dozen spearmen while his sister is tied to his back.

This is the quintessential kung fu film, and if you ask me it should be on EVERYONE'S top 10 list. I'm not going to say it is the greatest of all time....but it very well may be. Not only do you have a dark, emotional tale starring an all-star Shaw Brothers cast, but you also have a film directed by the greatest kung fu filmmaker of all time, Lau Kar Leung (Liu Chia Liang). In \\"8 Diagram Pole Fighter\\" (Invincible Pole Fighter), he directed both the greatest pole fight of all time(Gordon Lui vs. Phillip Ko Fei) and one of the most brutal, over the top final fights in all of kung fu history.

Max von Sydow as the 'innocent' institutionalized murderer and Trevor Howard as the skeptical detective make for formidable, stoical oppononents in a slow-paced (at 106 minutes) but rewarding chess game of wits. Note, however, that the VCI pressing I received (release date 2008) is a DVD-R, which may not be compatible with all players and is prone more readily to data loss than fully mastered DVDs; and although the package specs indicate a 'letterboxed' presentation (1.85:1 aspect ratio), the print appears to be fullscreen. Video quality is decent, audio somewhat variable (exacerbated by heavy overdubbing).

I enjoyed reading about places I had just traveled to and early on I related to some of the main character's experiences. However, as the story progressed, I was disappointed with how the PCV was portrayed. I feel the book gives PCVs a bad name; we are not pedophiles, criminals or violent in our actions.

I guess can't expect too much from network TV. Trust me, this would have never come out of HBO, NEVER.Anyway, if you like dumbed down stories, here is one for you. For the rest of us adults, who may prefer, more complex characters and not so black n white story delivery, I recommend Pianist. Based on book by ghetto survivor and directed by a ghetto survivor. Plus it has superb acting from Adrian Brody...

Basically, this manga follows the school life of a few teachers and their students. Just about everyone is a little strange, it seems. There's Miss Yukari, who is somehow a teacher in spite of the fact that she's more immature than some of her students, Chiyo-chan, the ten year old genius, and Sakaki, the girl who secretly loves animals and other cute things, just to name a few.

This is as close to \\"reality-read\\" as you can get, you are actually on board with Captain Kidd roaming the high seas as he fulfills his role as a legitimately sanctioned privateer, which makes his ultimate punishment and humiliation seem all the more unjust and undeserved.Mr Harris has an easy-going style of writing that at once puts the reader at ease and other writers at a distinct disadvantage.

This could be totally avoided it they would just stitch the beads in small closed squares. Also, you will need a large microwave, and you will need to move it around a few times on high to get it all heated. It took me about 8 mins total in a 1000 watt medium sized microwave. To get most of the beads warmed.I already own one of this company's products I bought over 12 years ago, and have NO problems with the old item.

How can Houellebecq offer us the slightest hint of redemption? Maybe, in fact, I am missing the brilliant point here. Maybe I should give it five stars. Maybe he is saying, \\"Look, I despair of this trash I just wrote as much as you. I cannot stay out of the gutter. Shattered bits of philosophy jangle around in my head.

There are sentences that don't make sense in the English language that may in French. Or, I'm guessing, they are errors in the translation. There are the use of French terms with slips into American colloquialisms. E.g., calling a psychiatrist an \\"analyst\\" in one sentence, then a \\"shrink\\" in another.I think the basic idea of the book came across, but the translation was terrible. It was awkward and jumpy, which really detracted from the storyline.

However, there's a LOT going on in this book. While recounting the stories of half-brothers Bruno and Michel, the author bombards the reader with ideas; about science, sex, family, religion, philosophy, sociology and the human condition. Yet somehow the books remains an engaging and enjoyable read, never seeming dry or pretentious.Michel Houellebecq is my new favorite writer. I'd also recommend the political sex-fest of \\"Platform\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure drivel","review":"This book is juvenile nonsense disguised as a \\"challenging\\" work. The author seems to have attempted to cram into the plot whatever he has researched on the subject of religion, philosophy and physics and has wound it together with a disjointed and extremely dull litany of sexual encounters. The book describes the misadventures of two half-formed characters, each of whom elicits no sympathy or interest from the reader. And to top it off, the novel finishes with an absurd sort of science fiction. It really is awful. I only finished it to find out what all the fuss is about and am still surprised that others were so easily duped into believing that this is important literature. Finally, it's also not hilarious as others have said - just desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even misanthropy can be meretricious--","review":"and boy is it a tiresome slog through a bunch of familiar Euro-middlebrow posturing.

The characters are not that well developed though, and delving into fantasy and science fiction takes away from the reality of the description of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction at the Edge","review":"Every now and then, a novel comes along that reminds us that the novel does not have to be the genteel commodity that dominates bookstore shelves--sold like Martha Steward's towels and designed as well. Then a book like Houellebecq's Elementary Particles comes along and reminds us that the power of a work of art often resides in shaking us out of of our easy assumptions. It is, in short, not a Hollywood movie disguised as a book, not an easy read meant to be consumed in an airport, but a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"More accurately 4.5 stars","review":"The further I get from this book the better it seems. Upon completion I was pretty distraught, which I consider to be a good thing. Perhaps it has something to do with me being a molecular biologist myself.

The author might have had better luck getting his point across by standing on a street corner, railing about how much he hates women. At least, we would not have been left with this empty shell of a book. I really find it ironic that a book supposedly about the meaninglessness of modern society would be so trite and soulless. I would laugh but for the potential this so-called author MAY WELL DO IT AGAIN.

The way Michel can slide so easily from character description to his sundry ruminations on humanity- he handles his ideas exceptionally well, whether you care for them or not.

I keep seeing people say how dark it is, but their is a vast amount of pathos in this to keep the spite alive.Rarely do i find books that are hard to put down, just my sensibilities.

One is a very short science fiction idea (the last 30 pages), and the other is mostly a detailed family history.The family history portion is very French. The male characters are not very likable, and the women are very sexy. Some of the men are obsessed with sex.I can't recommend this book. I kept reading it, waiting for the science fiction payoff.

Nietzsche: our insistent personal drama. The book is profane and often has too much sexual content to be interesting, but it is laden with witty and insightful flashes of revelation pulled from within modern life. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an artistic exploration of the spiritual and emotional experience of going through the death of a culture, as many believe is now happening in Europe and the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll miss the E Street Band","review":"I bought this CD mainly for the duet version of Thunder Road that was done by Bruce and Roy. I also like the solo effort on \\"Red Headed Woman\\" Bruce had better had been singing to Patty with that song!The rest of the album makes you long for Bruce to rejoin with the E Streeters. The back up band pales in comparison and just don't have the same level of emotion or power that is necessary to turn this into what it should've been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"It was funny to have him stand up after one song, plug in the instruments, and \\"rock out\\" - but in the long run it only made the performance and this album utterly pointless. An Unplugged session might have been interesting! But instead he just turned it into an average show, hindered by the intimate setting which kind of prevented them from truely 'rocking out'.Go with his other live albums, which are far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"MTV Plugged?","review":"I'm a big fan of \\"The Boss\\", but for the life of me, can't fathom why he is unable to follow the lead of larger acts, and actually \\"unplug\\" for MTV Unplugged. This CD offers no new material that can't be found elsewhere, and is basically nothing more than a \\"live in concert\\" CD that just so happened to be filmed by MTV.This concert took place in 1992, and you know it's pretty bad when you have bands ribbing you three years later about going on MTV UNPlugged, and then having to go and plug in. It's not like Bruce doesn't know how to play acoustic guitar, because he does. I'm a big acoustic guitar fan, and for someone of Bruce's talent level, to not be able to write songs that can be played acoustically only serves to bring down the level of respect I have for his talent.Not what I would consider an essential recording, and not recommended, unless you are such a die-hard \\"Boss\\" fan that you have to own every album he puts out. Otherwise, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Live Minus the E Street Band","review":"This is the cd version of the MTV Plugged show Bruce did back in 1992 with the band he assembled to tour with him on his Human Touch/Lucky Town tour. Unfortunately, the shows from this tour are always compared to those with the E Street Band and they, of course, fall short. That being said, there are some good performances on this disk. Bruce knew what were the best songs from those two disks were and they appear here. The performances of \\"Lucky Town\\", \\"Living Proof\\", \\"I Wish I Were Blind\\" & \\"Better Days\\" are all solid and among his older songs \\"Atlantic City\\" stands out. The performance of \\"Light Of Day\\" has a tremendous amount of energy and there is some excellent guitar interplay on it. All in all, it's not the pinnacle of Bruce's career, but still fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Springsteen Grown Up","review":"I've been listening to Bruce for 25 years an enjoy just about all of his music. It is CD's like this that keep me listening. It doesn't matter if you've heard it before--he always delivers a different slant. How many Thunder Road versions are out there? This one is beautiful. Far and away the best of the slow songs here is \\"I Wish I Were Blind\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big dissapointment...","review":"I'm not a person who feeds upon nostalgy. I'm not an E-Street Band unconditional fan either. But, listening to this album, anyone can clearly conclude that these new band that Burce put togehter simply is not the right band for him.Jesus, just compare it to the recent LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY and you'll be astonished by the difference in terms of passion, power and musical ability.Anyway, Bruce had the courage to try something radically different, but it did not work out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire Magick, Blood Sorcery, or Both?","review":"Finally, an author willing to take risks! Until this book came out, there was a serious lack of information available on the actual practice of blood magick. This book is a bold compendium of magic theory, rituals, philosophy, and detailed how-to sections on the actual use of blood (like how to get it & how to use it safely). The author seems to have specifically left out any overt mention of vampires. Though I think that was done intentionally so that the book would appeal to a wider audience, because the thing reads like a proverbial vampire bible. I see this book becoming a core text for anyone interested in vampirism, witchcraft, or the occult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is the most poorly thought out, poorly written book I have ever read. I'm not just talking about metaphysical books either. The authors thoughts are poorly constructed and Scattered. This reads more like the diary entries of a mental patient than a book. I wouldn't have put my real name on this either. I can only hope this book was written for the sole purpose of making money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't know","review":"I bought this book hoping to expand my knowledge about the use of blood in magickal and religious ceremony. I can't tell if I'm dissapointed because I already have more experiential knowledge of the topic than what is presented here, the author's lack thereof or the cursory and poorly researched nature of the book (more like a pamphlet). \\"Seth\\" could have dug much deeper into what is most definately an untapped goldmine of occult lore, but he's barely scratched the surface. Maybe it could be a lead in for the inexperienced, but I just don't know..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title of this book in my humble opinion is deceiving.","review":"The book's title is about Blood Magick, but the author doesn't really give us a practical aspect of how to use blood in magickal operations. I was very dissappointed. That is my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are only 3 good songs!!","review":"This cd was a great disapointment!!

I love hip hop, but it is not my life. BUT!, if hip hop is your life then I wouldn't reccomend this CD to you. (Instead, I would reccomend Lauryn Hill's \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\". She has a VERY beautiful voice and a VERY great CD!) \\"Big Willie Style\\" lacks originality. The interludes are very piontless and very annoying. \\"Miami\\", \\"Getting Jiggy With It\\", \\"Just The Two of Us\\", and \\"Men In Black\\" are the only tracks worth listening to. Plus, Will is always saying he's all that and a block of cheese which REALLY gets annoying.Lauryn Hill and cheesy Doritos 4-eva!!-Candy aka Megan B.L., the Cheesenoodle"},{"rating":"1","title":"PPPLLLEEEAAASSSEEE!!!!","review":"I JUST BOUGHT THIS CD JUST TO SEE WHAT ALL THE HYPE WAS ABOUT.

I bought this CD after I heard Gettin Jiggy Wit It when it first came out and I thought he was the best rapper in the world. But then I started listening to artists like Tupac, Easy-E, Dr. Dre, Outkast, Twista, Three 6 Mafia, Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony, Master P, and Too $hort. Then I realized just how far from rap Will Smith is. This is a great album to buy if you're ten and easily influenced by gangsta rap or your parents won't let you buy anything else. If you're old enough to know better, go for any of the other above mention rappers and you'll be glad you didn't buy Big Willie Style."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY","review":"Since there isn't an option for no stars, guess I have to deal with one. I bought this cd figuring it'd be ok but to my surprise, it a piece of crud. Alright, he's famous actor and is good at what he does but his music is horrible. Due to hearing \\"Men in Black\\" and \\"Getting Jiggy wit It\\", I thought the album would be as good. To my dismay, it's just like all the rap music out there. Why can't rap artists come up with their own music instead of taking it from artists that actually came up with their own work. The album is on my cd rack collecting dust and I'm willing to to sell it for a penny. Wait, I'll just give it away for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is da bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This album is the emperor of all rap albums!!!!

Yeah, OK, Will Smith is a great actor but a REALLY bad rapper. How unoriginal can you get?!?!?! You could almost say that N'Sync is more original than Will Smith, and N'Sync AREN'T original.

Plus he devotes a song to the city I love in (and a good song it is).Enjoy your songs with the repetitive songs of \\"women, cars, money\\" and constant profanity. lol.

JUST KEEP IT COMEIN' FOR THE NEXT GENERATION THEY NEED YOUR POSITIVENESS AND FUN-LOVING WISDOM WILL! THANKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One song and that's it.","review":"The big problem with Will Smith is that he appeals to pop fans. I was personally suprised when Gettin Jiggy Wit It was nominated as Best Rap video, because I never considered it to be a rap video. Unlike a lot of rap it is just a real get out there and dance as fast in the most comical way you can dance kinda song. I originally bought it because I am a mood person, and listen to something depending what my mood is. Now what the problem with this CD is that every other song (other than Miami, and MIB) in it reminds me mildly of usher. I know other people do like that kinda stuff, but when you are a real pop fan, and a club hopper, you might want to stick with the single. On top of it all \\"Just the Two of us\\" is the heart warming song for those who are tired of symbolism. For me it is just too blunt. Copied right of the tape, and changed in the least creative method possible. It sounds like it only took 15 minutes to transfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST EVER!","review":"I don't understand why so many other people wrote such bad reviews. I must admit that there really are only four songs on there that are good. But I bought the cd anyway because Will is so cool! He is an inspirational actor and father.

I wish him all the luck in the future with his career!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!","review":"It was good.

Will Smith's album is nothing but a carbon copy of other ones before it. He obviously has no ideas of his own as far as lyrics go and the melody he creates for his songs are just as rediculous (if not more) as the tunes he conjured when he was the fresh prince.

Terrible album!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 WORDS: RETIRE","review":"This album is a discrase to all true hip-hop fans. Will Smith defines the term \\"Commercial Rapper.\\" This album is neck-a-neck with Vanilla Ice. He stole the term jiggy that Keith Murry had already been using for years. But unless you're a true rap fan, you wouldn't know that. Instead of Fresh Prince going into the rap hall of fame, Will Smith goes into the rap hall of shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated rapper","review":"I have always wondered why Will Smith is so popular. Hollywood perhaps? Let's not forget about those Bruce Willis and Eddie Murphy albums. Will Smith cannot rap his way out of a paper bag. His voice is dull and thin sounding, which he has to compensate for by double-tracking his voice quite often. The material is lightweight - if I listen to rap I want to hear some bold remarks, but Will Smith's third-grade vocabulary and stories don't impress me at all. Musically, there are no original beats or samples - everything rips off an old disco hit. The lyrics at times can be cheesy and sickeningly sweet - listen to \\"Just The Two Of Us\\" and you'll know what I mean. This is candy-coated rap that absolutely anyone with even below adequate rhyming skills can perform. Will Smith should definitely have kept his day job. This uninspired trite mess is no match for the likes of Busta Rhymes or Mystikal. This CD is absolutely unlistenable - avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a GREAT CD! Will Smith introduced a great new style.","review":"You can never get bored of this cd. I got it 2 years ago, and it is still in style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal, too commercial","review":"If you think Will Smith is true rap, you better go out to the rap section and pick up something else. His beats are unoriginal, all of his songs are to commercial, have no edge and lack the realness of most other rappers (cept Puffy, but I won't start on that). All of his songs are almost exactly the same, and the lyrics in them suck. Basically, people impressed by glitz and stuff will like it. Real rap fans won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble Gum Rap","review":"I am not hating on the guy. Will Smith is a very successful in the entertainment industry.

I like him much better as an actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it but the Keith B-Reals wern't to good","review":"I likes all the songs but my favorites are tracks 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16. All though the Keith B-Reals in my opinion were funny I just don't see the point in having those in it. After I listened to them the first time they were old.

Yes, like I said, they do get annoying but that doesn't mean I have to stop liking them. A good thing about Will Smith's rap is that it doesn't talk about drugs, violence, and suicide and stuff.

Good thing my 12-year-old cousin had it already and let me listen to it, so I saved my money. Those two songs are the only ones on the CD with anything to recommend them, and the interludes were truly annoying.

What an entrance for a past funkster!","review":"Well what a change from his past funk and punk stroke old school style with Jazzy Jeff that had the eighties Shaking the Room. This is a laid back album that could be one of those albums that comes out when you want to relax with that special someone. This guy really is cool-Gettin' Jiggy with it just represents the talent that he has. I usually prefer the thugstyle rap like 2pac or mosdef but Will intreged me to have a pop at his album and i listened to it with an open mind and it really is fly- so have a listen to some samples, lay back a nd ride with the beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Version of Vitamin A With Complete Spectrum","review":"I take this version of Vitamin E because it contains the entire Alpha thru Gamma spectrum of Vitamin E plus it contains tocotrienals which my doctor recommended.

It is a great value and this size seems to last me about two months.

It made it through 4 Christmases with no use in between and now the train wheels are completely bound up, won't turn at all in spite of cleaning and oiling. Rather disappointing considering the cost of the set.Later: After looking up the seller I have found there is no support whatsoever and no, parts are not available at hobby stores. In my opinion, this is just a fancy looking, fun atfirst, but poor quality very expensive model train. Now that the engine has frozen up the train is pretty much useless.I now give this product 1 star overall, 2 for educational value and 1 for durability. It was fun when it was working but what do you do with a train with no operating engine?

We'll let you know how to repair the racket from the post office car in a little bit.This thing would be so much better if someone sold replacement parts or at the least had a list of self-help fixes online.

Now it has all of the problems that other reviewers mentioned. Our 4 biggest compalints: 1. The tracks will break where they are snapped together. 2. The second car will jump the track and it is such a pain to put back on the track. 3. The light connectors to each car does lose the snuggness and falls out afer going around the track. 4.

The moving elves are so cool. The only problem is it won't go if the wheels are not properly on the track. And, it takes time to put the wheels properly on the track.

Excellent guitars, drums, etc., although Andi Deris sounds like his vocal cords are wearing thin. RABBIT proves you can play great power metal without littering your songs with death and demons and the typical garbage. A very very good album, the only one better is possibly TREASURE CHEST, but that's because it's a best-of."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 word to describe the album - generic","review":"very weak and typical helloween of late! songs have this rehashed feel to it (one of them forgot the title is recycled from perfect gentleman). the guitar harmonies/interludes have been repeated a million times by all the powermetal bands, not to mention the generic double bass drum sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rabbit Don't Come Easy Not For The Clueless","review":"Let me say this: If you have ANY clue musically, you will dig this CD. There is so much going on here. Helloween decides to mix it up a bit and to someone who appreciates new things and not the same old re-hashed nonsense, this album delivers.Let me first address the obvious. One reviewer whined about \\"Nothing To Say\\" because of the break in the middle that is very reggae influenced. I found this to be more like Progressive Rock, and less like re-hashed 80's vintage Helloween. At 8+ minutes this song really does it for me, and does it well. Nothing old here.Other greats include, \\"Do You Feel Good\\", and \\"The Tune\\". I discover another song every time I listen, but these are the ones that jump out at you first.If you are musically inept and just want to relive the glory days of the 1980's Helloween, go buy a nice Gamma Ray CD and listen to Kai Hansen. However, if you want to watch a truly amazing band evolve, buy this disc.http://www.vincewylde.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Rabbit Outta Old Hat","review":"After listening carefully to this album I found it to be a great return to an old sound from a vintage Metal Band! Rabbit is truly a great album that lacks nohing in lyrics, melodies, and vocals that any of the older Helloween stuff encompassed! If you are a TRUE Helloween fan, then this album is a must have in your collection, you will not be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"Great from start to finish. This is not the typical thin powermetal stuff that is getting so old nowadays. I think calling this powermetal is selling it short. This album has variety, deep songs instrumentally, time changes, awesome hooks, and tons of subtleties that set it apart. It feels like some passion went into writing this. Back Against the Wall is one of my favs and the first song I've wanted to crank as loud as possible in a long time. Highly recommended. This is a step back towards the excellent songwriting from Keepers. Buy it and encourage bands to really write music. I've been getting burned out on metal lately and this was a pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the #%#@%^# happened?!!!","review":"I really hate doing this and I mean I REALLY hate doing this. Helloween Is in my top 5 bands but this album sucks. I wanted to finish out my collection with this and Better than Raw but I don't know why I waited so anxiously waiting on this one. The lyrics suck (and I love Deris) and the music is mostly mediocre. There are a couple of songs on here that have some good soloing but there is no consistency and no rememberable songs. Basically, this is an easily forgetable cd that really has nothing to do with Helloween much like the latter Kiske albums, I hate to say.There has hardly anything to do with their usual subject matter and it has a lot of songs about male/female dynamics which has NEVER been in a Helloween song, outside of Metal jukebox which doesn't count. I'm just really dissapointed in this and hope I like Better Than Raw better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helloween marches on","review":"Another enjoyable album, for the most part, from the pumpkin-obsessed kings of German power metal (Angel Dust kicks butt too, though). I agree with the reviewer who said the second half of the CD seems like an afterthought, but overall the feeling is brighter/happier than The Dark Ride. I saw them on tour for this album a few months ago, but just bought the disc last week so I wasn't familiar with the songs at the show but they had Helloween's stamp all over them. The last thing I have to question is a blurb in the last song. They slip into a reggae section - I don't have any problem with artists trying new things, and it only lasts for maybe 10 seconds but I thought: \\"a German metal band playing music from the American tropics? That's a bit of a stretch...\\" I guess that just goes to show you that metal musicians have been influenced by damn near every style around the world, which is a check mark for diversity..."},{"rating":"2","title":"back on board","review":"The only other Helloween CDs that I own are the Keeper of the Seven Keys Pt. 1 and 2. I had heard other stuff, but not really gotten into it. For some reason I heard this one and it was catchy and memorable. I was probably in the mood for some power metal to mix in with all the death and thrash metal. This is a good cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome at first, then it gets pretty awful","review":"The first 4 or 5 songs are excellent and probably some of the best material that Helloween has ever done. But unfortunately after that point, the songs tend to go downhill. I'll admit, although most of the songs sound good, the lyrics stink after about the 5th song. Not only is the writing rather crappy on them, but there's some pretty objectionable content on a couple of the songs that you wouldn't really expect from Helloween. There's two of the songs that go into a failed relationship between Micheal and his girlfriend, and those are especially awful. Don't get me wrong, look up at the rating, and you'll see that this album is still worth buying because of the great sound and about the first half of the album until after Sun 4 the World. Honestly though, after that, once you hear it a time or two and pay attention to the lyrics, you might want to only hear the CD halfway through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"I ordered these shoes because Clarks' are supposed to be quality, comfortable shoes.

Little Bird is also my favorite song, although the rest of the songs are about as good -- it is a consistently good album. You can see this Swedish lady perform Little Bird, Acceptable Losses, Mary, and Sweet Misery on www.youtube.com. Some of the songs are slower, such as the pretty \\"20th of December/Madison Avenue\\", which has really grown on me. If you like Michelle Branch, Natasha Bedingfield, or Sheryl Crow, you might like her too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great companion piece to \\"Word of Mouth\\"","review":"It's a shame that this soundtrack is so obscure because it contains some of the Kinks' best '80s work. \\"Return to Waterloo\\" and \\"Expectations\\" are beautiful laments to a lost England in the spirit of the \\"Arthur\\" album. Both would have been assets to \\"Word of Mouth\\" but thematically fit in better here. \\"Lonely Hearts\\" is a fun '50s-style ballad, \\"Not Far Away\\" rocks out in the same punkish vein as \\"Sold Me Out,\\" and \\"Voices in the Dark\\" works well as an atmospheric closer. All fine efforts. \\"Going Solo,\\" \\"Missing Persons,\\" and \\"Sold Me Out\\" are repeats from \\"WOM\\" of course, though the latter is present here in a slightly different edit.The relative scarcity of new material is troubling (even padded with the three \\"WOM\\" tracks, there's about 30 minutes of music here), but the title track and \\"Expectations\\" belong in any Kinks library, and the other tracks are solidly enjoyable, especially if you're a fan of \\"Word of Mouth.\\" Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right \\"tool\\" for the job","review":"In carpentry and other skilled endeavors, it's important to select the right tool for the job. The same can be said for pianists. If you have something powerful and dramatic, such as Rachmaninoff's third piano concerto, you want someone like Horowitz or Argerich to do it justice. For subtle and dreamy work, such as Chopin's nocturnes, Rubinstein is a better choice.For the delicate solo pieces on this disk that Brahms wrote late in his life, Wilhelm Kempff is perfect. Not sure I'd want him doing Beethoven sonatas (for which he is better known), but his easy-going gentle gracefulness is just right for these intermezzos and the other pieces on this disk.For a full preview, rather than Amazon's 30 second sample, you can search for Kempff Brahms on YouTube. There are several samples of his work on Opus 117, 118, and 119. Just beautiful - couldn't be done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swinging! Billy May at his very best.","review":"This is simply a masterpiece of vocal jazz/pop. Billy May wrote some of his best charts ever on this program, which has a great variety of tempos (and strings for the ballads). Randall learned all the phrasing lessons Sinatra had to teach and injects the energy and zest of youth. The band sparkles and this one is a classic -- as good as the Billy May collaborations with Steve Lawrence, Bobby Darin, and Jack Jones from this period. Truly great moments for the great American songbook. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossover GPS","review":"Once I started using the unit it was easy and accurate.

However, the warranty spokesperson did suggest I could use it if it were plugged in to the cigarette lighter or the charger at home. Not very helpful in a boat or on the trail. And also not true.

The on-line and supplied manual don't match the unit BUT CEW told me how to go on-line and get an equivalent manual off the Magellan web site. They even sent me the link. CEW was on the problem with very personal attention to my needs (to quote the Montana govenor) like the stink on skunk. CEW you are my heros. Once I got a eal manual this litle thing is great.

I am very pleased with the road navigation mode. I am very disappointed with the topographic maps. The built in maps have a 90 meter resolution and very little detail - they are close to worthless, particularly in relatively flat Ohio. According to the manual with the unit, 30 meter maps with much more detail are available on the website for the Continental US (loaded on SD memory cards). This is not true - there are no such maps currently available, and customer service was more than vague about when and if such maps would be available.Quite frankly, without this ability, the unit is not worth the extra cost. If I was going to do it over I would buy a cheaper road navigation unit and a topographic unit separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises a lot.","review":"This unit just doesn't live up to all of the promises made in the advertisements.

I had an old Magellan from the late 90's with road maps and I would venture to say this one is not any better. Calculating trip times are not even close to realistic. The time was calculated off traveling 45 MPH when the speed limit on this highway was 65 MPH. I cannot recommend anyone buying this unit.

Magellan mentioned in their manual and web site that you can import waypoint but they neglect to indicate that the waypoint import features works only on vehicle Nav.Now you guys tell me who use coordinates to find a street.... Or to put your friend on your favorite...Sucks , Now I have to put all of my OUTDOOR ROUTS manually..... very wisedI contact customer support and they confirm all above...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Outdated maps","review":"This unit does get you to your destination as long at it is on the maps that are provided. The problem is the maps are several years old and to get new maps costs a additional $75. Also the \\"great\\" TOPO system it has does not include TOPO's for the USA. They do have TOPO's for Mexico and Canada but not the USA. One other problem is when you call customer service it is in India and I for one can not understand what they are saying at all. They would not transfer me to to the USA either.All together I don't think I would buy this product again, hopefully there will be a better crossover soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs maps updated!!","review":"This would be a spectacular GPS if Magellan would update the maps for it. I won't recommend it until they do!! I have been misled by the Crossover several times. On the somewhat newer bridges in my area, it looks as though the car is a boat crossing a bridge-less body of water. However, the off-road feature works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy for a budget","review":"This GPS has a few limitations, namely the size of the memory. But, all in all, it was a good purchase. It's hard to find a better value for the functions available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Outstanding product with no issues. The most recent firmware update really improved the interface and useability. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best GPS for me !","review":"I have had the Magellan Crossover for a few weeks now and find it to be quite a useful tool. I like the large screen, its easy to see in the daytime and at night. A simple but smart layout of the navagation screen. I am getting almost 8 hours of battery life before recharging. I carry it around with me every day for work use and on the weekend I kayak fresh and saltwater it comes with me there too.If I broke it would buy the same one again.A great review of this product found here: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Choice","review":"If you're thinking of getting one of these to use on the trail, forget it. The topo maps that come with it are so poor in detail as to be useless unless you just want a walk in a city. No rivers, lakes or major topo features. A check with Magellan's update calendar indicates nothing scheduled for the Crossover in the near future (not needed because it's new). Email requests for info on ANY compatible maps go unanswered. I sent mine back and will go with a Garmin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Topo maps very poor; no upgrades","review":"Great idea to have topo and roads on the same unit, but topo maps are 90 meter (so topo lines about every 300 feet of elevation) and other map features such as streams are missing. I couldn't find a way to get any map upgrades--an FAQ on their website says none are available, although the instruction manual claims you can use programmed SD cards for upgrades (and even shows pictures of how much better the upgraded maps look on the unit). That's pretty deceptive. I bought this to replace my old sportrak pro, which has great downloadable maps and navagation features, but is slow and has a poor screen. This unit might be great for driving, but don't buy this if you also intend to use it in a serious way for outdoors or hiking. I'm returning mine today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old maps are a deal killer","review":"Not a bad unit, read the other reviews, but the deal killer for anyone should be that the maps included are from August 2006, hopelessly out-of-date, and Magellan has the extremely anti-consumer policy on not providing free updates even with a recent purchase of this unit. You ask, you get a polite e-mail from India telling you you can pay $80 to buy an upgrade disk for the GPS you just bought. Neither Garmin nor TomTom \\"screw\\" their customers like this.Bottom line, stay away from Magellan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GPS for all seasons & reasons","review":"I researched every GPS on the market with specific needs in mind. I needed a unit that was versatile enough to be used in my Land Rover during off road jaunts, Weather resistant for when I get caught in the rain on my Honda Gold Wing motorcycle and easily moved from my vehicle to a rental car when I travel for business. The Magellan Crossover GPS fits the bill in every respect. The unit comes with all of the map data necessary out of the box to satisfy almost all of your needs. The optional Topographical maps complete the package. The unit acquires satellite signals rapidly and the automatic detour function is very handy when needed. The \\"text to speech\\" feature is clear and easily understood and heard even on a motorcycle. The battery life lasts for about 7-8 constant hours of usage. I will be purchasing a second Magellan Crossover GPS in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GPS!!!!","review":"Please save your hard earned dollars. I've owned this model for over 2 years and Magellan has provided absolutely no support. They've been saying they're going to have new topo maps since the day I bought it, and they've yet to deliver. From their web site it looks like they've discontinued this model.6/16/2010 Update to my previous review. Magellan have made it official now. Since they discontinued this model in December 2008, they are no longer providing map updates. The really sad thing is the last update they had for this model was V2 for 2006/2007. So it was out of date when I bought it and it will NEVER be updated. Not the type of company you want to buy from.Buy a Garmin!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live Mario!!!!!","review":"Anyone who's played any of the Super Mario games, knows that it's music and sound effects are easily recognizable!this cd is a must for any fan of the classic Mario franchise...and I personally feel that this should have been the cd in the \\"Super Mario All-Stars\\" video game for the Wii, instead of the 15+ minutes \\"soundtrack\\" we got hosed with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will laugh and laugh","review":"You will laugh while reading this book almost all the time, the jokes that it has are very good and you will have to laugh.The story of the murder is a little bit disappointing because at the end of the book the \\"bad guy\\" just gives up and go to Stephanie's house to try to kill her, but if you want to have a real good time two or three evenings (it depends on how fast you read) read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Quirky Characters","review":"My sister recommended Janet Evanovich and the Plum series to me, telling me that my writing reminds her of Ms. Evanovich's style. So, I was interested, but not disappointed and actually honored to be compared to her. Ms. Evanovich has quickly become one of my favorite authors. Her characters and dialogue are hilarious. Grandma Mazur is a hoot, the little person Randy Briggs is hilarious, and Lula, the former hooker, boggles the mind! Ms. Evanovich now gives us a triangle involving Stephanie Plum, her boyfriend Joe Morelli, and Ranger, the mystery man. I had such a fun time reading this book. You can't get any better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"I'm going against the tide here but at least its an honest opinion:- This one's a dud, folks.In book 5, the mystery gives way to the romance. In fact, it gives a whole lot of way! Female readers will enjoy this book but the discerning crime-fiction fan probably wont (no matter what their gender).If you already have the first four books and must have this one in your collection, then buy it. Its your money. But if you dont mind, then skip it. Its a dud. Unless of course if you enjoy reading romance novels pretending to be mystery novels.The two stars are for Grandma Mazur. Otherwise, I'd give it just one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Solid Installment in the Series","review":"Evanovich never disappoints...this chapter in the Stephanie Plum series as just as consistently funny and engaging as the ones before it. With an intensely likable, witty, and imperfect heroine, these books never seem to lose their sparkle and appeal as Stephanie hops from one bizarre adventure to the next, encountering an endlessly entertaining entourage of oddball characters that will have you in stitches. While by no means does Ms. Plum have an ordinary life, she is, in many ways, an ordinary woman in her shortcomings - intensely real, but admirable. She's the kind of person you root for and would like to be friends with, and that is perhaps the true shining glory of these books. In short, another great novel from Evanovich in a can't-miss series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fun one","review":"Another installment in a cute, fun series. Stephanie Plum is as much herself as always. A quick, fun read perfect for a weekend at the beach. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS!!!!","review":"All I can say is HURRY UP with Number 6!!!

Love all the regulars, but besides Stepahnie, Grandma Mazur is the best. Can already picture Estelle Geddes (Golden Girls) in the made for TV role. We (my husband and I) can't wait for Ms. Evanovich's next creation. It's too long between adventures. We'd love to see Sally from \\"Four to Score\\" reappear in a future novel, but no matter, just hurry and get the next book out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: Read this book slowly!","review":"The very best thus far! Ms. Evanovich is funnier than ever (believe it) and crueler, too--what an ending. I too found myself laughing out loud countless times...and cursing when I realized I was on the last page. And favorite characters??? The riotous altercation between Briggs and Stephanie is priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"series is on the skids","review":"I have been a fan of Janet Evanovich since her days of pulp romance titles and I was very pleased to have her enter into the mystery-romance hardback theater. I enjoyed her first four books in the series but this last one HIGH FIVE simply rehashed old themes. Janet can do so much better than this. Stephanie is a great character and the possibilities are endless for her development and further adventures but this installment (book five) fell short. I also felt that the abundance of profanity was just a cover for the lack of a good solid story. The \\"shock\\" value of the language soon worn thin and became more boring than shocking. I certainly would not be able to reccommend this part of the series to teenage readers. Please return to the 'old' delightful feisty character and her struggles through life and rely less on tired themes and vulgar language. Yes, I will still have to read the next book in the series because I am not giving up yet. I hope it will be a good one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there aren't zero or negative stars!","review":"After purchasing (and very much enjoying) the first three books read by the talented Lori Petty, I was terribly disappointed when she was not the voice of Stephanie Plum in the fourth book, but decided to buy it anyway. Big Mistake. Janet Evanovich (or whoever is responsible for the casting of her audio book) should take a lesson from Grafton, Kellerman, and others who have a reoccurring character. Use the same voice. Ms. Mazar had difficulty inflecting to differentiate between characters, to say nothing of her lisp, which might have been less noticable had she slowed down a little in her reading. Offer Ms. Petty a house on the beach in Malibu if you must, but please get her back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GOOD AS HER FIRST FOUR BOOKS","review":"OK, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST FOUR BOOKS. I WAS HAPPY THAT I DID NOT BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Language Is Offensive","review":"A couple of acquaintances recommended Stephanie Plum and Evanovich to me for humourous reading. It was a waste for me. They are many \\"fun\\" books out there with decent language to take up my spare time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plum Crazy About Stephanie Plum","review":"Janet Evanovich has created an amusing and lovable character in bounty hunter Stephanie Plum. She has such an engaging personality and anyone can relate to the crazy situations that occur in her daily life. Her exploits as a bounty hunter keep you wondering what she is going to get into next. I can hardly wait to pick up the next book in this series to see who she will come up against and what kind of trouble she will get herself into. Her sidekick Lula is great as well and I will be anxious to see these characters portrayed in the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Stephanie Plum Series, Hate this abridged version","review":"Overall, I absolutely love the Stephanie Plum series, but I wasn't pleased with this particular one due to the fact that it's an abridged version and it was extremely unpleasant listening to Debbie Mazar narrating the story. My best advice is to get unabridged versions with C.J. Critt or Lorelei King. Heck, even the abridged versions with Lorelei King are much better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure it's a great book...","review":"but it is a HORRIBLE ebook. There are parts missing entirely, horrid misspellings and editing errors... this is most definitely NOT worth the price! I got so frustrated with this as an ebook that I returned it and got the paperback version. HORRIBLE, needs edited big time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read one you'll read another","review":"Great suspense and adventure and each book gets a little more interesting or exciting like you were there, I would recommend any of her books, although I do have a few favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this book on vacation I loved it.","review":"I had heard so many good things about this book, I went to the library to check it out. I read this book when I went on vacation to New York and New Jersey and read it on the plane, and throughout the vacation. I almost laughed out loud on the plane. Stephanie Plum is someone you wished you were when you want to do something dangerous, I liked the ending was it Ranger or Joe? I think it was Ranger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ending unnecessary","review":"I whipped through this book while flying... having fellow passengers wondering what was so funny. I enjoyed the play between Stephanie and Ranger and the whole cast of characters as crazy and endearing as they are. What I didn't like was the ending.....Ms Evans read your reviews, you have a growing number of fans who will pay hardcover prices without your having to tweak the ending. I thought it an unnecessary marketing ploy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books I have ever read","review":"But you can't just read one. You have to have the whole bag....Oops...you must read the whole series. Janet Evanovich is a wonder. Just like Potato chips, once you start one of these books, you can not put it down. I odered the first four together...Thank you Amazon...and read them in four days. I got High Five yesterday and read it straight thru last night. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could give it 10 stars!!!!","review":"What a great book! This is by no doubt the funniest book I have ever read. The series just gets better and better. I don't know how I'll wait another year for the next installment....Hurry, Janet, hurry!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm addicted to this series of mysteries.","review":"I, like so many other people, can identify with the mishaps of Stephanie Plum. Murphy's Law seems to follow her where ever she goes. In High Five, I was captivated by the romantic angle as well as the mystery. But I was left hanging. #6 must come out soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thinking Person's Mystery","review":"I have read all of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum mystery series. I have a great time reading her mysteries. They are fun, funny, and entertaining. Her novels are very quick reads: you'll be done in less than two days. What is also great about her novels is that you could read them over and over and not get tired of them. I always look forward to her next Stephanie Plum book. I WILL especially look forward to her next one after HIGH FIVE (you'll understand when you get to the very end). Attention JANET EVANOVICH: keep up the good work. Your novels are WONDERFUL, and what I call the \\"THINKING PERSON'S MYSTERY.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Each a winner in itself","review":"I have read all of Ms. Evanovich's other Stephanie Plum books and I just have to say, \\"I LOVE THEM!!\\" Ms. Evanovich's style of writing and ability to conjure up the story-lines that she does are just a couple of the reasons why her books are among the favorites in my collection. Any author who can keep me glued to my seat for hours at a time just to see how it's all going to work out in the end deserves MUCH praise. Keep up the good work Ms. Evanovich. I hope you comtinue to produce many more Stephanie Plum books in the years to come....I just don't know how poor Ms. Plum is giong to survive them all - but she will, I'm sure of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOTTA LOVE HER..............................","review":"The Stephanie Plum novels just seem to get better and better. Steph's at it again; also along for the ride are the mainstays--Lula, Grandma Mazur, and the rest of the looney bunch. Throw in a psycho from an earlier novel, heat between Steph and Morelli...and just when you think things can't get any better, there are sparks between Stephanie and her sexy bounty hunter mentor, Ranger.There are certain things that you can count on in a Plum novel--lunacy, lust, plenty of comedic action, and what would a Plum novel be without a least one car fire?Sit back an enjoy....it doesn't get much better than this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms Evanovich has done it again!!","review":"Our favorite bounty hunter is back on the job! But her life isn't all roses, her relationship with Morelli has cooled off. She's broke, with no one to capture for the reward money. Her uncle Fred is missing and the family asks if she could help find him. She finally askes Ranger for a job. Which is late night evictions for a landlord. Well when she's not blowing up her own car. She's getting blown up by angery squatters. If thats not enough Ranger gives her at least two company cares both are either stolen or blow to bits. She's got an annoying dwarf living with her and she still can't seem to make any money! This book is a bucket of laughs. The author has once again created a story in which our favorite characters come to life. This book is definately worth the reading time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another witty and suspenseful Stephanie Plum Mystery","review":"Things are so slow for Stephanie Plum, the Trenton, NJ, bounty hunter, that she willingly spends time looking for her missing uncle. The Trentonian local color rings true, as Stephanie stumbles into a major embezzling scheme involving several murders closely related to her uncle's disappearance. One of the things that makes this series so readable is Stephanie's on/off relationship with Lt. Morellia, a situation now complicated by the increased presence of Ranger, the bounty hunter from hell. We always know that Ms. Plum will find the crooks and solve the mystery, but readers can look forward to the new complexities offered by romantic triangle between Plum, Morelli, and Ranger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madcap humor from Stephanie and the gang...","review":"High Five is Evanovich's best to date.

Also, with a tough love triangle brewing, I can't wait for it to play out in #6!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Janet Evanovich is amazing.

And with the help of a three-foot-tall former FTA, she uncovers the whole fiasco, all while busting some butt to keep her own butt alive!---The beginning of this novel didn't quite trap my attention, so it took me longer to finish this book, but it did quickly pick up on action! This is my 2nd favorite in the series (the 1st is my favirite), so I recommend that you at least read this far in the series! I can't wait for what the rest have in store."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum books","review":"I got started reading Janet Evanovich's book when I was still working.

Can't wait for the next installment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a hoot!","review":"This was my first experience with Stephanie Plum, but it will not be my last! Terrific characters and with all of the fun going on, there is a little mystery woven through the book (What ever happened to Uncle Fred?)that is very cleverly done. I know I should go back and start with the first one as others have recommended, but I want to see who is at the door too, so I have ordered Hot Six. Always fun to find an author that makes you laugh and keeps you interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM SOOOO HOOKED!","review":"I happened to come across one of her books on line and read a little of it. I then went and got them ALL and started reading. They are a great fast read that had me laughing out loud! Once I picked them up I was loathe to put it down. I am hooked on Stephanie Plum and can't wait to see what she gets into next with Ranger, Joe and the indestructible blue car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranger is soooooo sexy!","review":"This is another very entertaining novel in the Stephanie Plum series. All of the books have been hilarious and this one is no exception. I just love Stephanie's grandmother, she is a hoot! But I have to say that I hope the guy at the end is Ranger. He seems so sexy, I wish he was a real life person! Joe Morelli is also hot, but she had him already, and I agree with the previous reviewer about giving him some competition. I can't wait to read Hot Six!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another riotous Stephanie Plum mystery!","review":"I was introduced to the Stephanie Plum series by a friend and I think I started with \\" Lean Mean Thirteen\\". That's the great part about this series! You do not have to start with the first, although they each stand alone, they build on the history of the previous books in each one which makes them all the more enjoyable. After having read 13, I found some more at the local resale book store and was completely hooked! I am now making my way through the entire series! \\"High Five\\" is a definite MUST READ no matter the order in which you are reading the books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"High 5\\"? Marketing 101 - returning this book to Amazon.com","review":"Deeply disappointing. Thoroughly enjoyed the first four in this series. Now Evanovich seems trapped in the Two Guys/One Narrator-Gal series problem. It's just to lure us through the series, while there is no plan or character development point.The book was mostly \\"Stephanie Plum's Greatest Hits\\". All the key things repeat from past books: funeral viewings, Stephanie's car woes, Grandma gets her hand on a weapon, junk food menu reviews, and waaaaaay too many plot threads. Ultimately leading to a big fake-out final three pages, begging: Read my next book, please!I won't. I'm returning this hardback copy to Amanzon.com. I might leave message at the author's webiste, and will definitely write the publisher. Very cheap ending ploy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Fun, Savvy & Realistic To Some Extent","review":"Stephenie Plum is really rolling here. Chasing down her Uncle, dealing with the psycho Ramirez, caught between her desire for Morelli and Ranger, putting up with the smart mouth dwarf, the kid Shiek with his fixation on sex and her Grandmother who is just a pip. This was a really good book that I could not put down. I especially liked the ending since it leaves you guessing. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanovich Continues to be the BEST!","review":"Each one of the Stephanie Plum novels is great and they just keep getting better. I burst into spontaneous laughter at least once each chapter. Who could read about Grandma Masur using the stun gun on Stephanie's father and not laugh? Or just the thought of Grandma as a Spice Girl for Halloween? Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost a little of the shine, but still worth multiple giggles","review":"I started off wanting to give this book three stars, but I couldn't in all honesty do it. I might think it's a three-star book, but I really enjoyed it like a four-star book.Evanovich is one of the most engaging writers out there, and even though it seems like she reaches a little bit too far in places to get the laughs, I still laughed.Stephanie Plum's career as a bounty hunter is stalled, so she decides to do a little extra work of dubious legality for Ranger while looking for her missing Uncle Fred. Rude jokes, car explosions, and bad hair galore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet's Best Yet","review":"I laughed until I hiccuped - I love all of Janet Evanovich's books, but this is by far her best! She is back in fine form after a disappointing Four to Score, and her characters couldn't be better. Stephanie is the best heroine out there, and loyal readers will be holding their breath for MORE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie's my hero, er..heroine!","review":"This series only gets better. I know the \\"burg\\" and love the neighborhood. Stephanie's life is so realistic that I think I'm going to see her careening down my street in the power blue Buick any day now. The story lines have been wonderful and completely hook me--I can't put them down once I start. What a dilema...choosing between Ranger or Morelli. It sizzles! Thanks, Janet Evanovich! Please don't make us wait a year for number six!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When will this book be released in kindle version??","review":"I'm in love with this series and have read the first four books on my kindle - now I'm addicted and the next few books aren't available in kindle version - WHAT's up Amazon??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, sassy, and damn funny!","review":"What an excellent book! I laughed myself silly while reading this book and I just can't wait to grab the next book in this marvellous series. Who did she did the deed with at the end of the book?? But judging from the preview of Hot Six, we will never have the chance to find out. :(If you, like me, did not start from the first book, you don't have to fret much cos you won't be totally lost. But for the best effect start from the first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already!","review":"I genuinely like this series, but is Ms. Evanovich writing about romance or mystery? The ending of this fifth book was ridiculous. The series is quite good, the characters are delightful. There's no need to treat the reader as if the only reason they come back is to find out about the next saga in Stephanie's love life. What started out as a cute facet of the series by book number five has turned into the main focus. It's ruining (at least for me) the series. If we want tortured romance stories, there's plenty of other places to turn. Enough already. Let's have the focus on the plot in book six."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not literature, but who cares?","review":"This is by far the most fun I've had reading a mystery series. Stephanie Plum is a wisecracking bounty hunter with a hamster, a spunky grandmother, and two men to choose from. Evanovich sense of place and time is terrific, her characterizations are individual, and her pace is quick.She has said that she writes for people who don't have much time to read and if she can write on command like that, more power to her. She does not pretend to be writing literature, but that has its place, and so does this. I call it fluff, but in a good way. It's mindless fun, something you don't have to think about.

Many interesting physical principals regarding all aspects of playing are discussed thoroughly (sometimes a little too thoroughly). It gets pretty technical about physics and hard to understand in some chapters, and some ideas expressed in the book completely contradict some of the conclusions I've found through my own experimentation. But, the book does a great job of making you think and analyze more aspects of your playing than you never thought of before. Even though some of the book only deserves 3, or 2 stars, much of it is 5 star material, and I think that the good stuff has more leverage than the bad: I say it probably deserves 4 well earned stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new but the actors and directors...","review":"I knew this was a low-budget effort from new directors, but as I am always on the lookout for new horror flicks I hoped for the best. Oh, well... I suppose I should state from the beginning that those 2 stars above are for unbridled horror film enthusiasm alone; I seldom hate a decent horror film. That said, there just isn't much to thrill at here and none of it new. The atmosphere seldom rises to the occasion, the sets (alot of apartment settings) didn't improve matters, most of the acting is amateurish or simply flat, and the stories seemed to start nowhere and return there as quickly as the thin plots could carry them. Most standard horror film sequels are better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standards.","review":"If you're accustomed to quality supernatural or horror movies this film is going to be a disappointment An obviously very low budget for this type of film in these days is not going to satisfy an audience accustomed to impressive localities and visual effects. And to have four crammed into an hour just makes it feel undeveloped and rushed. The stories themselves were nothing out of the ordinary. To the directors and crew - keep trying. We all have to start somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!!","review":"My 12 year old wanted it to practice drums.

When I recommended him to an acquaintance he said Donald Goines was his favorite author, so I gave Black Gangster a try. The writing was amateurish, the characters were all unlikeable, there was no message, no metaphor, no humor, no nothing. It was a complete waste of time.

This book was really hard for me to get into after Prince got out of jail. Then when the Cougars came in, I was all over it. Then when Ruby got all Queen Bee, I was bored again. It was just one big roller coaster of emotions. I'm still going to read another one, because I didn't like his first one, thought the second one was great...so I figure there's a pattern there too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strong piece","review":"This guy seemed to be ahead of his time. This was the first book I've read from Goines, but it won't be the last. He had a way of making the story so vivid, so real; he had a way of just bringing it to life and putting you right in the middle of the action. His characters in this story(the main ones) all had their own traits, and Prince and Ruby surely were the mad couple if there ever was one. The thing most impressive about it to me was he tied in actual events along with his story. The riots in Detroit, along with Black nationalist issues were key then, and he tied all of it in with what he was bringing to the table."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC","review":"This was a great book.

The little 12 year old girl speaking all of the different languages got to be a little much. I also had to constantly turn back in the book to keep up with the characters. I still could not understand how one of the character's father, Jerry Fein committed suicide in 1960 and in the book relates to that as being 23 years ago. I just couldn't find where the story was supposed to be taking place in 1983. Pages 60 and 61 looked like they missed the proofreader.

The plot is made difficult with three main threads that do not come together until late in the book. The overwritten character exploitations obscure the direction the story is taking.

She loves to chase after it and then pick it up by the handle and run with it, shaking it from side to side. I like the fact that the ball does not deflate if it is punctured.

It's made of a squishy plastic that's easy for them to sink their teeth into and squeeze, but it always returns to its original shape when released. Sometimes they carry it by the handle, sometimes they just squeeze the ball part and carry it from the side. The handle also makes it easy for us to throw for them to chase.A word of warning about the handle: The handle is a very soft plastic that is very easy to chew off. If your dog has even the slightest interest in chewing on its toys, I'd recommend only using the Jolly Ball under supervision so you can prevent the handle from being chewed off. The ball still functions fine without the handle, it just leaves a hole several inches long in one side, but that hole could be used as a starting place to make an even bigger hole once a dog decides to chew on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"chewed handle off in 10 minutes","review":"My 6 month old vizsla is not a big time toy ruiner, but boy did he ruin this one fast ... started eating the handle immediately.

For so long now, I've still been waiting for the awesome Jonathan Coachman to tell him off (which he failed to do on March 8, 2004 on RAW), and return the favor of 'kicking HIM off the set' for a change.The Rock is ALWAYS a jerk, I feel sorry for Mick Foley being his friend, and I don't understand why the 'millions, AND MILLIONS' of fans actually like him. I mean, WHY?I mean sure, he can talk fast with wits and cunning, he knows when to be nice SOMETIMES, BUT HE HAS AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM. He is one of those grown up football players from high school that's always been mean and for SOME REASON, people actually still like him.I don't respect the Rock, I'm not afraid of him, I punch the TV whenever he's on the set; but feel like shooting it!!He's so mean to his interviewers and people in general that he just pisses me off so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gift for my nephew","review":"This gift from the 'wish list' of my nephew arrived, but did not give the identity of the sender.As a result my nephew did not know that the gift was from his uncle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, great selection of desserts","review":"This is an excelletn book, full of the best desserts, and of course the best recipes I've tried many recipes and everything have came deicious, only one pound cake wasn't really great but all the other things came out great.The brownies are awesome, the Budapest Coffee Cake too, and other recipes were really good too.I think that is important to have it if you love to bake as me and if you love desserst as much as I love them, you will find many recipes (seriously I mean lots of dessert recipes) you will have a huge selection to choose the perfect one for each ocassion, and every recipe is tested by a queen of baking, Maida Heatter, go ahead buy this book try many recipes you will see great results and you will be happy with the final results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this huge book but was disappointed when it arrived by the fact that there are no photos!

The outcome was a bit disappointing. The disappointment is limited though to the performance of Concerto No. 1, and especially the Rondo (third movement). Paganini is indeed very challenging and requires the performer to add their own \\"interpretation and feelings\\" to it. The way Accardo plays Concerto No. 1 is very close to what a synthesizer would do (well, exaggerating), purely technical, no feelings at all. I must however state that the other Concertos show substantial improvement and deserve the praise expressed in the other reviews. For concerto no.1 I would recommend Hilary Hahn's performance which is truly perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer Clear!","review":"The colors and safety attracted me to this infant carrier, but it was a total waste of money. My son had totally grown out of it in six weeks. It is very narrow. He was on the large size, but come on, he wasn't anywhere close to even 16 pounds when he no longer fit. Also the fabric piled and looked very worn where he would kick his feet and they'd rub the bottom of the carseat in just a week or so. It was ridiculously heavy too, even empty it was a real chore to move around. The only good thing I can say is my son did not get overly hot in it. When you really want to be able to not have to wake your infant getting them in and out of their carseat this one was very frustrating. I live in Japan and this brand is very popular with the location nationals though - maybe because of the narrow size and smaller shape, would probably work great for much smaller than average babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much \\"common sense\\" not enough meat&#65533;","review":"I am very interested in learning about this subject and I was disappointed by this book.

What was an issue was installing the balls before I gave it to him. First, there was 'part' of a peg already in the middle hole so no ball could be installed there. Poor workmanship or quality or whatever. Had to drill it out in order to make it work. Secondly the 'trick' part of the puzzle was screwed on too tight and would not move - there was no way the pin was sliding on the 'third' peg (and I know the trick - that was not the issue). Fixed with a screwdriverand 'redrilled' - the puzzle works fine and I can now present it to my friend. I would NOT recommend this puzzle unless you are comfortable rebuilding it.

Big mistake. This music has no structure and no raw emotion like his older works. Even the lyrics are pretty tame compared to earlier work. Obviously musicians change over the years but this sounds like something you would hear down at an Atlantic City lounge, but with a terribly weak singer. Having a band is a waste of time, most of this music sounds like it could have been generated by a cheesy synth.I will continue to hunt down the old greats but this is just Elvis later years wish wash with nothing thought provoking except what happened over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"poetic,gritty lyrics","review":"Leonard Cohens \\"more best of\\" caught my attention at a very painful time in my life(my husbands death) ... after 9 months ...I carry the CD with me, and have given several to friends.. his wonderful voice and poignant ,acid lyrics are lifting me out of the blackest hour of my soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep.","review":"Personally, I couldn't deal with this little amount of Leonard Cohen myself, and would get his 2-disc \\"Essential\\" collection first.

The 12 tracks of the album are centered around Khan's husky alto and unusual instrumentation like harpsichord, maracas and handclaps. Some influence from American minimalist composers is evident in the construction of many songs from loops.Natasha Khan has some impressive musical skills, but the fatal flaw of Bat for Lashes' work is that the lyrics are concerned only with love, expressed in terms more common for a teenage girl than a mature woman artist. Repetitive imagery of hearts on fire, horses, knights in armor and such abound.

I had the pleasure to listen to this cd again and again and again to her beautiful voice and music when I was surfing the internet and every songs seems to have a life of its own after that, and each and \\"everyone\\" of the song keep you entertained by dancing around a big fire, wet your feet with their splashes of watery melodies and put that shiny thing called \\"happiness\\" into your soul(...it feels like Wow!!!...).

Am I so happy that she is on this earth!Run to the nearest music store or if there's no music store in your radius, then purchase this quick!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow I am under impressed....","review":"Expectations were high when listening to this album. The reviewers all give this record mad props. Keep in mind I am a fan of ethereal, electronic, down-tempo music. But after Horse and I, which is an incredible song, with her aching voice, brilliant chimes, and chugging baseline, this album moves so slowly with very little creativity. There are some songs that are repetitive and almost unlistenable. Please listen to this album before purchasing. You're welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Perplexing Adventure","review":"The contents of this album are as baffling as the name of the featured vocalist.

Both funny and moving, brilliantly written and beautifully acted, this is one of my all-time favorites, and I'm a huge fan of British TV. Despite being somewhat dated, it still very much holds up, even with repeated viewings. David Calder's performance is particularly memorable: \\"I'm a Soviet spy workin' the west, honey.

Again, going through the hassle of an RMA and sending it back, after two months I finally got another new unit from them, but it was only a 512mb unit instead of the 1gb that I bought. Again, more hassles calling a manager at Creative, getting another RMA, and having to send it back. They didn't even offer to send me one until they get this one back, even after two months of not being able to use their product and all the hassles.

It was a good MP3 player for the money.Then, last week I went to use it and the sound was all distorted. I went to the Zen website to troubleshoot it and went to try their suggestions but whenever I connected the Zen to my computer, the computer locked up. As soon as I removed the Zen from the computer, it was fine. So, I was unable to troubleshoot. So I tried to turn on my Zen to check settings. Now it won't even turn on. I went back to the Zen website to contact Customer service. They wanted me to pay a nonrefundable $25 just to get a return number, with no guarantees that they could fix the problem. There was no phone number to contact them, or anyway to contact them via email. When a company makes themselves inaccessible like that, I have to wonder why. Don't settle for the Zen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for kids","review":"I got this unit and was surprised that it only allows you to skip through the songs forward and backwards. I might have missed some other options, but I don't think so. I got this for a 10 year old and she doesn't seem to mind, but if you are looking for the ability to play songs by artist, album, or any other grouping, I could not figure out how to do it.It works well other than that. It's basically a thumb drive and you can drag and drop (cut and paste) songs on here easily.It comes with a rubber case to help protect it, ok head phones and a USB cord. My XP found it and installed it quickly with any additional software. It does come with software, but I didn't even look at it.If you want something more intelligent, then the one gig Sandisk with the 1 gig memory slot works very well, for under $100.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardy little player","review":"The Creative Zen Nano Plus is a great little player, it's a shame Creative no longer makes this model.

I couldn't afford an iPod so I bought this since I've had positive experiences with Creative in the past. It has worked beautifully from day 1. I've loaded entire albums onto it and use it at the gym. I also like the fact that it records (can use it to record meetings, lessons, etc) and has am/fm radio. People probably think it's an iPod when they see it and I don't mind at all. :-) I'll be giving this to family members as birthday/holiday gifts this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MP3 player compared to Ipod Shuffle","review":"I switched from an Ipod Shuffle (the first generation that looks like a stick) to this MP3 player and am very impressed. For the price, this player has many things the shuffle doesn't including a higher memory and an on screen display of the current song you are listening to. Although you cannot select specific playlists this doesn't bother me because I couldn't do that with a shuffle either. As far as size, sound and ease of functions I would say its about equal to an Ipod shuffle. I love that I can see the song I'm listening to and that it can hold way more songs, this makes it better than the shuffle in my opinion. Biggest drawback: batteries. I use it everyday and the one AAA battery only lasts me about 2 weeks, I suppose if I got rechargables I could diminsh this cost a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAVEAT EMPTOR defective out of the box","review":"Player was not detected in windows xp.

I don't have any problem with the Muvo Mix, but the Muvo V100 isn't recognized, either. I'm disappointed that such a common problem can't be resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I really dig this thing. It's super light, easy to use and has great sound.

It has the ability to bookmark, which allows me to pick up right where I left off when I turn it on. I haven't used it for music yet, so I'm not sure how it will be, but can't imagine it would be anything but wonderful. The sound is great from such a small device, but I'm using different headphones than the ones which came with it. I recommend it highly and would have given it a 5 star but for the little plastic cover over the port where you plug in the USB cord. It doesn't go back in very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"***Versatile, easy to use, tuner and voice recorder also!***","review":"I Bought this unit a few years ago, when I went to buy it, I was actually looking for a portable CD player which can play mp3 CD's. I couldn't find one at a big electronics retailer so I called one of my younger friends who told me that I could get a flash player. I'm glad I got this unit. It weighs almost nothing, holds a few hundred songs, very easy to load onto, being picked up by my laptop as an external drive. One really neat thing I do is I record using the record function, put it on my computer and burn a CD or send the wav file via email. Very cool! I think an Ipod may be better but I don't like the fact you MUST use itunes for the ipod. I like this piece. I am very picky with electronics and recommend this if you need something simple and versatile. Battery life's pretty good, a week listening every day on my daily commute to and from work. Love the indigo light, definately, consider it."},{"rating":"2","title":"depends on what you use it for","review":"I love this thing. My needs are simple: music, educational mp3's, news, a harddrive to store microsoft word and excel files. It won't get you mugged like an Ipod will. I used white headphones with it and some teenagers beat me up and screamed \\"Give me the Ipod!\\". As soon as they saw it was my old zen they gave it back! If you live in an urban environment NEVER use white headphones! Sound is decent but won't blow you away. I am very happy with my purchase and would buy it again except I've just seen models here at Amazon with 2 gigs and similar features for much less money.

This is where this player really shines. It is simply one of the best sounding mp3 players on the market, with very little background noise and distortion. Warmth, resolution, detail, and clarity allow your music to be engaging and very enjoyable. Play a track with a high-bitrate and this player will blow you away! I previously owned a heavy, 20GB hard-disc drive player made by Apple. The drawbacks were the weight and extremely short battery life (3 hours of play on a good day). This baby is so small, light and unobtrusive that you don't think twice about taking it everywhere you go. Buy 4 AAA rechargeable batteries and you're good to go.Oh yeah, by the way.... the price is right. You can't find a better mp3 player for under $70 bucks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it so far","review":"I have only had it for 2 weeks and I am very happy with it so far.

The headphone sound quality is to my satisfaction. I did try using the \\"line in\\" function to record online radio shows.

The size is great (small enough to fit into a pocket) and the protective cover comes with a clip if you don't have a pocket. Although 1GB doesn't hold a lot of songs it works for my purposes and 1 AAA battery lasts me about three weeks of daily play.One of the Zen Nano's selling points was the FM radio and it clearly receives the signal from my local NPR station, which is no small feat (my alarm clock radio has difficulty receiving the signal). I have not tried to record with the microphone so I don't know how well it works or the quality of the recording. The only thing that hasn't worked well for me is the earphones--they were uncomfortable and too big to fit into my ears so I had to buy another pair.I highly recommend the Creative Zen Nano and am planning on buying one for each of my daughters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat-out depressing","review":"Hawthorne Heights is one of the saddest things ever to happen to Victory Records.

Please...for a good hardcore/screamo CD, pick up a copy of the Silverstein album 'When Broken Is Easily Fixed' (also a band on Victory.) I can't say that hardcore/screamo is my favorite music that ever was, but I can say that I know enough about it to be able to judge it properly.

You hear \\"Ohio is for Lovers\\" and you think, it's just a single, there must be better songs on the cd. But no. Ohio is the best song, and the rest are all slow paced and boring. The silence in black and white is just that, black and white. No color to it, no originality, and the screamer sounds like he's constipated. And the lyrics just plain suck. Emo bands are supposed to write about heartache that they have been through. And obviously none of them have cut their wrists or blacked their eyes, because they are (unfortunately) still with us today.

When your trying to act like your a decent screamo band, and the majority of your fans are 13 yr old girls who are all like \\"OMG I <3 Hawthorne Heights Ohio is For Lovers Roxors!\\" then youve got a problem.Anyway, if your a 12-14 yr old girl this is the album for you. If your a guy and you like this album, give it time, you'll realize just how absolutly piss poor it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"cut my wrists and blind my eyes","review":"First of all i'd like to say that i like Taking Back Sunday, Brand New, From Autumn To Ashes, early Dashboard Confessional, and other things of that nature and STILL can't stomach this at all. It's complete disposable trash that seems to even be soon forgotten by fans. Ohio Is For Lovers was a catchy enough tune but this music is just wayyy too suburban privalaged white kid cuts themsleve, feels alienated, wears black, crys, no one understands, woe is me, i'd rather write 10 pages in my live journal about suicide then actually killing myself....self indulgent, black eyliner, hot topic, trl, neo-goth, garbage. if you are offended by any of this you should check out My Chemical Romance's album \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\\" (which i actually like) because it actually more effectivly (and artisiclly) captures this mood. All lyrical criticisms aside, the music is not good either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows a lot of Promise","review":"This is the initial album for a fairly promising band. I do enjoy the emo genre and find this music very catchy and nice to listen to. The main complaint about this band is that their screamer sounds like they are going to puke all over the mic. Well i have news for you, screaming is not always a pleasant sound. I do agree its a little overdone on this album, but they did cut it back and they sound much better on their sophmore album \\"If only you were lonely\\" which is hitting stores tomorrow. So please if you didnt like them this time around, check out their new album, it shows much maturity and growth on their behalf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot damn...","review":"This cd is amazing. I, at first, didn't understand the meaning of screaming words that most the fans didn't understand, but now I know that it just makes the song way better. I love this band and their energy. They're so amazing. You won't regret getting this cd. You'll love it. No doubt. I would never ever return this cd and if I had to buy it again because I lost it or something (which wouldn't happen because I'd never let it out of my sight)..I'd sooo buy it again...no questions asked. So go buy it. You'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawthrone Heights","review":"Hawthorne Heights mixture of emo with a touch of screaming vocals, three guitar melodies, and electric energy is something to hear. Ohio Is For Lovers and Niki FM are great catchy songs, and the more you hear them the more you love it. My personal favorite though is, Silver Bullets. I love the way the they slow down the tempo for just a few seconds, then speed it right back up for the chorus. The album in its entirety is great, but the setup of their song gets a bit repetetive. They also put on a great live show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just short of being good...","review":"I first heard of Hawthorne Heights while watching MTV and thought ,\\"This doesn't sound too shabby.\\" However, upon listening more closely to the songs, I found it to be short of good. I, personally, am open to many types of music, but usually prefer alternative, hard rock, or punk rock. Hawthorne Heights seems to be a mix of all three, yet doesn't satisfy any of the categories. Some people might enjoy that aspect I suppose, but on another note...I really can't stand the background screaming in pretty much every track."},{"rating":"1","title":"for people who like pop emo","review":"This is a decent cd .

The guitar parts were barely audible as well as the drums, all I could hear was that voice and then a random scream that was close to making me gag. The production quality was fair, but I was so overwhelmed by the singer's voice and the lyrics...this isn't good, it's just overdone...too much..."},{"rating":"1","title":"these guys dont deserve to make \\"music\\"","review":"this album is horrible the lyrics r bland n everything a bad emo band write's so cut my wrist n black my eyes these guys dont have any real inspiration to write these horrible lyrics the screamer sounds like he has himroids the guitar playing is something u hear at a middle school talent show the vocals r horrible the drummer uses the same beat for every song the bass player makes sid viouis look like cliff burton aviod these album"},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"ok yea they pretty much suck and their songs do sound the same but the only reason i gave it a 2 is because the singer has an ok voice (when hes not screaming) but the music is really simple anyone can play it!! and thats a bad thinglateerrr"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new Senses Fail!!!!!","review":"I first heard the song \\"Ohio is for Lovers\\" and was immediately attracted to the band. I went out and bought the CD eager to listen to every song. At first I played the whole CD through once and didn't think the CD was going to be great. But as I was driving my car I gave the CD a second chance and boy did Hawthorne Heights grow on me!!! I now play every song on the CD all the way through and rock out to every song. Some people don't like the \\"different\\" screaming that goes on with Hawthorne Heights, but I think that it makes the songs twice as better. The screaming gives the songs more of a kick. I definitely recommend BUYING this CD if you have a couple of extra bucks to spare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"So-called emo at it's worst.

The musicianship is so incredibley bad it makes me laugh. These guys arn't even musicians the way I see it. The drums suck. You can't here the bass. The guitars (all 3 of them) suk equally. The vocalist is ok. When I was listening to this, and I was actually enjoying this one song a tiny bit, and then this idiot comes in screaming like he has to fart or something and ruins the song. Whhat the hell? when I asked my cousin what the hell was with all the pointless screaming after a couple of songs, he just looked at me and said, dude, it's an emo scream. And I just kept quiet and laughed to myself thinking what the hell? This band is turning punk rock into a fashion trend for little girls and stupid boys with no musical taste...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Trash","review":"I have no idea what was going through my head when I bought this. It's embarrasing to admit I own this CD. All the songs have the same sound and are filled with high pitched screaming that sounds like the lead singer is being put through some sort of unimaginable torture.

They sound exactly like atreyu,blink 182,underoath and all that other trendy poser bullsH*t kids are wasting their money on at the malls. Wait let me re phrase that,computer/download space they are wasting.(nobody buys cd's anymore,except me it seems). So if you are another one of those trendy,little Hot topic F**ks, go out and get this cd today!...I doubt you'll be listening to it in a year from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WISH I could like this...","review":"I truly want to like Hawthorne Heights. I want them to be the perfect Thursday replacement for Victory. But I just can't do it. The songs on this album musically, are outstanding, the first step to an amazing screamo experience. The lyrics are creative and interwoven well, artistically beautiful.Then, the screaming starts. And I'm being nice by calling it true screaming. It sounds more like he's trying to hurl out his entire insides, and frankly makes me want to do the same. And that's really all that's wrong with this album...they need someone who screams well...as strange as that sounds.\\"Niki FM\\" and \\"Ohio is for Lovers\\" are tracks I can generally make it all of the way through. I want to like \\"Dissolve & Decay\\" but usually can't quite get there. If you like Alexisonfire, you'll like Hawthorne Heights without reservation. If you prefer Thursday, I imagine you'll feel a bit like I do. Two disappointed little stars. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"regarding \\"a kids review\\" review","review":"wow your a dumbass. how is saying that hawthorne heights is good stating a fact. thats an opnion you stupid narrow minded prick. this music is horrible. every new emo band should all be shot. and you say (in this style of typing) \\"if u dont liek thyis you can goo listn to rap\\" wow.... your truly are stupid. the type of people who gave this band 1 star reviews are most likely to be rock fans realizing that new rock music is garbage. its the stupid brainwashed asses like you who cause trash bands like this to become famous. get a life and get some taste in music."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst albums ever!!!","review":"Seriously...this album is horrible and gives screamo a bad name (or worse name for those of you who don't like the genre). Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"the end is near","review":"Back in the day, the arrival of bands such as Warrant and Poison spelled the end of the 80s metal scene because they were so obviously a joke. The sheer crumminess of such bands served to open the door to Nirvana and weed out everyone who wasn't 100% legit, leaving a handful of bands like Metallica. A similar thing is beginning to happen now. Hawthorne Heights is so bad that one would be inclined to laugh, except this is no joke. They are merely representative of the tripe excreted by the industry at the moment. No one's listening. I mean, really - when the guy who has the screaming part of the lyric looks like the dude the geeks, nerds and dweebs picked on, how seriously can anyone take it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Crap, new title","review":"Misreable is the title I would give to this CD. Unfortunately a band with so much marketing power puts out a chunk of crap. The only song worth mentioning is \\"Ohio is for Lovers.\\" They sound like a garage band trying to who imitate finch or the other bands of the same genre. I believe the try to hard. Music in general has gone to nothing. Unfortunately the music world marks bands as punk. I havent heard anything that qualifies as punk that is played on the radio. Nice try, HH bring on some Simple Plan(Not Really they are worse)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcore classic?...hardly","review":"no, i'm not kidding, somebody actually had the nerve to call hawthorne heights a \\"modern hardcore classic\\". yeah, you just keep thinking that, okay? meanwhile, the rest of us will stick to the REAL modern classics like Thursday's \\"war all the time\\", UnderOath's \\"they're only chasing saftey\\" or Emery's \\"the weak's end\\". modern hXc classic? HA, thats funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"...And to think I used to somewhat like this band","review":"Yes, after hearing \\"Ohio Is For Lovers\\" I liked what I heard, but as the song kept being played more and more, the problems that Hawthorne Heights has with their songwriting became apparant, like that awful screaming for example, I mean I can (if I had to) scream better than that pathetic screamer. The lyrics are horrible, for example, \\"I'm outside of your window, with my radio\\" from Niki FM, what the **** does that mean? For some good emo, listen to Nural. At least the members of Nural know how to play and write good music. Yes, that includes learning to play their instruments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Band has potential but the pointless screaming ruins this CD","review":"You can clearly hear the Band's potential. Most of the songs have some melody, but the screaming makes it un-listenable. Screaming to express your anger or excitement may be ok on a few songs, but not every song -- and not when the screamer sounds like he's auditioning for a horror flick. You would think that the producer, a good friend, or even Mom and Dad would have provided some feedback on their sound. These guys are not Thursday. Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE SOMEBODY KILL THE GUY THAT KEEPS SCREAMING!!","review":"The sad thing is, is that this band has the potential to be really great, but they manage to ruin every single song with the worst screaming I have ever heard in my life! Why do all these bands think that screaming sounds good? Usually I can halfway tolerate it when bands have a song or two with a screaming part, but this guy sounds likes he's choking up a lung. Maybe they'll release an edited version without the screaming, then we can all sleep peacfully. Here's to hoping."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh, its ok..............","review":"first off, im not a kid.second, this album is only ok. the problem is theres nothing memorable here.when you think about \\"silence in black and white\\", you dont remember the guitars, drum, or the singers voice. all you here is the CONSTANT screaming!the screaming is way overdosed(and not very good to begin with). if they toned it down a bit, it could be better.these guys could be great, but they dont have an original sound at all. like i said before, nothings stands out enough that youll be hearing it in your head later.i suggest you buy from first to last if you want some good screaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound like everything else","review":"this band is no different from any new emo/pop/\\"punk\\" (punk died in the early 80s)bands i got the cd cuz they r from ohio and i live in zanesville. dont buy this unlike u like ohio is for lovers cuz most of the songs sound he same ohio is 4 lovers and nikki fm are almost exactly the same. y cant someone bring back real music?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Emo?","review":"Isn't emo that red character from Sesame Street?

Since then I've bought their second album, which is definitely better, but not perfect.

I listen to a lot of punk (PUNK, not pop-punk: Bad Religion, Sex Pistols, Ramones, Descendents), not emo, and this was something new for me. I picked up both of the albums, of course, listening to this one first. The first few songs were alright, at first. After track five, I decided to listen to the CD again. The tracks are practically all the same. The singer's voice is painful, the \\"emo\\" screams sound fake, the bass is pretty decent, actually. The guitar sounded repetitive, the drums were nothing special. There may be one or two decent songs on the album, the single obviously.

It doesn't fit when someone is singing and out of nowhere there is screaming. It sucks, for lack of a better term. It pains me to see bands like this gain recognition for being \\"emo\\". Jawbreaker was lightyears ahead of these frauds. I would even go as far as saying that Alkaline Trio's \\"Maybe I'll Catch Fire\\" record was better \\"emowise\\" then this.

Ok, i'll admit that the target audience for this is the 15-18 year old depressed emo kid demographic but come on, get a life, and go buy a Ramones album.What the worst part of this is that it goes around masquerading as punk. It's ok to admit that you listen to pop, but please don't try to pass this off as anything close to punk.I like to keep my negative reviews short and sweet, so in short avoid like the plague. If you fall into the 15-18 depressed emo kid in high school demographic, then it sucks to be you but you don't know any better. If your over 18 and like this, then your a media controlled tool. Quit reading this and go buy Minor Threat's Complete Discography. They are a real punk band, with real intensity and anger. Not manufactured bull crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"The day i heard this stuff i just wanted to wring my cousin for making me listen to it, it was terrible. It was her birthday and she received this album, she and her friend kept telling me how great it was so when i finally listened to it. The lyrics were immature, the music is something thats been done before, and the screaming was annoying. Not only was the screaming pointless, this is a punk band why was their a metal scream in the backround it gives you a headache. I'll give these guys 1 star for at least trying, but next time (if their is one) they better try harder."},{"rating":"1","title":"another weak trend","review":"this cd blows, musicianship is awful they scream like a bunch of bitches, but everyone loves it just casue its the considered cool. start listening to music with fn lightning solos like slayer or jason becker's perpetual burn this whole music scene now is just a goddamn joke"},{"rating":"1","title":"the most unorignal music trend","review":"This is exactly why emo doesnt get respect in music. It ALL sounds the same, everyone looks the same, the lyrics are lame, and that stupid screaming. Honestly I wouldnt be able to tell this band from any other emo band by just listening.

As a reviewer said earlier, emo was created in the 1980's, and was an offshoot of punk.So......Hawthorne Heights......hmmm. A kid at my summer camp, who some may call a \\"poser emo kid\\", said that Hawthorne Heights was bad. He, who has no idea what emo actually is, said that this band only \\"whined about losing girlfriends and cutting themselves\\"Add the crappy lyrical content to even worse music(very poor stylized screams, terrible instrumentation) and you get this.

Why not try it sometime. Sound like these guys or all the other people who scream in bands. It's not to easy. Their music is good. I mean they have 3 guitarist, come on people try playing guitar with 2 other people and tell me it's easy to get it all to sound right. I'm in a band my self I know how hard it is to put a band together. These guys might sound like a lot of other bands but it's the work that counts. If you don't like it.....don't listen to it. If everyone listen to what YOU like then it would be a very boring world. I see someone who said something about Thursday and Thrice being orginal screamo band. All I have to say is listen to Grade.

My opinion is that this is nothing but a bunch of depressed emo whining about ex-girlfriends. If a girl gets you that depressed you are a dam fool who should just off yourself. The whole emo scene just pisses me off, all they do is whine and complain. I like my music with a positive message, or a socially aware, or a pissed off message like Madball, Vision Of Disorder, Hatebreed, Biohazard, stuff like that.

I feel like a kid at a funeral, you know, where you're not supposed to laugh, but then someone says something so hilarious and it builds and you can't keep it in anymore. AHHH HHHAAAA HAAaah haa! This is too funny. Someone, please pass the Vicks, I'm getting a sore throat just listening to this! (And believe me, it's from the laughing... this is the funniest thing I've heard since the 80's).

I don't want to hear a song about his failure as a competent boyfriend. Maybe he should've stopped whining for a second and listened to what people are saying to him. And what's with Niki FM?

This is just another crappy screamo band with no talent. Iron Maiden had 3 guitarists at one point. Unlike this band, they made it work.

They're another band that appeals to the brainwashed MTV masses.

But overall it's a nice cd and a pretty good debut, they got some potential. a second cd would do better with a little less screaming and some better lyrics. There's no way they can reach bands like thursday or senses fail, but they're still a nice choice to listen to, but don't expect something revolutionary..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hawthorne Heights, a disgrace to rock music","review":"This CD is so sloppily made. The music has no appeal because the lyrics are crappy, the singer thinks his screaming is just as good as any other band (it's not though, he sounds stupid), and the chords are simply uninteresting. The only good part of this album is the chorus of Niki FM, which I really like for some reason. OTher than that, this CD is a complete failure and seems like the songs were written way too hastily. Basically Hawthorne Heights tries to find any melodic layout that hasn't been used yet and goes with it, whether or not it's any good.

The story is run-of-the-mill Christmas caper, i.e. Christmas is in danger of not happening and our heroes must make it happen.

Sit Boy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the only good season of inuyasha","review":"Inuyasha seson one is in my opinion the only good season of this anime....after that it gets kinda predictable and annoying,also in a lot of the episodes they use still frame shots which I absolutely despise in anime.....all in all its a four star show up untill about episode 50...after that I would move on to better animesuch ashellsingexcel sagaakiraspirited awaynow and then here and thereneon genesis evangelionoutlaw starfooly coolylast exileranma 1/2paranoia agentanything else from satoshi konany and all miyazaki moviescowboy bebopsamurai xsamurai champloowolfs raingunslinger girlinuyasha is okay....the one reason to keep watching is that kagome is hot....also I liked the manga better"},{"rating":"1","title":"The anime that wont die","review":"I'll keep this really short. Always hated the show until recently. Started watching it, realized how shallow and derivative it is and still enjoy it. But the asking price is absolutely absurd. Watch it for free online."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie Was Awsome!","review":"I loved the firt Season it was totally awsome. I missed watching them so thats why i got it, the box set came in early wich helped me alot and I am glad it did. The First Season is worth it and the Price was really good to. :D :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"I ordered this not expecting much for 9$ but it arrived wayy before expected delivery date and is as said. new, still wrapped and perfect condition. this box set is only the episodes and nothing more but thats perfect considering the episodes seperatly would cost 3 times as much and the picture quality is great. Me and my fiance love inuyasha so i ordered this as a suprise for her and it even suprised me when it got here! if your looking at this set and wondering if you should get it. GET IT!! you wont regret it :D for the price and all the episodes you get and the quality..i would rate this way more stars if i could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Ok, the first episode i saw was 'return to the place when we first met' and i was confused about if Inuyasha and Kagome were a couple or not. So i brought the season 1 and 2 box set to find out but the characters, battles, and romance caught my attention that i fell in love. Inuyasha started out as a selfish, immature, smart-ass, careless, and bold but by the end of season 2 he was still all of them but less. He still my favorite charater.Im really want to know if Inuyasha and Kagome get 2gether. I just started watching it so im sure all of you know the answer. So please dont tell me! im ordering season 3 and 4 next week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price x3","review":"For the price, this is a amazing deal. I mean, look at most anime. It usually runs for 20$ at least for 30 or less episodes. And InuYasha runs for around 40$ usually xD So yeah..The quality is good and though you may not get as much bonus stuff as you would with the expensive box sets, you get the episodes for a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent start to any Inuyasha fan's collection","review":"The season 1 DVD box set of Inuyasha contains the first 27 episodes of the show. These episodes can be viewed in either English or Japanese. Subtitles are only in English. This boxset is in my opinion a great start for any fan of Inuyasha who wants to collect the episodes.Specifically, this box set focuses mainly on introducing the main characters of the show. The journey begins! This boxset is nice because it's MUCH cheaper than if you were to buy the episodes seperately. The extras are lacking, but I never really minded because I only bought this for the episodes themselves. Inuyasha is my second favorite anime. The story is very interesting as are the characters. I recommend this box set to any fan of Inuyasha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Satisfied :)","review":"I recently purchased Season 1 of InuYasha and I couldn't be more satisfied with it. The product itself was in excellent condition and arrived at my home earlier then I thought it would! It was an excellent find and I intend to keep purchasing more items from this site; first to complete my InuYasha collection :))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I was so excited when I got the first season to Inuyasha. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to have to buy every single DVD of inuyasha (with fewer episodes on each individual DVD at that). The only downside is the wait for the second season."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm ashamed that I like this","review":"Come on! This is an animated soap opera with enough cheese to construct a second moon. But I love it. I don't know what it is...the demons and fight scenes...but I can't stop watching this show. I'm a huge fan of adult swim and this show was always on after Sea Lab or Aqua Teen and I started watching it one day and haven't stopped since. I even bought this...the first season and now have to hide my face in shame that I've succumbed to such nerdery. I was in the book store the other day and my friend punched me in the face because I had absent mindedly picked up an illistrated Inyuasha book. He was like, you freakin geek and left. I don't know why I like this show, but I really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Present","review":"This was an awesome present. Some annoying translation issues (people say ye instead of you a fair amount) it is a great series that we've been enjoying quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 1 InuYasha","review":"This is not the larger box set, but it is a box set and does include all of the episodes and is a lot less expensive. Very good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long live InuYasha!","review":"Season 1 on DVD is a must-have for any InuYasha fan. To find out or remind yourself how it all began there's nothing better. 27 episodes, 1st movie trailers, textless opening and ending songs, character relations chart... It's all there! Plus the sound and image quality doesn't get much better than that. I've bought it and it left me thirsty for more with it's action and humourous \\"sit boy!\\"'s. It's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome!!!!!","review":"Inu Yasha deserves 10,20 or 30 stars. This is just one GREAT anime. It just does'nt get much better than this.

Inu Yasha,all I can say is \\"TOTALLY AWESOME\\"!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"Although the price seems a little steep this is a great deal over-all. The DVD's were in perfect condition and the package doesn't take up much shelf space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inuyasha rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"InuYasha is a great anime but not my favorite(my favorite anime is One Piece). If you already seen these episodes in English, just watch it in Japanese with English subtitles. This anime is recommed to teenagers(13+). The manga is rated Older Teens(16+).InuYasha's JP voice was done by the same person who did Usoop's(character from One Piece) JP voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deaf and hard of hearing fans","review":"The boxset is not closed captioned. Amazon is wrong about it. Though, it is subtitled, not perfect, but better than nothing. Viz have not learned that there's also deaf fans watching anime genre. Boxset 2 is the same way.If you still love Inuyasha, subtitles will be alright for you, just be prepared for no emotion or background noise being subtitled."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Choice","review":"Inuyasha is a very popular anime....nuff said. I would recommend this boxset among all the rest, because the show tends to ramble...alot. If u watch the first season you'll want to watch more but trust me, unless u juss want to see inuyasha get afew powers and never complete their main quest then go ahead, watch the other 6 or so seasons, but I recommend this one atleast."},{"rating":"2","title":"great series","review":"This is a really great and fun series to watch! It has romance, action, great fight scenes, mystery, is really funny, and it so much fun to watch. It also shows a lot of Japanese culture. I love this series! I recommend that you watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC ANIME","review":"A very long running anime series, InuYasha is entertaining. I recommend the whole series. The storylines are not very deep , basically just adolescent relationships and simple plots involving fighting off evil monsters, witches, demons, that stand in the way of InuYasha and his traveling companions finding the missing shards of the mystic jewel, but the stories are fun and you know who the good guys are. The action is fast and intense, and the fight scenes are exciting without being too bloody. It also has some sentimental moments, and a lot of humor as well. I'd recommend it for teenagers and older.- Mike S."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was excited to get a Pilates for men workout, but when I ordered this I hadn't realized it was by a woman.I guess what I mean is I expected a tougher, drill sargent. I know that's not really what Pilates is but it made me feel like I was doing a womanly workout. I guess I wanted something a little more fast piced, this bored me to death. I couldn't get through the entire thing the first time because Lindsey's voice annoyed the hell out of me. I am extremely disappointed with this, the only redeeming quality about this dvd is the 15 minute workout at the end. What a waste 0f $22."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports loving Doctor loves this DVD","review":"As a sports lover who has suffered many injuries, and is looking for alternatives which can stimulate and strengthen without causing further damage, I have found this DVD [a gift from my wife] the exact thing I was looking for, and the exercises within it surprisingly challenging. The relaxation section is also excellent. The explanations are very clear to follow, and if you are like me and don't like to exercise with music in the background - it may be switched off and replaced with your own choice of music... excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"For the most part, a good workout, but I wish the main workout was divided into separate scenes to give you some flexibility in customizing your workout.She's not as annoying to listen to as some reviewers claim."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring.","review":"this dvd was too easy and boring for me. wasn't any different than any other pilates dvd i've watched. Not geared for men. just labeled that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"I purchased this book to help my granddaughters learn to read.

Thank you for sending this book in such a timely manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck happened here!","review":"I'm not a movie expert. I just like Movies.....This film has lots of well known actors. But the thing that strikes me is: 1) The sound is wrong, 2) the cutting is wrong, 3) the direction is wrong, 4) post production editing is wrong.....When you watch this it seems like it could be a good movie, but it just does not make it. Never seen a film with so many A/B list actors that was so poorly made. Just sad really....."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum","review":"If you are a Seagal fan looking for an exciting action flick you might want to try something else.

This is never explained and therefore can only be seen as unintentional, a mistake. Tom Sizemore looks like he's depressed to be in this movie and he phones in his whole performance. All the actors look depressed to be in this movie, like they stepped in you-know-what. Peter Greene, who is usually a really good actor, seems like he is half asleep. None of the action scenes make any sense. I even think they had another actor replace Tom Sizemore's voice in the scene where he is driving over the Golen Gate bridge. The whole film is shot in close-ups which totally disconnect you from whatever place they are supposed to be in. Awful movie. This film is a funny example of how NOT TO MAKE A FILM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Film. . . .","review":"The acting was beyond sup-par. I have no idea what Dennis Hopper was thinking when taking this film. Don't be fooled by Nas appearing on the cover, he's dead between the 2nd and 3rd chapter of the disc. All the acting in this film was a huge disappointment. The story line, action sequences all horrible. . .The only thing good out of this whole ordeal was it was a Blockbuster rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful waste of good talent......disappointing.","review":"I watch this movie thinking it would another Speed type film, which is a compliment, but this was bad. Bad meaning why would anyone have big names like this and squander it with bad script and direction. Dennis was so unbelievable even trying to act like a lunatic bomber, if that is even possible given that he did such a wonderful job in Speed. Now i am a big Seagal fan but why is he moving his lips so much in this movie when he is not doing the dialog? Was that even intentional or he forgot his chapstick cause i can't even tell. There is some suspense so i'll give it that but it didn't hold my interest enough because at this point, i really didn't care.Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundtrack question","review":"I am interested in knowing about any soundtrack information associated with Steven Segal's TICKER.

There are extras in this movie that have longer roles than [Nas]. Steven Seagal give his normal acting performance, a really bad one. He tries to be a Zen master but ends up sounding like a (...) that quit school after 2nd grade. The only good thing about this movie is the explosions, if you want plot don't come here, you won't find anything that could even be called a distant cousin of plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor waste of film","review":"This is the first movie I ever saw where I believe the actors didnt care and made up thier lines.

I did read the earlier review that warned that the songs were in their original keys, not C. But having been classically trained (albeit eons ago), I figured I could handle it. I also bought some staff paper figuring I'd transpose any in keys I didn't want to struggle through. Well, unless you're really at ease and skilled playing in any key, I'd recommend going with a book in the key of C. I still give it 4 stars, however, because it's a great book in terms of content, and I bought it with my eyes open.

So, in actuallity I loved the whole CD. After I saw the movie, I loved it even MORE. The other day, I was working out and I wanted some loud fun rock music to play. I went through my CD collection and pulled this dusty three year old disc out. I played it and now I've got those old songs in my head! It brought back a bunch of memories too.

I got home all excited about a new toy only to find out the remote control was dead. It did nothing. I could only use the buttons on the side of the frame. I had the remote replaced via an RMA with Pacific Digital and when I installed my memory card again, the firmware for the LCD was hosed. All the screen says is \\"PC-RGB No SYNC\\" and then shuts back off. It's a paperweight now. I have asked for a new MV-800 as a replacement.

Even though I scaled the pictures to 800x600 about 140kB each, plain vanilla JPEG.* it is not recognized by my Windows XP box so I cannot put pictures on the internal memory. No driver disk is provided and no drivers are available on the manufacturer's web site.* picture quality is dissapointing. Bright highlights are washed out. The dynamic range is pretty poor.

This picture frame is limted to displaying 512 images MAXIMUM, if you have more images than that, they may display, but the ability to repeat or re-loop them will fail. The manual does list this limitation, however you will not know this until after you purchase it, so I feel it is my duty to warn you in advance.

My pictures look fine on my computer, but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc. (although I found that it the picture could be adjusted, it was never mentioned in the manual). The manual is, because of the comment above, disgustingly incomplete. If not going through the bother of returning it through Amazon because I purchased it on line, I would not have kept it. I actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse, otherwise I would have given it only one star.

I contacted the company and was initially told that \\"ISO 9000 standards\\" allow the LCD to have 3-4 bad pixels. After spending $200 on the product, I pushed and got them to send me a replacement. I waited about 3 weeksand was once again disappointed to find out that the new replacement also had three bad pixels... in completely different places on the screen.I tried to live with that because I loved the concept of a digitial frame. However, when I moved the frame to dust behind it, the entire screen went white and I have not been able to resolve it or see my images.The company does not seem at all concerned with customer satisfaction and I will be issueing a chargeback with the credit card company. This item is not worth $200. Save yourself the trouble and do not buy it... or anything from Pacific Digital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice piece of Junk","review":"I purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend. I will start out by saying that when I first purchased this frame, I loved it. The display, contrast and brightness were great.However, after 5 short months, the display's pixels started acting funny. They get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage. Turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about 60 seconds and then it's back to bad pixels.Myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue. In conclusion - it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifetime: Two Months","review":"Received as a Christmas present, dead by February 24.

A lot packed in one book. We are absolute beginners so Wendy Lin's books was a bit more realistic for us. It may be more helpful for those who already speak Chinese at home with their parents and their parents can help them. Otherwise it was a bit over our heads.The books are in color. The tapes are all in Chinese except for some instructions. So you basically have to have the book in front of you to practice and learn.I like the sentences and phrases. They are all relevant to most children.

The TV created interference that overwhelmed the IR sensor and generated too strong a signal in the IR flasher that the TiVo wouldn't accept. I could get it to work intermittently by wrapping the IR flasher in paper to degrade the signal, but then it wouldn't work for the first minute after turning on the TV. It also wouldn't work if I pointed the remote directly at the IR receiver. I had to point it off axis to make it work.After talking with an infrared hardware expert where I work, I instead purchased a XANTECH 49085DKit LCD-Proof Designer Micro Link Infrared Kit, which is specifically designed to filter out interference from LCD TV's and compact fluorescent lights. It works perfectly no matter what direction I point the remote, and I'm a lot happier now.I recommend buying this instead:XANTECH 49085DKit LCD-Proof Designer Micro Link Infrared Kit"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thief of Hearts or A heart of gold","review":"Nothing exciting ever happens to Miss Penelope Hamilton.

Owen Kendrick is beginning to suspect that the lovely, seemingly guileless Pen has some secrets of her won.

The Smithees are an award show put on at gaming conventions like Orgins.

Of all the movies the group saw and we watched movies for a long time this was the worst. It is up in 2007 Orgins Smithee 5 year award which means it has the ability to be the worst over the last 5 years. So if you are looking for a classic B movie this is not it.However if you want pointless nudity, no plot at all, hard to follow script (ladies the men in this movie are not that hot and mostly over ugh) this is your film.

This is in no way, shape or form even close to being good. You never even see what the actors shoot at. All they do is stop walking and fire there guns. Then they start to walk again. You think that the director would at least show the Chupacabra before the shots started. Or at least running away from the bullets.The fights are just as bad. Ok, the girls that fight in this film do a bad job. You kind of expext that. But the guys aren't much better.

There could be more color images too. This would have been a great book had they made use of the size and done a better layout between text and image, as all books on artist should be. It also seems like they've left out a lot of good stuff the should have had room for.

It is a great book to read (or give as a gift) when you lose someone you love. And it's an eye-opener for our own \\"life\\" experiences. The irony is that it teaches some of the same messages about God you hear in traditional churches but it makes sense of God in a way I've never felt before.

As I've progressed and encounted other texts and sources of information, I've been able to augment and enhance the foundation that I built with \\"A World Beyond\\". I'm not saying that everything written is completely true, but I do urge anyone and everyone to read this book and let your spirit guide you in determing what's accurate. I've reread this book many times and each time I go back, the new information I've learned helps open up understanding of little bits of information that I may have missed on my first or second read-through.

I consider it to be a cardinal sin to artifically alter recorded music, and this recording is the worst case I can think of. My other complaint is the placement of the microphones. The various instrument groups are spotlighted, especially the woodwinds.Am I the only one who noticed the artificial vibrato? I know it's not my imagination. Why can't people hear these things?

I know this came on the heels of \\"Breaking Silence\\", so everyone expected a moody noir piece - but its refreshing to hear Ian's most commercial material, with choruses you can sing along to, lyrics with insight, the works! Of all her albums, this has to be my favorite, because I can play it tooling around in my car, right next to Back Street Boys and Puff Daddy.

The sheer depth and breadth of her work is amazing. Sharing her birth year, and, it seems, a bit of her attitude towards life, I can very well relate to her work as it has grown over her career and lifetime.

However, I personally found several of them to be stilted and generally uninteresting, and even though I have a strong interest in the subject, they failed to hold my attention.

Okay, I'll probably always wonder how the author's love of boxing was deemed worth inclusion, but then I wonder why the entire book was printed. I feel suckered! And can't think of anything to recommend this book. My advice is to spend your money on ANYTHING written by M.F.K.

For instance, for a low budget film, we certainly don't see a lot of the crappy acting or the badly coordinated video/cgi shots. The CGI looks great and I must admit that at times I got over excited myself and thought that it was real. And we all have to admit that we didn't get movie with people having crappy lines and acting them out badly.

It is very thought provoking and makes us think about society and ourselves. It should also relate to us, by having good characters and a good story. Special effects can only highten the experience, but special effects alone can't make a movie, and that's what WING COMMANDER does.Sure, it can be fun and it has great special effects, but it has bad characters, played by actors who can't seem to get the parts down, only because they were handed a bad script.YOU WILL LIKE THIS IF: You are looking for a fun movie with good special effects and a lot of action.YOU WILL HATE THIS IF: You enjoy thought provoking Science Fiction with good characters, good story, and a good script.BOTTOM LINE: Don't take it seriously, or you will not enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the game series has been scarred","review":"Here's the deal, I actually LOVE the video games.

Avoid this one.

Most of it's passable at least, I think. Come on, there are a lot of movies with far worse acting. The special effects aren't cutting edge, but the movie was low budget, and the ships looked a lot more realistic than the glossy starships and resorts in other Science-Fiction films. And I won't say this movie is bad because it's not exactly like the games; That doesn't have anything to do with whether it is good or not. Like it or not, I think this movie is good. Or fun, at least.

The beginning sequence of the game, Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger had more believable animatronic Kilrathi rather than the poorly done slow moving armor bearing CGI variety. I guess in the Earth/Kilrathi war all the Marines are dead, and the pilots (who are supposed to just be flying) take on the role of boarding enemy ships in full Marine armor. Who designed those ships? I was waiting for the deck crews to spin the prop on the nose section to get the thing started. They could have used the game designs. They were at least more believable. The TCS Tiger's Claw looked more like a WWII submarine, rather than a space carrier. That's what you get when you put a game director in a real director's chair.

Her review was one of the best, most succinct, not to mention funniest movie reviews I've ever heard.

They explained that they were \\"God Like\\" with there abilities but they didn't say what they did to upset everyone if anything. They just needed to put a conflict between a high ranking oficer and the main character that his abilities will come into play later on in the movie which will save everyone and all will be forgivin. I like the fact that they based the ships and the plans after WW2 subs and planes. that was pretty nice but other than that....I can't think of one good reason why anyone would want to rent or buy this movie.

If you are looking for a great Sci Fi film with fantastic acting, great character development, etc., then you are in the wrong place. This is a B movie where most of the actors are unkowns. They do their best to pull off their one dimensional characters and for the most part are passable. There are exceptions both good and bad. There are a few big name actors who help carry the story, but most of the major actors are not that great, just like you'd expect in a B movie. I watch this movie every few years, partly because I was a fan of all of the Wing Commander games and I like how this sometimes tells part of the story (yes I know there are differences, but I'm not bothered by that as some are). Besides that, it's just a fun, little adventure. A guilty pleasure for a Sci Fi fan like me.

The movie also includes \\"Deep Blue Sea's\\" Saffron Burrows. Any way, the plot of the movie is kind of lame. It's just about two fighter Soldiers (Lillard, Prinze) fighting in war against an evil cult of Aliens. The movie is hardly realistic with Freddie Prinze Jr's character. He is supposed to be a large big hero, but infact, usually in warcraft there is really not a big hero. Matthew Lillard (maniac) is some silly pilot who never gets a second chance.

Instead, well, he gets carried away with a bunch of senseless content. Next time (if there is one) they should make sure a person who can direct is in charge.

I tried to take the movie on its own terms, but just couldn't let go of the fact that the material had taken a step down from its roots rather than a step up (for comparison, look at TV's atrocioius intrepretation of You Don't Know Jack). I still can't figure why they went with different actors. McDowell, Hamill, Wilson and the others in the game at least lent a gave a sense of gravity to the events swirling around them. The ships looks better in the game, and even, dare I say it, the Kilrathi. Bottom line: Boot your PC up in DOS mode (if you still remember how) and pop in WingCommander 3 or 4.

Second, the fight scenes, in the gun battle on the Kilrathi ship the fighting just wasn't intense enough for me. there wasn't a sense of ergency that I was expectiong. It would have also been cool to see what the Kilrathi looked like in thier fighters and see thier perspective. Lastly the ending. I was left a little dissapointed.

This movie, however, fails to offer anything worthwhile. It does not follow the perfectly good plot outlined in the computer games (the most recent of which are true interactive movies), instead substituting a story so flimsy and cheap that a bright 4th grader could have written it. The special effects and sound effects are truly wretched, and quite obviously computer-generated. The spaceflight sequences are unrealistic, and seem to be reminiscent of the old Flash Gordon movies, where you could see the string holding up the rocket ship. The Kilrathi, the aliens, look like shaved cats that have been lightly scorched. In the computer games, the Kilrathi parts are played by actors in costumes that look something like bipedal tigers (with full hair).

What I can't respect is a script which seemed to be written by a student in remedial high school English, and performances which seemed to be some kind of therapy for severe personality disorders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus 5 stars","review":"This movie wanders into unchartered territory of horrid movies. I honestly could not keep my eyes open, it dragged on and on. Boring, goofy, stupid and pitiful. The only scene worth watching was the part where the hero dies,because I felt at least some justice existed in this dumb movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps one of the worst movies of all time","review":"Not only did this movie lack a plot and depth, but was further more boring and long. I went to see this movies in the theaters only to leave half way though crying from laughter at how simply awful it was. I am not a particular gamer buff or sci-fi fanatic but in going to see this movie I was expecting some special effects. You know a spaceship battle or two some aliens, maybe a explosion or two, instead what I got was a plot that was next to random, a handful of characters that were dislikable, and some cheezy love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXCELLENT PICTURE AND SOUND, BUT LACKS PLOT AND CHARACTERS","review":"This DVD depicts a fictional battle for the earth between the \\"Confederation\\" and the \\"Kilrabi\\" (Think the Federation and the Klingons). The movie is visually stunning with excellent definition and color saturation. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Soundtrack is of reference quality and one of the best I have heard on DVD. Unfortunately, the plot is very poorly developed and the movie is populated by people who you care absolutely nothing about. The story is almost non-existent. This is a disc you rent to enjoy for its wonderful soundtrack which really defines the benefits of 5.1 digital sound, but after having seen it once you don't need to own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"they should have built around the game...","review":"I am totally disappointed with this movie. It's one of the worst DVDs in my entire collection. After \\"bonding\\" with the original characters from playing hours/days/weeks of the Wing Commander games, they had to use some other bunch of actors and some other sound track... If they even attempt to make a remake of this...they must use the original people before I even watch the trailer... The games really had better sound and effects...how sad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST FILM EVER MADE. EVER.","review":"Geez, this film was bad. Take the hideously awful acting of Plan 9 from Outer Space, the annoying dialogue of Star Wars Episode 1, and the pitiful plot of Friday the 13th-- you'll get an idea of just how bad Wing Commander really is. It's far inferior to any of the films I previously mentioned; in fact, the only good thing about the film is the score. While the music is commendable, it does not change the movies mood whatsoever. I found myself laughing in the theatre after many of the lines. Pitiful, pitiful. If you liked this film, please do not write any screenplays and do not, by any means, reproduce."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can keep the money, I just want my two hours back.","review":"This is a bad movie. Plain and simple. The plot is barely existent, and the acting is either bad or melodramatic.

Glad to find it on dvd. Only problem is that the picture does not go to full screensize on my laptop. It only gives you a picture 1/2 to 1/3 screen size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!Outstanding!Wing Commander is brilliant!","review":"Wing Commander is a masterpiece. The movie has an intriging plot with amazing special effects. The only problem I have with it is that the Kilrathi look a little funny. No matter, a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really Wing Commander?","review":"I mean I saw more special effects (not to mention actual Kilrathi) and talent in the game than in this movie. The kitties looked like statues and stiff. Only through a lot of sequals could this series ever hope to redeam itself. Can't see how Mr. Roberts could imagine this movie would be taken in by the game players of WC3 and WC4. You'll get more enjoyment playing those two games than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite possibly the worst ever...","review":"Okay, we were in Nashville and I wanted to see a movie that had the Episode 1 preview before it. The girl at the box office said that Wing Commander was the only one that had it. She obviously didn't know what she was talking about because it wasn't on there. If only it had I could have justified the money I spent on seeing this really awful movie. We applauded when one of the main characters was killed. We almost got up and left, but one of my friends was taking a nap and we didn't want to disturb him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Submarines Spotted Off Earth Orbit","review":"Despite the fact that Wing Commander is basically just a World War II submarine movie flung into the future, it's still very good. I was disappointed with the Kilrathi costumes (the ones in the game are better), but I loved the starships and the human costumes. I was really impressed with the special effects and script as well. I can, however, see where some people might think this movie wasn't all that good. The casting was slightly less than ideal, and fans of the game (myself included) would most likely be disappointed that the movie lacked Mark Hamill, John Rhys-Davies and Malcom McDowell. I, however, feel that David Suchet and Matthew Lillard more than makes up for their absence. So, aside from the costumes and the casting (though the acting was excellent), I see absolutely no problems with Wing Commander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dispensable, Plotless, Redundant","review":"If they were trying to kill the whole Sci-Fi genre by using some of the most listless actors ever on screen, well - congratulations! I'm sure kids will flow back to the game, just as they were supposed to, I suspect.The DVD is of good technical quality. Unfortunately even that potential bonus is wasted in the hopelessness of the whole project.Way too expensive for something you wish you could forget while still actually watching it for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"How I wasted 90 minutes of my life","review":"Why did I watch this movie through to the end? Well I bought and played the first 3 wing commander games and enjoyed them immensely. I felt I owed the memory of those games a full viewing, I was wrong. Apart from some occasional good special effects the story line was crass and the acting was dubious. The Kilrathi hardly featured and when they did they looked like something out of a bad 50's b-movie. They are supposed to be heartless, warrior cat like beings, but are about as scary as miss piggy.Blair is half pilgrim on his mothers side. People generally don't like or trust pilgrims and bad mouth him and his father because of it. He is a rapier pilot and must be reasonably intelligent, and yet it took Paladin, another pilgrim, to tell him the most basic historic facts as to what a pilgrim actually is.

It sometimes does the trick, it sometimes makes you sick. As a professional bike mechanic, I have pulled thorns out of tubes with slime and it sometimes holds the air and sometimes a small green puddle hisses at you, almost making fun of you for filling your ties with something that looks like antifreeze and has the consistency of snot. There are more effective and lightweight latex tire fillers commonly used on tubeless tires that I have pulled countless thorns out of with no leakage, but to me the best possible fix are Rema patches. Never once, when properly applied, have I had one of those fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Real Difference","review":"I've used about four of these things and haven't noticed an appreciable difference between a good regular tube. I have had two blow immediately (one within a couple of days and yesterday after five hours). When the second one blew it left a large amount of bright green slime all inside my tire and over the inside of the rim. Real fun to clean off on a long ride. Won't be purchasing these again, feel it's mostly hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Slime Lite as pictured","review":"Amazon has a picture of Slime Lite tubes, but shipped regular slime tubes.

I don't know, I'm staring at one now after biking through thorns last week. Apparently a slow leak that's gone flat over a week. But, isn't that what the slime tube was supposed to prevent? I guess the argument is it could have gone flat on the mountain. Kinda like the absence of something happening is the value statement for why you should believe in something that appears to accomplish nothing good. A faith-based belief in Slime.I've used them on my MTBs for a long time, but I'm done with their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than a normal tube!","review":"No visible thorns or punctures, my new tube developed two tiny, tiny pinholes within the first 5 miles of use. The slime did not seal these holes at all. The holes were so small, I was just dumfounded at the difference between the claims of this product and the actual, miserable results. There might as well have been water in the tube. When I tried to fix the holes with self stick and then normal patches, the slime prevented the patches from adhering to the tube. A waste of time and money using these awful tubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"False sense of security","review":"ve been stranded twice by these tires. Sure it can fix some flats but if you get a pinch flat (common in the rockies) it doesn't work.

This is a MUST read for anyone who is trying to free themself from the hold that panic/anxiety attacks have on their life. Yes, it is a \\"workbook\\" but it doesn't feel like work. It really does feel like Dr. Carbonell is with you each step of the way supporting and comforting you while empowering you with the knowledge to move forward. If you are like me then you've made many hospital visits and most likely have been to the E.R. ( and not just once). Panic attacks are scary and the anticipation of the next one can be paralyzing.

Truly being on your employee's side, listening to them, trusting them and helping them grow and achieve. You'll never go wrong. I re-read this book to help me remember these truths when times get tough. Also, the professional editorial Amazon includes for this book is a bunch of hogwash in my opinion.

In a corporate fairy-tale approach, the protagonist, a big, bad \\"abominable no-man\\" manager, suffers a near-death experience and is subsequently guided by an angel through his transformation into a manager with heart.Please. If this is intended for real corporate managers and executives, why tell bad fairy stories? It makes the overall message much less appealing and far less likely to be taken seriously!I gave it two stars, instead of one or none, because the underlying concepts do have *some* merit. However, this one really isn't worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much on where to eat and stay","review":"The maps in this book were nice. 4 or 5 maps of different sections of the city and one nice subway map.

I'm still using the original blade that came with it. I've never tried to make sausage.I was shocked at how low the reviews were. This machine is not made to grind bones. It's a meat grinder. It does have a small feed tube so your chunks need to be 1\\" cubed to make it easier to feed. Not sure what else to say. It's a meat grinder that grinds meat and still works after 4 years.

These Men are in my opinion the finest thing in British Pop to come state-side in a very long time. Once you hear songs like \\"The Drowners\\" and \\"The Living Dead\\" you become a fan for life.

I'll probably avoid any Slime brand products from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scab repairs leak air","review":"I've got a couple of these scab on a couple of tubes and I see that most leak. At first they work, but they don't seem to handle inflation and deflation very well, they don't stretch with the tube.All the other types of patches I've ever used worked.Not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply doesn't work","review":"I had a small punture that was about 1/3 cm wide. I followed the instructions and used the patch after I roughened up the area. It looked like it was sealed properly, but within 12 hours the tire was flat again. I tried it again and this time I gave it a day to stick before I inflated the tire. It worked a little better, but still got flat. The only reason why I gave this product 2 stars is because the tire levers included makes it a whole lot easier to remove and replace the tire."},{"rating":"1","title":"only work for a while","review":"Have used it two times, one leak after a few hour of rideanother after a few days.Bubble will form under the patch and eventually reach the edge and leak.Difficult to remove to use normal patch. Will just torn to pieces.Good for temp fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"Tried to use yesterday on a bike ride. Tiny hole. Would not hold air after 25 pounds. Don't buy. Lucky I had spare tube with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"Absolutely terrible, leaked right away, i tried repatching it 3 times. The hole was not that big, the last time i tried using 4 at once all overlapping, did not help."},{"rating":"1","title":"PFFFsst! about half the time.","review":"These work about half the time, which is no fun on the road. The rubber cement style patches work better, but take longer. Use the Park Tool patches. They are far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't work","review":"I bought a pack of these once, and it was one of the worst purchases of my life. In short, after applying an entire pack of the things to the same leak the tube still would not hold enough air for me to move more than a few meters and I wound up walking 8 miles with loaded panniers--not an experience I'd recommend. Go with a proper vulcanizing patch set. The time you save in applying these you'll lose many fold in repeated attempts to patch the same leak before finally giving up and walking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small puncture unfixable","review":"Used as instructed and could not even get back home, had to push bike for 2 miles in the middle of the night. Not fun at all, got home and used some old patches with proper liquid vulcanizer and presto, fixed.Do not ever purchase any type of bike flat repair kit that does not include liquid vulcanizer, there is simply no way to get around using it for a proper fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked after 1st ride.","review":"Great idea, but they don't work. I applied scab to a tiny puncture. Tire held air overnight. I rode to work but when I came out to go home tire was flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"How quickly we fail...","review":"I was initially enthusiastic about these \\"scabs\\". I followed the instructions carefully but in two repairs, both failed. Don't let these strand you somewhere--they may seem to be working at first. It took 2 weeks for my repairs to prove futile. Oh well, back to the drawing board!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patches have never held","review":"I've used 3 of the patches and they have never been able to maintain a seal. I would look for either a better pre-glued patch or go for the ones you have to add the glue."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"These are a waste of time and money - tried using them to repair a 1mm hole in the inner tube for my road bike, but to no avail. Tried applying them, and immediately inflating (after putting tube back in the tire). Tried waiting before inflating. Either way, it didn't matter, because these didn't fix the leak. I'm just lucky I wasn't on the road when the repair was needed, and that I had the time to test out their reliability, of which there is NONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work!!!!","review":"OK,Used these patches on two seperate scooter tires. Followed directions and the patch seemed to stick perfectly. As soon as air pressure was applied the patch let go, and this happen twice!!!! Also tried using one on my son's little duck bathtub, the next day the duck was dead. Horrible product. Stick with the old glue and rubber patch, you can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Sang","review":"Though there were many beautiful songs , I found it to be a beautiful album and Dion's best yet. The Titanic theme was enough to get me hooked. Also another beautiful song Love you more"},{"rating":"1","title":"some great some terrible","review":"I absolutely LOVE Celine. But her approach in some of these songs is just too much generic pop. Two of favorite songs are on there as well (My Heart Will Go On and To Love You More). But most are just too tiring or boring to listen to. We played this CD in the car on a roadtrip and we'd keep saying, \\"do you wanna skip this one?\\" to eachother. That doesn't say much for it, does it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"anything celine sings is number 1. she has the best voice in the world. i dont think there is anyone who can beat her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celine is beautiful, with a voice to match","review":"The album is simply the best ever, every tracks evoke the emotions of love and happiness, with her hauntingly beautiful vocals surpassing any before. The album of the decade!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Talk About Crap","review":"You might like the songs, the overplayed titanic song and all that. Once in a blue moon she sells a good record like her last one but this one was out on an ordinary moon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever try again Mrs. Dion!","review":"I wonder whose idea was that to create a NEW Barbra Streisand out of Celine Dion? He/she should have made the mistake of his entire life...This album may be commercial, I say nothing to that,BUT why does she shout so often even though she doesn't have a proper voice? And I DO think she doesn't know where to emphasize the words so the lyrics sound so awkward!(ex : \\"Thatch\\" instead of \\"that\\"! - My Heart will go on)She should take two lessons :1. English 2. Singin'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this stupid cd","review":"Celine Dion is a great example of the typical garbage that passes for popular music today. Her bland vocal delivery and heartless lyrics combine to make some of the most boring music of the decade. Her songs are overplayed and completely devoid of any type of meaning. Instead of blowing money on this cd just eat a piece of cardboard, you'll get about as much out of that as her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and laborious","review":"I never expect much from a Celine Dion CD, but can someone explain to me why 'My Heart Will Go On' is so popular? The melody is mind-numbingly repetitive, matched by familiar, insipid lyrics. And as usual Ms. Dion is too eager to show off her powerful voice. I don't understand why some people would find her music soothing. An assault on the ear drums is more like it. I thought 'I will Always Love You' was loud and laborious before I heard Celine Dion."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it 0 stars but thats not an option!","review":"I never particularly liked Celine but this CD is absolutely horrible. I am a teenager and my mom bought this CD for herself. I used to have to listen to it everyday in the car, but I got smart real quick and confonscated it so I didn't have to suffer any longer. I thought my eardrums were going to bust!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat in Heat","review":"\\"My Heart Will Go On\\" is an exceptionally beautiful song, and showed great promise. Unfortunately it is the only good song on the CD. My advice to Celine: stop trying to imitate Barbara Streisand's voice and style, and imitate instead her talent for understanding what is special about her own voice. You can do better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Celine Yawns","review":"Celine Dion has being inflicting her dreadful and sickening musak upon the world for quiet some time now.All her past albums have been full of sugary adult pop songs (Adult pop?) and melodramatic over-blown ballads and love songs and, 'Lets talk about Love' is no exception. It sticks firmly to the tried and trusted Cleine formula. The Titanic theme song is probably the best thing about the album, keeping in mind that it is a terrible, terrible song, while other tracks such as 'The Reason' and 'Immortality' just show up how weak a voice Celine has actually got. Hitting those high notes is fine, but honey, you gotta stay in key!?! There are those who will completely diagree with my views of the album and there are people out there who love it. Well fair enough what ever you are into, it just was not my cup of tea. Some of her earlier work (especially 'Falling in to you' moved me to tears)So come on Celine!!!! I know you can do better just try that bit harder."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff makes my teeth ache.","review":"How sad the state of popular music is that this shrill, shrieking vocalist can make it to the top of the charts. Celine may think so, but she's no Streisand. She's no diva at all. She's an overrated, mediocre talent who has already over stayed her welcome. Go away Celine, and please, please, please, take Mariah Carey with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She has no talent!","review":"I loved Celine's Falling into You, but now I find her annoying, pretentious, verbearing, and nauseating. What a ditz! Titanic is the stupidest, worst CD and will someone tell Celine to shut up? The boat sank, the guy died, get over it. I'd say where she can go stick her heart, but I'm not going to. If you want really beautiful music, listen to the Goo Goo Dolls. If you want mindless screaming and kind of scary chest banging, listen to Celine Dion. But before you, do, take a moment and think about your poor ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old boring lyrics...","review":"She has a greate voice..no doubt about that. I wish she would use it to create something unique...in the music world. What is this world coming to...same old boring love songs..one after another. Don't get me wrong. Love is essential. But, if we keep doing the same old thing, where is the fun and excitement...Real talent is in creating something new with what you got. For real talents, listen to these CDs: Michael Jackson's History... Mars Accelerator (a young new band from Seattle) and another artist who I think is talented is Shiela Chandra."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest set of songs ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Celine got a great voice and everyone who dislikes her are fools. She is fabulous and this CD just proves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Selection of Her Songs","review":"It is wonderful because it has her best songs on it. Her other CD's have only 4 or 5 that I like. It is filled with the best of her songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC","review":"I can't wait to purchase my next one. This is my first Celine Dion CD and I bought it because I wanted \\"My heart will go on\\" - theme from Titantic, but once I stared listening to the songs, they are absolutely fantastic. I especially like \\"where is the love\\", \\"miles to go\\", \\"us\\", \\"to love you more\\", and \\"let's talk about love\\", let's face it I love the entire CD. Celine has such a wide range to her singing, she is a exceptionally talented lady, each of her songs have their own unique sound. She can go from a rap type song in \\"treat her like a lady\\" to a Mariah Carey type song in \\"Love is on the way\\". I get goose bumps just listening to her. She puts so much depth and meaning into each of her songs its amazing. If you buy this CD you will not be disappointed and you will definately get your money's worth and more. From the first song on this cd to the last you will be so moved that you can't wait to hear it again. I just can't say enough about a truely exceptional album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another great album by a grand star","review":"Celine does it again! She gives us listeners something that'll make us look inside ourselves and realize all the love we have. The best ballads are \\"My Heart Will Go On\\", \\"Just a Little Bit of Love\\" and \\"To Love You More\\"- one of her best ever! The tiresome \\"Tell Him\\" duet succumbs to the album as one of the worse sides. Yet songs like \\"Where Is the Love\\" and \\"The Reason\\" lift the fact that parts of the album are slow and have failed their duty- to entertain the listener. \\"Let's Talk About Love\\" closes the album nicely. If Celine wanted to end her career- this album should've been the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"loove it","review":"i love celine.. and this cd is just another one of her best! i would highly recomend to all you celine lovers out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"water damage","review":"this cd had a lot of water damage. the picture book in the front was molded together and would not open up for anything. the cd played just fine but most of the reason i bought the cd was so that i could have the pictures and read the lyrics. and i was not able to do that. and the water damage was not mentioned at all on the description of the product. that dissapointed me greatly i could of just downloaded it instead of spending money... not happy"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 of 15 songs","review":"While I'm a big fan of Celine, this CD was a big disapointment. There are only two really good numbers on the CD while the other 13 range from fair to just plain bad.On this CD it appears that Celine tried numbers that really aren't her style, and are \\"dangerous\\" to her voice. She is best when she does ballads and love songs.A \\"Rock\\" or \\"Rap\\" star she is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Annoyed","review":"i bought this item but it was never shipped to me. the seller will not write me back to tell me what happened so i don't know if i was refunded or if it's on it's way or what. i want it to get here already and i'm very dissatisfied that it's taking so long. i love the album. i have it as a cassette tape and i just wanted the cd. i never even received a confirmation email that it's been shipped or anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is da bomb!","review":"i own the cd and i love it. she has a great voice,but some of the songs aren't as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD album there ever was!!!!!!","review":"This is truly one of Celine Dion's very best albums.

These 2 songs should be among the top of all time best."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERPRODUCED AND THEREFORE DISAPPOINTING","review":"Celine is one of my favorite singers, but on this CD she is just trying to do too much. Yes, there are a couple of gems on here, but this combination of songs doesn't gel into anything one can listen to all the way through in one go. Does she think she won't make another English recording? Also she wails her guts out on a few songs and kills them. Less is more, doll. Her work with Jean-Jacques Goldman is much better. Spend your money on S'il Suffisait D'aimer instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has no talent!","review":"I loved Celine's Falling into You, but now I find her annoying, pretentious, overbearing, and nauseating.

Except there's one song that does not stand out to me and that is \\"I Hate you then I love you\\" I dont know why it doesn't stand out to me, it just doesnt. But this CD is terrific, go out and buy this CD if you dont have it! :)My favorite tracks are, \\"Where is the love\\" , \\"Treat her like a lady\\" ,and \\"My heart will go on\\"Best Love CD Celine:-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Talk About Horrible Music","review":"Please tell me why this woman is still alowed to make this boring, egotistical trash that passes for music. Her music is so bland and she is such a superficial artist that it makes me mad. Why do artist that are original and stay out of the spotlight get pushed asigned by a no talent hack like Ms. Dion. If I had a choice between having my arms broke or having to listen to \\"My Heart will Go On\\" again, lets just say my arms will always heal but the shock of listening to Dion could last a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOre sickening than a Hershey bar during a milk shortage","review":"Celine Dion sings sickening and unrealistic love songs.

Collaborating with some of the biggest and best names in the music business including: her long-time idol Barbara Streisand (for their spectacular, over-the-top duet \\"Tell Him\\"), the Bee Gees (on \\"Immortality\\")Carole King and Sir George Martin (who co-wrote \\"The Reason\\")and Lucianno Pavarotti (for their duet \\"I Hate You Then I Love You\\"). The album was vaulted to the top of the charts back in 1998 by the ubiquitous Titanic theme \\"My Heart Will Go On.\\" Other outstanding tracks include David Foster's gorgeous masterpiece \\"To Love You More,\\" the emotional title track, the powerful, poignant \\"Us,\\" beautiful \\"Miles To Go Before I Sleep,\\" and Celine's pseudo hip-hop song \\"Treat Her Like A Lady,\\" (featuring Diana King.) While there are a couple of weak tracks, and the aforementioned duet with Pavarotti suffers from mediocre songwriting, all in all, it is an excellent adult contemporary pop album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Talk About Celine!","review":"I like Celine Dion and you can say that I am a fan of her music particularly of her French recordings. This album is strictly English. I loved all the songs except track 3 (Treat Her Like a Lady) which I found was kind of annoying. It just isn't Celine's style and I appreciate her trying to make herself flexible but it just didn't sound like her. \\"Tell Him\\" is sung with American legend, Barbra Streisand. She sings her mega-hit Oscar winning song, \\"My Heart Will Go On,\\" from the film, Titanic. Apart from the usual songs about love and relationships, Celine has a good selection. She sings \\"I Hate You Then I Love You,\\" with late opera singing legend, Luciano Pavarotti. For the most part, it's a good compact disc and a must-have for a Celine Dion fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUSIC FAN FROM PUNGOTEAGUE,VA.USA APRIL 11,1999","review":"The first time I seen and heard CELINE here in the USA I was and still am captivated by her voice and personality.I have all of her English and French CD's even thou I can't speak or understand French.

Speaking of death, this CD turns metaphorical screws which produce such intense agony that you will feel inclined to kill yourself. All her songs sound exactly alike and they all have the word 'love' or 'heart' in the title - does this woman possess even a small amount of originality? Seriously, record labels should spend time and money promoting talented artists instead of this crap. Anyone who actually enjoys this - what the hell are you on?"},{"rating":"2","title":"With a Little Help From Her Friends!","review":"There is no doubting the great quality of Celine Dion's voice. She also has the ability to pick the right songs that suit her inimitable style. This album is well mastered and the sound quality is quite good. She even does duets with acts as diverse as the Bee Gees and Pavarotti but the big international love song from the Titanic is here which I suppose alone would be responsible for selling truckloads of this cd. A competent, feelgood disc, nothing to shout about but nothing to sneeze at as well. If you are a Celine fan, then you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I think this album is Celine Dion's best work yet.

I used to love her in 1991/1993 when she wasn't as big, and just broke into the United States market. Now she is overhyped, and ruined the whole \\"Titanic\\" film by her overemphasis in the song. If you want soothing music, listen to Sarah McLachlan. She has a beautiful voice and doesn't need to scream at the top of her lungs to prove it. Heck, Sarah could sing the phone book and make it sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just more of the same","review":"I used to like her music but a lack of variation in musical-style means: that of late - as evidenced by that quite wretched song from the 'Titanic'- she has begun to sound more and more like a coyote on a hill howling at the full moon.

But anyway, one song is incredible : it's TO LOVE YOU MORE(u.s. only).What a wonderful song!!!Finally, you'll ENJOY this album but not as falling into you or others.

It contains too many \\"sleepy\\" songs and she screeches when she hits the upper octave (i.e The Reason, Treat Her Like A Lady) and sings with all the nasal-voice she is able to muster up (i.e Immortality and probably everything else!) The reason that this CD will sell-out is because of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\", propelled by the movie. Celine should go listen to \\"Falling Into You\\" once again ... listen to the material and how she sang (skip the nasal, celine!)... and do a repeat performance of that. Bottom line is, this album puts me to sleep ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ever!","review":"Celine Dion is so great singer! I love this album.

The bonus track, \\"I Will Be,\\" is not too bad but, it just isn't very good either.

It can fit 2 Barie dolls up front and 2 children in the back. Don't try to put Barbie in the back, she won't fit. However, even as frustrating as that is, the trunk opens, the side mirrors move, the steering wheel turns, the middle console between the front seats lifts up to reveal two cup holders and the seats lean forward so you can put the childern in easily. I'd suggest buying the Barbie: Happy Family Volvo so you have a car seat to put in the back of this vehicel. All in all a great buy and very durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of PKI","review":"You can treat this as \\"the\\" book you need to read to understand different aspects of PKI to get a \\"big picture\\".

It reads like fiction and will make you happy that you chose to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another pleasing Fernando Ortega CD","review":"Fernando Ortega has a relaxed, easy-going style, yet he displays a passion for the Lord which is evident on this CD. He takes traditional songs such as \\"How Firm a Foundation\\" and \\"All Creatures of our God and King\\" and puts them into new and fresh arrangements. He also sings his original songs such as \\"I Will Praise Him, Still\\" and sings of the human condition in \\"Anita's Heart\\". He is a consistant artist who always brings his special inspiration and love for the Lord to his song-writing and performing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous CD, this is a MUST BUY!","review":"My sister introduced me to Fernando Ortega's wonderful music. It is calm, relaxing, and most of all, CHRISTIAN! I also recommend Hymns & Meditations, which is not currently sold by amazon.com - it has the old hymns sung by this soothing voice!

I intend to collect all his albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fernando crosses many genres perfectly.","review":"If you like variety in an artist you will enjoy this cd. Fernando will take you to a song that has an Amish story behind it. He will also take you to 1225 and sing songs from St. Francis. If that isn't enough he does a Spanish song that is very touching. One of my favorites is \\"Grace's Waltz\\" which is an instrumental. There is a song on this album that everyone will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"No musician does more to help me draw close to the Lord.","review":"I first heard Francisco Ortega on his album \\"Hymns & Meditations\\", and found it to be not only very enjoyable to listen to, but found that he helped me to worship. His vocals are disarmingly sincere --which helped break through the wall of cynicism I have to most \\"Christian music\\"-- his playing impeccable, and his arrangements are fresh and interesting. The only thing I can recommend more highly that \\"This Bright Hour\\" is his earlier \\"Hymns and Meditations\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Outdated Outdated","review":"Can you say, \\"outdated\\"? Wow, this book talks about how women can find a place in the workforce and purpose in their lives. Hmmm, very relevant I am sure 20 years ago when it was published but most of the companies mentioned are now defunct, and much of the information I feel is very elementary at best, of course it might have been cutting edge stuff when it was written.How about a revision??As a 12 year veteran of direct sales, I would NOT recommend this book to anyone looking to get started in party plan sales, there are much better sources of info out there.If I had noticed the publish date I would not have bought it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A study in callowness and naivete","review":"Stephen L. Carter wishes to deny to other African-Americans those very advantages that allowed him to \\"make it\\" in the system, all the while ignoring the pervasive racism that made affirmative action necessary. Coming from someone who has spent his entire life in elite academic surroundings, one wishes that he had experienced racial hostility in an up-close and personal fashion in \\"the real world\\". I, for one, have grown weary of denizens of ivory towers trying to preach their myopic and ill-informed sermons to those black professionals who must make their way in the harsh, acquisitive business world. This book has no grounding in the black reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for filling in details","review":"I am not a historian, nor am I particularly a history nut. But I got interested in the relationship between Grant and Sherman after re-watching Ken Burns' Civil War series (thank you, Amazon Prime!). This book is very readable and fills in a lot of the details that could not, of necessity, be covered in the Burns documentary. Occasionally, I find the descriptions of the battles somewhat boring, but they do not go on for pages and pages. And the details about each man's family life were very helpful, as were stories of each man attempting to be successful in private life before the Civil War. I was hoping to read a little more about Sherman's occasional manic-like tendencies, and there is some of that in the book, but I think I will have to read a bio just of Sherman to get more on that aspect of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'must' for any who would understand Civil War connections","review":"Grant And Sherman: The Friendship That Won The Civil War will prove an eye-opener to many, describing the relationship of two of the most important figures of the Civil War - who happened to also be friends. Grant and Sherman shared many common experiences despite their differences: they were prewar failures, they each struggled to join the war effort, and they each collaborated even while under fire on the battlefield, giving orders and learning from their decisions - and each other. Until now little has been written about this friendship, and about their common ties: Charles Bracelen Flood has written about the war before but here excels in presenting the depth of an unusual friendship which not only influenced but eventually won the Civil War. A 'must' for any who would understand Civil War connections."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"Bracelen Flood's writing is at once engaging and entertaining. Even as he approaches serious topics, he continually draws in the reader to his book. Where other biographies could have been boring, this one interests. It is a truly beautiful piece of writing, matched only by Bracelen's personality. The author is a man who comes alive when talking about his subject, and his enthusiasm is evident in every word."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New View of the Civil War","review":"With so many books available about the Civil War, I usually sigh when I see another one. But Charles Bracelen Flood has surpassed the usual offerings with this fascinating account of Grant and Sherman, who's friendship would \\"win the Civil War.\\" Well written and researched, Flood's narrative gives life and blood to these men, written off early as failures: US Grant--a drunk, and William T. Sherman--insane. Whatever their shortcomings might have been, the underlying combined genius of these men came together at the crucial times and places. A splendid book and a breath of fresh air to the genre of Civil War history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and entertaining read","review":"As a fan of all things Cump Sherman, I found this to be a valuable read. Adds color that you won't find in his memoirs, while avoiding the temptation to linger in esoteric detail. Recommended for anyone interested in the lives of Grant or Sherman."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best, if not the best!","review":"Having read most of the five star reviews, any superlatives that I might add seem unnecessary. I do want to say that I borrowed this book from the library in 2009 and since then I am almost haunted by it. I have long wanted to read it again. It is so unforgettable, such a valuable addition to any Civil War library, that I am going to buy the hard cover addition, even though most of the books I purchase are Kindle editions.Barbara D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle School Book Report","review":"This is a below average Civil War book. It reads like a middle schooler wrote this for a project. Nothing really new was presented in the text and if you've read anything on Grant or Sherman in the past I would ignore this one. I can't believe this book was on a list of ten must reads for the 150th. The amount of errors in dates and facts makes this book seem like an attempt to make a quick buck. Example: page 362 states that Seminary Ridge was a battle fought in the West. Come on! Seriously? Page 219 states that Sheridan was brought South to help the beseiged Union soldiers at Chattanooga...Wrong again! Page 160 says that the Battle of Fort Hudson was part of the Red River Campaign. Nope! There are several more. A lot of spelling errors that could have been solved by simply looking at a map! I'm no expert, but I could've written a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading","review":"Very good narrative about two civil war characters. Great reading even for a non-history person"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brahms*Ein Deutsches Requiem","review":"It is my humble opinion that in the world of classical music, for those of us who are purists, this particular cd is perhaps one of the absolutely best that classical has to offer! The music is astounding in that it takes you to places you have never been before, and your soul is carried away to a place that can only be described as a heavenly place for all music lovers. I endorse this cd as an absolute must, for those who fully appreciate what classical music has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off-cuts should not be published.","review":"This very short book will disappoint all but the most blindly fanatical Burroughs fans. A series of sketches inspired by the Nourse novel of the same name, it simply repeats well-worn themes dealt with more effectively elsewhere in his work. It seems to be the collected results of an aborted attempt to write a novel or screenplay, and from these insipid, lifeless scenes it is easy to see why it was aborted. The only question is: why display the lifeless corpse to the reading public? Methinks his manager was behind this unwise decision$$$For completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the murder mystery games","review":"I own this game (in its previous incarnation, with the floppy record, not the CD) and I can honestly say it is the worst Murder Mystery game I have played out of dozens of plays by multiple companies. The plot is uncomplicated and unfun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"I had played other murder mystery games in the past, and I really enjoyed them. We were headed to vacation in a ski area, so I thought this would be great to fit with the theme. Sadly, we were all disappointed with this game.1) This game is very short compared to other murder mystery games (1.5 hours as opposed to 3 or 4 hours for other games I have played).2) The solution was not complicated. Don't be fooled by the \\"twist\\" in the title. This was about as complicated as something from Saturday morning cartoons.3) The format was different from other murder mystery games, and there just wasn't much information to play with (hence the short gameplay).If I could go back and buy something else, I would. With so many other good murder mystery games out there (\\"Lethal Luau\\" and \\"The Good, the Bad and the Guilty\\" to name a couple), why buy this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No script","review":"I've been buying Murder Mystery games from Bepuzzled for years and have had loads of fun hosting parties with them. Reading the tongue-in-cheek humorous lines causes lots of laughter and fun. This one looks the same, but the booklet doesn't have a script.

Think of \\"Saturday the 14th Strikes Back\\" (but maybe worse).The only reason it gets 2 stars for the obscurity of the material on the disk; and the fact they attempted to make it the best product possible (though the washed-out full frame transfer leaves quite a bit to be desired; we believe it's due to the age and rarity of the print).Our advice: RENT IT (if really curious)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Night of the Dribbler","review":"I would rate it zero stars but Amazon dont give you that option, DONT BUY IT,Slow very slow and just plain stupid!!!

So far record companies have favoured Tosca and Gioconda over this far greater opera, but well, that's another topic. This very expensive recording turned out a very sour lemon. I have no idea who decided on hiring such a young and inexperienced conductor as Ion Marin for this very complex opera, his reading of the great overture is unbelievably bad, he seems to be sight reading the score for the first time. Cheryl Studer is pale and annonymous as Semiramide, she just doesn't seem to have any ideas on the role, what a pity Lella Cuberli was not preferred. Larmore, Ramey and Loppardo are the redeeming features, too little too late perhaps.

Those jerks made a plastic cap for it that the coffee was percolating through and kind of defeated the purpose. Furthermore, the plastic cap stained very easily and I could never really tell how dark the coffee was. I bought this cap, fit in there just fine, and it solved both of those problems. At first I wasn't even sure that it was really glass since it felt suspiciously like plastic to me. But I noticed it had a different clanking sound when you clanked it against metal than the other one. Then for good measure I took out a lighter and burned the hell out of it with the lighter and tried to scratch it with a knife where it was still hot. It did not even make a tiny scratch in it at all and I am happy to report it is most certainly glass. Also, the fact that it does not stain like the plastic did also confirms that.

Many of the songs are excellent as they capture one band's plea for change in musical composition. The songs are pretty simliar to Beds are Burning but they have enough variety to keep most of the album interesting.Bottom Line: I haven't listened to the any of Midnight Oil's actual albums so I can't say if this compilation is all you really need or not.

Not quite so. The first glitch is Deutche Grammomphon's loathsome 4D technology - it captures the VPO's sound badly: woolly bass frequencies, bloated mid-range frequencies, and an attenuated top-end. Fortunately, it did not completely warp the sound of the Viennese strings - there are moments of sweet beauty to be savored, particularly in the Intermezzo and Capriccio extracts.Unfortunately, the other injury to the VPO comes in the form of Previn. It seems he was in a sonnambulistic mood of sorts, and the entire performance suffers from an interminable haze of laziness --- rhythms are often slack and droopy, particularly in the \\"Rosenkavalier\\" piece and musical expression often turgid. Listen to Rudolf Kempe's recordings of the same music and see how much more lilt, affection and zip could be put into this music.Not a success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danny's Acadamy Award Winning Score To \\"Men In Black\\"","review":"Aside from the on-and on part of the CD,which may I say is barely in there,I thought it was great!The theme was just an unforgetable song and maybe one of Danny's best themes(not better than Batman)The rest of the CD is definitely worth listening to!The whole score has a mix of jazz,but not too much,and a kind of action-packed,up-beat,but in the also magnificent Danny Elfman way!It is a great score and is simular to the album to \\"Mars Attacks\\"!OH!I must include the wierd but interesting sounds from a very cool guitar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Score","review":"This is a very good score by famous film composer Danny Elfman.

And I was VERY pleasantly surprised. Incorporating more of his rock music history than many of his other scores, Elfman's energetic, highly rhythmic opening sets a rather hip tone and paves the way for smart-alek Will Smith's adventures in the world of Illegal Alien tracking. A handful of the selections are sheer listening enjoyment, most are okay... Without the images to go along with it, a couple of pieces amount to just a lot of electronic noise. While I definitely consider this a positive addition to my collection, I must confess I fail to see why it got an Oscar(r) nominee; it is so unlike anything the Academy likes to nominate. (I'm happy for Elfman, but surprised.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Elfman score (though not his best)","review":"Once again, Danny Elfman creates a masterful score that perfectly compliments the movie.

I purchased this at the warehouse and viewed the first 3 episodes with my wife tonight. The episodes are between 23 and 28 minutes long. These are edited down to about half the original broadcast. Do not get me wrong. Some of the skits are very funny. The barbarshop scene w/ orsen wells and Jimmy Stewart made me laugh for its 5 minutes of wit. But the episodes all have end credits that show snapshots of scenes from the show broadcast, and you can guess easily what you misses on the DvD realease.In addition, the audio mixing is terrible. Watching this DvD with a 5.1 system, you loose vocal in the center channal at the end of the first episode/ disk 1. If these broadcasts were recorded in Mono, realease them in Mono.

So what you get are interviews and comedy sketches, and maybe a song or two from Dean. The earlier \\"best of\\" series was much better as it focused on the musical numbers. Another missing element are \\"Dean's Girls\\"--- the Golddiggers and the Dingaling Sisters. Since they did mainly musical numbers (their own or as backups for guest stars), they have been cut from the episodes except for when they do introductions. At the end of each episode, you can see stills from the many segments that were cut from the DVD as the credits roll. And don't look for Joey Heatherton or Ann-Margret, they are not in this set.

In reality, the involvement of quality venture investors typically raises valuation in the long run.\\"Does the author really not understand that ownership and valuation are two separate and distinct things?Earth to Rob Adams: investment may increase a company's valuationbut it also most assuredly dilutes the founders' ownership. And dilution of ownership with the concomittant loss of control is a big concern for most entrepreneurs.Add to dumb mistakes like this the author's penchant for being a blow-hard self-promoter and you have a book that can be very challenging to finish.I gave up after the first half."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not enjoy this book","review":"I like to think of myself as a person who reads a lot of business books. I am an entrepreneur as well and this book could NOT hold my attention. I ended up returning it to get my money back. I think it was because the things they were saying and talking about was not interesting at all. This is my first bad review of a business book. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I read this book and stopped about halfway through. Why? Because I expected some insightful information for entrepreneurs to start businesses. All I got out of it was the idea that you need to pander to the desires of venture capitalists in order to get venture capital.There is little, if any information here for the independent entrepreneur. If you want to capture venture capital, then this is the book. It will put you in the mindset of the venture capitalist. However, if you are looking to start a business and are ambivalent about venture capital this is no the book for you.I suggest you use your money for marketing rather than buying this book, unless you are trying to get venture capital a la 1999."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time & money","review":"If you take brunch and sip tea with your local venture capitalists, then you won't need this book. However, if you don't have any strong personal connections with VCs this book will be even more useless to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets down to the brass tacks- indispensable business reading","review":"The author's chapters on execution intelligence and market validation are among the most useful discussions I've seen of these core business issues. I was also impressed by the concept of what he calls \\"value inflection points\\" as measures of company progress, particularly when viewed through the prism of financing. Tying funding to real, measurable company progress strikes me as an extremely rational way to grow a business, whether you are an entrepreneur or a long-time corporate executive. Finally, I found his take on the business plan - which he sees as secondary to the early-stage tasks of assembling a good team, validating the market, and developing an effective go-to-market strategy - to be unique and thought-provoking. This is an original, extremely well written book with an interesting perspective and plenty of practical advice - and it's already changing the way I run my business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, what every entrepreneur should know","review":"As somebody who has successfully led and developed 4 companies though to success I cannot rate this book too highly. Rob Adams gets to the heart of the issues that are key to building any business venture, particularly in the IT space. If I had these insights at the outset of my career I'd have saved myself a lot of heartache. If only European VC's had as much insight as Rob Adams, we wouldn't be so far behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"How arrogant can you get?!? Do not buy this book.","review":"I couldn't read more than half of this book!Although there is good advice in this book, it is nearly impossible to sift through the heavy self-promotion to get there. Rob Adams is more concerned with telling you how he and his companies have made all the right decisions than he is in educating.Every other paragraph is about how he has corrected some mis-guided sole with THE right way to do something. He never allows for the fact that there are often multiple successful approaches. He thinks he has the formula nailed for everything a business person will ever come across.And, he has either never made a mistake in his life or isn't willing to admit it in this book.If you like reading about how Rob \\"set them straight. fast.\\" several dozen times, buy this book. If arrogrance annoys you, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful...","review":"Poorly written...badly edited...sloppily organized...I struggled to continue and finally had to put the book down halfway through. Full of bad and contradictory advice that flies in the face of every established business principle. What a bunch of self-serving tripe. Totally irrelevant for about 99% of the population...unless you're some techno-geek with a half-baked idea and access to loads of money from equally out-of-touch VC people. By the way, how many of these HOT start-up companies that Adamas writes about have YOU ever heard of? What garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"Finally, a book on Entrepeneurship in the high tech world that is actually useful. While most books are either academic tomes, or simplistic drivel, this one actually provides useful information, and in the context of specific examples.While no single book can teach you everything you need to know, this one will help you avoid some classic mistakes, and recover from many of the ones you've already made. Reading this book won't guarantee your success, but even for those of us who've already successfully built and sold startups, it provides an easy to read \\"refresher course\\" in the basics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little More Than Self-Propmotion","review":"This book is nothing more than an advertisement for the author's incubator in Texas.

Pyramid Illusions is a culmination of original research, imaginative writing, and many useful illustrations to help the reader envision him/herself at the sites and interiors of the Egyptian masonry pyramids. By reviewing the facts on the sites, the reader is capable of separating the fact from the fiction and finding that the pyramids are not tombs, the stone blocks of the pyramids were man-made and not quarried, ramps were not used, and slaves did not build the pyramids. Readers will become informed about the ancient Egyptian tombs and how they differ from the stone pyramids. They will learn how and when ancient Egyptians manufacture hard stones for jewelry, jars, vessels, statues, as well as for the pyramid blocks, and much, much more.

Once armed and with even leather armor you could strike out in any direction in search of adventure. There was a storyline, but it was still possible to get a job or gamble your way through for a good while, building up experience in the process. Fallout 2, on the other hand, is very difficult. Creatures are so tough at first that survival becomes a challenge unto itself. Guns or body armor would be helpful, but there are none to be found. The storyline, and character survival, are so intertwined that striking off in any direction, alone, is certain death. Experience points come very, very slowly. Crippling injuries are common. Because it's part of the Fallout genre I give it 2 stars, but it really deserves only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are similar games for the Mac that are much better.","review":"Its graphics and sound are lackluster.

I think the game is terribly dated in terms of looks and game play. As far as a RPG it is pretty good, there is lots of story and character development and the turn based attack system works well. However that doesn't make up for its shortcomings. My biggest complaints are the graphics and the interface. On my computer (G4 533 w/GeForce2 MX card) the graphics are very grainy and pixilated. This may not bother some people, but to me it made game play very unpleasant. The interface makes it hard to move your character and interact with the environment, such as picking up objects.

The author's application of chaos theory to small group development harkens me back to Kurt Lewin's innovative work with groups. Adaptation of Arthur Young's work in creating a model of group development is also very innovative. I was especially pleased to see uncommon topics covered in this book such as women in leadership roles, group metaphors, and regressive groups. The chapter on the transpersonal and spiritual aspects of groups was new to me and alone worth the purchase of this book. Anyone working with groups or involved in a group or business organization would come away from reading this book with radically different ideas about group dynamics.

I played it a lot and the actual story about the pacifier is great but it is sandwiched in between other \\"big kid\\" stories. I almost think it gets lost in the mix to be honest. Not sure if it really helped the 2 year old but it did help me come up with a story that the pacifier fairy took the pacifiers & left a toy, etc. instead- which is one of the scenarios from the movie.

Page after page of \\"meeting-like\\" dialogue going over background in excruciating detail bogs this \\"thriller\\" down. If you are interested in sitting through \\"secret agent\\" meetings, lunches, etc. and being in on every single aspect of their discussion, then you will be very pleased with the content and pace of this story. However, if your taste is higher on the action scale, and if you are bored by going through every move that someone makes or contemplates and why they did this and why they did that and why they didn't do this, and what they were thinking when they did \\"that\\", you might find this book a bit slow moving for you.I quit after getting through more than half the book waiting for someone to actually DO something.

I'm an international businessman who has spent a lot of time overseas, some in the same locales that Carmon uses as background, so that made the book even more fun for me.

I hear so many people going nuts over Ravi Shankar, but i don't think Ravi's mucic is as melodious as Ananda's were!!! Ravi is more widely known; where as, Ananda kept a very low profile. Ananda produced less but Quality cuts. Such a great blend of sitar, guitar, drum, tabla...aah list goes on. Another word, if you are looking for an instrumental cd, i don't think there are too many of this kind!

It can be heard upto several feet away even when there is surrounding noise. Not to mention other issues like weight, _very_ low battery life (its much lower than they advertise). The only thing that stands out in this laptop is its screen. I also have intermittent problems with the touchpad. Overall, I wouldnt recommend this laptop at all. I want to reach out to Sony and get it exchanged if possible, even if I have to pay some money. The fan noise is very erratic also - goes up and down like nobody's business. I am also not happy with the performance of this laptop - not sure its windows or the hardware tho. Looks to me, its hardware since windows has less latency issues on my other desktop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad!","review":"To respond to the review stating that the VAIO K35 locked up after hibernation when every it felt like it, is untrue. I just bought my K35 and the only time it locks up is when it is running on the battery, but this only occurs when the battery is less than 10% charged. Spoke with Sony and they stated that this was due to the VAIO not having enough power to do anything else. When the battery is better charged or when plugged in it never locks up after hibernation.To respond to the review about the loud fan, well the fan does produce noise, but come on it needs to cool down. And really the sound of the fan is not that loud, I guess it would be if you were in a completely quiet room. I have found that normally I don't even notice the fan running.I personally like the VAIO K35 and would recommend it.

I cannot watch a DVD film on it using battery power. The power requirement is so high that I cannot find an Air/Car 12v adapter powerful enough to charge the battery. This machine is a step backwards not a step forwards.I contacted Sony and I didnt find their advice useful.

I looked at this very model in several stores and NEVER heard the fan run. I was told by Sony that the fan was not on in the store because it wss bssically being used as a \\"TV\\" not a computer. I feel that this is false advertising. I did extensive research on this unit before purchasing. Now I am facing up to a $400.00 penalty when I return this unit to have the seller take it back (if they will). This is bad business and bad retail policy on the part of Amazon. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great laptop with a few minor issues","review":"I bought this for my wife, and she loves it. Many of the complaints listed are valid, like the short battery life and noisy fan. The noisy fan keeps the laptop cool, I have had no issues with it burning my lap. We did have to send it in to get the DVD drive replaced, but that was fairly painless. It goes into hibernation all the time, and we have never had an issue with it locking up. It actually returns to normal operation much faster than I am used to with desktops. Display is incredible. My 3 biggest issues with this laptop are: (1) noisy fan, (2) no good port replicator/docking station & (3) no auto/air adapter. Number 3 is by far my biggest gripe due to the lacking battery life. Other than these 3, I really think it was a great deal.

They lie to the police to protect the killer because he's a friend, but forty years later, one of them is forced to deal with the consequences of the cover-up. Much of the early part of the book deals with the family of the narrator/protagonist and how their lives have affected him and the decision he made to protect his friend. The protagonist's own story -- the crime and its aftermath -- turns nostalgia on its ear by showing that the happy and innocent past we all long for wasn't always happy or innocent. Sin of Omission is filled with genuine pathos and believable characters. I enjoyed it tremendously and hope to see more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most engaging ever","review":"This was one of the most engaging novels I have ever read.

This book is a fictionalized account of his life. It is undoubtably a classic, but readers tempted to follow his advice would do well to consider that he had repeatedly lost his entire fortune, regained it, only to lose it again not long afterwards. Not long before he died, he finished a book on his investment strategies. Unlike this book, it didn't sell very well back then, and it still doesn't sell well now. Readers should also keep in mind that the author of thisbook, a writer by the name of Lefevre, wasn't much of an investor himself (just a few isolated investments over his lifetime, according to the book's foreword.) Apparently, the author didn't have much faith in Livermore's methods.It's almost funny how often I've seen this book mentioned by other books on investing. For the most part, they neglected to mention how he died and why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best","review":"This is a classic book on trading and market speculation, and is still the best introduction to the subject.

Of course you do not rely solely on Livermores ways - the economy and the stock market is more complex today than it appeares to have been then. But when you make your educated guesses, I think his lowbrow way of letting the price action prove or disapprove the thinking, and then pyramiding up (on longs) or down (on shorts) is actually a nice way of letting yourself into a position. I do not think you have to do his extreme concentration on one or two stocks. As long as you can keep up with the action, a bigger number of stocks can keep you away from his boom/bust experiences thru diversification."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic - it belongs on every bookshelf","review":"Even though this book was written nearly 100 years ago, the lessons contained within still apply today. You won't find specific trading systems, or investing rules in the book. You will find, however, an inside account of market manipulation and the thought processes of a great trader.I especially liked the exposure on the operations of \\"bucket shops\\" - the early 20th century counterpart of some modern retail Forex brokers.While there's little technical information, a beginning investor may not 'get' much of the material here - a good knowledge of markets and trading is required to follow some of the anecdotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Thngs Never Change","review":"I heard Cramer mention this book. He said it was his favorite book about trading. LeFevre was a kid without any formal education who started working for brokerage houses around the turn of the 20th century. His reminiscences of how he developed into the incredible trader he became is both refreshing and familiar. The stock market was a totally different world in those days and many of the institutions which were part of it no longer exist, but the principles LeFevre writes about are unchanging.A great read and a surefire way to get your head on straight and deal properly with the fear/greed bugaboo."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUtstanding book for all traders of all markets","review":"Found the insight of Jesse Livermore to be very helpful in understanding winning trader behaviour.

It was written more than 80 years ago in a style that was boring. The chapters have no titles. The message the author wanted to put across was unclear.Jesse Livermore committed suicide. Why learn from him? According to other reviews, there are gems of wisdom in this book like 'cut losers short, let winners run'. Do you have to learn this from this book? It is common wisdom that can be found in other better written books. To learn from this book is counter-productive.Indirectly, I learnt only one thing in chapter 3: Have regard for money.And I stopped at chapter 3.I prefer Nicholas Darvas' 'How I made 2 Million Dollars from the stock market'."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel much more knowledgable after reading","review":"Altough Jesse Livermore traded during raw beginnings of the market only the rules have changed not traders tendencies..

He actually wasn't that stable of a trader but you can learn from his mistakes (ie the enemy within the trader)..This book also uncovers some of the mischievousness of the markets participants.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cornerstone for a solid trading education","review":"Looking back on my trading career, I am grateful to have read this book when I did. It helped me frame my reactions to market moves and understand what to expect when I started trading, otherwise I would have torn my hair out a long time ago. It presents in a compelling anecdotal style what you can come to expect as a professional trader. The ups, the downs, the doldrums during vacation times, the market panic, etc. I recommend it to anyone who wants to begin trading. When you are done with that, then I recommend you check out a market timing book like Connors VIX Reversals and a simple, effective trading strategy like the One Day Breakout Method. These two books alone will help you make a lot of money in the markets. Take it from me and the thousands of dollars I lost before I decided to make my trading life less complicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest book on speculation ever written","review":"There is no doubt that Reminicences is the greatest book on speculation ever written and if you are serious about actively speculating you MUST read it, preferably more than once.My only caveat is that almost no reviews or even biographers of Jesse Livermore have pointed out the obvious fact that Jesse had a compulsive gambling disorder. The reader should realize that he lacked self control and probably did not lead a fulfilling life. The book does not tell you that after losing his shirt in the great crash (1929-1932) he was unable to recover from his loses and eventually committed suicide.Just remember that there is much more to life than money. He who loves money never has money enough, and he who loves income is never satisfied with his income."},{"rating":"1","title":"Service Sucks","review":"I ordered this book on 12/10/07 and still have not received it.

I would buy this again in a heart beat.Let me add that yes, this is meant to be a bath toy, but anything with batteries is sensitive to water regardless of what the label says.

Not only did the wand not rotate properly, it was extremely noise, AND if difficult to clean/empty out to store. Also, if you do NOT have smooth walls (like tile) on your shower enclosure, the suction cup will not stick.The woman at the store said \\"yeah, we get these returned a lot\\". I wrote the manufacturer on their website and received no response, so I just took it back to the store. If you don't use all the bubbles, you have to leave it upside down for a LONG time to try to drain the solution out, and even so, you'll have residue everywhere.So, 1) noisy. 2) doesn't always work. 3) difficult to clean. 4) difficult to mount/place. 5) doesn't work if it gets wet.Save your money, just blow bubbles with a cheap bottle of suds or buy a bubble gun and keep it out of reach of the child so it doesn't get soaked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, bad execution","review":"This was really cool - while it worked. It makes lots of bubbles, and a huge mess - so make sure it is aimed in the tub. But, the suction cups don't hold well. Ours dropped off the wall and into the tub.

We've only used it a few times but the darn thing is so noisy! My son is a bit hestitant about it because of the noise. It does blow tons of bubbles. In fact, I think it blows too many, too fast. It'd be a much better toy if it were less noisy and had different bubble speed options. I would keep searching for a bubble maker if I were you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Bubble Machine","review":"We've had this bubble machine for about 6 months now and it's still working great! Our only complaint is that it's a bit loud and you do need quite a bit of bubbles in it for it to work, but once you get enough bubbles in there....watch out. It creates a TON of bubbles!

It's so fun to watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who makes a bath toy that's not waterproof??","review":"Only managed to use this once with my 8 month old. The instructions say \\"do not submerse\\". Well, it's a heavy toy with only one (inferior) suction cup to hold it up. It splashed briefly into the water when my daughter predictably tried to touch the unit, and while it continued to work for that bath, it hasn't worked since. I honestly think it would have stopped working if it had just gotten a couple of good splashes. Really disappointing - we have other electronic bath toys that seal up watertight, why doesn't this?Also, the fan on it was obnoxiously loud when it did work. Definitely not worth purchasing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"God Fearing Women","review":"I got the Winnie the Pooh Summer Infant bubble blower. It doesn't put out much bubbles.

What a fun idea, and oh how poorly executed. This item is cruddy. Very very poorly designed. The bubbles don't gently float up like they do in the picture. It's more like a full on bubble assault! They shoot out in an aggressive horizontal line. It's terrible. You could NEVER sit your kid in front of it like they do in the picture. They would be taking an aggressive onslaught of bubbles to the face!! Oh!! And did I mention, their bubble solution BURNS!?!? You would think something they picture as floating into a child's face would have the sense to be tear free but I can promise you this is not. It got into my eyes and stung like crazy. What a poorly designed product. I returned mine immediately. When I went to remove my batteries to do so, i could see that the inside of the battery compartment was slimy with bubble solution. This, after ONE abbreviated use! This is a very poor quality product. Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not produce bubbles.","review":"I purchased this for my 3 year old son.

The reason I came to Amazon to look for one, is the one we got as a gift broke after 2 weeks. When I did a search, I saw that this product, the one we received as a gift, was the first on the list! This thing is terrible. After a couple of weeks, the machine stopped working. Thinking it was the batteries, I looked to change them, and realized that one of the 2 battery compartments was corroded due to water getting in to the battery cabinet. This was not even exposed to direct water, just splashing. I can't believe this is being sold as a bathtub toy. Pass on this unit for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unhappy","review":"This product is not worth your money.

What a disappointing toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after battery replacement","review":"Well, the thing was pretty good and interesting while it was working and it was working for about a week; after a week the batteries dies (that's ok), but replacing batteries did not activate the item; so, the batteries are new, but the bubblemaker does not work - simply does not work;"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential, result = waste of money","review":"First of all, I've had it for probably 9 months now and doesn't seem to be anywhere near breaking.Unfortunately, when you turn it on, that's it; it's on.There's no flow or time button. For instance, if the bubbles came out at a slower pace, and then would run for about 10 seconds and then waited a minute, then started again, that would be AWESOME! However, it doesn't. It's on/off and at a moderate pace which is just too much.Overall, waste of money.

I wish I would have read all the negative reviews on here first! They are all right! I have gone through the entire bottle after FIVE uses and just as another reviewer said, even when the reservoir has the bubble solution in it, it only sends out a couple of bubbles after 30 seconds of use. I have it high on the wall, so I haven't gotten it wet yet. Bottom line, this toy just isn't worth it.

It's kinda pricey. I paid $67 for it. I love it though so I don't care. I paid $152 for \\"Shotgun Justice\\" and it was kinda worth it. In my opinion the last four Razor albums are the best.

Thought we would watch one from the library then order the others but glad we didn't waste the money on others. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally pointless","review":"\\"The Double\\", which is the shortest episode in this set, is completely unsatisfactory.

The video version left out one of the main male characters, who basically solves the mystery. He is captivated by the main female character, which gives added depth and meaning to the mystery.

Nat King Cole was already known for his velvet voice when he started to work with Nelson Riddle as an arranger. Like Sinatra, Riddle was able to perfectly compliment Coles voice, and add it to the melody as an instrument. This set is a prime example.

He said I gave him carpel tunnel syndrome. This massager does the trick. The first time you use it - do so sparingly or you'll bruise yourself like I did. I'm going to wait a few days before I use it again. I had the Homedics neck massager but the two massage heads where too far apart. This is so much better and you can use this on your feet too! Awesome - Awesome - Awesome - hope it lasts forever. Will buy more to give as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just be careful...","review":"...this gives an amazing massage, however, you have to adjust yourself accordingly. You cannot lay directly against it with much pressure or you end up feeling more bruised than anything. If you can stand REALLY deep tissue massages, though, this is definitely for you!

I have problems with my upper back, shoulders and neck. Before I Bought this, I already owned a Homedics shiatsu massaging cushion that fits in a chair and moves up and down your back. It works wonders on my back and I love it. The only problem is that it doesn't get my upper shoulders and neck. So, based on reviews, I purchased this massage cushion. Now, I use both. This works extremely well for spot massaging my upper shoulders and neck. I found the best way to use it is lying on the floor or in bed. I also turn it upside down, so the top is at the bottom. I find this works best for me. I highly recommend this product. You get a great massage at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"This is one of the most satisfying purchases I have ever made. While nothing can take the place of a \\"live person massage\\" this product certainly does come closer than any other product I have ever used. My husband says he would have paid $100.00 for it, had he known I would stop asking him for a shoulder massage every 8 seconds. You do have to move around a bit to get to certain muscles, but once you find it, it is heavenly. My shoulder & arm have improved tremendously since I've been using it. It is easy to maneuver around as it is compact and I usually lay on it in bed of an evening. I often fall asleep on it! I highly recommend this to someone who wants something small, and relatively inexpensive by way of a massager."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!","review":"This product is great. I kinda wished I got the full chair one though. Then I don't have to move when it's doing it's work.

Both are reworkings by Respighi of little-known compositions from centuries before. These are lighter works, and they are simply charming. The Three Botticelli Pictures are more of Respighi's musical scene paintings, not as memorable as the Roman pieces, but enjoyable nonetheless.

Contrary to some books where abstract theories are discussed at length but whose connection with reality remains elusive, this book contains calculations on phenomena in the real and currently observable world. Approximations, i.e., back-of-the-envelope calculations, are performed for a great variety of physics topics that makes for truly fascinating reading. The math is mostly high school level with a small dash of calculus in a few cases. The text is clear and engaging and complements the calculations very well. The reason that I am giving it four stars instead of five is that there are several typos in the calculations and the units are not always carried through, i.e., numbers are often presented dimensionless when they are not. Otherwise, a fascinating read that I heartily recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faerie Whispers, secrets shared","review":"This book will evoke emotions buried deep in all who read it. There is so much of the author's life poured into these poems that you are left feeling torn apart and touched by the enormity of what she has endured. I admit some of the poems left me in tears they were so fraught with heartache and despair. Humour has been interlaced with sorrow giving the book a remarkable sense of light and shade.I thank the author for letting us mere mortals share the thoughts, passions and frailty of her world. If it has been a catharsis for her, I am happy. It has been a learning curve for me.

I highly recommend the slime lite for commuters, high mileage cyclist, or anyone who doesn't mind a little extra weight for the convenience. The only potential problem I can see is if you travel or ship your bike and need to let air out of the tires.

I encountered this with slime tubes and schrader valves on my mountain bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product","review":"This is just a horrible product. It works no better than a standard tube. When it does flat and one tries to repair it the slime will come spewing out of the tube when pumping air into the tire to find said puncture.

When I looked over the tire, I found no punctures or cuts. Upon removing the tube I was surprised to find that the rear Slime Lite tube leaked at the valve stem base. Green slime all over my rim and hands and no way to repair the tube. While these tubes may have been a good idea, the downfall of this product is the poor quality at the valve stem.

You may make your own conclusion about buying Slime bicycle tubes.

I must say that my reaction is mixed.First, on negatives... I was amazed that at a few places, she was simply and glaringly out of pitch. For example, in 'Meditation', she played the high F# of the first section way sharp. The orchestra and the soloist were off-pace at times. On expressive slow phrases, the tone wasn't warm enough. Rather, it was coarse and felt artificially suppressed.In contrast, she exhibited great clarity and brilliance on virtuouso phrases. It seemed she was much more comfortable with 'devilishly' difficult phrases than slow sentimental phrases. I also felt that her articulation on 'gypsy' phrases was excellent--full of energy and raw emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":".....not impressive","review":"I love Ms. Mutter and how she plays, but I have to say this was one of her worst albums.

It wasn't great or junk it was just....there...The Carmen Fantasy though was horrible, i think she shoulda redone the last movement where she coulda practiced her shifts...I think that Pearlman and Sarah Chang played the fantasy with the Zigeunenrweisen much better.

Clearly, the powers-that-be decided it wasn't worth it, because they replaced most of the music, INCLUDING THE THEME SONG, with poorly chosen and not particularly good replacements that don't work with the (admittedly already weak) dramatic moments. It's extremely distracting, and makes a weak show even harder to watch- I got this for my boyfriend because he has fond memories of the show and a bunch of VHS tapes that I'd like to get rid of, and he couldn't make it through an episode.If you actually want to watch this, buy the German print, they love Hasslehoff enough that they've paid for the original music- they even have the American dialog as an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this!!","review":"I ordered season 3 because I bought seasons 1, 2 & 4 at amoeba but they didnt have season 3.

But you should read all three books one right after the other so the story flows better. (I hate it when a book ends suddenly and leaves you hanging until the next publication is available). This next book in the series picks up right where Freedom's Landing left off. Freedom's Choice has the same action as the first book. You find yourself reading in anticipation the more the \\"dropped\\" discover about the original owners of Botany. Looking forward to listening to the third installation of the Freedom's Series (Freedom's Challenge) because, though I choose to read Freedom's Choice in the written form, I think the audio version helps creates a more interesting vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good addition to the story.","review":"While I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first in the series, I still found myself staying up too late reading because I just couldn't help getting drawn into the plight of the unwilling colonists. Zanail and company really start taking control and affecting their own destiny in this instalment of the story. Although some of the book seems a bit like old news and I couldn't help feeling bored with parts, the overall story continued on strongly and the stage was set for an exciting conclusion to the story in which the people of Botany may play a crucial role in events that could change not only their own new world, but Earth and the rest of the Universe. Hopefully (as seems likely) the Eosi/Catteni and the Farmers will come head to head in a conflict that would be entertaining to say the least.

It is a space romance that is as hard hitting as a soap bubble.What made the first book in this series so interesting is pretty much lacking here. By this I am talking about the surreal dream like quality that pulled out unusual though inspiring visions to dawdle over. Instead we are presented with a story that follows the most predictable 'read it before' plot lines that seem to float by without struggle.This might be a good series to read with your kids, but you can find better books in that regards as well (Pullman, Harry Potter, Narnia, and Watership Down)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read.

This one lasted for 18 days before breaking. It started off great and was an excellent choice, but for busy places it is not the best. It is a shame because I really thought this one would be an excellent buy, but I was wrong.

Surely this would last for the average person who only sharpens a few pencils a day. Kid tested and not teacher approved."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I purchased this pencil sharpener for my 3rd grade classroom after already having gone through 3 cheaper sharpeners this year. One of my students brought in this exact model for about a week between sharpeners, and I was amazed at how well it worked so I ordered one of my own for the class. It performed excellently for about 3 weeks--it quickly ans quietly sharpened pencils into very sharp points. After that, however, it took longer and longer to sharpen (you would have to move the pencil around and apply pressure to the pencil to get it to sharpen evenly) and the \\"sharpen\\" light no longer worked. It only lasted about two more weeks, and now it is completely broken. You can hear the motor when you put a pencil in, but the mechanism that turns to actually sharpen the pencil does not move. It wasn't worth the $50 I paid for it, and it's not worth the $30 it's currently listed for. Save yourself the frustration and find another sharpener."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one stinks","review":"IT does not make a sharp point on the pencil.

Recipes are arranged by meals, with ideas for breakfast, lunch and dinner--instead of the usual food type catagories. There is also a snack section.The only negative about this book besides NOT being spiral bound, is that a lot of the kitchen tools you may need are Pampered Chef specialty products, though you could probably manage without them, specific tools are mentioned in the recipes.

Here she hits the mark perfectly. She sounds as if immersed in Strauss's lavish, plush, self-inudlgent world. Korngold if anything makes that world seem austere, with his ultra-chromatic wanderings around the home key.

Shaham tears into the notes with thrilling immediacy, and you can hear the Sinopoli and the Philharmonia ignite with the same enthusiasm, racing along with the soloist. Shaham's tone is richly colored, with the earthiness of \\"digging into\\" the instrument. (Compare this with Anne-Sofie Mutter's equally captivating performance, where she creates a sinuous, almost icy tone and a very different atmosphere.) The recording quality is DG at its best, full of detail and depth. Listen to the beautiful, aching first statement of the violin in the Sibelius and you will at once be transfixed.

I've used many of them dealing with my four children and with great results. Secondly, the author has a refreshingly positive and compassionate view of children which is important and contagious. Her term \\"creative disciplinarian\\" is interesting, teaching one to become aware and alert to a given situation instead of just dishing out punishment in robot-like fashion.

Ne-yo's music is sexy with a hip-hop feel to it. If you like Michael Jackson and Prince ne-yo sound like a combination of them both at times with his own uniqueness added to it.

Where Because of You departs from the norm is in the musical arrangements. Ne-Yo cites his influences for this album include Prince, and Michael Jackson.

The songs included on this release all have the same sound and tend to just blend together - making it quite a \\"blah\\" CD. Which in turn makes it very forgetable.There are a few \\"ok\\" songs on here but, none that are really worth running out and buying the CD for.

I can't even say I like the first single off of the album.

Yes, the promo vids aren't that great. Yes, the old guy is annoying. But, these videos were already compiled. The real greatness of this dvd, is overlooked. Great concert footage from a great era of the band; and it has remixed in surround. The Archive portion, especially lends itself to this option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Previous review inaccuracy","review":"To say that Bauhaus receive no income from this release is completely untrue. They are actually being paid a HIGHER royalty on this release than on the previous vhs issues.

The relationship between the chauffeur and Lady Bradley is too casual yet too platonic to believe , the motive for the murders weak. The ending is also too weird for me. Not to mention I had it figured out long before the end. If you are a fan of Suchet's Poirot or Joan Hickson 's Miss Marple, you will find this not up to par. Too bad because Diana Rigg is so fun to watch. But even she doesn't save this shabby mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece Theatre Disappoints","review":"A disappointing sequel to The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries - Speedy Death.

Every little detail from the makeup and jewelry to the music and clothes to the homes and countryside give way to the feel of the 1920's England. The acting is superb. Diana Rigg illuminates the screen & treats the viewer as someone in on the inside joke. There is evil lurking around the corner or in a haunted house or to a vaudeville stage or a girl's preppy boarding school. Strong scripts with a great supporting cast gives chills and suspense.

I originally found this in my local mall, (hah) browsing for an Exodus CD. When I caught a glimpse of \\"Gore Metal,\\" I was intrigued. I mean, just look at it. When I placed it on the checkout counter, the clerk looked at me like I was insane. If there's a better sign of a great album, I'd like to know what it is.There's not alot to say here. The guitars literally sound like chainsaws, appropriately enough. The bass is pretty much drowned out by the overwhelming drums, and the vocalist's scathing grunts reach subterranean levels. Though brisk tempo changes run amock, the music here isn't exactly enviable in its virtuosity. Exhumed pride themselves on brutality, and strong grooves. \\"Deathmask,\\" \\"Limb From Limb,\\" among other classics, are highly infectious. Exhumed's \\"Gore Metal\\" doesn't exactly propel metal into a new level of subtlety,but it gives what it promises.- Thus says the Pellington"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Evil Grind Core.","review":"What can I say about this album besides the fact that is very fast and very evil sounding.

My ears rang afterwards for a few minutes it was so intense.Exhumed: Gore Metal is a must buy for every metal head but unfortunately there following up second album \\"Slaughterclut\\" didn't top this one. In Gore Metal you had all four members Matt Harvey, Col Jones, Mike Beams, and Ross Sewage. In Slaughtercult you had Ross Sewage (Death Throat) leave the band which just left the remaining three.By all means purchase this album now, it is truely a wicked taste of death and thrash straight from the pits of hell!

When I got it I put it on it felt ok at first, But then I wore it to work and I suffered for about 4hours and then i just had to take it off. The Straps that go under the arm pits were killer. They should attach a piece of Fleece or something to those straps, it might be more comfortable. I haven't tried to wear it agian yet.

There are better options here on Amazon, but you have to invest more money for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually Works!!!","review":"This thing really does work! You need to order one size up from your normal size though. I am normally a \\"large\\", and I needed an \\"extra large\\". It is a little uncomfortable at first. But here's the thing: How many medical devices are comfortable? Is traction? A cervical collar? No...you get used to it, AND...it does improve your posture! INSTANTLY!!! I was really skeptical, and it took me a minute or two to figure out how the thing went on. But as soon as I did, I could immediately tell my shoulders were being pulled back, and I wasn't hunching over from the 8 ruptured disks I have! For the most comfort, wear a t-shirt under a long sleeve shirt! That works fine for me! I don't think that's asking all that much for something this inexpensive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works! Itchy...","review":"Like everyone else says, this is a gentle reminder not a forceful pull.

So tall and a bit big and the size I ordered (ML) works just fine.It needs a t-shirt though and with some of my work clothes that is going to be visible and I'm going to have to figure out how to wear it while discrete.

Abbado is consistently up tempo, which, in my opinion, does not allow the music to breathe, if you will. Just for the sake of comparison, Furtw?ngler's recording of the Vorspiel lasts 9:52, Abbado's lasts 8:24. The result is that it feels hurried and ineffective.On the other hand, Kurt Moll as Heinrich der Vogler is noble and divine, so if you like Moll as much as I do, then this recording is worth purchasing. Other noteworthy performances include Meir and Jerusalem in the title role.Bottom line: Abbado needs to quit collecting like he has a plane to catch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"#1 Fan Metal License Plate","review":"Not Really Happy On This Purchase.

Davidson's book is tough going in places, which is why I gave it one star off, but the material is in fairness quite complex. He emphasizes the role of cis-regulatory sequences in genes and the structure of the systems that regulate gene expression in development and evolution in some detail. It becomes clear how minor mutations in the regulatory part of a gene can transform how it is expressed, and why the importance for evolution in mutations in gene expression is clearly much greater than for mutations in the protein coding sequence. His explanation for what is responsible for the incredible homologies in, for example, the pax 6 gene that regulates eye development across phyla is very illuminating. A must read for anybody interested in the molecular basis for development and evolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far","review":"It has been great the few times I have used it.

My older model had a rechargeable battery, and is apparently no longer available). Right from the get-go, I had trouble figuring out how to insert the batteries, as there were no directions on the package as to how to do this. I initially tried to unscrew one of the panels, without success. Frustrated, I turned to the reviews on Amazon, and was incredibly grateful to find the battery insertion directions in the initial review here. (Unscrewing the back of the spotlight, counter-clockwise, with no need for tools). I NEVER WOULD HAVE FIGURED THIS OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. !!!! I anticipate that this will be just as awesome a spotlight as my previous model, which I use mainly for taking the dog out in the dark and locating his droppings.

I was favorably surprised by brightness of this light, and it being a bit smaller than expected. This is a basic spotlight with just one switch setting but that is fine for my use. It seems to be built tough, and I expect many years of use. I had a 10+ year old Energizer Hard Case whose lens cover had become badly discolored, and choose this Energizer LED to replace it.

Additionally, there is no indication on how to load the batteries anywhere on the light or the packaging. I know this must sound amusing, but who would expect that the whole back of the light would unthread? I was looking for latches, screws, etc. You'll see what I mean when you receive yours, and then you will also chuckle.Works great, and is very bright. Compares well to a 1M candle spot that I have. I've used it a few times now out on the ocean for spotting markers, bouys and debris at night. The LED light doesn't return as brightly off of reflective bouys as a full-spectrum white light, but the long duration and very tight beam make up for any limitations."},{"rating":"2","title":"best and toughest spotlight I have ever had","review":"I work for UPS and at this time of year I use spotlights as a tool to find houses that don't want to make it easy to get there packages because they are not leaving the lights of for us to see their address. I have gone through a few spotlights, and by far this is the best one that I have tried. It is light, compact and just as bright as the big bulky lights. The rubber armor is great it not lonly protects, but also keeps it from moving when riding on the dash for easy access. Batteries are easy to get to, just twist off the back, no little screws to mess with.

Three-hour burn time on high power. Cyclops has consistently been the leader in bringing newly engineered lighting instruments to the outdoor market.Now this light I love, The Energizer is wimpy compared to it.The Energizer model uses C throw away batteries, has only 1 LED bulb.The old saying you get what you pay for rules here.Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for the Cyclops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmm wonderful!","review":"This flavoring smells amazing; I bought it to make homemade Bubblegum Ice Cream just like I used to get from Dipper Dan's Ice Cream Parlor when I was a child.

Well, I was wrong. This game has some of the best settings and atmospheres in a PC game. In the first part of the game, it's easy to feel alone and frightened as you venture away from the inn and out to the snowy woods under the moonlight. The wind is howling, and there's fear in the air. The characters that you (Jonathan) encounter are creepy to say the least, and really add to the dark element of the game. While this game isn't that difficult, it nonetheless has its share of puzzles that border on challenging. Even if you're not a big fan of Dracula, this game can appeal to those who appreciate a game that is scary to the core, and for those who love an overall dark theme. A great musical score complements this game as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it after the first install - poor graphics and gameplay","review":"The game fails to meet the mark on multiple levels: graphics, entertainment value, creativity... list goes on. This looks like a game meant for some bygone era and doesn't stand up to it's illustrious name."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better","review":"To echo another critic, this 2-CD set has a few good tracks, but mostly consists of bland electronica. On Disc 2, tracks 2, 3, 9, and 12 are exceptional - eloquently combining Brazilian/Latin beats and acid jazzy, electronic riffs. Those tracks almost justify the purchase of Disc 2 by itself. However, Disc 1 is pretty much completely unremarkable and it will collect dust on your shelf after one or two plays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well have been called \\"Cafe Montana\\"","review":"Other than a few tracks with Italian acid jazz-like lyrics (one in a dialect that was incomprehensible) it's mostly instrumental, and not that great.

It must be the honesty in the songwriting and the flawless and quite deluxe recording mix. Man, these songs sound fresh and immediate. The first five songs, \\"Headphones\\" thru \\"Just One More Day\\" really pack a wallop with Mr. Fischer and fellow Rainer Maria-er Caithlin de Marrais trading vocal duties. Speaking of \\"Just One More Day\\", this is some potent stuff, Ms. de Marrais claiming that she would buy anything, say anything, just to have one more day with her ex. I think we have all been thru this private hell and this delicate song really resonates. True love is indeed hard to find. It's incredible, this powerful yet oddly static music."},{"rating":"1","title":"My birds hated this food","review":"I bought a bag of this very expensive food and it was a total waste of money.

What a disappointment! Ben's voice is pleasant, but soooo lacking in dynamics. The songs are sort of pleasant, but none are what I'd call good songs. They are generally all boring. The songs are melodically just fair. Ben's lyrics are probably the strongest part of the album, but I wouldn't call them good. The lyrics are okay.The weakest part of the recordings is the musicianship and arrangements. The snare drum sounds terrible on a number of songs (tinny with a lot of reverb). Ben rhythm guitar playing sounds like he has barely learned to play the guitar. Very mediocre and predictable. The lead guitar player plays a lot of musically uninspiring licks and has lousy tone. Nothing to grab the listener from the bass player, either.Sorry, Ben. Better luck next time. And I am a Cleveland Indians fan, too!

Those brave enough to try it with primary school audiences generally \\"dumb it down\\" by using abridged versions with simplified language. This, of course, defeats the purpose, as Shakespeare's genius is in his use of language, the plots being incidental. Fred Sedgewick makes \\"real\\" Shakespeare clear and exciting to understand and teach. He encourages the same kind of word play with his students as Shakespeare himself was famous for. This book is more than a manual to teach children to write and appreciate these great works, it is also a motivating book for teachers interested in adding a new aspect to their language arts classroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover promised more than book provided","review":"The inside of book was all b&w drawings - most of them belonged in the sword and biker mode than mermaids"},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Life, not Hidden Life, of Dogs","review":"Mr. Sipress's book, The Secret Life of Dogs, is as good as the reviews say.

In other words, she picks a subject almost at random. Today its delta blues music, tomorrow its Mae West. Next week it might be The Beatles or Picasso. It doesn't matter. Then write a book \\"shattering\\" everyones image of said topic. Wow, see how wrong you were about that. I must be a great author to point that out. Problem is, its all in her head. Why only a few reviews of each of her books? Because not many people give her any credibility. Even less care. Notice the cliche'd academic style title too: Statement, colon, three words. Always three words.

Changed my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for a couple study","review":"I liked reading through this book with my husband on a weekly basis. We took a long hiatus from it after the birth of our second son, but we finally finished.It gave many suggestions on how to make things work despite the differences in men and women. Impractical expectations due to present-day media disappoints many in the marital bed. By being able to talk with each other and making your spouse happy, the selfishness we often feel can be overcome.I only wish there were more Biblical references throughout this book as to how we should regard the other as more important than ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Soul of Sex","review":"The McCluskeys understand and speak to the inextricable connection between body and spirit. They view sex as a form of communication, so it's natural that they focus on what's being communicated. It's at this deeper level, they contend, that most sexual problems and frustrations begin. And they can only be cured at the source-in the soul.They avoid the degrading lingo that most people default to in discussions of sex. Each chapter begins with a character sketch of a marriage from Christopher's casebook, and the stories resonate, touching on issues all couples struggle through. My cheeks flushed as I saw my own mistakes woven through others' experiences. But the book's gentle tone makes this bearable.With this book, the McCluskeys have set a new standard for the genre. Much more than a manual, When Two Become One speaks to and about the holy longing in each of us, a longing for God in our physical experience of each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one has it all.","review":"Sablewood is a delightful offshoot of the romance genre, incorporating fantasy, and it's rich with character and characters. I think of it almost as a Harry Potter-esque form of the traditional romance novel, and as such, entertaining and strongly written with complexity and depth rarely found in the boilerplate romance species of literature. Congratulations to Brenna McKaye for finding the absolutely right balance between that cleverly imaginative deviation and the age-old story of love. And on top of it, one gets politics and war and humor. A fine piece of writing and hope there's more to come. Tuck yourself in early and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info!","review":"This book was a gift from a friend and it's wonderful.

Over paid ($33.16) due to the way overpriced shipping. When it finally got here, was very excited to open the box of pure purple super bubble. However every piece I have chewed starts out as grape flavored chalk and after chewing for a few minutes the gum never turns into bubble gum... instead it falls apart in my mouth. End up spitting it out soon after. Gum must have been packaged in the 1980's and left in a warehouse somewhere until I unkowningly ordered online and am now stuck with a big box of grape flavored chalk... very unsatisfied. Would not recommend buying bubble gum from this online store!Signed - Grape Super Chalk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pee-yew!","review":"When I saw the opening credits, I knew I was probably in for a letdown. \\"An Allen Smithee Film, Directed by Allen Smithee.\\" For those who do not know, \\"Allen Smithee\\" is a name tacked up on the credits of a picture that has been so badly mauled between original concept and final release that the actual director does not want to place his or her name on it. I can see why whoever actually did make this film wanted no association with it. Chamberlain's acting and his terrible British accent are an embarrassment. Actually, it's very much like the charcater he occasionally plays on the Drew Carey Show (in drag as Craig Ferguson's mother!). Oh, this film is bad. All the acting is stilted and you couldn't care less what happens to any of the characters.

But, I decided to watch the film anyway and form my own opinion about its quality. Well, this has to be one of the worst scripted, worst edited, worst scored and most poorly acted horrors I've ever seen. Richard Chamberlain's acting was so bad that I couldn't help wonder if he had taken laxatives throughout the production and was overacting because he really, really had to get to a bathroom!!

With just an acoustic guitar and Toni's vocals, I think this song captures what is so special about this particular vocalist. Her delivery is rich, emotive and moving, reminiscent of Nina Simone at her most pained.Definitely look for the bonus cuts - it's hard to imagine the record as complete without 'Long Way Home' and 'Suddenly' (though the later sounds like the sequel to 'Spanish Guitar')"},{"rating":"2","title":"Returning to her roots.","review":"Let's face it. \\"The Heat\\" and \\"More Than A Woman\\" were really bad albums. It's a mystery how \\"More\\" even managed to go gold. So I'm glad to see that Toni is noticing that she's not ghetto and she never will be. And \\"street\\" is not what we need in the music industry right now. We have plenty of that. What we need is good ol', classic R&B. And for the majority of the album, that's what she brings. Except for \\"Please\\", which is a sorry track with way too much mumbling, and \\"Take This Ring\\", which is enjoyable but has a way too familiar sound from Rich Harisson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Toni Fans","review":"If you enjoyed Toni's Secrets and The Heat albums you will like this album. This new album feels like a mix between the other 2. A lot of the songs start off slowly so make sure you give them all a chance; listen at least through the chorus.The first single, Please is the most upbeat song. The rest of the songs are mostly sultry Toni at her best, in my opinion. I'm not the biggest Toni Braxton fan but I'm happy that I bought the album. My only complaint is that it's only 10 songs. But to be honest, if there were 13 tracks I'd still be left wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless Talent","review":"Without a doubt, this Girl continues to be a sensation;not only of natural beauty, but an immense singing talent.Toni never looks back, and also never looses sight of her early songs.Wow!

I have owned all of them. I enjoy this one the most because it is really the best album through and through. I don't feel like any of the songs are fillers - they are all unique and wonderful to listen to. The best songs are Sposed To Be, Please, Trippin, and Take this Ring. I don't think these songs got a lot of radio play because she uses her voice more as a musical instrument to accessorize her songs, rather then strong ballads on this album. But you never lose the emotion and genuine feeling in her songs - you feel them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Average at best","review":"Visually Toni Braxton keeps my Glasses Fogged up like I was on London or somewhere.Musically though:while Her Voice is still good the Music for the part is Over-produced.I don't hear no cuts that make me think back to Her Hey day between 92-96.I think she is kinda going through the Motions for the most part on this album.the Material has some moments,but I don't hear that Money Song.I think she hasn't been given the best Material to work with on a whole to me.but again Visually I stayed Glassy Eyed upon watching pictures.if the Album was half as Good as the Visual then she would be the Comeback Artist of the year besides Mariah Carey."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is in a moonring!

This album is R&B perfection. It would have been nice to have more tracks but Ms. Braxton more than makes up for it with the quality of work she put into the album. The Babyface penned \\"I Wanna Be (Your Baby)\\" proves to my favorite track followed closely by just about every other track. This CD is a must have for any R&B fan and is sure to add to Toni's already huge fan base. GREAT JOB TONI!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I love this cd.

This cd is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Aint Rupaul, But B**ch You Better Work!","review":"In my own personal feelings i think Ms. Toni has been getting a raw deal as far as publicity and management on her last few cd ventures. People expect her to sing power ballads and nothing else. As an artist she has to switch it up a bit to add some of the feelings and experiences she has had evoked during the time between recording her material. Toni Braxton's voice is still the melodic, flowing honey it has been since the beginning. Libra definitely proves this. From beginnning to end it is 10's, 10's, 10's across the board. She is not far from being 40, has had heart complications, has bore 2 children and still has all the seductive charms of a she-devil, and the heavenly voice of a just-crowned angel. Ms. Toni, Libra is off the hook, you are off the chain, nuff said......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful album, very happy with my purchase!","review":"I can only recommend this album to everybody, it's a wonderful sensual and soulful collection of songs delivered with Toni Braxton's unmistakable voice. The first single \\"Please\\" went to radios in April, the new single is track #2 \\"Trippin'(That's The Way Love Works)\\" which should be another big hit for Ms. Braxton. I saw her live in concert just last week where she performed among many older hits her current material from this album. I'm excited about an upcoming tour and will cherish this album along with her older releases.My favorite songs are: Trippin', What's Good, Sposed To Be, Shadowless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Toni Braxton","review":"Great artist!

Worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Libra","review":"Really bought CD because 'Please' was briefly given some publicity in the UK then almost immediately dropped off the radar screen and couldn't buy it or the album anywhere. I was told it was on import only. Loved Please so much I thought I would use it as an opportunity to hear the rest of the album. However, the rest of the album seemed rather bland to me personally, although I have only listened to most of them once or twice. A work colleague listened and didn't rate it much either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooops!!!","review":"Give us our good old Toni back! This her new effort sounds like a sweaty remake of her worst tracks from all her previous albums. I am a most devoted fan of Toni and I have to admit I have all of those.

Then it explains why she sounds so exhausted on this album as well as its title..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is she saying?","review":"Was about to throw this CD out the window onto the Interstate until I got to cut #6.

It was definitely a good bounce back from her last cd. The beats are nice and the lyrics hold their own. Toni's vocals are pretty hot as well, classic Toni Braxton. My favorite song is Please. It has a nice dance vibe to it and a little attitude. Overall the album is definitely worth checking out and a sure fire message that Miss Braxton isn't going any where any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Toni's best! Her earlier albums will always be the best","review":"Unfortunately, Toni's Libra album is very disappointing to me. I glad I check this out at my local library because this album is not worth the money. Last album More than a Woman was way worse than this. I wasn't feeling any of the songs. When she was with La Reid, Babyface and Diane Warren, that was Toni. This album is not the Toni Braxton I love during the early 90s when she sang songs from Another Sad love song to Unbreak my heart. She will always be a great singer, but sadly Toni isn't making big again like she used to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best, but good","review":"Libra is a good album. The problem with the album is that she had to do music from this time period, resulting in her not being able to stay with her old style. Also, the album is too short. The upside of this album is that it all of her songs are either good or okay. Please, trippin, take this ring, midnite, and I wonna be(your baby) are all good songs. The rest of her songs are okay, and none of her songs are bad. I think part of why her album was so short was because she was trying to play it safe and not have too many bad songs. By doing that, none of her songs were bad, but the album ended up being too short. It's a good album, overall, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back with FIRRREEEE!","review":"I have to say I wish the album was more than ten songs, but I do have to say the songs are quality. It is definitely worth buying. I think Toni went back to the basics for creating her album and I think the next one will be even better. It was worth going out to get it! I enjoyed \\"What's Good\\" and the Babyface/Under Dogs creation, \\"I Wanna Be (Your Baby).\\" Great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I BOUGHT THIS U.S. EDITION ONLY TO FIND OUT THERE IS A IMPORT VERSION THAT HAS 4 (FOUR) KILLER BONUS TRACKS!","review":"Don't get me wrong this is still a good album with the Key Cuts being \\"Please\\",\\"Take This Ring\\" and \\"Shadowless\\", but it's the Bonus Tracks that are only found on the Import Edition of \\"Libra\\" that takes this album where it needs to go. This U.S. Edition focus more on her change in sound (Music-Wise)...Change is good, but you gotta have a little something for the die-hard fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but a word to the wise...","review":".....DO NOT buy the regular US release of Libra! Spend the extra money and buy the german import from edel records (yes, amazon sells that version). The import has 3 more songs than the US version, and if you buy the US version you only get ten songs (how cheap of Blackground, huh!?). And the 3 bonus songs on the import version are fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"toni is back ya'll!!!","review":"After the disappointing more than a woman I thought she was done for sure and felt sad cause she always had great music but more than a woman was so bad that I didn't bother buying it like I always did with toni albums. But now she's back with sizzling r&b jams and an updated new sound that will appeal to both youth and adult audiences. She tried to be hip hop on 'woman' but it didn't work and I'm glad she realized that. If you enjoyed mariah carey's records this year with her chart dominating hits, you will enjoy toni too. The divas are slowly coming back doing their thing better than ever and more divas will continue to come back next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toni Is Back And Sounds Better Than Ever.","review":"While 2002's More Than A Woman wasn't my favorite Toni CD, it had its moments. Now I don't own the American release of Libra, I own the Germany re-release. This is a very good CD. It's the Toni we fell in love with, with a little spice thrown up in there. All in all a very good album with a lot of songs worthy of being hits. Standout Tracks include Please, Suddenly, Stupid, Midnite, I Wanna Be (Your Baby) (dedicated to her son, Sposed To Be and The Time Of Our Lives (w/ II Divo)."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album needs more recognition","review":"this album is mostly filled with r&b/soul/jazz songs with only several hip hop sounding songs, including the leading single please, which is brilliant. The video is very creatively done and the strings hook is so catchy. The second single trippin has a beautiful piano hook too and I hope more people buy it and contribute to the sales of this wonderfully crafted album from toni braxton. Her last album was more musically diverse than her others and most people didn't enjoy it, but if you like her first 3 albums this is a must have album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secrets...It is Not!","review":"I have every Toni B album that's ever been commercially released, and had been highly anticiapting this new cd for quite a while after hearing about her departure from Arista. So when it was available for import in London, i stormed down to the shops to buy what i thought would be a gem. I was not pleased to say the least, bland and generic, are the terms best used to describe the album. Please and trippin are the only decent tracks on the album, certainly even they cannot be compared to the gems on the Secrets album, which to this day still stands as one of my favourite albums of all time. So just like Usher who has yet to produce a new album to better 8701, Toni still has yet to better secrets or even the heat. Perhaps a return to older ballads is the key to her revival and more collaborations with Babyface."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL USED TO ALBUMS LIKE THIS","review":"TONI B STILL HAVENT' FAILED ME..SHE'S BEEN BRING HEAT.ALL THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE AMASING BUT FOR ONLY 10 SONGS..IT KEEPS ME HUNGRY FOR MORE FROM TONI..I GUESS THAT'S WHY SHE ONLY WANTED TO PUT 10 SONGS ON HER ALBUM..TO MAKE US HUNGRY FOR MORE FROM HER,RIGHT?

You need to take whatever it was that Mariah had and take a hit of it, cause you're star quality is gone. Please would've been hot if it wasn't dropped in May with no video. Trippin is like Brandy's Saddid another song that has past it's prime. The only songs that even come close to average are 'Take This Ring' and that's because of it's beats.

I believe this one is one of them.Chicago Symphony plays with such a passion that any listener can differentiate with other orchestras.The Firebird in this recording is the complete ballet, not a suite. 1919 Firebird Suite is a summarized version of the complete ballet.Chicago Symphony Brass gives the mighty sound and they show why CSO bras section is the best in the world of orchestras.What makes Boulez a great conductor is that he doesn't cross the \\" Line \\".

Of course, this results in additional air escaping the tire.Don't purchase this item..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke pretty quickly.","review":"Worked pretty good at first.

The cheap green plastic around the tip broke and no longer formed a proper seal to measure pressure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent at best","review":"Like I said, inconsistent at best, which makes it worthless as a measurement tool. Sometimes it would be way off, sometimes I couldn't get a reading at all.

Imagine going to a Billy Joel concert, and finding out that there was a stand-in singer. That about sums it up for me.Three of the piano pieces were \\"canned\\", not even played live at the performance. Now imagine the cost to see the show in New York City for four people, and you understand my (negative) enthusiasm.It was billed as a musical. The dancing was good. But there was very little connection between the dancing on stage and the music that was being performed. Not even dialog to clue you in to the action.Save your money. Buy a CD of real Billy Joel music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I recently saw Moving Out on Broadway, and was very impressed. Being a dancer myself, I must say its the best show on broadway I have ever seen. Part of the great experience is the live band they have playing during the whole show. It blows you away. The singer and musicians sound just like Billy Joel himself. His music gives a great rock experience and I love listening to the Moving Out soundtrack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movin' Out CD: Why?","review":"Who is this recording for? Surely not for Billy Joel fans, who would undoubtedly prefer Billy doing the actual singing. For that matter, why would anyone want to listen to 60+ minutes of Billy Joel covers?

It's no wonder you see used copies of Movin' Out is used records stores everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album, But The Wrong Singers","review":"I have one problem with this album, one and only one problem, that is Billy Joel doesn't sing it. These singers are very good, don't get me wrong, but I need the real Billy Joel. All of Billy Joel's fans probably agree that no one can compete with Billy Joel. Besides this fact, it is a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???","review":"This album is simply a list of BJ's songs sung by an imatator. Michael Cavanaugh does have a great voice and could do a GREAT job on an album that has ORIGINAL tracks on it. He just didn't live up to BJ's originals. If you liked, or want, these songs on a CD, buy a greatest hits CD. Don't bother with this album, buy a BJ greatest hits and wait for a Michael Cavanaugh original CD. It really is the best way to go.I haven't seen the Broadway production yet, so maybe the songs are better on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"different, but not better","review":"I ordered this for my wife when her belgian waffle maker died after 15 years of regular use. Since I prefer fruit and whipped cream on my waffles instead of syrup, I thought the \\"boat\\" style waffles this makes would be better for that purpose. While the boat does hold fruit better, the quality of the waffles produced is not as good as that from a good quality belgian waffle maker. The center of the boat tended to be soft and undercooked when the bottom and edges were done. After two weeks of the wife and kids complaining about the waffles this maker produces, my wife bought another belgian waffle maker from a big chain store. Breakfast is a happy time again, and this little novelty occupies shelf space in my garage alongside the breadmaker, waiting for a garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value for price.","review":"I was looking for a compact product, something that could stow away easily.

My suggestion: Buy three bottles. Take the recommended dosage \\"religiously\\" on a daily basis until you have completely depleted the supply. Have monthly blood tests.

The opening chords of the final movement are impressive and exhilerating. The orchestra is a bit too heavy at several points, especially the brass during the second and last movements. The sixth is okay, but I would have preferred a much more lighter and serene approach. The Berlin Philharmonic's sound gets too heavy and thick at several points in the work. The first and last movements are a bit too slow for my tastes as well. These points aside, the fourth movement is intense, dramatic, and terrifying, conveying the full fury of a thunderstorm. This is a highly recommended CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bum rush","review":"A disappointing release that has very little depth. The emotion is not there. Too rushed and frantic. /Beethoven, particularly his symphonies, are, to me, like a fine wine to be tasted and held in the mouth for full enjoyment. With this album I feel like I'm sitting in a good restaurant and being rushed through the meal. This is the second Beethoven's 5th/6th symphony album I have by Karajan, and I'm not impressed.

I'm not a really big fan of the Fifth. The Seventh and the Ninth are my favorites, and I'm having a devil of a time finding the right recording of the latter. It takes an exceptional recording of the Fifth to get me interested in listening to it again. This recording is it for me. The precision and fire of this interpretation are right up there with the best.

It referred me to the film \\"Pootie Tang\\". So I went on down to my local video store and rented a copy. Now I feel like a total idiot. I am sorry to contradict all you other reviewers, but I didn't connect with this movie in any way. I know Pootie was supposed to be a total hipster, but his custom-made words (e.g. Tippi Tai, Sine your pitty on the runny kine, Wadatah, Sadatay...) made me want to scratch my TV screen into a pile of shavings. Beleive me, I love Chris Rock, but I really thought he deserved better than to play some dumb guy's flunkie. Anyway, rent this movie if you must, but if you liked all the funk and moxie in Undercover Brother, I think you will be disappointed. The only musical number in this thing is just Pootie doing nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"sadatay\\" ok i prolly spelled that wrong","review":"my bf showed this to me:D its funny and i really liked it:D lol and id like to say that i liked it too.LOL ok byebye:D"},{"rating":"1","title":"not funny","review":"This movie has it's moments, but they're all in the trailer! Perhaps this movie is a spectacular satire as some say, if it is, it is not an accessible one. Even Chris Rock wasn't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and not that funny","review":"I expected more from Louis CK, but this movie was a waste of time. I like dumb movies like \\"Tommy Boy\\" and \\"Zoolander,\\" but \\"Pootie Tang\\" just wasn't very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exposing Henry Hype for the Hypocrit he is","review":"Henry Hyde's last name fits him well. He is a true Jeckyl and Hyde character constantly speaking about morality and virtue but displaying very little of it. I will always remember him mostly for his hypocrital, self intrested ramblings during the Clinton impeachment farce when he said\\" It's alright if this country has some corrupt judges\\". Is this man devoid of sanity? He showed the country that the impeachment was nothing more than his parties abuse of power and how they hijacked governmental authority for their own selfish interest and why they should not be in office."},{"rating":"1","title":"heartbroken","review":"If you love the music of John Stewart do NOT buy this album. To put it very simply, his voice is shot. The songs are good, the music is good and the vocals are weak, quavering, atonal. Stewarts' voice sounds like that of an 80 year old man who struggles to walk down the sidewalk with a cane. It makes me very unhappy to write this, but it is true and needs to be said to the potential buyer. This album is bad enough to tarnish your affection for the artist, whose music I savor and hope to find renewal in some of his earlier albums. It also cost too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind","review":"I always approach new JS albums with so much history and so much hope, and he meets and exceeds expectations so regularly it's just amazing. The idea that the man can have this much to say and this many musical ways to say it 36 years down the line from \\"California Bloodlines\\" is simply staggering, and I would say unprecedented. I guess that's why he's John Stewart and no one else is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journey to WHERE?","review":"We went out on a limb buy ordering this movie without anyone we knew ever seeing it. We did the same when we purchased \\"Amiee & Jaguar\\". A & J was a wonderful foreign film! This one unfortunately was not. Through the whole movie we were awaiting something...anything of excitement to happen - nothing ever did. The scenery was ok but not fantastic and definitely not cool enough to overshadow the boring script.We say DON'T BUY with this one. Borrow it from someone else who was brave enough to buy it and save your $20!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"OUR JOURNEY WAS THE DEVIATION\\"","review":"In the months leading up to the Second World War, two women travel from Switzerland to Afghanistan to study an elusive nomadic tribe in Kafiristan. Writer Annamarie Schwartzenbach and researcher Ella Maillart embark on a journey that is both physical and emotional as they discover their own hopes and dreams. Unfortunately this film failed to capture my interest and was rather dull. Aside from the stunning cinematography of the Middle East and the (very) sexy Annamarie, JOURNEY TO KAFIRISTAN is a slow story with little insights of the human condition to offer the audience. I hesitate to recommend this film to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journey to where?","review":"I hated this movie...I don't think I can come up with anything nice to say at the moment about this it. It was slow...boring...and well...odd.

Too bad one has to buy the series piecemeal rather than having the series available on one DVD. Guess that means bigger profits for the producer! Which aslo becomes difficult to track which events are covered and which ones aren't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"The animation wasn't very good, and the whole plot just proves how desperate the Barbie company is. The Barbie company is obviously scared by the threat of the Bratz dolls, so they tried to make a \\"cool teen\\" movie.IN reality, Barbie is for three year olds, and the themes of the movies are just too adult for three year olds. Tweens are what this movie is appropiate for, and what self respecting teen would watch a Barbie movie?The movie is about Barbie whining about being unpopular, and wishing that an (ugly) \\"Mr. Hotty will recognize her and be her boyfriend. H3er \\"so clever\\" scheme for popularity is to make her band play BAD songs at the fall formail. A total must see. NOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for little girls!! This movie is for girls 13+ and by that age they don;t play w Barbies!","review":"This Barbie DVD was very disappointing, Barbie and her friends had conversations like \\"Oh he's so hot!\\" This is not appropriate for girls who actual watch and play with Barbies. Not a good story either. I'd recommend Princess and the Pauper if you are looking for a Barbie movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"When I got this DVD I thought it was going to be really good and I was really happy. But when I saw it, I was really Dissapointed.It is a just like Mean Girls!

The Songs are really good, If they have a soundtrack I want it :) Apart from that, this movie wasn't very good.Oh and PS. Unlike the other Barbie Movies, this movie isn't really for like really young girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on the previews","review":"I think the subject matter is a bit grown up for the younger girls. Its more suited perhaps to the tweens, who wont watch it anyway. I liked Mermaidia, it had strong female characters. I hope Barbie learns in the Diary movie there is much more to life then boys and popularity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good!","review":"story line: not for young kids, and not even really good for older kids. she has to try to fit in with the cool kids. whatever. i hate that an animated kid movie took on the teenage ideals of teenage movies.

No offense, but it totally is NOT a positive influence. Barbie says, \\"I need to find a way to approach the popular crowd.\\" So she's basically saying, oh I have to be popular. This is basically another Mean Girls-esque movie just with Barbie. Role model? Yeah right. Yes, let's all be blonde cronies and rule the world being popular! Frankly, I'm a bit miffed because there are never Asians. They're all blonde, brunettes...hello? Barbie is racist and such a stupid vision of \\"beauty\\" - thanks to Barbie, people are bulimic. Thank you so much you blonde idiot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Barbie DVD","review":"It's a little mature for the typical Barbie crowd. I bought it for my four year old daughter, and I was taken aback a bit by the more mature themes represented on the DVD (high school, Fall Formals, crushing on the cutest guy in school, etc). But I actually like the DVD myself. It's sweet, and has great music throughout by Skye Sweetnam. My daughter watches it with me, and we discuss things she doesn't understand. She also loves the music. But, once again, it would have been nice to have a bit more of a head's up on the actual content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks pretty good","review":"Wow, I'm kinda glad Barbie did this. A teen like movie, I can't wait to watch it. but I wonder why it's showing on TV before it comes out. Oh well, I'm thinking of watching it caue it looks really good. Bratz, Danny Phantom, and My Scene ROCK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be rated in advance","review":"Very disappointed by the preview. My daughter loves all of the Barbie videos and is now very interested in a video that highlights \\"sophmore year,\\" and \\"did he kiss you?!\\" comments.Up until now Barbie videos have been based on fantasy play and imaginative play and this new viedo applies to real life situations that are too old for the crowd of girls it has always appealed to.Lions Gate or Mattel has, in my opinion, missed the mark on this one. Any parent who buys this Barbie Diaries video for their young daughter is just wishing their youth away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young children!","review":"Warning to Moms of young children. I let my 4 year watch this movie. She adores it and I did not think I had anything to worry about with it until she started saying \\"I Hate My Life\\". When I asked her where she learned to say that and she said from the Barbie movie. Sure enough, that's what Barbie says in it. I am shocked phrases like this were in a Barbie movie and I am very disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"too mature for young audiences","review":"My biggest complaint with this Barbie movie is the line from Barbies guy friend expressing excitement at walking in on a \\"girl hug\\". Do we really need that kind of suggestive remark in a Barbie movie aimed at girls ages 5 to 12?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is actually pretty cool!","review":"For a Barbie film this surprised me. It's a total write off of Mean Girls, so imagine Barbie as Lindsay Lohan, with a couple of sidekicks, including a band junkie and a typical clothes-obsessed brunette. Unusual to me, Barbie is not the typical \\"popular\\" stereotype as I grew up knowing her, she's simply a typical teenage girl wanting to fit in. Overall I'd say the movie isn't for the littler Barbie fans, it probably doesn't set the typical \\"popularity\\" values parents want their 6 year olds to see, but it's a lighthearted afternoon flick for all teenie-boppers at heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie","review":"This Barbie movie was not what I expected. It covered high school issues about fame and popularity. I just think that all the other Barbie Movies were in a fantasy world teaching lessons with a strong female figure (my children new it was a fantasy world but the lessons were deep). This dealt with petty issues. Barbie should have been out doing service work not getting involved with the gossip of high school. Even when you are in high school there is still a big world out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely innapropriate for young girls","review":"This movie is truly awful. Obsession with being liked by guys, wearing makeup, \\"looking hot\\", hanging out with the \\"populars\\" on the \\"popular lawn\\", gossiping about friends and attracting as many admirers as possible by having \\"fabulous hair\\" and great outfits are NOT activities that i want my 6 and 8 year old girls emulating now or as they get older. Garbage garbage garbage. I thought it was safe to assume all of these cheaply animated barbie movies were intended for the lower elementary school crowd, but i have no idea who the market for this movie was supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"The animation is jerky, Barbie looks odd and nothing like herself. She's portrayed as a highschool student, but acts like a middelschool student. Poorly written, poorly animated. My 8 year old daughter loves Barbie movies, and she asked me if we could send this one back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Pre-teen Girls","review":"I am the mother of a Barbie-obsessed 4-year-old and bought this unaware of the plot. I like the movie but think it's too mature for my daughter right now. It would be great for a girl in middle school however. I did find it entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love You, Carlo!","review":"This book transformed my approach to pasta making and sauces. It's a compact powerhouse with the author's charm and humor in abundant evidence. His exceptional knowledge and generous approach to teaching and explaining the process is outstanding. I now regularly make pasta instead of my machine gathering dust. Carlo makes the process approachable, and his friendly encouragement will have you enjoying pasta and exceptional sauces. His mantra is quality ingredients and classic techniques, not complicated or inaccessible recipes. Worth it for the sauce chapter alone if you want to purchase pasta."},{"rating":"1","title":"matalin cannot be trusted","review":"Mary Matalin has been supporting the publications of people like Jerome Corsi. Any statements that she makes should be taken with extreme care and checked before being accepted. It is likely that what she says about herself and her daughters is also distorted, and likely in a way favorable to herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and easy for an affordable price","review":"I just bought this for my cat and it definitely keeps the mess and odor to a minimum. It cuts the cleaning time in half from 8-10 minutes of dumping the litter or sifting through it with a scoop, and spraying the box down- down to only 2 minutes. It's just overall so much better than any of the other litter boxes/litter maid products I've seen. And the price is reasonable.I wish I had this for my previous cats I've owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the listing for the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box for WAY more reviews & info","review":"I just happened to notice this listing, which was evidently put up by an online retailer, but if you check outOmega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Regular, Green and Beigeyou'll find a wealth of info, & almost 1000 reviews, with about a 4.5 star average(which is about what I would give it). This product works great, you just need to learn how to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"I bought this box thinking it would help with the ease of cleaning it out but i was mistaken. Like others have said, the litter clumps on the grate and i still have to scoop (scrape) clumps off the sides and bottom of the box. I did not have a problem putting it together, nor did i have a problem with litter leaking all out. The space inside is very small for a cat and my cat's body practically hangs entirely out of the box when he uses it. The kitten doesn't have trouble but he is still very small. I have to empty it at least twice a day and it smells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate It","review":"I bought this thinking it would be a good alternative to the mechanical boxes, but not so. I haven't had the litter leakage that others here have, but when the cats pee on the grate with clumping litter inside, the litter is stuck and clumped on the wrong side, and you have to take the thing apart to get it all out. I too now simply clean the box out with a scoop like a regular litter box. I will be throwing this box out when I move next."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like them. I really did.","review":"I ended up with three of these litterboxes...from other people who hated them as well. Here's the thing: With the grate in, they're very cramped for even the tiniest cat. Your cat can just deal with it for your convenience? Not so, my friend. Because of the cramped quarters, your cat will inevitably end up defecating or urinating on the grate...which makes the entire \\"sifting\\" action of it virtually nil.So, as it stands, I'm yanking the grate, covering up the drawer hole, and using my reliable old scoop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't think it was much of an improvement","review":"First of all, it was difficult (really, impossible) to put it together in a way that litter wouldn't leak out whenever the box was rolled to clean it; the parts fit very poorly. Secondly, if your cat uses scoopable litter now, you know that sometimes the liquid penetrates to the bottom of the box so instead of having a discrete clump, you have a clump stuck to the box. The Omega Paw does not deal with these at all, so you still end up scraping and scooping, albeit less often than with a regular box. Thirdly, this box is big, so big that it was a problem to give it enough space so that it could be rolled over to clean. Because of this, it was also bulky and awkward to wash. I used it for awhile, didn't hate it, but disliked it enough to get rid of it when I moved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Mistake","review":"This was one of the worst purchases I've ever made. The problem that I had with mine is the litter pouring out all over the place. Everytime I went to flip the thing over, the litter came out of the cracks. Everytime that I went to take out the little drawer that is supposed to hold the waste, more litter came out. I ended up using it just as a regular litter box. It was a complete disaster if I tried to use it otherwise. Plus, the opening of the litter box is so low, that everytime the cat goes in and out, even more litter comes out of it. I'm getting ready to throw it in the garbage once and for all, but I must admit I've never had any satisfaction from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Cleanning Litter Box From Omega","review":"The litter box does not work as advertized. It says to roll it over and the clumped litter will fall into the collection container. Well it does not go into the container. You have to scoop it out yourself which is very inconvenient. Would not recommend this product. It is no better than a regular litter box that you have to take the litter lumps out of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minimalist Cool","review":"If your looking for a solid, I mean rock-steady, quality computer case, look no further. The Wave Master is reminisent of Apple's G5 boxes, exhibiting a modern, minimalist design approach. The level of build in this case is the best of many I have seen. Those looking for some flashy, \\"Alien \\" gamer type of box may be dissapointed, as for the rest, it's like having MOMA designing your computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant. Incredibly powerful.","review":"Very rarely does a play have this kind of impact on me; I don't think a play has ever affected me so much before I saw it done.

This CD is proving this. Her impressive quickness and accuracy in Mendelssohn's and Shostakovich's concertos indicate that Hahn will become the legend of the century. This CD was the best violin recording that I have heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mendelssohn, 3rd Movement","review":"Hilary Hahn has a great technique. I loved her Bach even more than Grumiaux's. I figured you couldn't lose with the stuff she uses. I was wrong. What in the world did this young lady do to the 3rd movement of the Mendelssohn? Did she have to run off to the loo or something? I bet the conductor's arm nearly fell off when she sprinted away. She lost all clear articulation when she did that and she also lost the orchestra in a couple of places. As a violin teacher, I would have to tell her to come back to that passage and play it again, slower, and with some clear articulation.It was so rushed I couldn't catch up enough to hear some music. It looks I'm going to keep listening to the old guys on this one ;-). Isaac Stern's and Fritz Kreisler's have left pleasant memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"All right, if you want to live in a hotel room","review":"I had great hopes for this book, but alas I did not find much useful information. The author's background in commercial cleaning and design shows that he has a tendency towards hotel-style decoration and has a strange liking for carpet. NOT a great selection for keeping a house clean! I found other books and common sense more helpful and would not recommend this book to a friend, even if they were building a house from scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earthbound Yoga","review":"I thought this was a waste of money. The quality is poor and boring. I got much more info from Vasant Lad's book Ayurvedic Home Remedies. I found it misleading in that it was going to show you how to make decotions and it does not.

The songs and \\"comedy\\" were painful to hear. There's a small amount of useful technical information but overall it just wasn't worth the money. I wanted it to teach the kids how to play baseball and I wanted to learn enough about hitting and fielding to understand all the plays when I watch a game.

Do not miss it. You may want to get the other Mutter, Karajan, and Berlin Philharmonic violin concerto recordings. They are all great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, not enough dancing, too mature-oriented for kids","review":"I really liked the story, it's a different take on Tchaikovsky's original story line, with a much better core and ending. Most of the characters were well-developed and likeable, but with the exception of Barbie/Odette and Odile which I think needed a bit more depth and character.The motion-capture performed by NYC dancers were exceptional, but the disappointment was that there was actually very little dancing.The character models did not seem age-appropriate, it was something for more mature or teen audiences, I would definitely not recommend this as a kids movie, especially young girls who can get the wrong impression about thinness.The computer rendering of the scenes seemed rather poor for a movie produced in 2003, there was also an major absence of shading/shadows which was very noticeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOOF! This one is the worst! EVIL RED EYED Villian. YUCK!","review":"This movie robs the classic ballet's music, and ruins what story there was with its evil bad guy. (You'd think it was a Disney flick.) The bad guy scared my kids, and they even had nightmares. He has a long, ugly, & pointy nose. He and his awful daughter transform into birds that are dark and intimidating. The red light glowing evil power from his eyes is plain SICK! He shoots his sorcery red power lightning to harm others and even turn Barbie/Odette into a Swan.

End of story"},{"rating":"2","title":"animated introduction to the classics","review":"There are times, in a series of films, that the third movie proves to be a better sequel than the second. \\"Barbie of Swan Lake\\" is one such movie. It picks up where the first movie, \\"Barbie in the Nutcracker\\" left off, in that it introduces young children to the timeless beauty of classical music married to classical ballet. All that, in a story they can easily understand. The movie found fans, not only in my ballet-crazy four year old daughter and me (I love animated features!), but in my almost eight year old son as well, who enjoyed the buildup and the suspense that came at the climax of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too SCARY for toddlers! Get your act together 'Mattel'!","review":"The 'Mattel' and 'Mainframe' entertainment companies should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this UNRATED animation movie, with NO age recommendations on it's DVD case! My 3 year old was terrified at certain scenes in this movie. The 'innocent Barbie' theme is misleading. I'm no religious zealot or uber conservative here, but these companies should really indicate (on the packaging) that these movies can indeed scare some toddlers!

A great way to introduce the classics to Young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming after Rapunzel, a disappointment","review":"Coming off what I felt to be a very well done adaptation of the Rapunzel story, I felt Swan Lake to be a serious disappointment. The characters in this story are very different from it's predicessor. Odette's friends are hardly likable, the only exception being an amusing troll. The story line is disjunct and the computer animation (especially the children dancing)is rather poor and awkward. Gothbart the villian, is voiced wonderfully by Kelsey Grammer and is the only exceptional part of this production. Odelle (Gothbart's daughter and Odette's antithesis) is simply appauling in concept, pushing offensive, and it is difficult to watch the interaction between the two without feeling somewhat disturbed by the contrast.Sadly, I feel that this represents a poor general effort on the part of the creators and am left to wonder why they waisted their time on such a weak project.Rapunzel is the way to go. The story line is well done and truly uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont want to see this movie again.","review":"This movie was boring.I know that many people loves it,but I dont like to say dont watch this movie or something.The music was terrible.The story was horrible.Barbies hair was like a junk plastic.What a joke.This movie was the moooooooooost dissapointment ever.Mattel did a bad job on this one.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*EVERY ONE KNOWS ME WELL HERE NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP THE MADNESS!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"People are fighting each other in the streets.

Found Sergeant Scott to be a bit less 'smirky' than in his few earlier episodes - but his night with a suspect/then victim in one episode didn't add much to either his character or plot development.

It means something that makes you feel like you are actually there, to immerse yourself into the virtual world.There are really no crashes, no car damage (That i've managed to find yet????), and the graphics really aren't really all that pretty compared to some other games.I suppose if you are a fan of Sports Car GT, or Test Drive Lemans/24 Hours of Lemans, then this game should fit the next step up in gaming.But if you are like me, and in desperate want of an actual immersed racing experience, walk away... quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"super sports cars","review":"I thing this game is going to be cool because if you love fastor sports cars then this is the game for you i am going to getthis game because i like fast cars the cars i like porsches,and ferraris"},{"rating":"1","title":"You tell me","review":"I did not buy this product but I had this experience with this manufacturer (X10). I originally bought a home security system from the manufacturer directly X10. What a mistake, the salesman told me it could have an exterior alarm but after two months of trying to make it work (Often I waited 5 to 7 days before someone got back to me) they gave up and told me it would not work and never should have been promised in the first place. They also use an antiquated way of sending messages to indoor sirens that causes all sorts of problems. Eventually, they offered a refund and I have been waiting over 3 months to receive it.

Astonishingly underrated. I was quite overwhelmed by it. (Only David Oistrakh is any thing like as good.) None of the showy scraping \`gypsy' violin style, just nobility, power, strength and seriousness, which is just what Sibelius is said to have wanted. Apparently, Sibelius marked a slower tempo in the first movement than he might have done just to deter violinists from using it for virtuoso display. Ferras plays this piece as if it were a symphony: passionate with a superb full tone and magnificent intonation. Very good recording quality too. Karajan gives him just the right support: dark, powerful, purposive. Ferras isn't quite as well known these days as some other violinists - this may be partly owning to the fact that he died comparatively young, aged only 49 in 1982. I can't recommend it too highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!","review":"My daughter has wanted this item ever since she saw it on TV with tons and tons of bubbles blowing out......it blows 1 bubble and pops, it is like the arm is not aimed correctly and so the bubble hits the seashell and pops immediatly.

Ten minutes out of the box and I have already decided to take it back tomorrow morning! As the previous reviewer said, the arm on the bubble wand keeps coming off.

The second year of Hogwarts is about to begin and Harry Potter is warned by a small house elf not to return. This starts an amazing adventure filled with magic and fun. Some scenes might be a little scary for the wee ones so a parent close by can be good for comfort. Special effects are amazing and the music is also a treat for the ear. Truly a magnificent sequel.

Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chamber of Secrets Ultimate Edition","review":"I have not watched this yet, but I have seen the original release of Chamber of Secrets and loved it.

This movie is darker and longer than HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, but the novel was too. All of the previous characters from the first film are back and the most crucial elements of the novel survive intact and are brought to life on the screen. There are a few scenes missing, such as the Deathday party that Harry, Ron, and Hermione attend for Nearly Headless Nick. Much of the humor found in the novel is also missing, but I was pleased to find that this movie was much more humorous than it's predecessor. Also, watch the entire movie through the ending credits and find out what happens to Professor Lockhart. A great movie full of action and faithful to it's source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not perfect","review":"I really liked the movie(this goes for the first one too), but I like the books better.

I am quite disgusted with the Harry Potter marketers and producers--I feel that I have been cheated out of my money.When JK Rowling and etc. begin selling unabridged products, I will consider purchasing her movies again.The movies themselves are good; the DVD's are an outright rip-off.BUYER BEWARE!!!Disappointed fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO DIGITAL COPY!!!","review":"Do not be surprised when you receive this and your digital copy code expired OVER A YEAR AGO.

He is all that Daniel (Harry) isn't; he moves his mouth in one side and put his eyebrows up, and you know that he is upset, scared, etc.And Emma (Hermaione) learned to express her feelings just by her eyes, she was superb in her rol. Now then, regretting very much that Richard Harris (Dumbledore) has departed this world, he leave a very hard rol to fill, in wich he plays superbly.All and all, this movie is worth your money, although the casing shoud be much better than the flimsy carton in wich came packed. I highly recommed this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a delightful movie!!!","review":"This Harry Potter movie is great! My nephew loves it and he is 4!

The movie is wonderful and my older child loves it too. I was however disappointed that the 19 additional/extended scenes were not blended into the theatrical version.

It wasn't funny if thats what their getting at. The book was actually enjoyable but the movie didn't follow the book that well. The acting was stupid. They were the worst actors ever. Don't buy or see this movie it will be a waste of your money. The special effects were also a bad joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chamber of Secrets Should Not Have Been Opened","review":"The same story continues, but this time around they deal with a snake. It even has a language of its own. Give me a break! But the way they made the film, it seems so real. I don't like it because it is scary, but I love the school setting. It took me back to the days when I was a student. The teacher is so self-absorbed that it is ridiculous. I probably won't review the rest because I don't remember the other storylines, and there is a huge snake towards the end. That's why I stopped watching, but I'm sure Harry will win because that's just how it happens in movies...real life is different: you win some, you lose some."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAROLD POTTER MOVIES ARE THE WORST EVER!!!","review":"Once again this is another stupid movie that should be ranked with no stars.Daniel Radcliffe has absolutely no talent because he can't do any other motion pictures besides Harold Potter movies.

The whole movie is very sloppy(so was the first one)the problem is that they tried to throw it all together too fast to make as much money as they could off pottermania. They really needed two things to make any of the movies great.1. They should of waited for all the books to be published before writing the script and filming. For a tighter production.2. Hire Peter Jackson he obviously knows a thing or two about making a fantastic fantasy film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail for Computer Users","review":"Hope you don't want to watch this on a computer, because this film (and other early harry potter films) come pre-loaded with the Interactual player, an effort to prevent pirating/limit access disguised as a means of accessing special features. Interactual is bad software in and of itself (it sends information about how you use it out to the content creator without notifying you) but it's also not compatible with Windows Vista or 7, and the DVDs are set up to block you from viewing them on a computer using any player but Interactual. While it's installed, it will mess up the graphic display on your other players, and even if it's uninstalled, the DVD will halt playback or only play without sound. There's no available fix for this and they don't even still make the Interactual player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Widescreen Edition)","review":"The DVD was in good condition.

I don't think we've ever been able to see the extended version b/c to get the vocal & acting together we stop the movie and go to scene selection and it bounces back to the original version. The behind the scenes is very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun romp","review":"You'll enjoy it a lot more if you've read the book. Otherwise, I don't think there's anything crafty about it, but it's tons of fun. The major drawback to the film is something I've never encountered in a movie before--an overwhelming musical score. The music is so overdone, so dramatic, so loud, that it distracts from the movie. I've never actually been in a movie where such a thing was noticeable before, so I thought it was very unusual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Review","review":"I am a junior in high school, but I love the Harry Potter series. This movie is the best Harry Potter movie yet. This movie is darker than the first movie, however, it is still very good. Ginny Weasly is featured very predominately in this film. Also Tom Riddle's character is portrayed very well. The actress that plays Ginny is a very good actress. Daniel Radcliffe does a very very excellant job. Rupirt Grint and Emma Watson also do a very excellant job as well. This movie was so good, I can't wait until 2004 when the next movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, comes out in the theaters. Good job Daniel, Rupirt, and Emma, great movie. The same of all of the other characters: Percy, Fred George, Oliver, Draco, Richard Harris (Proffessor Dumbledore), Proffessor McGonnagal, Crabbe, and Goyle, Proffessor Snape, and Hagrid.

Amazon, please get your act together on this. We had to stop using I-Tunes because the sound would never sync up with the action when streaming a rental. We don't go to the free illegal sites to cheat anyone out of their $, we just want something that works. Looks like we will be sticking with free sites for a while. You know what would be awesome?

The last one was made watchable only by Coltrane but in this one he plays a much smaller role. The comic relief void left by his absence is filled by Kenneth Branagh, who gives a fine preformance as harry's new teacher but nothing special. Finally, the worst thing about this film is the ending, a scene where everyone in hogwarts is happy and hagrid comes and gives them all a big hug. This sickly sweet scene is not in the book. if you must have this then save some money and rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Poster PROBLEM!","review":"I don't like the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets poster should have Harry and his friends on the poster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptastic","review":"The books of Hazza P are cool.

Unlike the first film, which took some liberties with the material in the interests of time, the sequel simply left out some of the most charming scenes in the book without really transitioning to the next event. The cast was, of course, excellent, and the sets wonderful, but the film was so predictable in every aspect that watching it was a tedious chore. A literary adaptation is only good if it contributes something new to the material, and this one doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I was a little disappointed with the first one, but I really liked this movie.

Really disappointing I thought. I hope they've improved it since I bought my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter magic","review":"I think Chamber of Secrets is a step back from the first and third movie. It begins on a high note but turns dry 45 minutes later (\\"dry\\" by Potter standards). From that point, it never really recovers. However, the mysterious story and the dark atmosphere (in some moments, overwhelming darkness not far from a horror flick!) really make it stand out from the other Potter movies. Probably my least favorite of the Potter films but worth buying indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb but Not for kids under 9 years of age","review":"My Mum, My Dad and I hesitate to let my little sister watch the movie because there are gaint spider and a giant snake, called the basilsk which can kill by staring at people.

However, if you are over 8, like family, action horror, swordfighting and adventure then this is your movie.There is no reason not to like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A job well done by Chris Colombus and crew!","review":"How often have I heard, \\"The book is better than the movie.\\"? Well, for just about every book that is turned into a motion picture I have! It is a difficult task to take what a reader has seen while reading and project those images on film. The second installment of the Harry Potter series is a success, capturing the feel, characters, and places of Rowling's worlds.

The extended editions are fantastic! They add more story to the films that I could never get tired of watching and while the special features are alright the brilliance lies in the extended version.

But Harry is saved by Ron and the Wesely brothers come and save him in the flying car...which is cool shown on screen. And we begin Harry's second year at Hogwarts. I loved this movie...full of action and fantasy. There are many things we learn about Harry in this movie such as someone is a parseltounge. If you read the books you will already know what happens but it is neat to see how someone else sees the same thing you did. And if you haven't read the book and loved the first movie I think you will be happy with one as it give you insight into Harry and will help with future books and movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Daniel Radcliffe is the only Harry Potter!

Darker. But then, having read all the books, I expected it. The stories just get darker from here, which suits me just fine. This movie was fantastic. Dobby looks exactly how I pictured him while reading the book, and he's as annoying and loveable as the book version. And while it is dark, it's not scary, at least my kids didn't think so (they are 9 and 6), so I wouldn't worry too much about showing this to children, but I would wait until they were school age. Besides, they are reading these books to your kids in school anyways! Harry Potter, while certainly the most controversial literary figure since Tom Sawyer, plays out beautifully on the screen, and I myself can't wait until the next movie in June, which promises to be even Darker and more suspenseful than this one! Too bad I already know the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"These kids still can't act","review":"The disappointing acting from the three young stars is marginally improved, but none of them is convincing for a second. Worse, the magical world of Hogwarts has lost its charm the second time around, and the special effects (especially the really dreadful snake) are strictly grade-B. This movie lacks any excitement or genuine pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flick","review":"I have never had any interest to read a Harry Potter book, but for some reason I really enjoy the movies. I guess because they are different and have something new to offer other than the usual Hollywood \\"Blow everything up and show off my heaving pecs\\" movie.I really liked the witch soccer game, the ghost in the bathroom, the scenery and sets. I liked the giant snake at the end and the way Harry killed it. How the elf got his freedom at the end of the movie was pretty funny.I was a little confused with the whole \\"I am a memory and my diary holds my rememberances and I need this sacrifice to become real again\\", but I went along with it. I don't take movies like this so seriously that I cannot enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I had all the other DVDs except this one and one more.

It was like you were standing right there in the middle of everything. Dobby looked so real. This movie is filled with adventure and action. People of all ages will love it, I'm telling you. There's not one boring part in it. Once one exciting thing is over, another exciting adventure begins.

I guess it's just me, but I don't believe Harry Potter to be that great. I fell asleep with the movie still in its first hour.

The only thing what keeps me from giving this only half a star is the acting of dombledoor it was superb he acts like ho realy cares for what he is trying to do.

That would seem enough to understand the terrible, sour ambiance of these films. Firs tof all, the acting is terrible. Almost all the character show no desicion-making and they are nor believable whatsoever. Emma Watson and Daniel Radclife were particularly frustrating in their acting. The screenplay is awful anyway, so I don't entirely blame the actors. The cinematography is bad, the special effects are sloppy. Please, do yourself a fovour and don't watch the movies.I suggest Lord of the Rings, all three in the trilogy, The Secret of Roan Inish, Hidalgo, Fairytale: a True Story, Chcocolat, Benny and Joon, City of Lost Children"},{"rating":"1","title":"they butchered the books","review":"i am a huge fan of the books and i have been reading them since their american debut. i just cannot watch the movies. i don't feel they accuatly portrayed the characters and i don't feel they stuck to the book as well as they could have. they cut out scenes that were important and added scenes not in the book. they did a horible job. don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Well, after having seen and loved the first Harry Potter movie, I took my girlfriend to see the film we had both been waiting for.

(This coming from a 17 year old female) Anyways, the movie did lack certain scenes and interactions from the book. But overall the screenwriters did a nice job of pulling the movie together.

They will definitly make much more sence.If I was to rate this book I would give it a 4 star!!!By London D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but no where near great","review":"First of all the movies don't come close to comparing with the movies. In my opinion 2 stars is stretching it a little. I know they can't put every detail from the book in the movie but they do miss some things they shouldn't.Some things they made wrong were Mrs. Dursley's hair. In the book it's blonde. In the movie she has black hair. In the book Ron is quite a lot bigger than Harry, but in the movie they're very close to the same size(Harry might even be bigger).The rest in my opinion was pretty good but not great. Those things are big details that they obviously missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment For The Harry Potter Fan At Hand!","review":"Great! Flying Cars, Snakes, and the Pesky Malfoy! I do admit I haven't seen the DVD or the VHS but I've seen the movie in theaters. I have read the first 4 books. I was one of the first fans of Harry Potter. I read them way before the movies and I kinda didn't like them at first. But I tried it again and it was great! I've heard the DVD is GREAT! Just like the first DVD you get to attend Hogwarts and go to Diagon Alley. Sounds better then the first.

Just before the first movie opened, I read all of the books (1-4). Needless to say, I was very impressed with the first movie.Now, I loved the second movie--I even bought it the day it came out. But, I have to admit that the acting was not quite as good as the first. Also, I expected better special effects--especially with the flying car. I had hoped the car would look a little more realistic, and less like the falling Neville in the beginning of the first movie.Never the less, I do recommend this movie to anyone who likes the books or the first movie. But be prepared, as with most sequels, this is one is slightly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Harry Potter Movie!","review":"I thought that this movie stayed pretty true to the book. Of course, most books are better than the movie, and this is no exception and that is why I gave this movie 4 stars.I love the characters, and it is so wonderful to actually see things on the screen. It was so great that all the characters from the first movie were also in this one. I do think that some of the images might be too graphic for younger kids, especially the final \\"fight/battle\\" scene. All in all, it's another great edition to the Harry Potter movie series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In between 4 and 5","review":"As most would certainly agree, this film outperforms its predecessor. The action is a bit livelier, with some unpredictable jolts that can shake a viewer in a dark room. The producers manage to keep the plot entertaining for a range of ages by peppering it with adult humor, as well as ageless action scenes.Unless the name \\"Harry Potter\\" draws a scowl from a family member, most any person with children, or the heart of a child, will want to add this movie to their collection. Even if you don't buy this one, it's worth renting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay for Harry Potter","review":"I'm probably too old for these movies, but I'm unashamed.

Now there is a place to click and go directly there. The special features are easy to get to unlike the first Harry Potter DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, good quality DVD with great bonuses!","review":"The movie is great. Very true to the 2nd book. Since this book was slightly longer than the first, some parts had to be cut from the movie. These cuts were actually filmed as \\"additional scenes\\", and are included on the second bonus disk.The image and sound quality is very good especially since a lot of the movie is shot in darker lit areas. The special effects which looked lower budget in the first movie actually shine in this film. The scenes of Quidditch will be right up there from action scenes from great sports movies. You will feel right there among the players.The bonus disk in this DVD set is better than in the first movie. Its much easier to navigate and the menus are more alive and animated.Overall a great movie adaptation of a fun book. This DVD will be sure to please fans of the movie and of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first","review":"This was a pretty fun film.

The second disk has games and other dementions to it that allow you to have more fun after having watched the movie. So fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good effort, but rushed due to age restrictions.","review":"Harry Potter should not have been made into movies. It may be a good idea, but every character has age restrictions, making the films rushed and causing people heart attacks when Harry's character gets a pimple or has a growth spurt. Another major criticism is that, like the first, more is put into the special effects than the plot and the storyline. The final con would be that, like the book, the plot elements are so obvious that they could have signs reading \\"MAJOR PLOT ELEMENT\\" next to them and give the same effect. Despite these flaws, it has some decent acting, making it not completely horrible, and for children or big fans of the series, I would give it 4 stars for being so faithful to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright","review":"this harry potter movie was nowhere as fun as the first and third harry potter movie. still this movie has parts that is fun too see. and im glad that the cast is the same as the other harry potter movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great!","review":"Chris Columbous is keeping it real and very true to the book in the 2nd movie. I am thrilled through what he did and even though the book was my least favorite of the 5 that are currently released the movie was so good! The DVD version has so many cool effects! You'd love it too. Then-12 Emma Watson, 14 year old Dan Radcliffe, and 15 year old Rupert Grint star in this and are great actors. They truly make this movie worthwhile! Since Chris is no longer directing them :( I don't know if the 3rd movie will be this good-so watch this and enjoy it while you can! Good if you read the books or even if you didn't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the first","review":"This movie had a lot more action than the first.

Read the book.I saw the movie last week and I wasn't impressed. In compare to the book the movie is boring, pointles, suffers a great lack of details and what ever bad thing cross your mind. The book has in it not only the main story line but also small sub stort lines which makes the book the good book it is. The movie has no such story lines and that really ruin the experience we got use to find in the books.If you still want to see this movie all I can say is that the second movie is better then the first one...Enjoy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tale of two misfits...","review":"Acting and set improved since Sorcerer's Stone where the real petrification occurred.Cast for Chambers:Myrtle, Ron, Snape, Vernon - know how to act.Brannagh - real acting.Tom - \\"I'll show you acting, Potter!\\"Dumbledore - Zzzzz.Fake snake - fake.Fawkes - fake savior against fake snake.Ginny & Potter - weird Oedipal resemblance to Lily and James.As usual, suspending belief is essential to understanding the story. Adults have no sense and only the Potter gangsters can bring salvation. So why isn't Professor McGonagall taking lessons from Potter? In a world where snooping is heroism, the tale of two misfits continues, either Harry or Tom will crack, for neither can live while the other fails at acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Scenes","review":"Warning, this rerelease does not have all the scenes in it for some reason. For instance, when Harry uses flue powder to get to Diagon Alley and ends up in that strange shop, it does not show the Malfoys coming into the store. There are other missing pieces, too. I do not see an extended edition anywhere, so I can only assume these scenes have just been left out.

Special effectsWRONG...the snake looked fake, fake snake= dull movie. Not even Maggie Smith can redeem this crud, even though she is quite a babe.

The movie seemed to move a bit too fast at times, causing some time flow issues (perhaps due to the greater length of the book as compared to \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\"). I heard one young viewer arguing that the action in this movie had taken place over a few days, versus the actual many months that the movie attempted to relate. Also, there were some wonderful bits in the book that didn't make it onto the screen. I can only assume this is due to time contraints. The movie ran nearly 2.5 hours as it is. These are relatively minor flaws, however, and overall I found the movie to be most enjoyable.It should be noted that my 9 1/2 year-old states \\"this is the best movie I've ever seen in my life and I vow to never like any of the others as much as this one.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets will be better than the first movie I love the movie and I have the first one on dvd and I love it you guys should see it its a great movie.

Too amny give away too many stars.Which frankly is not just and fair to alot better recordings.NOTE: Buyer beware.Sorry 2 stars.I have now become dis-enchanted with Messiaen as of last week. READ Wilbod's review of the opera St Francsis/Nagano.I have to agree with him.Messiaen was OK for about 3 months after which I lost interest.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all around","review":"Some have said that Beethoven's odd-numbered symphonies are great and his even ones are only mediocre. Well, here Bohm shows us how great the 6th and 8th symphonies are. Like many have commented, this is one of the best recordings of the 6th out on the market. The \\"Pastoral\\" symphony is rich and lush, and Vienna takes you away into the landscape that Beethoven envisioned as he wrote this wonderful work. Great attention to detail that is highly satisfying. In the 8th, Bohm doesn't let up and conducts with such precision as to create a wonderful driving energy that can be felt underlying the piece. Excellent choice of tempi and full rich sound. The 7th is not my favorite of the recordings out there but it is still well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"No energy","review":"I've tried hard to like this set, being a huge fan of the Vienna Philharmonic, but Karl Bohm's direction is SO slow that it robs the music of all sense of forward movement. The 6th, in particular, is almost coma-inducing. On balance, I prefer Claudio Abbado's under-appreciated cycle with the same orchestra, although Abbado's 6th is a bit slow for my taste as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you love the pastoral?

I first heard her sing as the opening act on the D.C. leg of Maxwell's \\"Now\\" tour. She was phenomenal. It was a perfect appetizer to a wonderful show that followed. As for her album, Vivian Green is near perfect at offering an original sound and vibe. There is never, at any point on the album, a time when one will need to press the forward button. Simply said, she deserves all the accolades she is sure to receive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Stirring","review":"I really like this. I love the album as a collective effort.My favorites are What is love, Ain't nothing but love, Keep on going, Complete, Emotional rollercoaster and Fanatic.

It completely lives up to its title. It's her love story (and everyone's) about relationships - when everything is all sweet and perfect in the beginning, through the crying and breaking up, through trying to cope with being alone and convincing yourself that you made the right choice, to starting over and finally finding true love. I had a personal revelation about almost every song on the CD. I'm about to go listen to it now... and have another breakdown. Hee hee heeI originally saw Vivian Green perform as the opening act at Maxwell's concert at the Tower Theater in Philly. I was so blown away by her live performance that I was on her website the following day at work (don't tell my boss). I purchased her CD the day it was released. I couldn't be more pleased. Defenitely one of those CDs you can listen to it from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All I Have Been Listening To For Months","review":"Mind you, I have been pretty disgruntled with the current state of R&B/Soul music lately. Most R&B/Soul albums that are released today are cliched, generic and feature far too many guest appearances. I guess this is probably what I like most about this album: it is all Vivian Green. This album is perhaps one of the most consistent albums that I have heard in the past year. IMO, while all of the songs are potential victims of the repeat button, the standout tracks are Superwoman, What Is Love?, Emotional Rollercoaster, Affected, Fanatic,. Be Good To You and Complete(my personal favorite). Sure, some of what Vivian Green is doing on this album has been done before, but A Love Story sounds much better than 85 percent of whats being passed off as R&B/Soul music today. This is a very solid debut album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Story To Be Told & Heard","review":"Vivian definitly has a great voice and a very well put together CD. I listen to it with open ears every time I put in my playlist. With this CD tho i have to fall back on it because i think it's too much for me. Its a keeper for the ladies and a piece for the men, If thats appropriate to say.There was no doubt that i had to have the CD when i heard \\"Emotional Rollercoaster\\" because of the entire layout of the song. It's still in the top when it comes down to the passion behind the voice. I was impressed that she delivered the same passion in all of the songs. I personally just wasnt feelin all of them at the same time. It's a one-of-those-day's type of releases. I GOTTA SAY that \\"No Waiting By The Phone\\" is one of my favorite tracks on the cd as well as \\"What Is Love?\\". I could play those three tracks over and over and never get tired of them. But the Story is still nice to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more","review":"I bought this CD after hearing a couple of tunes on the radio. It took about 2 listens before I realized the background singing is better than the lead. I expected a lot more, but nearly all the tracks are full of her emotional/relationship garbage, and it isn't even good garbage. It's just \\"you do me wroooonngg\\". Didn't take a lot of creativity. The music is plain old radio keyboard boring..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real music lovers please stand up?","review":"What happened to all the real music lovers? I can't for the life of me understand why this CD is getting such rave reviews for such shallow material. Granted, she has a good voice, which, with the right material, has the potential to be a great voice. But this...just ain't cuttin' it. Emotional Rollercoaster is a fine, solid release but there really isn't much more before or after that. Maybe it's just me. I tried, I really tried to like it but, on her best day, this could never hold a candle to Jill Scott. If you want some real music check out Rahsaan Patterson or Tommy Sims. I guarantee you can't go wrong with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I got this album as a gift, and I thought that it would be good since I kept hearing \\"Emotional Rollercoaster\\" on the radio. I loved the song and figured the album would be good...NOT. There are maybe two other songs that MIGHT make it to the radio stations. Please don't waste your money on this album. If you like \\"Emotional Rollercoaster\\" get the single instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Voice but she should sing someone elses material","review":"I don't get it. The first song has to have the lamest lyrics I've ever heard in any pop song. \\"I wanna laugh until tears fall down my face and my abs are aching\\" or how about \\"I hope the children I sponsor down in Chile get the money I send and I wanna fly to Paris...with my husband\\"Achh!! Please hire a song writer. Almost all of the R&B divas of past sang professional songwriters compositions. Now we expect them to write their own and this is how we pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOOKING BACK: A \\"ROLLERCOASTER\\" of talent.","review":"Vivian Green's debut didn't grab me by the throat in the way that I wanted it to do, it still showcased the artist that she is. The songs are solid and, for some of them, her voice was a perfect match. There were others that, it seemed, the instruments slightly overshadowed her vocals. Her range isn't the most versatile of most singers and her strength in her voice isn't as prevelant. Still, when it came to her jazzy-flavored R&B tunes, such as WHAT IS LOVE & NO SITTING BY THE PHONE...masterful! These I could listen to all of the time! For me, this is where she has found her niche. Overall, this was a great beginning and, since I own all three of her cd's, will vouch for her to anybody wanting to add more to their musical lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE MORE IMPRESSIVE DEBUTS IN RECENT HISTORY","review":"I must first give thanks to Amazon for giving prospective buyers the chance to sample music before making a decision to buy.That having been said,Ms.Green has to be put in the class of Ledesi,Liv Warfield,Goaple,and other breakout female vocalists whose work might not have been heard if not for a vehicle such as Amazon.Really,Ms. Green has shown that she belongs in the class with All of the top female vocalists that are out there.AN OUTSTANDING CD!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an beautiful love story","review":"i love this singer but she only came out with two albums i dont love her any less for that but i wonder why she stop singng. great album i like her outfit on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in Love","review":"Jil Scott's former background singer has branched out on her own.

I definitely love \\"Fanatic\\", \\"Ain't Nothing But Love\\", and \\"No Sittin' By The Phone\\". \\"A Love Story\\" is a solid debut from a truly talented singer-songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Voice!!","review":"Vivian Green's voice is clear, beautiful and strong. The material is very real and romanticly poetic. For those who need a comparison, let's just say that it is very similiar to Chante Moore earlier days. She should be talked about more than some of the artist today. It's sad that this beautiful voice is not being heard right! Do yaw hear me!! She needs to be done right! So enough said, go and get her today, you won't be disappointed. To Vivian record label, please do better and promote her right! These artist put so much into there work! Peace to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid R&B with Jazzy Undertones","review":"Ms. Vivian has no reason to be \\"Green w/Envy\\" of any of today's Black female artist. Sista can hold her own! The tracks on this CD are smooth...created for your continuous listening pleasure.Vivian once said on TV that Sade is one of her all-time favorite artist. Well, hopefully like Sade, if Ms. Green can stay away from the radio copycats w/the same ole recycled productions, I'm sure she'll have the same longevity that a bright, mature artist deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"another just there Neo-Soul Album&Artist","review":"tired of Neo-Soul Artists because after a while you heard 10 you have heard 100&this set is no different.Vivian Green is talented but pretty much a dime a dozen vocalist&artist.\\"Emotional Rollercoaster\\" was catchy but not much after that holds my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good debut","review":"Vivian Green's love story is a CD very good debut. To think that this CD is only 8.99 is kind of crazy. This CD is great from a quality standpoint and Vivian's vocals are very good as well. Vivian is wearing her heart on her sleeve in this CD. I would have liked to have heard more music that is positive about love because on most of the songs she sounds as if love has never gone right for her. Next time Vivian, make more cheerful stuff!!

It's not as bad as the other reviewers say, you just have to lean against it. You can't just put it on and sit up in a chair - it works best when you're leaning back on it, more like a neck rest. It's not disruptive, either - in fact, I am using it right now! It's not loud enough to drown out the TV.

It's even funnier when you think back to the media blitz that Yahoo was in the middle of in 1989--some of what he undoubtedly experienced and felt is probably represented here.Yahoo's work is that of a highly observant satirist--check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter rubbish","review":"This film started out ok,but then rapidly decended into an utter mess.I am surprised this film didn't star Mel Gibson as the levels of Brit bashing in it are akin to one of Gibsons many efforts.If you want to buy this rubbish at least dumb down your sense of humour,and your hearing,yahoo serious apart from having a daft name,also has an equally daft voice.In my opinion if you consider purchasing this film you should be given brain surgery and at least 5 years in an insane asylum."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cult classic","review":"A cult classic!

They were fairly priced on sale. I suspect that the price drop was because they couldn't sell them at the original price. Price stickers were extremely hard to remove. Be prepared with at least heavy a duty cleaning pad and maybe some alcohol or other solvent to clean off the labels. After spending about a half an hour a cup, and going through two cleaning pads to remove the lables, I would have not have been happy paying the full price for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Macy's overstock?","review":"These are OK mugs for a couple dollars each.But I don't know what makes them \\"Rosenthal\\" as the bottom is marked \\"Hotel Collection by Charter Club, Classic White, Made in Germany, ....

Soaking, dishwashing, rubbing alcohol - no luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Cups and Not made in China","review":"Obviously, the previous reviewers don't know about Goo Gone. A drop or two, a little waiting time, and the price tags slide right off. An old librarian's trick for removing many \\"interesting\\" things from mylar book covers.

Because they are made in Germany, you can be sure they aren't leaching lead into your hot drinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much bang for the buck.","review":"This book is _not_ for those who are seeing Montreal for the first time. It does offer a few non-touristy ideas but many secrets aren't that unusual, the organization is lazy, and it's tiny at 160pp. The Ulysses Guide for Montreal (with its extensive walking tours) was way more useful to me as a tourist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abuelos Clasicos","review":"Me encantan los Abuelos de La Nada.

Fuera de eso, pura rumba con Los Abuelos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gor story re-arranged to fit Sword & Sorcery label","review":"The Gor stories were never literary classics, but they were never meant to be. Something else they were not meant to be were Sword and Sorcery as they are depicted in this film. If all you are looking for is the \\"dirty bits\\" then that's all you'll see. If all that is wanted by the director is skimpily clad women, THAT'S all you'll see. You do NOT have to be into S&M to be fascinated by the cut and thrust world of Gor, something the puritans out there cannot seem to understand. Unfortunately, it is something the filmmakers didn't understand either. One final comment. Whoever it was that armed women with swords in the film, and showed them beating down the swords of men twice their size in battle has made little effort to follow the Chronicles of Gor.... nor have they ever held a sword!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have been arrested!","review":"I should have been arrested for spending while stupid; bad costuming, bad sets, cheap film. Did they just drive out to Baja(or wherever) and film in the sand on the weekend? The book author John Norman must have really needed money to sell his story to this studio. Incidentally, they must have had a film budget of a dollar ninety-eight. The saving grace was some good acting (stressing some) and the beautiful women. Yes I've seen the second one too! See my review in \\"Outlaw of Gor\\". My wife tells me I write with an acid pen, well see the movie and find out. But RENT don't BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy rip-off of the book series","review":"The book series by John Norman made much use of sexual and erotic images of muscular dominating men and subserviant women - the kind of world most men long for. Unfortunately, the movie producers decided to forego all that and just use the name \\"Gor\\" and wrap it up in a very bad plot. It looks like the screenwriter tried to follow the basic plot of the books - the slavery and class roles of the characters are evident - but somewhere along the lines the producers mucked everything up with Christian \\"morals\\" (no nudity, little violence) and toned down Norman's statement about society. The result was a waste of a movie that once had potential.My advice: read the books and hope the producers of the next film get it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternate Title: Planet of Stupid Headgear","review":"That pretty well sums it up.

It is porn for those who think they are above that kind of thing. Please email me if you have a view on this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid!","review":"I can't begin to imagine why John Norman didn't sue the movie studios when this travesty of his creation was unleashed on an unsuspecting world.All I can say is that it is so bad it ranks right up there with Jackson's Lord of the Rings: Wanna-be directors stealing someone else's characters and insisting they can tell the story better than the author did."},{"rating":"2","title":"LukWerks works great.","review":"Have had this installed for a few days and could not be happier. Have not experienced any of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned. I use this to watch the baby's play area which is near the front door so I can also see who is coming and going. I spend most of my time at work in front of a computer and the remote view is great for checking on the baby throughout the day. Will be adding additional cameras in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukwerks Needs Work","review":"Nice concept. I offer the following observations -The motion detection algorithm results in too much unnecessary recording. Recording of sunrises, sunsets, moving leaves, clouds, and shadows from the trees is very annoying. Experimenting with the adjustment options doesn't resolve the issue.I have found on many occasions that the product doesn't record actual human or large object movement. This has occurred with the camera on the same power circuit as the network and computer (i.e. eliminating any connectivity issue).On occasion, the product stops recording even when no one uses the computer.You have to create and analyze the log data to discover recording errors/glitches.The product offers no effective archive feature.I suspect there is a glitch in the file allocation resulting in unwanted deletion of video.In summary, I wouldn't recommend this product until they resolve some of these serious issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"the power supply for the indoor cam has design problem (you lucky if you have 4 months use of it)","review":"I'll update this if their customer service will get back to me.

When it works it's excellent. I bought fourteen cameras for home and office. Of the fourteen I returned, I think, four within the first year. They replaced them. By the end of the second year only six of the eighteen are working. The outdoor cameras are worse than the indoor cameras. They will not honor a warranty after a year. They could have a great product but their hardware is extremely shoddy. I also bought a desktop camera. It doesn't work either, in that you cannot change set the time. Save your money. Buy a DVR system, it's cheaper in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working","review":"Generally unhappy with this system. It all started with the installation of the software. The 15 minute setup is not as advertised. In order to get the camera installed, I had to download a newer version of the software, which involved a call to their technical line. Once I got it working, it worked for about two days and then abruptly stopped recording motion. In addition, I was unable to access the camera online. I called technical support and we reviewed my setup. According to them, everything was setup properly. For some reason the camera would not arm to detect motion. The representative elevated it to a higher level and promised to have someone get back to me in 24 hours which never happened. I also sent two diagnostic files to them. Finally after about a week they responded and basically said everything appeared to be fine. I returned the unit and am now looking for some other system. I am disappointed because this system has some very nice features."},{"rating":"1","title":"hardware failure during power outage","review":"The software is adequate, it certainly works once you learn the interface. I had a system with one camera running for 1.5 years and added 2 more cameras about 10 months ago.I just had a power outage in my house, and unfortunately the original camera is now fried - both the wall power line converter and the camera itself are dead. The problem is that the wall plug cannot be plugged into a surge suppressor, so your stuck trusting the devices ability to handle line noise. Apparently, not so good at it.My low rating is mainly due to the price and robustness, when you spend this much on a camera you expect it to be well designed. Failing due a lightning strike I can understand, but this was no such event. In retrospect, my recommendation would be to buy a more professionally designed unit that is not susceptible to power line noise. With 3 cameras, I've already spent over $500; that would purchase a much higher end unit then this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easiest home video monitoring system ever!","review":"This is so easy to set up I am kicking myself for not trying it out earlier. I have looked at many wireless systems before but because I need to run power near the cameras, I have not been willing to do that. This system allows me to have the camera inside the house (no tampering) and anywhere I feel is convenient. The video is average - don't expect to do face recognition with it. Good enough to let you know that someone is approaching or left a package by the door.[..] I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to feel safe with a monitoring system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable Camera Longevity","review":"After 10 months of use, I am abandoning this system.

India is a land overflowing with places to stay and eat, and those mentioned in this book are full of aforementioned hordes of the 'uncool', and correpondingly overpriced.I also disrecommend it because info on local points of interest leave a littleto be desired, the tone of the authors is often a little smug, and by buying this book you are funding the ruination of hard found havens by the unwashed hippy masses.

This work is predominantly R&B, in comparison to her first release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft-Edged, Just a Bit Undercharacterized","review":"Boulez is generally noted for his crystal clear textures and although that is present here to some extent, there is a soft sonic ambience that, for instance, takes away from the mystery and terror of Mmt III and the humor of Mmt II -- the Giuoco delle coppie -- is rounded off somehow. Everything is in place but somehow it doesn't have the rough good spirits that the classic Reiner/CSO recording has. I did like the First, Fourth and Fifth movements just fine, though. Although this is a good recording, it will not replace the Reiner even though that one has aged sonically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Precise but bland","review":"This is a stunningly clear, perfect, precise reading of the concerto and Four Orchestral Pieces, wherein Boulez demonstrates he has stick technique that's perhaps the finest out there. The violin glissandi in the second movement of the Concerto are particularly exciting and vividly captured by DG. But while he sees not just the trees, but the leaves, the bark and the twigs, he misses the forest completely. These works lack the folksy-excitement of Bartok. It's Bartok under glass. It's a conductor who knows everything there is to know about music--except how to have fun with it. These are pieces of almost unbearable contrast--from mysterious to joyful to blistering to serene. They're not just a test of technique for the conductor but a test of conceptionization as well. Boulez's own earlier take on the music was much better, but for a real treat, hear Dorati and the LSO on Mercury Living Presence, and compare him to Boulez. Pierre, lighten up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing product","review":"I chose this product mostly for the claimed heat feature. But where is the heat? Hot water gets cold very quickly in the foorbath. The bubbling is also very mild. There is no control for either heat or bubbling.This thing also is not as quiet as claimed.

I am going to return this thing if I still can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Doesn't Work DON'T BUY IT!","review":"I bought my Homedic Foot Spa at Sears, the first of which I returned and the second of which I took to get my money back.

First, it says the unit does not heat the water so you have to put warm water in, but that it will maintain the heat. Well, it didn't. I put very warm water in and by the time I was done, just 10-15 minutes later, the water was luke warm. Second, I filled the water, as directed, to the fill line and still once the unit was on and my feet went in, the water was splashing all over the place. There were no bubbles near the toes. It did not seem as soothing as I thought it would be. I am considering sending it back and getting a refund or something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!","review":"Along with the last person I was really disappointed in this. I use it now with epsolm salt and just don't plug it in. Otherwise it's LOUD and doesn't justify the weak bubbles it puts out or the annoying vibration.

They just kick in when they feel like it apparently. The water gets very cold fast, I'd be better off just filling an empty kitty litter pan with hot water and sticking my feel in that.

I then boiled water on the stove and filled the unit with that only to find out that it actually cools off very rapidly in the unit, presumably because of the cold air bubbles being pumped through it.The only positive review on this product was actually written by the company themselves. That's a shameless way to conduct business, and a disgraceful way to mislead the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"What can I say about this garbage that hasn't already been said. The thing shocks you every time you put you foot in it. I thought maybe it wasn't grounded, so I put it on a rubber mat and it still shocked me.

You will get as much pleasure from hot water in a big Rubbermaid bucket as this Homedics device. I just received this as a Christmas present and it is going back.

I don't understand why, 20 years later, the foot baths on the market are weak, messy, and can't heat the water let alone keep it warm.Cons: No power, no heat, and virtually no relaxation.Pros: Based on reviews I have read on other machines, it is light, easy to carry with a fold-down handle, and comes with a nifty foot pedicure device that can be attached to the base unit or hand-held. Unfortunately, I will not test it because IT IS GOING BACK!!!
