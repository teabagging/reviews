Neither Sandisk nor Dell has been able to get my computer running again except in Safe Mode. I have returned the product to Amazon and have purchased a new computer.

They each have their own installation program and it couldn't be simpler. Plus, if you use the default drivers the drive icons are just generic.

They ran me through a few drills, and then gave me a case number and told me to return it to get a new one. I'm returning it. I'm not getting a new one. And given that I recently had a SanDisk Cruzer 1MB flash drive crap out on me, and Tech Support told me the same thing (return it--get a new one), while referring to me to a third party service that MIGHT be able to help recover my data...I don't know....call me loco, but I'm pretty much done with SanDisk.

The first clue that something was terribly wrong was when the book's dedicatory page included names like Fawn Brodie, who is known for her acrimony towards The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. So it went with the historical documents of the time, presenting letters and court documents from fundamentally negative perspectives, mainly from those who sought the destruction of early church leaders.

It was unnatural and stilted in my opinion. For example, I don't know any man, let alone a football player, who says \\"Lordy\\" or \\"lovely\\" all the time. The author wrote as though she was expecting her English teacher to grade her. Rachel was a sexy vixen one minute (and even then her dialogue was flowery) and a very proper speaking society matron the next.

I won't regret it now by not buying it because DVDs should never have that problem. We've had DVDs for like what? Almost 20 years? But to have them be not very functional is just ridiculous. Seriously, if they are going to continue producing these, at least maybe go back to VHS since someone's already mentioned that those still somehow have higher quality.

Lo and behold, the 2nd boxed set had the same problem as the first set (another duplicate of the 1st disc).

I could have done better myself by copying video tapes and burning them to DVD. The video is very grainy like they made no attempt at all to remaster it. At times the audio does not match the video. Also, there is only a rudimentary menu system. You cannot jump to a particular scene like you can with almost all other DVDs on the market. In addition, the set I received had two of the three disks bad.The price of $59.99 is extremely high for what you get.

I popped it in & thought, \\"so much for digitally remastered\\" (more like lack of). The picture was just grainy & awful. Then to top it off, disc #2 skipped, or just outright stopped at parts. By the last few precious moments it just died on me. At first I was willing to accept a replacement, but then changed my mind & have asked for a refund instead. If the discs were damaged but had at least offered decent quality otherwise, then an exchange would be fine. But I'm not willing to shell out this much money for substandard goods.

Maybe it is a great story if you have the experience of depression and suicidal tendancies. Maybe it expresses those experience and feelings exactly. I don't have that experience, and really, reading this book did nothing to help me understand those feelings, nor did it connect me emotionally to the experiences of people who suffer from these types of disorders.Runyon lived that which he was writing about.

It is, at the same time, wickedly funny and poignantly insightful. It's about families and friends (and random celebrities), about the heady effects of testosterone and the hard edges of being cool. It is also about unspeakable pain and uncompromising love. Beautiful, simple language. Dialogue that will ring true to the ears of teens and parents. Insights only a 14 year old could have combined with perspective only an adult could give. Impossible not to laugh and cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding me.","review":"I couldn't wait until this book was over.

If you want to read or want your kids to read an account about a guy who tried to kill himself, scared himself for life, continued to judge other people and feel sorry for himself, this is the book for you. Oh yes did I mention every 10 pages he talks about getting into a girls pants or blouse or trying out his \\"junk\\" to make sure it works. I wanted a book about a kid who survives a major ordeal and grows to appreciate life a little more. What was more important to the author was talking about his developing sexuality. Boring.

The thing was, he had only used the first section, which was so short, and the rest of the book was BORING!The writing doesn't get much credit at all. It's choppy, which was done on purpose, but I don't think that Brent reached what he had hoped to with this. Instead, he upped the page length and made his book much more choppy and annoying to read. At one point, there were single sentences on each page. It's because his thoughts were so choppy at that point, but it makes reading it very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"The potential for an amazing story, but...","review":"I hope -- and suspect -- that even as a (target market) young adult I would have been as unsatisfied with this book as I was after reading it as an adult. It's laughable and ludicrous to compare this book to the likes of Susanna Kaysen's Girl, Interrupted or Augusten Burroughs's Running with Scissors simply because they share some basic similarities. The story itself, the event, has the potential to really knock a reader's socks off, but is told in such an artless and stumbling manner it makes it difficult to want to continue reading, and especially difficult to connect at all with the humans behind it. I didn't find it \\"refreshingly normal\\" and certainly not \\"scary\\", as some other reviewers have credited; I found it boring, course and overall disappointing. I've read better straight out of my junior high students' journals."},{"rating":"2","title":"harrowing and real","review":"I read a lot of YA novels for my job, and most of them are terrible.

It is simple but extraordinarily powerful. The book deals with a young boy's reaction as his father is wounded in the war, though I think it would be appropriate for any child who's parent has suffered an illness or injury. It concludes with the understanding that in the face of debilitating circumstances, we are fortunate simply to have each other.Both the writing and the artwork are extraordinary--I would recommend it for any child."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty much expensive chapstick...","review":"Seems like a nice, moisturizing balm. It's a little \\"claustrophobic\\" feeling on your lips: thick and petroleum-like, not something I would call \\"sheer\\".

I'm sure it will be a decent, protective balm for the winter, especially to put on at night or outdoors in the wind. But I could've gotten the same results from original chapstick.Also, the vendor charges 4.99 on Amazon, but left their 2.99 store price slapped on the bottom of the jar.

We recieved it at noon on a Saturday, by 1pm that same Saturday it was totally dead. We thought we may have blown a fuse so we tried other electronics in the socket and they worked fine. To start with the princess songs (3) that play were a bit scratchy. I will admit the projection worked fine when the clock did work. It was hard to find any stations on the radio even with the antenna extended to the sky (wire). My daughter had only used the clock maybe 30 minutes when she reported that it no longer worked. I don't mean the radio stopped working or the lights stopped glowing... this is totally dead, no lights, no clock, no radio, no songs. Dead Dead. I am very dissapointed with this clock.

She asks us to fix it all of the time, but there is no way we have found to change out the bulb and I am not sure that would actually even solve our flickering.

There is not an auto off for the projection light and ours died out after 4 months. I could not find a way to get to the light bulb to change it, so my husband worked on it. He had to take out all the electronics in order to reach the light, which is fiber optic encased in a housing unit that does not come apart, so the light is unchangeable. I am very disappointed as the music and lights were the main selling point of this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute little alarm clock","review":"Just bought this at Target and it is a really cute little alarm clock. The stars on the ceiling are really cute- I just wish it had an auto off button for the stars because I can see the bulb burning out pretty quick if it is left on all night. You can wake up by radio, buzzer or a princess song and voice. I have no problem getting the AM/FM to work. It is a little annoying that it is a turn dial for the radio stations and not digital. I can't tell what station I have it on. My daughter is only 6 so she doesn't need to wake up to the radio anyway. I think it is really cute. It is smaller than it looks in the picture which is a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"We purchased this alarm clock for my 6 year old daughter less than a year ago. She loved the princess castle shape and the projected star feature. Within a couple months, the FM radio no longer works.

The guest appearances by the robot and Dr. Smith are over the top and too camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This DVD edition of \\"The Fantasy Worls od Irwin Allen\\" blew me away! I bought a VHS copy of the program after seeing it on the Sci-Fi Channel back in '95. It was a great, campy tribute to a great, campy producer. June Lockhart and Billy Mumy were fine choices as hosts. The Robot from \\"Lost in Space\\" (Irwin's best known TV series) was fun, too. (I don't want to ruin the surprise ending.) The clips, editing, interviews are great - especially the segments on Irwin's disaster films, \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" and \\"The Towering Inferno.\\" All in all, this is a great program if you like TV Sci-Fi (and love \\"Lost in Space\\"). The real news here is THE BONUS MATERIALS! Foxstar Productions and Image entertainment really went all out. There are featurettes galore from \\"The Towering Inferno\\", \\"Man From the 25th Century\\", \\"City Beneath the Sea\\" and \\"Land of the Giants\\" (another all-time favorite). Again... WOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"Pointer Sisters great music,the early years ,full of energy,later music had more skill sure but nothing matches the excitement of this cd,truely timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes We Can Can: The Best of the Blue Thumb Recordings of the Pointer Sisters","review":"I have been looking for several of the selections which are featured on this CD.

Many of the songs on this album are from their first \\"Can Can\\" album, and what a joy it is to hear them again.

My kids 4 and 10 fell in love with it. Then we checked it out from the library and they didn't want to return it. So I knew I had to buy it. It was a really good price on Amazon and so I bought it for my 4 yr. old for Easter. She is loving it. It's a wonderful chidren's CD. Very cute songs that are all new. Our favorite's include Tickle Time, O Lonely Peas, and The Dinosaur song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hire a band. Synths are cheap and sound that way.","review":"My kids love the songs, the lyrics are cute, the vocalist is fine. The music is computerized shlock. If you like the sound of Barney, then you will love the backing music. The lyrics and singer deserve better. This is a basic issue I have with most of Boyton's CDs. More recent productions have included better lead artists, but the synthetic music still lurks in the background. On Rino tap, the \\"horns\\" sound like a early 90's synth patch. It is fine for the kiddos, but my god, after the 20th listen kill me. Hire session players, and you have a 5 star kids album. I expect more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great kick-start to Apache, PHP and MySQL","review":"This is a great book to start out with. It tells you what you need to know to start using PHP very quickly. Within 2 hours I was writing my own PHP scripts. I would not recommend it for experienced users.I had never written any PHP, C or Java before this - I had been brought up on Pascal, some VB and lost of System/370 assembler and Rexx. I had a clear understanding of web sites and html and I would now say that I am now a fairly competent PHP programmer.The book explains very clearly how to set up Apache, MySQL and PHP on your Windows or Linux system and takes you through some examples. It also points you at further sources on the web then once you are going, the book becomes fairly redundant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Codes Which Do Not Work!","review":"The first one-third of this book contains information which a beginner like me may quickly but too hastily find very grateful. But the feeling of being grateful will soon give way to a feeling of disappointment and anger as inaccurate code begin to show up one after another, which will make you waste countless hours. If you buy this book and have to go through the same horrible time of frustration as I have, you will agree that the authors have not tested the codes, which may sound quite incredible to you. I do not understand how this book has gotten that many positive feedbacks. I sent e-mails to the publishers to inquire about the codes in the book which did not function. But I haven't heard yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Code Errors!!!","review":"The first one-third of the book is pretty good. But beginning Chapter 12, you will begin to find too many codes which simply do not work. I guess the authors did not bother to test the codes even once.

I regret buying this book a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Book!","review":"This book has too many codes that do not function.

The mysqld-opt command to use to start the mysql server is not what www.mysql.com recommends for a windows machine. The book looks like it's easy to read. But I couldnt get out of the starting block with the mysql effort in the first chapter. It was easier to buy a mysql book and do it the correct way. Some URL's are needed in the install area that take one to some type of Mysql installation help. There are some at the back of the book, but I only saw those as I was dropping the book in the trash.It's probably not the books fault, but mysql installations on a windows machine... well you have to be lucky.

More than anything, it is something felt. Something experienced. Winter's success with this anthology cannot be denied. That it is still in print after all this time is a true testament to that. The quality of work between the binds of this book is absolutely some of the best stuff in horror, all presented to you by the current masterminds. A rare superb collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fine collection of second rate stories","review":"I give this book one star just because of the writers it includes, and I give it a second star only for the stories by David Morrell and Peter Straub. Otherwise, this is without a doubt the worst collection of horror stories I have ever read. There is no consistant theme, not that there should be one, but a theme would have given Prime Evil at least something to separate it from all the other collections. The authors included, though famous and well respected, have seemingly selected from the bottom of the barrel. The Stephen King story, Night Flyers, is probably one of his worst and of the headliners, only Straub's The Juniper Tree had any value, and it is only a horror story by association, having no real place in a genre collection. As a whole, the book works better as a marketing campaign. Stories by Jack Cady, Thomas Tessier, and Charles Grant are amusing; otherwise - don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"the flag sent was not the one in the picture","review":"Just a heads up.

Her Amway style, evangelical christian morals come through in her presentation. If you are not able to automatically forgice the past and forget the past, save your money. The whole premise of the course is based on these two principles. The sad fact for most people looking to gain from these books, is that if they could actually do those two things in the first place they would not need the books at all.The work books are condescending and pointless. Perhaps consider \\"The Positive Power of Negative Thinking by Julie Norem\\" as a viable alternative to the unrealistic sunshine and light approach of Hay, who really needs a good dose of reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wrong book to look at","review":"Buy How To Find Yourself and Your Best Match Socionics by Rod Novichkov.This book, you wasted your money on, tells you that all your physical flaws are do to a disorder you may have in the way you think.

I have shared many of these same affirmations with my 10 and 12 year old children, and they are noticing positive changes beginning to occur in their lives too. Like anything else, you can't just read the affirmations or do the exercizes once. They must be practiced on a continual basis, but if you do the changes in your life will be dramatic. Louise Hay's writing style is also very \\"readable\\", easy to understand, and practical. A great self-help resource book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This!","review":"I am a self-help junkie, I admit it, but this books makes sense. It all comes down to how we feel about ourselves.

Having positive energy surrounding you is something good.However, I whole heartedly disagree with parts of this book. A lot of it comes across as victim blaming.Oh, you got cancer? It's because you're a negative person.You were born into an abusive family? It's your own fault because you CHOSE your parents.You're starving in Africa, or had your whole family murdered due to war? Oh that's because you needed that life experience.It disgusts me that she blames the person for their ailments in such a condescending, ignorant manner.Yes, it's good to be a positive person, because it leads to less stress, which helps health.But that should be obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Louise Hay book and DVD","review":"Louise Hay is just great.

Hay mentions in the book really are all it takes to heal your life. The shape of your life really is mind over matter. Sure we are all thrusted into circumstances beyond our control at some point in life, but if you keep telling yourself you won't have or can't do, nothing good will happen for you. In the companion book that goes with this, she kind of tricks you into answering your own questions about what is holding you back from healing and happiness. You don't even realize it when you are answering the questions.The thoughts expressed in this book are so simple that you will ask yourself \\"why didn't I change my thinking sooner?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully wise and truly health centered book!","review":"Louise L.

A massage therapist recommended this book to me because I have MS and I read the entire thing with an open mind, though I became concerned fairly early on. I am surprised there aren't more reviewers who find Ms. Hay's edicts as to how this or that thought pattern cause SERIOUs physiological problems and diseases--with no scientific back-up, training, and very little anecdotal evidence--really irresponsible. To suggest that you can cure yourself of life-threatening conditions by repeating her suggested affirmations is reckless.

My mom has had a chronic cough for YEARS and she did the affirmation for coughing and has not coughed in 5 days after only doing her affirmation for 3 days- utterly amazing!

I was encouraged by my boy-friend's friend, who lent me a book by Louise Hay 'You Can Heal Your Life'. I started reading. It didn't seem to work. I started doing the mental work described in the book. It didn't seem to work. I said to myself: I hit the bottom. I am constantly thinking of committing a suicide. I cannot fall any deeper. I will continue the affirmations and visualizations. It must start working some day. I was stubborn as hell and so I persisted. Twice a day for about 20 minutes. The first results began to show after a year. And so I went on with the mental work. After 5 years of working on my ways of thinking daily I can say I changed substantially. I also realized that this kind of work is just like taking a shower. You should do it every day, it is a sort of mental hygiene.Balancing the Beast: A Bright View of Schizoaffective Disorder - Bipolar or Manic-Depressive Type"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelously Simple","review":"The message is simple, which is why it's so powerful -- You don't become what you want, you become what you believe.

Radical tidbits -- it's just a thought and you have the power to change it; we're responsible for and create our own happiness (or lack thereof).

The author is a not a doctor or a scientist; not even close. She makes ludicrous statements like if people are deaf, the \\"reason\\" is because they \\"heard something they didn't like,\\" and similar silliness, and for every condition imaginable. It's like reading the rantings and ravings of a pathetically ignorant child. And it's dangerous in the extreme: a friend who bought into this atrocity of a book just passed away because she believed in all these childish \\"mind over matter\\" ideas and wouldn't go to the doctor when she had a condition; and she paid for her belief in this nonsense with her life.I wonder how the author can subject the public to this kind of fraud and live with herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think think the information is redundant and the book is overrated.","review":"I think that the technics to heal yourself are a little redundant.Over all I felt the book was a little disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Paper","review":"So here is Louise's version of good and evil.

If you have food poisining, you attracted it. The message here is that you attract EVERYTHING in your life. Good, bad, or in the middle. Think Ms. Hay is just a little bit of a control freak??

This is much like the wording that is used during rapid eye and let me tell you it has never worked for me.

Thanks. Y'know, I thought it was the result of swapping some tainted saliva, but apparently Louise knows more than I.This is not to say there are not things once can do to improve one's psychological well being when ill, or that it isn't good to lead a healthy lifestyle.

However I do think psychology can affect you physically. If that point was made more reasonably and without this sense of absolutism, the book would be far more valuable. Stress does make you tired and more susceptible to illness. Yes, unhappiness adds tension and pain to your back. But a virus is a virus, not some cosmic force punishing you for not being comfortable with yourself.Sadly, I would guess that a lot of doctors are quick to prescribe drugs rather than more homeopathic/psychological/placebo options because they are worried about this slippery slope into, \\"take your kids glasses away and tell them to cheer up!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I was really hoping this book would be helpful. I started to lose interest when it said that everything that happens, bad or good, is your choice. That's not true.

How am I supposed to take the rest of the book seriously after that? That doesn't even make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures but not much help","review":"The pictures in this book are lovely, pretty enough to cut out and hang in little frames on the wall. The words of the book, on the other hand -- convey the very simple message of positive reinforcement.Look in the mirror and say \\"I'm a kind decent person\\". That's the entire msg of the book, along with alot of paragraphs about how many people the author has helped, and different patients the author helped, etc etc. But she helps them all by having them look in the mirror and say \\"I like myself\\". This is very 1970's golly-gee stuff. I would recommend the books by Manuel J. Smith instead of this series of books.... but the pictures again -- are luverly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bothered by the implications","review":"I am a firm believer in the importance of positive thinking and the power of the spoken word. However, I was bothered by the implication that the Author believes illnesses such as cancer are caused by the thoughts or words of the individual.I enjoyed reading her book until I got to the section that discussed the causes of illnesses.Don't get me wrong, I believe that our mental attitude, thoughts, and self-talk can \\"negatively impact\\" our health; but I don't agree that we ourselves cause illnesses such as cancer.I really like Louise Hay as writer, but this one goes too far.Dianne Rosena JonesAuthor of \\"Tragic Treasures: Discovering Spoils of War in the Midst of Tragedy\\"and African American Literature Editor for BellaOnline"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"I have given this book as gifts to 2 friends battling cancer.

Since I teach Freshman and eighth grade English, I like to show movies that back up the literature we're reading. Imagine my disappointment when I showed this video. Not only were the images blurry, but the sound was garbled! My students could barely understand the dialogue. I tried the DVD in another player with the same results.

I was extremely happy to see the delivery man carrying both packages. Some people also mentioned that once they opened the boxes, pieces of the table were damaged/broken.

The Gunfighter is perhaps one of Gregory Peck's best films, before he became maudlin and uninteresting, before To Kill A Mockingbird. But compare this Gunfighter film with The Bravados, e.g.)The Garden of Evil has sweep and color and a use of CinemaScope never seen in westerns, until The Tall Men. The Bernard Hermann score is riveting, and Susan Hayward..tremendous, as are Richard Widmark and Gary Cooper.Widmark is always great, and underrated. He was the glory of westerns.Rawhide has Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward trapped by killers at a stagecoach station. The insanity of both Hugh Marlowe (underrated) and Jack Elam makes it look as though the whole world is in chaos, light years away from unity or peace. Tyrone Power, always stupendous, and Susan Hayward, adjetives cannot describe, respond to this wave of evil with fear and trembling, and finally...Get this set and play it for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Western Classics","review":"I purchased the set of three films in order to acquire \\"The Gunfighter\\" as I could not buy it as a single. \\"The Gunfighter\\" is worth the price of the set but \\"Garden of Eden\\" is stupid and not worth the effort to even start it.

Diane Mott Davidson's stories are tightly written, well thought out, and believable to every day life! Her humor is an important link to her character, but also to the reader of her stories. She starts the book with enthusiasm, meaning that the story \\"just never drags.\\" I really appreciate that in a mystery writer, in that you don't wait until page 206 for the murder to take place!

You don't ask the kid what happened? Don't call the principle for more information. Dont' march right down to the school and demand to know who's beating up your kid? Well, this author lost me right there. You don't let your kid go around getting beat-up without doing something about it. Plus the fact that other basic things don't match up as well - like the fact that the main character, Goldy, is flat-out broke and running her catering business on a very thin string, but has enough money to have a gym membership to which she can add her niece - well, it just doesn't work for me.

I found the characters to be flat, not well developed and not very interesting. And this was a shame because I think some of the characters could have been interesting and I could have cared for them. At the end I was just glad to be done with the book.

As a matter of fact the addition of some recipes (in the paper books at least) was a nice touch.We are introduced to Goldy by way of her catering a funeral which culminates in the poisoning of her ex father-in-law. You soon find out just why Goldy left her doctor husband even with a young son to support. During this investigation which Goldy feels the need to take into her own hands, she meets Tom Schultz a detective and soon tepid sparks are flying. There are a lot of people in this cast but all of Ms Davidson's books are like that.While I found that the first half to one third of this series to be light and entertaining reads, eventually the series turns stagnant, unbelievable and just plain annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy character, too much backstory","review":"One common problem in first-books-in-a-series is too much backstory, and this one sadly provides a grim example. Davidson churns out information on character after character that the reader has no reason to care about yet, delaying the start of the actual story. Then it didn't take me long to realize Goldy is a wuss, a doormat just waiting to be trampled on. Although her ex-husband physically and emotionally abused her, she still expends effort to accommodate his whims, to the extent of preparing a non-strawberry accent for an event she is catering that she expects him to attend! Sheesh! Since I couldn't care for the character, I didn't care about the story, and quit about a quarter of the way through. The title related to the plot in only the most obvious way, that Goldy runs a catering business. The only praise I can give the book is that it uses good spelling and grammar."},{"rating":"2","title":"A scrumptious first course!","review":"I've always noticed these yummy-looking mysteries on the shelf at my local bookstore, and I finally decided to try one. I must say, I'm quite satisfied! I enjoyed meeting the characters - Goldy, Arch, Marla, Pomeroy, and others - I think Diane Mott Davidson did a fine job in creating them and \\"fleshing them out,\\" so to speak. She makes you love the ones you're supposed to love, and hate the ones you're supposed to hate (for example, The Jerk).The story itself was quite enjoyable. I prefer mysteries where you really don't know who did it up until the last minute, but with this book, it's pretty easy to figure it out sooner than that. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to continuing this tasty series of culinary mysteries. Oh, and I think the recipes look delicious! I will certainly be trying a few of those (especially the Holy Moly Guacamole! Yum!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catering to Nobody","review":"Good, easy reading with a plot. It's a book that can be read in an evening or two and holds your interest. A fun, easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Count me in as a new fan!","review":"It isn't very often that a writer brings freshness and believability to a mystery. After all, \\"there's nothing new under the sun.\\" Diane Mott Davidson is, however, a new voice (to me) with a lot of pluses in her column.Davidson's characters are real enough to live in my home town and Goldy's situation is familiar...how to pay the bills, raise a child alone, have a life and deal with a vengeful ex. And, to have a suicide and attempted murder thrown in for good measure just adds spice to the mix!I have the rest of Davidson's works and look forward to reading them...if only I can finish without gaining 10 pounds!Go, Goldy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left a Bad Taste in My Mouth","review":"To be honest upfront, I didn't get past the first few chapters of this mystery. I didn't care for Davidson's prose, nor did I find the characters compelling. Actually, I found the protagonist Goldy (could the name be any more precious??) a bit off-putting and not in any way believable. Goldy's a caterer whose ex-husband used to beat her -- and she goes out of her way to make sure she doesn't serve him tomatoes at a function she's catering, because he's allergic to them. Is it just me, or does that make her a complete doormat? Who wants to read about someone like that? Or her alcoholic mother-in-law? I don't know about you, but I've got to like the people I read about. For all I know, the ending of \\"Catering to Nobody\\" is brilliant, but I just couldn't see slogging through it to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foodies","review":"This is the first of the series about Goldie and her catering and involvement in murders. This is a great book and enjoy printed recipies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get past the 3rd chapter.","review":"Not a fan at all. I didn't get past the 3rd chapter. I found the main character to be truly unlikeable from the start and couldn't get past it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun introduction to culinary whodunit.","review":"This was a a light, entertaining book and and fun murder mystery. The first book in the series, we are introduced to Goldy Bear (Whose real name is Gertrude Bear Korman). Goldy has started her own catering business, to support herself and her son, after divorcing her abusive ex husband. While catering a funeral, Goldy's ex father in law is poisoned, and Goldy's business is shut down. In order to clear her name and get her life back, Goldy decides to investigate the crime.Chock full of interesting characters, a possible love interest and as an added bonus, some terrific sounding recipes. I can't wait to move on to the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of Print!!!???","review":"I can't believe this book is out of print in paperback and out of stock in hardcover. What a shame! \\"Catering to Nobody\\" is the first lovable book in the culinary mystery series. Among the twists and turns of an engrossing mystery you will find about 3 recipes (other books have more). In this book, Goldy's business is officially shut down due to poison-laced coffee that nearly kills her ex-father-in-law. Many believe she is guilty ... so Goldy must find the real culprit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Prose - Passable Plot","review":"This was the most unpleasant selection my monthly book club has nominated. The author seems like she is trying to follow a \\"Writer's Digest\\" formula as she unfolds her plot and the effect is just too predictable. The timeline is not paced well either. Sometimes we'll spend a whole chapter on a conversation and then we'll jump ahead three days in the space of a paragraph. The dialogue is cliched and the characters come off as shallow stereotypes. The writing reaches a definite low point as the author describes a \\"Amour Anonymous\\" meeting with five characters in attendance and skips from comment to comment so quickly it is hard to imagine how the conversation reaches such emotional highs and lows within the space of a few moments. The plot wraps up neatly and the recipes are an interesting addition (worth trying I hope!) - but these two positive attributes are not enough to save the overall writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIght and at times silly","review":"Its been a while since I read this first in a series book but it was good to refresh my memory on the background of the main characters in this series. I didn't remember that her characters were a bit over the top; they have since settled down and all the books in the read are light, easy reading, especially good after reading something heavy, serious or historical. I enjoy books that can do that without getting sappy or feeling too self important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish","review":"I wanted to like this series. I really, really did. I love other similar books about heroines who work with food. But after reading a few chapters, I was not only depressed but thoroughly bored. The characters are superficial and the plot plods along at such a slow pace I couldn't take it anymore. It seems my view is in the minority, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldy Bear is a fun character and a good read.","review":"I am a fan of the Goldy Bear caterer series by Diane Mott Davidson. This is my second time through to read Catering to Nobody, and is fun to get re-acquainted with the characters from the beginning. If you like a good mystery book to curl up with, I recommend this one. The book moves along well, does a good job of introducing the characters, and is not big on graphic gore and violence. Light-hearted and a series you will want to continue to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldy is Great","review":"I wondered how this series with Goldy Bear would hold up. I had originally thought that Goldy was a Jewish caterer. My mistake! Goldy's real name is Gertrude and Goldilocks is the name she uses for her catering company. I truly enjoyed this mystery. I found it interesting how Goldy had to rely on other cleaning jobs when her catering business is temporarily shut down by accusations of poisoning. I know there's no way in hell I could ever clean up after other people. I have a hard enough time doing it for myself!I'd like to read more in this series. I'd like to hear more about her budding relationship with the cop, Tom. I like him. He's sarcastic and speaks his mind. Wonderful attributes in a man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive and ill-informed","review":"While the story itself was interesting and the recipes were really cute, the character of Marla was poorly written and quite offensive. A size 16 and she is described as having \\"swirling tires of flesh\\" and can't be trusted around food. The way she is described as eating in the book she'd be a size 42 and weigh over 350 pounds! I don't think the author has ever met someone who was a size 16, and if you don't weigh 115 pounds and fit into a size 4, this character will ruin the book for you! The other annoying cliche was the pregnant girl is described as craving pickles and ice cream. Ooooo, I'd never guess that one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rose Polenzani is a genius!","review":"Dragersville is an amazing album. One part hauntingly gut-wrenching and one part sweetly sorrowful, Dragersville is completely capitvating. You can tell that Rose not only plays and sings, but feels her music, down the very depths of her being. The first track, \\"You Don't Know\\", is probably the best song on the album, although others that are better known, such as \\"Olga's Birthday\\" and \\"Or\\" are in close competition. All in all, this album is well worth your money. This woman has a lot of talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure, brutal death metal !!","review":"This release from Seance still ranks up there as one of my favourites even after all these years !! Death metal purists who love early death metal from the era of Entombed's \\"Left Hand Path\\", \\"Dark Recollections\\" by Carnage and that kind of thing need to add this to their collection. Heavy, chugging riffs and solid growling vocals combine to make this a \\"must have\\" for an old-school death metal collection. Stand-out tracks are \\"Necronomicon\\" and \\"Wind of Gehenna\\" (instrumental) but production quality on the whole release is really very good. I'm starting to hear a lot of bands coming out now with their sound being influenced by Seance and in my opinion these guys were one of the death metal pioneers."},{"rating":"2","title":"good ol' 90th DM","review":"If you liked their style in the \\"Postmortem\\", a song in the tribute to Slayer album, this album is worthy of trying. Not complicated and speed maniac DM, just a classic yet talented piece of works. I like their bass guitar sound, seems to be amplified by some distortions but gives very clear and heavy impacts on their total sound configuration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues Harp Master","review":"Probably one of blues' biggest inspirations, this artist represents the pinnacle of skill in blues harp. There is possibly no other single contributor (Robert Johnson excluded?) to the blues influence than Sonny Boy Williamson...and he really brings it. I suggest that you give it a listen and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classics","review":"My father loves the blues as much , maybe more so than i do and this cat here , Sonny Boy Williamson is one of the best blues artists ever and this compilation is a small treasure for sure ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rice Miller Compilation","review":"This is a wonderful collection of blues harmonica music. The Sonny Boy Williamson who was also known as Rice Miller was a masterful player, and a talented songwriter. His voice aged with him to produce that fine bluesy-gravelly sound that endears a blues performer to his audience.Some of his classic songs like Don't Start Me To Talking, Your Funeral and My Trial, Fattening Frogs For Snakes, and Nine Below Zero are on this retrospective. This is a blues music collectors must have if you love harmonica music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely Sonny Boy's Best","review":"The item arrived quickly and in good shape. I've been listening to Sonny Boy for over 30 years and this is the best collection I have heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential blues","review":"Sonny Boy II is not my favorite. I like more honk from the harp and less undercurrent of menace from the vocals, and I like Little Walter's and Paul Butterfield's ways of extending the blues melodically without losing the Chicago of it. But Sonny Boy grows on me, and this album has a lot of great stuff for a guy like me to hear who's trying to pick up journeyman skills on the harp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mislabeled","review":"Weirdly, these fonts are all Gothic (actually blackletter), whereas the Gothic book in this series contains some Celtic (uncial) fonts. I think that the books were probably produced at the same time and mislabeled. Nevertheless, both are well worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of shape, and better for it.","review":"For those who profess to have eclectic tastes, this album could prove frustrating, challenging and ultimately liberating. On first listen it's a jumbled mish-mash of disparate styles and ideas, but repeated exposure reveals Mr Tenor's knack for funking up decades' worth of Easy Listening World Muzak. Imagine if Prince were locked up with nothing but a collection of Martin Denny albums for a few months! Jimi Tenor's musical focus is perverse, persuasive and curiously passionate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for reading nightly","review":"I found this book at my childs school library and found it to be a wonderful complement to our nightly Hanukkah celebration. Every night I've read a new story and we've talked about what each story means. I think its a great book, full of meaningful stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"What a compleat waste of money!

It depicts the journey of \\"Dinnie-the-Dot\\" as she travels to Switzerland to attend an international boarding school where her uncle is the headmaster. There, she is exposed to a variety of cultures and people and thus her life is inevitably changed forever. I found this novel extremely interesting, I've always wanted to go to boarding school! You just can't put this book down; a wonderful MUST READ.An element that I especially love in Sharon Creech's books is that all her characters from each book are intertwined with each other. There are references such as in Bloomability, her aunt mentions a girl ( Zinny from \\"Chasing Redbird\\") who is clearing a trail in a postcard. \\"Walk Two Moons\\" and \\"Absolutely Normal Chaos\\" also have characters which interchange and appear in both novels.I strongly reccomend everyone, (children, adults, pre-teens, young adults,etc) to read this novel, and other books that Sharon Creech has written. You'll never be the same again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Will make you Think","review":"I like this book a lot, for quite a few reasons. The characters are clear and real.

And even though the plot might not be overly exciting, it's ...human. i guess the main reason I enjoyed the book as much as I did is because it made me think about,well, everything.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Though I am a big fan of Walk Two Moons, and also enjoyed Chasing Redbird, I was not at all impressed with Bloomability. The book just seemed somewhat lacking, in both characterization and plot. I did not find myself caring about the characters, and I kept on waiting for something to happen. The book seems to consist of minor events that are not all that connected, and not all that important. Generally after reading a book I feel like I am able to take something with me, but I did not get anything out of this novel. I would not recommend this book, even if you are a fan of Creech."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK [IS BAD]!!!!!","review":"This book was definitly NOT one of the good books i have read.

At first it was completely crazy and I stopped reading, but then at some level I picked it up again and started along the lines of the chapter when she went to Switzerland with her aunt and uncle, the \\"two complete strangers\\". Being in a country you don't know of at all and getting to know all kinds of different people IS hard. The story itself was fun, and it really seems like you were completely into the story, falling into the snow, skiing, eavesdropping the conversations, and listening to Lila complain about not respecting the Americans. I read it in a few days and read it again. It feels like you were really in Switzerland with Dinnie--IN Dinnie-- and in the adventure.Creech has captured the fun and the wildness of what a reader wants, and the life being in a country that you merely went to and feeling a bit foreign at first. In other words, Creech has gotcha there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloomability","review":"This book was great!! It was interesting and entertaining. For me, the plot of the book was,well a little weak, but the way Sharon Chreech wrote the book it still made sence. Also the book was very realistic, so I could relate to many of Dinnie's problems. I learned a lot from this book and would definatly recomend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the name Dinnie!","review":"So far so good!

I loved Walk Two Moons, Absolutly Normal Chaos, and Chasing Redbird. So naturally I was very excited when this one came out. Dinnie was a bad character the only thing good about her was that she showed how insecrure moves can make children. And Guthrie lived in some kind of sick fantasy world. What kind of teenager goes around shouting \\"I am a transparent eyeball!\\" Give me a break. And \\"such the best.\\" Who in their right mind says \\"such the best?\\" Lila was the only decent character. I loved how she expressed her opinions so clearly.

Her stunning vocals in \\"Another Dumb Blonde\\" showcase what an incredible amount of talent the 18 year old daughter of Don Ho truly is. The emotional ballad \\"To Myself\\" has helped me through hard times and good times, the remixes are seriously kickin' and the cover art is great, it captures Hoku's youth and innocense perfectly. I am such a huge fan, that, with a little help from my e-pal Jordan, I have started a hoku webpage I think is well worth your time. Please check it out if your unsure of your purchase. It includes lyrics, audio/video clips, lots of pix and plenty of interviews. Thank you for your time and patronage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoku: A Fresh Talent","review":"Hoku is perhaps the best new female artist. I've supported her since her debut two winters ago and will continue to for the rest of my life. While her voice is not Mariah Carey-esque, she has her own style and tradmarks. She is a far better singer than, for example, Mandy Moore and much prettier than your average girl trying to make it big. Her songs are easy to relate to for any teenage girl and her first single \\"Another Dumb Blonde\\" is simply incredible! She has the best album, one of few you can actually listen to without hitting the skip button once. This single is a must for fans because it includes the very rare \\"To Myself\\" which everyone needs to hear. It's sweet, touching and just plain great. There are also remixes and a karaoke version.

It brought perspectives of both British army and Patriots. In addition, through the characters of Ethan, Clark, Thomas and Kindred, author provided different view points.I specially enjoyed descriptions of Ethan's home, structure of Red Indian culture, fascination of researchers with plants and man-wife relationship. As an Asian Indian, for me these were very fascinating parts of American history which usual text books ignore.Full credit to Mr. Carter for this book. I specially appreciate his courage to write a fiction, which are usually easy targets of critics.I look forward to a similar book on War of 1812 and American Revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"US History Finally Explained","review":"Thanks to President Jimmy Carter for writing this excellent book about the Revolutionary War from beginning to end. The stories give great insight to the many hardships our ancestors endured in order to gain and change the new territory. This book is very well written and impossible to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ration the research","review":"Indeed,Jimmy Carter has done an impressive amount of research. And by golly, he has used it all. When reviewing a novel, this should be a reason to delete stars, rather than award them.Cramming in all the research at which they worked so hard is a common failing of novice historical fiction writers, but fortunately for them, they are not former presidents of the United States, so their initial efforts never embarrass them in print. Either Mr. Carter's editors (and we know who they are, because he names them) were overawed by his impressive past, or recognized that turning this turgid recitation of facts into anything resembling a novel would be a hopeless task."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will someone please teach Carter to show, not tell?","review":"I hoped to like this book. I have a great deal of respect for Carter, and he clearly knows his historical subject in detail. I also have lots of patience and even enthusiasm for historical detail in fiction--I'm currently reading Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver series, which has a similar level of clearly well-researched detail included. However, Carter's fiction writing style is some of the most tedious I have encountered. I bravely soldiered on to page 90something before giving up in glassy-eyed despair. Every page is exposition, beginning to end, even the dialogue! Characters consist of historical explanations of the details of their lives. I felt like I was reading a long-winded description of a novel, or perhaps of the lengthy backstory notes for a novel, rather than the novel itself. I wish Carter the best, and hope that his fiction writing improves with experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book/historical fiction ever written","review":"Was I ever primed for this one. As a living historian who portrays the Southern campaign I could not wait for the book to arrive. It was obvious from Carter's Larry King interview he had read the right books, had a firm grasp on the salient issues and understood the long-overlooked importance of the Southern front. What he could not do was tell a story, write a passable piece of dialogue or engage his reader at all. It was in short a book as disasterous as his presidency. In fact, I am convinced were he not a former president, short of self-publishing, this could never have been printed. 134 used copies from as low as $4.59 right here on Amazon says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"History comes alive","review":"This is a wonderful story, well told. It will keep your interest and you will learn a little about the beginnings of uor country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"A very dry flat uninspiring read. When the book (infrequently) takes on a tinge of excitement, the mood is quashed by a lapse into tedious detail. Real science and history texts have held my interest better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful, for a TEXTBOOK, not a NOVEL!","review":"This book did bring me a lot of information about the revolutionary war in the Southeast of United States, tha's a thumb for Mr. Carter. But, Mr. Carter, this book is call a novel is because it merely have characters with misplaced love and dialogues. This book is kind of hard to delve deep in. For history lover, I recommand it, but time-killer, I would say no.The book take place in Southeast of United States, and specifically in the frountiersman social class. Ethan Pratt, the main character, transformed from a careless person to a patriot, and have a position in the revolutionary war. The book also included misplace love, that Espey, Ethan's wife, divorce from him, and he fall in love with his best friend and also neighbor's wife, Mavis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary Stagflation","review":"Old Jimmuh is as good a novelist as he was a President. I thrilled to his description of young colonists falling in love; they \\"exchanged information\\" then got hitched. Two different couples within seven pages. Wooden characters who spend most of the time explaining things to each other that had to be common knowledge. Lots of facts are presented, but I got zero feel for how life was really lived in the period. Just as the great moralist from Plains eschewed Presidential pomp in office, he sternly rejects any literary style or elegance. He should return to telling the world what a wonderful fellow he is, hectoring a real President, and hiding from rabbits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consistently Lackluster","review":"This book follows the pattern established by the former president who has once again stepped far beyond his natural skillsets. Carter is a decent, compassionate and intelligent man who was a mediocre president, at best. He is a worse author. \\"The Hornet's Nest is a lackluster tale, bereft of coherent plot and wanting well developed characters that effectively link history and fiction. Mr. Carter should stick to his knitting as a concerned humanitarian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Research","review":"Jimmy Carter has done an admirable job of research on a part of the Revolutionary War that has most of us know little about. Unfortunately, Jimmy Carter's first-rate research is undone by his limited skills as a writer - especially a writer of fiction.It is ultimately a great deal like his presidency: the best of intentions, a good mind, and poor results."},{"rating":"1","title":"It re-defines the word \\"novel\\"!","review":"Make no mistake: if the author of this book were NOT a former President of the United States, his manuscript would never have seen the light of day. He seems determined to pack in every event related to the Revolution that occurred in the south during a twenty year period--at the expense of character development, plot, narrative drive and dramatic tension. If a reader actually reaches the last page, he or she will have a pretty good idea of what happened in the south during the Revolutionary War. But if that's your purpose, I could list several histories of the period that do the job better, not this textbook masquerading as a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was excited to read this....","review":"I believe that Jimmy Carter is a fine man with a good heart and an admirable mind. \\"Sources of Strength\\" was an inspiring book to me. So I waited in line for 3 hours to have Mr. Carter sign my copy of \\"The Hornet's Nest.\\" But that's where my story takes a turn for the worse. Because then I read the book. And it's not great. The ratio of telling to showing is really bad, the dialogue is stilted, etc... I finished it as a matter of principle. But I would not recommend it to a friend looking for a good read. I've given it 2 stars simply because the research that went into the book was obviously so extensive. And I learned some interesting things. But now I know why no other former presidents have written fiction. It's harder than it looks! (And I'm not a writer.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"majorly lacks character devolpment.....","review":"It's obvious that Jimmy did extensive research for the book and it could have been a really interesting read for that reason except that Jimmy did a lot of telling rather than showing, a very elementary rule not to be broken in fiction writing. Parts of the book are also overly repetitive. Often I was informed of the same fact over and over, and I had only read as far as page 50... His book reads more as an outline and a catalog of historical details. It may be hard to be in the hotseat as the editor of this book, but it is truly a shame that the editor did not do his or her job in editing. If only it could have been polished up a little bit before publishing, by fleshing out the characters more, eliminating the repetiveness and the political correctness, it would have been a more enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"History does NOT come alive, unfortunately","review":"I wanted to like \\"The Hornet's Nest\\". I'm becoming more and more of a history (and, by extension, historical fiction) buff these days, and when my brother lent me this book I accepted it eagerly. However, his initial reservations (\\"It's badly written; I can't get into it\\") were absolutely on the money.Sad but true--the book is a failure. Though his subject matter is interesting (the Revolutionary War as it was fought and experienced in the South) and his research is thorough and admirable, Jimmy Carter is simply unable to bring it all alive in novelistic form. Style is required in the writing of a novel, and Mr. Carter doesn't have it. Page after page of thudding exposition and flat dialogue from stiff characters cripple the story's momentum to the point of exasperation. Though I learned from the book, I didn't enjoy it -- of course your mileage may vary, but proceed with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Humanitarian, Okay President, Dismal Novelist","review":"I love American History.However, I feel as though I was being lectured to in this book. President Carter has certainly done his homework and has researched well.Hornet's Nest certainly is not a novel, but more of an outline of historic facts, with added conversation. The characters have flat personalities. You do not get to know or care about any of them. THE whole book is written on a sixth grade level. It may be wonderful to a student in a special needs class, with limited vocabulary and reading skills who needs American History written in a very clear, flat manner.. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Research - Bad Novel","review":"I have to agree with the reader from Pasadena, CA. President Carter did a fabulous job of research. But, it did not flow as a novel. The first half of the book was bogged down in waaaay too much detail about the main characters. The second half of the book flowed much better in terms of integrating the details with the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Revolutionary Rebels Won the South","review":"President Carter has brought to life the story of The American Revolutionary War with great detail and exciting verbage. I knew nothing at all about the South and it's participation in the war and his book has wet my interest to learn more. The next book I read will be Savannah to Yorktown by Henry Lumpkin. Unfortunately the editor could have made the book better if he actually read from beginning to end.It lost momentum with to much detail about a vist to a cabin between action scenes near the end.And both women in Eathans life lived \\"Northward\\". I think Mavis won him,and he should have said so more clearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hornet's Nest","review":"Interesting story line.

His conversations are formal and lecturing. His main fictional character has no passion. This should have been a history book. The sections dealing in the pure history were interesting and informative although I did tend to lose track of which side he was talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps he should stick to non-fiction.","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed several works of non-fiction by President Carter. And I greatly admire him. However, I found this a s-l-o-w read. Some parts of this book were very interesting to me because of the historical insights. But since it was a novel, I expected to find some central characters who reappeared pretty consistently throughout the book. However, just about the time I would become interested in a character, he abandoned that character (sometimes permanently and sometimes for several chapters), leaving me \\"stranded.\\"I have always had interest in the social impact of history, including that of wars. Perhaps someone more interested in specific strategy and the details of battles would enjoy this book more than I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool!","review":"Like many people, my first exposure to the Standells was seeing them on the Munsters TV Show.

If the screen would fully fold back;2. If there were a volume control on the remote;3. If it could be hacked to be region-free;4. If the battery would charge when the player were in use (needs to be switched off to charge);5. If the remote sensor were in a more accessible place (when you put the unit in a holder to strap to the back of a car seat, the sensor is covered so the remote doesn't work.)None of these issues are deal-breakers - I highly recommend this unit at twice the price! (we paid $95 refurb)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE TOSHIBA!","review":"I have been very impressed by Toshiba products since my first purchase 5 years ago. What I love about the DVD players and TV combos is that when the movie is stopped, the player remembers the stopped location & will play right where it left off. Even when the tv was turned off. No more of this \\"trying to find the spot & wasting time in the process\\" stuff. My only complaint about the portable players is that they only \\"hold\\" the stopped point for so long before it doesn't remember anymore.

Imagine my surprise when I read the owner's manual and in several places it warns \\" Do not operate the player in a moving vehicle. Vibration may prevent proper playback or cause damage to the disc.\\" And \\"Do not use the player in a place subject to vibration.\\" And yet, it includes a vehicle adapter.

When it came time to replace my last one, based upon the reviews I purchased this unit. I cannot recommend this unit at all. First of all, the picture quality was not nearly as good as that of the units I have owned in the past. But more importantly, the unit did not even get through the first commerical DVD when the picture started breaking up, and the disk mechanism started grinding and continually running. The only way I would stop it was to open the door of the disk bay. (There is nothing wrong with the commerical DVD, as it plays fine on my other units.) I have always liked Toshiba products, but I would only recommend this to my least favorite people. I would not have given the product one star, but a star is required to complete the review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went through 2 units with skipping problems","review":"The one star is for battery life. Otherwise incredibly frustrating to go through two players both with unpredictable stutter and skip problems on different disks.In addition, the screen controls are limited.

You can only stretch the picture, not magnify it to fill the 16x9 screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a bit disappointed","review":"I've used cheaper machines that were much better. The picture is not crisp and clear. I hate the separate battery pack. It sticks out and gets in the way. The power adaptor has a huge \\"brick\\" attached to it.

Resume is when the unit is power off and goes into a stanby mode. When turned back on the program begins at the point is was at. This unit does NOT do this. Why any one thinks \\"resume\\" is when you stop and then hit \\"Play\\" is unique does not know what a true resume feature is. The Sony has this feature as does a Zenith unit and Nortech Media 10.2 unit.As it turns out if the stop button is pressed and the lid is closed, the unit will go into standby (sort of) opening the lid and pressing play will get you back to the place it stopped.

The second problem is that it simply doesn't go off reliably. The third problem is that it's got no AM/PM switch, so it's a bit of a task to use it as a daily alarm clock. ...I kept mine because it looked nice--but if you want a nice-sounding alarm clock, an iPod alarm clock playing a home-made audio track is a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Do not be deceived by the nice looks.

Bush, before his Presidency. So I'll just note a few items not noted much by others here. The first is his religious conversion at about age 40, and questioning whether Jews can get to heaven. When he asks his mother, Barbara, if this is possible, she suggests calling Billy Graham, who replies that Mr. Bush should not play God. Second is his remarkable method of getting rich , by parlaying $600,000 into $16 million, by forcing certain well off people to move, and passing (barely) a referendum to apply a sales tax to pay for the new stadium. In both cases, property rights and low taxes appear at odds with standard GOP thinking! With the new stadium, the investors net worth skyrocketed! If only we could all be so fortunate! His time as Texas governor seems average enough, and there are some accomplishments in education and other areas. So this seems a reasonable critique for all sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Molly Ivins -- Bad Analysis or Just Plain Stupid?","review":"Ivins -- Terrible Analysis or Just Plain StupidMolly has a folksy down home style. She gets you comfortable with the feeling that she is one of us, and then marches forth with her analysis. Watch out, her numbers are not what they seem and do not back up her words. Example -- Tax Rate -- Molly works through numbers showing that the tax burden on the lowest income groups have the same total tax rate as the highest income groups. She then implies that the two groups are paying the same taxes. However, using her own data, the math actually works out to the richest group paying over 25 times as much per person as the lowest tax group. 25 to 1 is certainly no where the same.

I'll save all potential readers a lot of trouble by giving you the story line: 1) Dubya comes from the Bush family, therefore anything that goes right is because of their influence, 2) anything that fails to pander to Ivins' and DuBose's idea of a properly liberal government is a result of Dubya just not being bright enough to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Grief","review":"Molly must have a personal grudge with President Bush since all she seems to be able to do is find ways to bash him. Even the complements in the book are backhanded and it feels like the tone is anti-Bush.Molly has a way of telling a story to make it seem one sided, the book isn't totally unreadable but if you understand the Ivans/Bush relationship you need to read it with a grain of salt.This book would be better if you had a non-biased person writing it"},{"rating":"1","title":"C_R_A_P","review":"Why doesn't the book tell about All the bad things he has done. I mean talk about one sided views. Where are the affairs,iligal activities,Smoking the herb?

She practically foams at the mouth with hatred of any politician who doesn't have a 'D' after his name. This is just one more predictable hatchet job of liberal hate-speech. Molly couldn't find any fault with the... Clinton years, but practically invents and over-blows the slightest Bush 'fault'. Because of her close-minded, lock-step liberal bent, Molly's opinions must be taken with a grain of salt by any open-minded reader. Don't waste your money on this latest example of liberal hate speech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Molly underestimates we Texans again","review":"Having endured Molly's columns for a number of years, I cannotdecide if she is serious or just takes her positions to make money. She is amusing. Those of us in Texas who voted 65% for him for Governor and those 85+ who approve of his presidency obviously have better vision of the man than she. Imagine ifGore was now president !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"Anybody who thinks that Bush is the moral salvation of this country, needs to read this book. Molly Ivins exposes why the same people who loved to rant about Clinton's lack of content are eager for a man with an admittedly worse record.Because Ivins does not rely on one-liners or comedy matterial, this book is much more credible than the joke books that are problaly rolling off the presses now that Dubya's selection as the Republican nomination has been confirmed. She simply lets the governor's lack of a good record speak for itself.Bush is a spoiled little rich boy who is ruining Texas, but Ivins and the rest of the educated world are not going to let him get away with such debauchery. Texas ranks first in the number of executions and last in education---and we wonder why people from OUTSIDE the state were praising his education record at the convention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected something different.","review":"As a big fan of Molly, I was really looking forward to this book but must say I was disappointed. I thought the book had a lot of interesting observations of Dubya but I couldnt find much of Molly in them. There are enough straight books on G.W's life and times. I think there was too much Lou Dubose and not enough Molly in this one. Come on Molly, eagerly awaiting your next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road Not Taken...","review":"Ivins has wasted her talent on this rather brief re-hash of the public record. Obviously meant to capitalize on current events, it would surely have been much more interesting if she had focused her \\"Texas-sized smarts\\" on answering the puzzle that so bedeviled her and her co-author: \\"The puzzle of Bush is why someone with so little interest in or attention for policy, for making government work, would want the job of president, or even governor.\\" That would have been a worthwhile effort. It's not too late, Molly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this about Bush?","review":"I was looking forward to reading facts about Dubya, but, other than the \\"duh\\" variety (his father was VP and President of the US, rich people invest money in speculative ventures, it is easier to solicit capital from people you know) they are few and far between. Most of Ivins' and DuBois' material is gossip or speculation and their use of \\"*\\" is not to provide sources, but to make more catty asides. The chapters beginning on page 57 and 71 have nothing to do with W. I guess they needed to pad the book. I will try to read some more, but my eyes keep glazing over."},{"rating":"1","title":"They came at him from the left!","review":"I am by know means a big G.W. Bush fan or supporter. But I think the authors let their political views creep into the text.

But insted use this book as a starting point and go from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid her books, listen to her interviews.","review":"In person Molly Ivins comes across as witty, acerbic, and fun. Her writing, by comparison, is stilted, vicious, unhappy, ungracious, and in the end, plain sad.That's her usual writing. This book is worse off than the rest of her screeds, being an attempt at a polemic that falls short for want of material.About the only thing that might save this book is a books-on-tape version read by her. Poor thing.THIS UPDATE: FRANCISCO FRANCO AND MOLLY IVINS ARE STILL DEAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows the normal graceful cynicism of Molly Ivins","review":"From newspapers across the country, to, yes, a great many books, Molly Ivins always has the most enlightened attitude in attempting lessen the burden of tough political thought on those who would support \\"Dubya,\\" as Ivins dubs the Texan governor.Her book is an absolute hoot and is a must-read for any of those Gore supporters who need ammo, or for those Bush followers who want a real challenge in explaining where Bush was during the Vietnam War or on the divide between openly supporting pro-life stances in front of the Christian right and being more secretive to the American people.This book, without a doubt, hooked me on Ivin's keen insights into the darker (and often laughable) side of politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the Facts.","review":"If you are truly interested in the bare bones facts of who you are being seduced into voting for, this is the book for you. Molly Ivins is one of the most honest and unbiased reporters on the scene today. If you haven't heard of her, it's because she has a nasty propensity for telling the truth ... and the propogandists who spend fortunes controlling your beliefs can't cope with that. Before you vote, whatever your politcal persuasion, read this book. Find out who the man is you're voting for, and who bought and paid for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Will Endure","review":"This book is a warning not to elect George W. and of course it's too late, he's already been appointed. But it will remain useful far into the future to be able to read such an accurate prediction of what sort of president this clown was going to be. Just as people in the future will be curious to examine what exactly our knowledge of global warming was while we went about creating it, some will be curious to read what knowledge we had of this walking catastrophe before we nearly elected him.With this book we stand convicted of the most wide-eyed and aware political masochism. Every nasty trait exhibited by Shrub since he planted himself in the White House had already been analyzed by Ivins and Dubose. Each revelation that there was no compassion in the promoter of \\"compassionate conservatism\\" had been foreseen. The psychopathic inability to feel doubt, regret, humility, or concern had been documented, chronicled, and lamented before Georgie had left Texas.Never forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Molly Ivins Is Missed!","review":"There is no other writer that has such a witty presentation on such a difficult subject. She saw George W. Bush and his impact on Texas and with her wonderful sense of humor told the American citizens what to expect with regard to education, guns, laws and leadership. As I read I was amazed at the warnings we had, but we \\"elected\\" him anyway. Molly said what so many think, but are afraid to say outloud. This book is not heavy or difficult, but explains what GWB did and would do while injecting lots of humor to keep us from crying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shearing the Family Bush","review":"When I picked up Molly Ivin's book \\"Shrub\\" I expected to read a fairly short, biting, and amusing commentary on a politician prone to malapropisms and frat-boy behavior. Instead I found myself crying. Crying because of the injustice that is occuring in Texas at this very moment, injustice cemented and continued by Bush's reign as governor. My strong reaction was due largely to the skill of Molly Ivin; although she is most assuredly not a member of the religious right, (she frequently pokes fun at them) the facts are presented in such a clear manner that they more than speak for themselves. Anyone expecting a 'tour de force' will be disappointed. This book is not \\"Les Miserables\\". However, if you're willing to be challenged, angered, and amused...you may find Ivin's book worthwhile reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verified what I already knew...","review":"While Bush was campaigning it was clear to see he wasn't wrapped too tight and Ivin's book just verifies that over and over again. What is amazing to me is how he has fooled the American public. However, I believe that into his second year as \\"that guy occupying the White House\\" the public is beginning to understand the big mistake they have made. All they have to do is to look at their bank accounts and stock portfolios. It's that old line...\\"It's the economy, stupid!\\" But Bushy boy is in great shape. This books tells all about how he sold stock in failing companies making millions before unsuspecting shareholders knew the truth. He bailed out & left them holding the bag. After reading this book the reader will be sick, disgusted and angry with George W."},{"rating":"1","title":"Molly Ivins, Plaigiarist","review":"It's unbelievable that a reputable publisher would give this documented plaigiarist (from Florence King and Tom Brokaw) a forum to vent her hackneyed, Bush-hating spleen. Ms. Ivins has proven herself incapable of original thought, and this book is actually the recycled campaign material of Bush opponent Ann Richards."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder this book was being sold at half price!!!","review":"What a nasty little book. If the author was looking to be subtle, boy did you miss the mark.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insect Attackes A Bush","review":"What else would you expect? Another book on a GOP personality written by a Democratic Party Activists and third-rate failed journalist, small-time Party hatchetman Lou Dubose. And guess what? He doesn't like Bush. Surprize. Credits him with nothing. Surprize. Ridicules his accomplishments, Surprize. Belittles his drive and personality. Surprize.Don't waste you money on this one, even the half-truths are incoherant. No doubt you already know how you feel about Bush, and probably have a better basis for that opinion than this tuna boat.Bottom line: For the extent that the author dislikes Bush, he really can't find much to soil him with, though try as he did. An incompetant slander at best. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I have not actually read this book below, but I will tell you why I will not do so. When I lived in Texas I read Molly Ivins's political columns frequently. The prospective buyer needs to know that Molly Ivins always gave the far-left view on issues of the day, but her columns were especially bothersome because her columns were always a pack of lies, and even worse, you could tell she thought she was being funny (she always bombed at trying to be funny- she never was funny!).Therefore, since she cannot be trusted to be honest, there is no need to bother with her book (unless you enjoy being deceived).Added On: January 25, 2002: It is apparant that my review struck a nerve out there. I'm sorry if you are offended about my review of the quality of work of Molly Ivins but truth hurts. I should also add that Miss Ivins is very hateful to people who disagree with her views (just witness the insulting language she uses to describe people in her columns)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight may be a partial antidote during the next few years.","review":"Our entire family enjoyed this book. Even our 12-yr-old is now entertained watching \\"Dubya\\" speak as we play \\"Is he staying on point?\\" This isn't Molly Ivin's best book, but its typical of her point-blank humor and insightful analysis. She's a national treasure. If you are a Republican who is happy with the 2000 election maybe you should disregard my rating and not read this book. Everyone else, buy the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Down Home Analysis of Bush","review":"I have always enjoyed Molly Ivins' lively style, which makes her a pleasure to read. I enjoyed \\"Shrub\\" and found it highly informing as well. The book details fascinating incidents from the career of George Bush as Governor of Texas, along with highlighting key events from his life growing up in a famous American family, being the son of a U.S. president, as well as his business career.In order to understand public figures it is important to know about their past lives, which serve as an excellent predictor of present and future conduct. \\"Shrub\\" provides a detailed look at Bush's past, making him far more readily understandable as President of the United States.William Hare"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opener","review":"I had never heard of Molly Ivans before reading Shrub. I thank her for this quick, easy to follow, read. I received her book compliments of a pal who questioned my voting for Gov. Bush. I began reading with total skepticism but eventually accepted that I voted in total ignorance (not the first time unfortunately). I urge anyone who is truly seeking to be an informed voter to purchase this book. IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR ALL VOTERS. You'll quickly see through the rhetoric you've heard in television ads and shake your head in wonder. Given that this man was handed the baton to be our next leader, I'm terribly offended that we haven't heard more about his coattail accomplishments and seedy record, especially where children and lawsuits are concerned. Now when I hear him or one of his allies say \\"tort reform\\" I scream at the TV! Clinton is an embarrassment but even he hasn't been personally bailed out by the taxpayers. Yet.

Heaven help us. Molly, a native Texan, is probably the most honest satirical writer going. She chronicals Dubya's life from his Texas Air National Guard duty to his win in the Republican Primary for President. His corporate policy (oops I mean public policy) are the yarns of extreme right wing Republican lore. The reverse of Robin Hood.

This book, however, mostly deals not with the human body per se, but with the nuances involved in creating the comic book superheroine. A knowledge of basic human anatomy would be most helpful in dealing with this book. There are, however, some extremely helpful sections dealing with posing, proportions, using computers in drawing, the different inking and coloring techniques, and differing ways to draw faces, hair and (the bane of many a neophyte artist) the hands. Overall, an excellent work with only a few minor flaws.

The worst feature is the chapter on computers. Why would somebody who is still trying to learn drawing skills need to even begin to worry about cheesy computer effects? seriously, wasted paper guys. It says on the back the artist has \\"been in the feild for years\\", but you would think that after looking at his illustrations for this book that this is his sole commision.

When Buddy sings \\"She Suits Me To A Tee\\" I honestly wonder at what point his vocal chords will snap. And when Buddy sings \\"I Cry And Sing The Blues\\" you are convinced that in fact he is crying and singing the blues.

It was nice to get their perspective, which generally seemed to validate Montauk's approach.One caveat: As the title implies, \\"How to Get Into the Top Law Schools\\" was written for people who are applying to elite programs, so anybody who is looking outside the top twenty or so might not find Montauk's attitude or advice quite as helpful.

In fact, the question posed in the title can be summed up in 3 words - high LSAT score. For the schools referenced in this book you need a LSAT in the 160-164 range to even get on the wait list. Not to mention that the personal statements are from people with extraordinary backgrounds - people who lived in the jungles of Costa Rica, grew up dirt poor, got pregnent at age 14 or had klansmen in their front yard. Doesn't really help the suburban kid who has lived a normal life. Save your money for the application fees, go to a law school forum, study hard for the LSAT and ignore law school rankings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blower Dryer Diffuser","review":"The product fell apart on the 3rd day.

On a surface level, the author's memory of events is staggering; she covers an entire lifetime with details of names, places, events and even the prices of food and clothing items, almost in diary form. This is all extremely interesting. Her father's behavior is another level, and quite appalling reading; one wonders how any man could treat his family this way.But the deepest and most impressive level is how this family lived and endured and ultimately found happiness through love for one another. Daddy may have been the intended focus, but in the telling of his life, his daughter celebrates something much deeper and long-lasting, the triumph of the human spirit.

My mother, a generation earlier, had a similiar childhood-- abused and deprived of a normal family life she was determined to secure a better life for her children.

His moral failure didn't destroy this group, on the contrary, lead by a strong, loving, forbearing mother, somehow, the family's strong faith led to achievement much of the time.Surprisingly, \\"Daddy Was A Bad Boy\\" was inspired by her children's book \\"Small Change\\" , that is used to explain the Great Depression to children.

We found this one at the library and I checked it out without previewing it based on the reputation of the author. When I read it with my daughter, she was attentive while I read, but unusually quiet. She certainly didn't find it \\"hilarious\\". I was concerned with the eery, almost hallucinatory style of the illustrations and abundance of not very subtle phallic symbols (see reviews below for more detail). I quit reading the book half-way through and I finished it on my own later. I thought the storyline was cute, but found the illustrations completely inappropriate for children. I am surprised and dissapointed that Ms. Fox would have her work associated with something so disturbing. Remember, if a book isn't doing well, anyone with a motive can write a positive review!

I loved the bleakness of it all because I felt that it enhanced the story and helped to set its mood.

They work great at first, but I just find that the velcro wears out waaaaaay too fast. It's frustrating when my LO starts breaking out of them all the time.

This one is the best. You need to do it tight, or baby will get out of it. Both of my babies were able to get their arms out of every swaddler. Including this one, until I did it a bit tighter. I also swaddle first in the muslin wrap blankets. In summer I did a short sleeve onsie, now it's winter and I do a full cotton footsie. Be careful not to over heat baby of course. I like this swaddle the best because of the roominess in feet area/length. The large spot for Velcro is great.

I was skeptical on how much we would use it at first, but now it's all we use at night. My husband and I used receiving blankets for the first two months but our baby kept wiggling out and then waking up either due to startle reflex or cold.

It's too bad, because the cotton SwaddleMe is nice for warmer nights...but I won't buy another one.

With a regular swaddle blanket, we used to swaddle him when he first went to bed, but then I would have to unswaddle to feed him in the middle of the night and just couldn't get the swaddle tight enough again in my half asleep state. Hence, he would break out and be awake again in 30 minutes. With the Swaddleme blanket, swaddling him tightly is effortless, as is getting him out of the swaddle for feeding or changing his diaper. This has saved me tons of frustration! The only downside is that the velcro is quite loud when you open it and has re-alerted my drowsy baby on a couple of occasions as I tried to re-do the velcro. Still, an excellent product...I intend to buy more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver!","review":"Our baby has super determination and strength and can bust out of almost any swaddle. The Swaddleme is great - the velcro is awesome and really allows you to get a snug fit.

Sole Survivor and Phantoms are among my favorites. I was excited to dig into this one, but was soon disappointed when I discover that half the characters are pointless, the big revelation is a let down and a cop out especially for Koontz.

The story could have been told very well in about 400 pages and would have gotten a much better review from me, however, I felt that much of the 526 pages was just fluff that unnecessarily filled up space. My other problem with this book was the ending which was totally predictable (let me just say, without giving away the ending, what you think it is, it is).Strangers was not a horrible book but I expected so much more from it as well as from Koontz which is why I can only give it 2 1/2 stars (there is no 1/2 option so I can really only give it 2)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me reading","review":"After reading it a couple of years ago, I picked it up again to keep me company on my morning metro ride.

He gives us a cast of characters who live in different parts of the world with different occupations and life styles but they all share one thing in common: their lives are coming undone. They have each developed a fear they can't explain. The moon is also a common thread that joins them. A pair of black gloves and water in a drain cause a young brilliant doctor to have blackouts along with mind numbing fear; a motel owner is suddenly terrified of the dark; a seven year old draws pictures of the moon over and over again. This is just a few of the characters that are trapped in a world of fear. I was left turning the pages at break neck speed just to find out what in the world was happening.

So far, out of around 15 Koontz audio versions this one is my favorite, in spite of its length. I could easily listen to it again in the near future. There were, as in many of Koontz's books, some references to the ever enigmatic \\"The Book of Common Sorrows\\". Having always found these poetic phrases quite intriguing I finally decided to obtain a copy (if it even existed). Well, it was originally fictitious (see [...]) but Koontz finally assembled these strange, lyrical exerpts (and more) into a hardback reality.

After 50 pages I started skimming. At 97 pages I gave it up, and just briefly skimmed ahead to the end. Koontz has a serious love affair going on with his own writing, and never mind the story. This is not the first one of his books that I've gotten thoroughly disgusted with because of his verbosity. Sad to say, tho, this may very well be my last Koontz book. He's definitely talented, and has a highly creative imagination. I've wondered before tho, and again with this book; does he get paid by the word?Fortunately, I got this free from a friend.

I am reordering it today so I can pass it along to my niece. She found Koontz a couple of years ago and has read just about every book he has written, except for this one.

There was way to much beating around the bush about an ending that anyone can see coming a mile away. The characters are the usual Dean Koontz characters.

It was terrible--by the time I'd made it through 3/4 of the book, I didn't care what had happened to the characters anymore and gave up reading it.

The reason for only two stars is because of the way it was formated. A novel of this length is usually recorded on thirteen to fifteen cd's or tapes. this novel was on two cd's. This makes each chapter or section very long. If you want to change from a portable cd player to your car cd player, you may have to relisten to an hour or more. The story I would give 4 or 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, poorly written dreck.","review":"This book is awful. I do not know how in the world this man became a bestseller. This book reads like it was written by a schizophrenic with a poor imagination. Here's what happened in a few words, instead of 681 pages:-Group of \\"strangers\\" experience strange feelings, happenings.-The \\"strangers\\" independently discover that they were all together at a hotel during the landing of an alien space craft.-They discover they were drugged and brainwashed by the government. They are hunted by the government, and all is well when they are captured. THAT'S IT!! Terrible book, colossal waste of time and mental expenditure. Run, don't walk, AWAY from this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of Koontz's Best","review":"The other highly qualified reviewers have adequately given a synopsis of this book. I am simply adding a voice to the chorus. This is by far one of the BEST Koontz books ever--right up there with Watchers. If you like Koontz, but haven't read this book, then shame on you! You need to read it STAT... FIVE STARS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangers","review":"I am big mystery/suspense reader and Strangers does not rank up there with any of my favorites. This book, to put it simply was just okay! The version a that I read was 526 pages long and I found that to be entirely too long (how others read versinons between 800 and six-hundred-and-some pages and still gave this book five stars I don't know)! The story could have been told very well in about 400 pages and would have gotten a much better review from me, however, I felt that much of the 526 pages was just fluff that unnecessarily filled up space. My other problem with this book was the ending which was totally predictable (let me just say, without giving away the ending, what you think it is, it is). Strangers was not a horrible book but I expected so much more from it as well as from Koontz which is why I can only give it 2 1/2 stars (there is no 1/2 option so I can really only give it 2)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long. Don't waste your time reading this 681 flop.","review":"I agree with Dave from Arlington, TX. I read at least 250-300 pages before the book started to make any sense. The cover claims that it is a \\"spellbinding story.\\" Yeah, right. I plodded through to the foolish ending. Don't waste you time. Stephen King said that this was \\"...the best book he has written so far...\\" Then again, Stephen King wrote Tommyknockers. If you thought Tommyknockers was way too long and had a stupid ending wait until you read Strangers."},{"rating":"2","title":"strangers","review":"This was the second d. koontz book i'd read and the one that got me hooked.

I recommend those who enjoy reading science fiction to pick this book over others. : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another really good Koontz thriller","review":"This is only my third Koontz novel - the first one I ever read was \\"Fear Nothing\\" which got me hooked (it's wonderful!); the second was the sequel to that one, but not quite as good. Strangers is sometimes a little too wordy, but fortunately Koontz has quite a way with words!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this would never end....","review":"Now I normally don't mind long books if they are of the \\"can't put it down\\" variety. And I have read other reviews that complained about \\"Strangers\\" length. But I really couldn't wait for this thing to end. I nearly quit several times but hung in there to the end.

On the older albums, there were only one or two great tracks I liked...not enough to really warrant a purchase. The overall sound of Wreath Of Barbs seems more organized and musical with less banging, screaming, and filler material. Even with this change however, Wumpscut has not diluted into synthpop like so many other industrial bands. The theme of Wreath Of Barbs is still as dark and angry as the previous albums. Deliverance and Wreath Of Barbs are the best tracks on here, and shouldn't disappoint any Wumpscut fan. So for long time Wumpscut fans: Yes, the sound has changed a little but it's still worth picking up. For those who have not liked Wumpscut in the past: Wreath Of Barbs is just different enough to deserve another listen. Either way, Wreath Of Barbs fits nicely into any industrial fan's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album blows","review":"the vocals are hella cool but the lyrics are g.ay, and i the layering could have been better.

Almost all the time is one of the two pointing the home video camera at the other one, conducting an \\"interview\\". It looks like exactly what it it, a home movie made by teenagers. The tornado footage isn't a SHADOW of the film I've seen on any other storm chasing video, which surprised me. At least I expected some good footage.Avoid this rip-off at all cost.

There are several problems with this unit tat you don't find for a while.- No option for stem mount. Strap mount is hard to use if you need to take unit off the bike for other uses.- Forget about the connecting this unit to the Internet software. It uses an internal modem that you are supposed to place you computer mic next to the cs300 and it communicates with the Polar site. Good luck. This feature is worthless as it just plain does not work. Tried 3 different computers and 4 mics. Support was useless.- Stops receiving HR for no apparent reason then starts up again. It can take up to a full hour of riding before I get an accurate heart rate reading. I tried using the special electrode contact gel but still no good.- Sensor and strap roll over while swimming.I have purchased cycling computers for much less and they outperform thin piece of JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch broke after 2 weeks","review":"Hi,The Polar CS300 broke after the 1st time I went into the water.

The watch was either unsealed or is cracked somewhere that cannot be detected.Polar USA claims that Jomashop is not a certified reseller and therefore I DO NOT recommend buying Polar products from them although they are sometimes much cheaper.Currently I cannot use the watch and after trying unsuccessfully to reach Jomashop and get their feedback to why the watch broke the 2nd time, I decided to give up and donate the watch to my kids collection.I had very good experience with other Polar watches that served me for many years but this experience made me consider other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch, great for workout and monitor heart rate","review":"Good productGreat product for working out, riding bicycle and monitor heart rateWill recommendGreat buyGood for daily use also with alarms"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD PRODUCT, RECOMMENDED","review":"I read all reviews here, and I was very worried about the quality of cs300, but I decided to buy it and I installed it in my bike and it works without problem, I recommended it, for amateur bikers.

The batteries in the cadence sensor and the heart rate sensor have to be replaced about once a year. Even worse, when the battery in the speed sensor is drained, you have to buy a whole new sensor. My speed sensor battery died in about two years. The cheapest price I've found for a new speed sensor is about $35.00, before shipping.

He thinks the script was added to the CD in error. If you check the book carefully you will find a discussion of why some installed packages should be removed. Chapter 12 starting at about page 386 discusses removal of unnecessary software on a *firewall computer*. Mr. Sery is talking in the context of a standalone firewall machine, not your personal work machine. It's important to understand this distinction and to read Chapter 12 before you run any of his scripts from the CDs. You would not want to run these security scripts on your *personal* machine.Of course Mr. Sery is overlooking a small fact -- most home users don't have the money or knowhow to set up a standalone firewall computer, quite separate from their personal work machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good format but riddled with errors","review":"I agree with the reviewer that stated that this book was poorly proofed - if at all. The format of the book is very good, but it is so riddled with errors that you end up going in circles trying to figure out what the author is trying to tell you to do. I ended up using this book as my primary source for getting my Samba network up and running, but only because I couldn't find a better reference.

One can find serious typographical errors on almost any page, ranging from misspelled keywords, to sentences that just end in the middle of a thought. Often the text instructs you to do one thing, but the representative screen shot shows completely different information. The only way I would recommend this book would be for students of typesetting to study as an excellent example of how not to practice their art. Based on this one experience, I have no plans to ever buy another book from the publisher, IDG Books, nor the author.Patrick Krepps"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful for connecting to internet using DSL/Cable","review":"I am very dissapointed with this book. If you are looking to setup a firewall/gateway Linux box and you have a cable modem/DSL, look somewhere else. This book is primarily about Samba and how to setup an internal network. There are 2 chapters regarding gateways/firewalls but they assume you are using a regular modem. The web site for the book contains no information for us cable modem folks. The Ipchains discussion was not helpful at all.Also the screen shots in Chapter 1 are very dated and do not reflect what you see when you install the distribution on the cd.

The film does contain some Eurocentric perspectives of aboriginal gender relationships and political affairs. However, it demonstrated the Spanish subjugation and manipulation that took place during the European Invasion of the Americas. The mass genocide displayed in the film is dramatized with real body like characters and background illustrations of dead bodies. A film on Pre-American history is somewhat unusual,especially when it comes to authenticity. It would be great to see a film on the Amerindian Holocaust for historical purposes with all the colors, backgrounds and true craftsmanship that some American Hebrew and Chinese films have when they portray their history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"This game continues with the great graphics that Red Storm has been consitant with, HOWEVER, I managed to finish this game in about 2 hours.

The book focuses on:1) The main principles of marketing effectively to increase customer appeal and retention;2) Dangers to avoid when you plan your advertising or marketing;3) The importance of dollarizing everything you do in sales and service. This has to do with knowing the value of your product and pricing them based on the real worth of the product. Customers buy the product for the benefits it brings them. You need to dollarize your product based on the benefits it brings, not solely based on production costs.

Not funny at all, the writing is horrible, the scenes are haphazard and disonnected--an umitigated disaster. An amazing lineup of actors, but I'm sure most of them will hang their head in shame when anyone reminds them that they were a part of this movie. Some of the lesser-level actors whose acting ability was never stellar turn in some of the worst acting ever in this movie. Even the bloopers during the end credits aren't funny, although in the first movie they were.

Sometimes actor's cars will change from Corvettes to Plymoths, then back again thinking no one would notice.

This movie is cram packed with one liners and has a cast that you just can't beat - a bunch of hasbeens maybe, but GREAT hasbeens. Maybe you have to have a sick sense of humor, as i obviously do, but i and my family love this film. I will admit that it's corny and sometimes just plain stupid, but if you're not looking for a deep storyline and you just want a funny show this is a great choice. It does help a bit if you have seen the first Cannonball Run because there are inside jokes that you may not catch otherwise.

It should have been torpedoed in the planning stages. There was very little that was enjoyable about this bomb. I enjoyed the Tim Conway and Don Knotts cameos, but that's about it. Even the angry ape wasn't funny especially after the news of the ape that horribly attacked that woman a few years ago. Take my advice and skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Vanity Film","review":"Justly forgotten, \\"Cannonball Run II\\" (1984) is a glorified home movie that displays its all-star cast in a spectacularly poor light. Production values are nonexistent and the anticipated Rat Pack reunion (with Frank Sinatra barely showing up) falls woefully flat. After sinking to the depths of \\"Stroker Ace,\\" Burt Reynolds and director Hal Needham end their screen partnership on a wretched note.

This comedy dynamic duo once again sets out to tear up the highway in this cross-country laugh-fest. Awesome cameos by a virtual who's who of celebrities. Terry Bradshaw rocks as the beer-swiggin' good old boy you'll love. Pound for pound, this is the best cannonball ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"well....","review":"Ok, I think the first CBR is one of the funniest movies EVER. This sequel is pretty lame though. There are some funny bits but most of the cast is wasted in this. I forgot how bad Dean Martin looked in this one. Ah well, for the price I guess it's good for completists.

As one can see from the rapturous reviews below, this approach mesmerizes many listeners. Sometimes Celi can't bring off the necessary intensity to hold ones attention, but Lehmann does. I admit I can't listen to more than a few movements of this performance at a sitting. It reminds me of Haydn's Seven Last Words of Christ, which is also built upon one Adagio after another. That's what this reading feels like, but it's deeply committed on all counts. The two soloists are as good as one might wish, the 1955 mono sound is clear and rich, the chorus sings with true religious fervor. If you don't mind an account that literally has barely a single allegro section, this legendary CD may captivate you, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the space it takes up!","review":"This is the worst piece I own by Cuisinart. I generally like their products but this thing stinks. My girlfriend bought me this for X-Mas (after I picked it out!). Let me say that I would give it negative stars if possible. I now have to waste time and fuel to drive it back to the store to recuperate the cost. The thing fell apart after 1/8 of an onion--which is, btw, all the space this thing has to chop. Was not sharp enough to cut through the tougher, outer onion layer. P-l-e-a-s-e! I took it all the way apart to see what could possibly \\"jam\\" a manual food chopper. I noticed that the blade piece unscrewed from the hand piece. No problem, right? Wrong, wrong! The pieces would not stay together. Needless to say that it almost ruined X-Mas once my girlfriend had to go digging through the trash for the receipt . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the task!","review":"Doesn't work. Too bad--good idea, especially the self-rotating bit. Would not cut through the red pepper skin. Same for Portabello mushrooms-not the toughest items to cut. I tried it with the guard, without the guard (food got trapped in blades), on the base and on a cutting board. I tried pressing hard and fast, and with a slower motion. In every case, it mangled rather than cut and did not go all the way through. I can do the job with a knife better and faster.I chose the Cuisinart model because I'd read quite a few negative reviews of choppers in general, but I had faith in the Cuisinart brand and thought they could get it right.

This collection of his Chess recordings shows that he would have deserved more attention. He did not have as many hits as Muddy and Walter and accordingly the collection only contains two CDs. Chess concentrated on the hitmakers. Don't let that detract you because this is high quality blues that still deserves to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago Blues at Its Finest","review":"I've had most of these recordings in my collection on vinyl and cassette since the early-mid 1970s and I consider them to be mandatory staples in any and every serious blues collection.

I can not overstate how great this music is if you love the blues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance and revisionism","review":"The author has given a reasonable and interesting history of warfare up until the 1600s. He does not understand the military and has ignored truth in defining and explaining their actions. He makes assumptions about current military thought based on ignorance. He has no knowledge of the current theories of war as presented by Boyd.He gives a typical liberal view of the military based on feelings from the 1960's. He ignores the actual facts of the behavior of American soldiers and assumes they rape, pillage and plunder as in the past. He describes the bombing of North Vietnam as carpet bombing by B-52s. He has no understanding of current air warfare. His description of using air power as a terror weapon reminds one of the older theories of Douhet and not those of Warden.The author needs to educate himself on current means of warfare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inclusive","review":"This book includes more than i expected.

About half the cuts are classic Berry rockers of the late 50's and early 60's. They are great rock and roll numbers, but did not do well on the charts. There are mid-60's releases from when Chuck made a US comeback, e.g. Nadine and No Particular Place to Go. The rest is filler - 2 bluesy cuts from early 60's LP's, 2 off-color live recordings from England, and a couple of other obscurities.

Wasted time. It took forever to get through the over-complex character build-up, and some strange characters they are. Not one character had any sense of normalcy.

This mystery is cleverly entwined with the age old friction of Jewish vs Christian beliefs mixed with guilt and hatred. The author cleverly lets the reader know who the killer is but never reveals his motive and intentions until you peel off each layer of the characters to get to the heart of the matter. Regardless of religion, this book is not preachy nor does the author favor one over the other. Instead it's about understanding, patience and love. It's about the love of God...both true worship and fanatical, of sins both past and present, of forgiveness of ourselves and others, of acceptance of our flaws. I've never read anything like this book and it sent me to my childhood when in my innocence I asked my Jewish neighbor and friend why didn't she believe in Jesus. The female characters could have been us.

It's awesome, challenging and demanding, a must buy for the Flight-Sim freak you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game","review":"Damn, this game is incredible. Even if you rev your engine, the plane will rotate a bit from the torque. Try to learn how to recover from stalls on all the different models, then learn to recover the ME-109. It ain't easy but once you recognize how your plane of choice acts when it's about to stall, you can pull aerial maneuvers that really ride the edge of the aircraft's ability. I guess that's where 'flying by the seat of your pants' comes from. This game is just overall unbelievable. It's hard to imagine how people used to actually fly and fight in these things considering the difficulty of just getting up and landing, nevermind combat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have all of these sim","review":"While this is the first of the IL-2 series and most likely will not work in a mordern computer now, how ever for you that still have a window 98 operating system an a Micrososft sidewinder flight stick laying around.

The graphics in it are very competitive with current games(eight years later). This WWII simulator offers missions with every country involved in the war. The graphics on the planes and artillery is very realistic. The cockpits are the closest you can get to being in a real plane. However, compared to other simulators it seems very hard. This is because it is so realistic. IL-2 1946 Sturmovik is by far the best combat simulator ever produced and will continue to be a hit for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the basis of the demo....","review":"On the basis of the demo, which was an earlier build of the beta, this sim will be the new benchmark.

It's that good.If you like combat flightsims, or have always thought you might like to try one, you cannot go wrong with Il-2 Sturmovik.If you felt burned by BoB, MSCFS2, or B-17II, this is a completely different animal.

And, it turns out, I was not disappointed at all.The graphics of the game are no less than astounding, each screenshot is fit for framing in a fine arts museum. The flight model, since the game was created by two aeronautical engineers, is relentless; it's definitely for the pros but provides for hours of entertainment while you learn how to fight in the sulky IL-2 Sturmovik. The explosions are terrifyingly real and the wingman messages are even entertaining.This is definitely a $50.00 game masquerading for $39.99. If you know anyone who is even remotely interested in war or flight, this is definitely a great game for them to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"Maybe it's just the game is too old for my computer, but it doesn't work.

I am currently using this as a secondary text to an advanced calculus class I am taking, and, as far as I'm concerned, this is the only text I need.

It reflects the author's passion for the subject in its comprehensive coverage of a topic that many people find uncomfortable to deal with. Step by step, page by page Booker (now Wiebe) takes the reader through identifying the problem to resources for recovery. She is as thorough in her description of what constitutes abuse as she is ruthless in her encouragement to individuals and congregations to find solutions. Scripture, prayer and extensive resources provide some balance to the difficult matter that groups are invited to study. There isn't room to do justice to Janet Booker's book. If this is a subject you or your group would like to tackle, or if it is an issue within your congregation, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life saving Book Everyone should read","review":"I have just finished reading this book and felt compelled to buy it.

It helped me so much that I feel the need to have it in my personal library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For The Truly Desperate","review":"I found this book disappointing. It might be okay for a person who is only slightly depressed. I actually laughed out loud when I got to the part where the author \\"helpfully\\" points out that there are suicide hotlines which are open. Ya think? Those hotline counselors are poorly trained although I am sure they mean well. I think they are mainly to call EMTs for life-threatening situations.This might be worth a read, but I do not recommend it for someone who has unsolvable, daunting problems.

If someone was in the state of mind to where they were very much depressed and suicidal, yet reaching out for help the words might bite back at them in a bad way.This might be a helpful book for those who are dealing with a suicidal person, but I wouldn't recommend a non-sympathetic toned book to be given to someone who is suicidal themselves. I would find a book with a warm, calm and relaxing tone to ease their brains into accepting the help they need.I suppose it would all depend on the person and how they handle criticism. I would imagine that most people in a suicidal state are fragile mentally and should have much more care and thought put into any words that reach them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Stupid Book","review":"This book is totally stupid and so is its author.

Looks like someone went collecting buzzwords, then went to beef up a list of references to get the appearence of academic-something and then embarked on writing a few paragraphs on all buzzwords, not even trying to be either a reference or a tutorial or a review work, or really anything.Reminded me of an old Fortran book which couldn't make heads or tails and went scattering one topic all over the place, but was official texbook so you had to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This book reads like an academic term paper; in other words, brief and boring, with many references to other works. Broad overviews are all you'll find. For example, the author devotes a mere five pages to discuss the XML document object; why did he bother?There are far, far better books for any and all of the topics covered.

I haveread many other books concerning fire behavior and fire investigation, but I feel that this book is the most comprehensive over all. It not only gives you the basics in fire investigation but also the hard scientific knowledge to understand what happens when fires occur. I have used this book for several years as an investigator and find myself returning to it time and time again. This book is also a must for preparing cases for court. The author is a reknowned leader in the field of forensic fire investigation and is widely respected for his approach in regards to this subject. If you have any questions you can contact me at my e-mail address. Thank you, Jeffrey A.

The first scene is with the 3 wise men entering his birthplace with frankensense and mur. They give the treasures to him, then they realize that he is not the messiah, but that they had made a mistake and that the real Messiah is in the next tent.We then enter his age of adulthood. He joins the \\"PFJ\\" (People's Front of Judeah), not the Judean People's Front. And joins them in their quest to overthrow the Roman government which has taken over Jerusalem at this time.

The film, rather than attack Christ, attacks Christianity. It never mocks what Jesus says or does, only the foolish things said and done by those who worship Jesus (often while conveniently ignoring much that Jesus said). In short, this movie attacks the narrow-minded, unimaginative, hostile mess much of Christianity has become, rather than the very compassionate, admirable ideal Christianity was intended (and still claims) to be.

Those who are squeamish about religious satire should probably avoid this movie, but for anyone worried by the rise of Christian Fascism in America, you couldn't find a better vehicle for dissent than this insightful and roaringly funny movie. \\"Brian\\" is born next to and at the same time as Christ, and his life experience, as he attempts to make sense of Roman oppression and the Jewish resistance, parallels those of Jesus.

Only a bit less tears-rolling-down-your-cheeks funny than Monty Python and The Holy Grail (to this reviewer), The Life of Brian is a must-see for history buffs or students of religion with a sense of humor, anyone who appreciates a bit of creative lunacy, and aspiring Python fans everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Python at their Sacriligious Best!","review":"Jesus,watch out!

The extras included on the criterion dvd are well worth the higher cost. Perhaps the modern day Christian pharisees wrapped in their smug self righteousness will find this movie offensive or sacreligous, but do these Holy rollers watch movies anyway? If you haven't seen it, you should. This movie and \\"The Holy Grail\\" are two of the comedy classics of the late 20th century. Too bad they cut out the scenes with Otto.

I think the movies political attacks are about the time of Jesus, not about Jesus himself. Jesus only makes two appearences, once as a baby, and the other when he's giving his sermon on the mount. In this scene, Jesus has nothing to do with the action, he's just the background character as the rest of them get into arguments (very funny by the way). As I said, most jokes are aimed at the times. For example, there is a scene where a man is getting stoned for uttering the name of the Lord, and it just gets incredibly silly.In conclusion, I'd just like to say that all of the people that I've met that find the movie offensive, haven't actually seen it. That includes all of the protesters who were marching for a boycott. Go ahead and watch it, if you think you'd like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've only watched it once (so far) but...","review":"This is the first DVD I purchased for my new DVD player, and I watched it this weekend for the first time. I'd read all the reviews here and figured I'd like it, since I like humor and have always adored John Cleese. Before I got my DVD, I tried to rent it at the video store, but they didn't have it (they did, however, have a lot of other MP videos). So that spurred me to purchase the DVD, and I'm glad it did. The picture was very clear. I know I'll have to watch it again because I missed a lot. I loved the \\"Biggus Dickus\\" scene, and the Roman grammar lesson, and the stoning scene was hilarious. I would recommend this film to anyone with a sense of humor.

Christ is portrated quite respectfully but it is nevertheless an attack on religion and particularly on Christianity. It covers itself from outright blasphemy by subtle, lawyer-like strategems but, nevertheless, if you think Christiainty is a force for good in the world it is enemy work, part of the cheap, smart low-mindedness which seems a predominant feature of modern culture.The space-battle scene is hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"WE ALL HATED THIS MOVIE!","review":"I have liked other Python films, but this? BLECH! The whole family was bored to tears. (and yes, we DO have a sense of humor!) The funniest thing was the space ship because it was so unexpected.

The Lumberjack song? The Parrot Sketch? The Holy Grail? All good choices, but I suggest Life of Brian, Monty Python's most consistently funny effort.The movie is laugh-out-loud funny for newcomers, but with plenty of almost subliminal jokes that can only be fleshed out with repeated viewings. And repeated viewings are a pleasure with the new Criterion Edition. The transfer is pristine and the extras will keep even the most seasoned Python fans busy for days. There really is no reason NOT to own this disc.The movie itself is classic Python; dead-on satire of religious fanaticism (not of religion, as some would suggest) plus the best comedic ending since \\"Some Like it Hot.\\" If your friends don't understand the inherent humor in \\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,\\" it's time to find new friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monty Python's Life of Brian","review":"This is quite simply the funniest, most thought provoking and best movie of the entire Monty Python collection. What other group would give you a movie with political intrigue, religious persecution, Roman Centurions and aliens battling in outer space? If you like slightly (?) irreverant humor that merciless fun at people's ability to believe in absolutely anything, then this is your movie. The religious naysayers who pan this movie because they believe it makes fun of Jesus either haven't seen the movie or just weren't paying attention. This movie gets funnier every time you watch it. Warning: this movie makes your sides hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, baaaaaaaaaad extras.","review":"First off the movie was excellent and the acting (as always) was superb but the only problem I have with it is that THERE ARE NO EXTRAS! They say that there are extras but all they are are the Theatrical Trailers and the Python bios! I only spent [a little money] for the DVD so I can't complain too much. That is the only problem I have with the DVD. If you do not like your children to see wee wees and pee pees then don't watch this with them. There is full frontal male nudity (about time) and full frontal female nudity (nothing new). If you have a blasphimus sence of humor you will enjoy this movie very much.

Those who didn't see it, and protested anyway, were only improving the film by giving proof that its central theme of the stupidity of blind faith (and I'm sorry you religious Python fans - but that IS the point of this movie - it is a powerful atheist tract) was 100% accurate.Fantatic piece of work. immensely funny, Graham Chapman's finest hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controversial?","review":"With by far the majority raving over this trite and predictably British schoolyard humour since its release, I would hardly ever have called it 'controversial'.Seems the vocal Christians were surprisingly mum over this one.

She spent it saying \\"When do I laugh?\\" my wife says much the same, since her parents bought me the DVD for Christmas. there's no way to make anybody but an afficionado see what's so screamingly funny about this movie. It's better than their other movie, \\"Holy Grail,\\"--and that was a darn good flick! and how do you not like the closing song, \\"Always Look on the bright side of life.\\" I try to remember, after a brutal work week, that \\"Life's a piece of s--t, when you look at it,\\" as Eric Idle sings in the song. this is money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blasphemously Funny","review":"A very different interpretation on the life of Jesus, we here follow the life of Brian who by pure accident becomes the messiah despite him being a very naughty boy (according to his mother).The only thing I can compare this movie to would be Aristophanes' \\"The Clouds\\".

It can be viewed as just a funny movie, but for those of us who like some depth there is also a message (namely what idiots humans can be).But what makes this a great DVD are the extras. Two (that is 2) commentaries, deleted scenes (with commentary (just one though)) and a documentary made during the making of LoB. All of these are a joy to watch/listen to. Most of the commentaries are the pythons reminiscing and telling stories which in my opinion make the best commentaries. In a word: yummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, lousy sound","review":"I love Life of Brian. It is one of the wittiest movies I know. But the sound quality on the DVD (the $9.99 version, not the Criterion version) is appalling.

Don't buy this version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"extra features make this DVD all the better","review":"The Life of Brian DVD is a veritable treasure trove of extra features which make this worth buying even if you already have the videotape. Five deleted scenes with commentary (admittedly poor quality, as they were rescued from a working tape), a Python documentary, and two audio commentary tracks can keep you busy for days. One comment on one of the tracks during Graham Chapman's \\"full monty\\" scene is worth the price of the DVD. You'll be yelling \\"Props!\\" for years afterwards ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, bad copy","review":"I don't know what the story is with the Criterion Collection, but this is another mediocre transfer of a great movie. The sound goes in and out, the picture looks like it was doused in bleach, the cigarette burns (the dots that tell the projectionist when to change reels) are still on the print. And the extras aren't all that hot.The movie itself is, of course, outstanding. Satirical and hysterical. Although it has been labelled as blasphemous by many who haven't seen it, it shouldn't really offend anyone. This is another one of those Python films you'll be quoting endlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear!","review":"This book by John Noe develops some strange doctrines. One of his main arguments is that this world on which we live will never end. The earth will last for all eternity.He also teaches that the resurrection of believers promised in the Bible is a current spiritual resurrection. No one will ever be physically resurrected.For a helpful critique of the false doctrines in this book and in this Hyper-preterist movement, see Keith Mathison, \\"When Shall These Things Be?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't see the forest for the trees","review":"Wow! Here we go again: another theological movement being steered by untrained Bible enthusiasts. In the Preface it is noted that Noe (a motivational speaker by training) has never attended a theological seminary to study theology, biblical languages, church history, and so forth. And his book proves it!His main point in this book is to claim that ALL Bible prophecy was fulfilled in the first century and that the earth will last forever. He even recommends a new holiday to celebrate the Second Coming of Christ -- which in his view occurred in the first century: Parousia Day. Too bad the church has missed this opportunity for 2000 years.This new movement is quite a worrisome innovation. For more information, I recommend seeing Mathison's \\"When Shall These Things Be?\\" which is also available from Amazon.comTo Noe I say: Thanks. But no thanks. Come back with your innovative ideas AFTER you have taken some theological training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"If you like to see people playing around with theology this might be the book for you. But if you hate to see people wading in over their heads, stay clear.This is very disappointing work. Although the author makes dramatic claims to being a theologian, his writing actually betrays him as a novice.I can see why this book was not published by a major, reputable publisher: it is absurd through and through. Read some of the reviews below to get a sense of the disappointing argument of this book.Noe actually believes Christ's second coming was in the first century, that earth history will NEVER end (in fact, this seems to be a major point of this book), that Christians should not expect a future resurrection from the dead, and many other errors.If you are looking for helpful material on prophetic issues, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange doctrine","review":"This was an alarming book promoting some strange doctrines. Mr. Noe believes the earth will last forever and that Jesus returned invisibly in his Second Advent in A.D. 70.He also believes that this complex of new doctrines is helping to establish a \\"New Reformation.\\" He believes that Christianity has been mistaken about the basic doctrines of the Bible for 2000 years.And he sets himself before as one who can straighten things out. If this is what Christian doctrine is all about, I don't want any part of it.We have too many \\"prophecy experts\\" among us. Away with this man. We will not have him to reign over us! After reading Noe, Tim LaHaye seems to make sense (but only by comparison).I would pass on this volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naive book","review":"This book is one of the most naive and silly attempts at theology that I have ever read. The author stumbles over biblical theology while attempting to thrash out a new theology.The Hyper-Preterism he represents believes the earth is everlasting, the second coming of Christ has already occurred, Christians will not be physically resurrected, and more!He recommends having a new holy day: in September to celebrate the destruction of the Jewish temple.Steer clear of this hodge-podge of would-be theology. I recommend Keith Mathison's \\"When Shall These Things Be?\\" as an antidote to the strange doctrines promoted in Noe's book. R. C. Sprouls' \\"The Last Days According to Jesus\\" also corrects the excesses of this new theology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, disappointing","review":"This is pop-theological book. It is based on some rather strange views of Scripture. The main point of the book is to try to prove that the earth we live on will last forever, because Christ has already come again (in 70 A.D.!).

But it could be so many things (reader, card, port, processor, operating system, drivers) that I don't know which is to blame here.The only problem I had was that after updating my firmware in XP (as suggested by SanDisk website), I could not use the reader with Windows Vista.

The second time however, the reader's light did not light up, did not recgonize the memory card. It would not eject from my computer.

I don't think I can return the product either because it came in \\"blister pack\\" but I'll try anyway. It really bothers me when the package of a product itself has Mac icons all over it, but then has no actual compatibility or even driver downloads.So, nothing against the product itself.

The enemy has a serious advantage in this game because if you get shot once you you wil lose control of your guy so they can shoot you again, in an endles cycle until you die because the have full auto weapons.OVERALL: This game sucks.

You have to skulk around and save all the time because at any minute, a shot could ring out and you're dead. The field is really big and it takes a long time to cover it and kill the bad guys. While this is brutally realistic, for me, it's boring. I bought this to have fun. Second, it doesn't look good. Again, it's painfully realistic. It's in olive drab and brown. Last, the interface to control your team is a pain in the _ss. I only played this for about an hour and sold it to a friend.

I'll get this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game but frustrating","review":"I've always been a Tom Clancy game and I like the planning missions out beforehand approach. However, it gets frustrating at times when u get shot in the head and thus taken out after just one shot. There were several times when I almost broke a controller playin this game.

But the graphics (particularly for environment) are unacceptably poor, even archaic by most standards. heavy pixelation, poorly designed and applied textures, and chunky modelling blend to form a GUI that is both tiresome to look at and difficult to use. Which is sad because this game should be the standard for realism by which other FPS games are judged. Instead, it's hard to take it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"VooDoo Owners Need not apply.","review":"If you own a 3DFX VooDoo video board, you should not buy this game.This game may be fun, but that only counts if it runs and you can see it.

No charging through levels and beating it the first time. More like attempting the same level a dozen times before getting it perfect (for me anyway).

You can make it through levels having lost some of the team members, but since the guys aquire skills with each level passed, letting them get killed off is out of the question for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red stormed","review":"Well . i don't own this anymore.A great game , but it and the rest of Clancey's game ware out after time, I play the R6 games and Splinter cell , but even they get a bit boring and well the graphics are a bit old, but not bad.I how ever haven't played Vages or the newer GR games yet , so I'll review them next.over all it's a descent play .Be sure to check out CTGossamers , coming in 2008 , were I'll review games for PC and PS2 and as soon as I get a Ps3 or 360 .

I think the price was lower than average due to it being a new scent. I have noticed the prices have gone up. Try it you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Quite disappointed with this album. Although the artists are all top notch, the renditions are poor at best. Aretha's should have been a gospel flavor, not the disco beat used. By listend to many of the tracks, I would guess that they were recorded in the late seventies."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many maps, so little time","review":"I ordered this for my 5 year old daughter because the price was right. But, I was happily surprised by how thorough and lovely the pictures are. The beginning of the book contains a comprehensive section on how to read maps, and explains how a map can represent different information (climate, politics, terrain). Each continent also had photographs of the people, and natural formations that are identified with it. That was nice!But, all cannot be perfect alas. Many of the maps span two pages, to make it larger I presume. However, and this is REALLY annoying, you cannot see what is in the crease between the two pages! The United States is missing parts of it, Africa is bisected at the Congo. I would rather Nat'l Geographic had made each map a fold-out. I guess there would have been a chance that it would eventually get ripped out, but at least you can see the whole area being shown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Value, Comfortable and Cozy Sleeping Bag","review":"This is a great value buy. As a down sleeping bag, it's 2 lbs and very compressible. This comes with a nice little bag to store the sleeping bag. This is for someone who decides to camp only during the fall, spring or summer and want to be able to move around a little instead of those mummy bags that can feel claustrophobic. It is made of durable quality material that keeps you warm. It also works for couples who want to get cozy together as you can combine a right with a left zip bag! However, you can zip 2 of the same right sides or 2 of the same left sides with no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheels came off taking the cars out of the box","review":"I echo the comments of the other reviewer. The wheels on 3 of the cars came off while taking the train out of its carton. The wheels are not removable which means the cars were rendered unuseable. This item is poorly made.

It was obvious that here was a man with such technical excellence and passion that the formation of The Retaliation was bound to grab the attention of the British blues fans, and he did big time. Shame that he only made 2 albums with his band. This is the second one and although diverse and compelling in it's lyrical and musical delivery, the first simply called \\"The Ansley Dunbar Retaliation\\" was a masterpiece and still shines in the cosmos of British blues. So where is it?Anyway back to this album. The slow sultry voice of Victor Brox matches even the greatest blues singers in tone and feeling.

Although technically brilliant, I think Milstein stands out above the rest because--how best to put this?--because he loves every single note, and beautiful ones that Heifetz and Szerzyng for some reason speed past Milstein lifts up with exquisite care and tenderness to show us how sublime. In my book, Bach never had a better interpreter than Milstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly","review":"Imagine hearing this recording of Nathan Milstein playing Bach's Chaconne over the sound system of the San Francisco Opera House! The San Francisco Ballet used this recording for the piece \\"Artifact Suite\\" for Muriel Maffre's Farewell Gala on May 6, 2007.

I take Flonase, which used to work great but now doesn't keep me from getting the cold initially, and I used to love Zyrtek's nasal swabs but those are now off the market. I always do saline nasal rinses when I feel a cold coming on, and that helps a lot but doesn't always keep me off the antibiotics either.I got a sore throat on Tuesday and since everyone I know has been sick over the last month, I knew my time was here. I took some probiotics and the \\"intensive\\" dose of System Well, three in the morning and three at night, every day, and now it's Sunday and I feel all better.

I ended up purchasing the Nature's Way SystemWell plus a couple other highly rated products. the Nature's Way SystemWell is by far my favorite.

The audio quality of the phone is tinny, fades in and out, and it is almost impossible to have a conversation on it. The radio is also tinny. I've had better radio sound way back in the 1950's with a Japanese plastic transistor radio strapped to the visor of my Ford convertible. You can't really tune the radio to any degree of accuracy, as the tuning wheel is stiff and difficult to use. The light for the clock only comes on when a button is pushed, then immediately goes off again. You can't just roll over, open one eye and see what time it is. Very user unfriendly. After one week, I unplugged this unit and put it on a shelf in the garage. If I had the original box, I'd send it back to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad but too much static","review":"Most people complain that the alarm clock is not always lit, but I am glad about that because I like my room dark.

Crispin gives us a look at 50's British film and the people that worked in the industry. There are lots of surprises in store in this book. This is the first time I've read a book featuring criminologist Gervaise Fen. In this book an unexplained suicide of a young girl sets Fen and Inspector Humbleby on the trail of a particularly crafty murderer who is leaving enough bodies around to fill frequent hearses. This is an intelligently written book, and it certainly kept me turning pages.

She is equally adept with a tender ballad from the swing era like, \\"Sunday Kind of Love,\\" but she can also get down and dirty, searing through \\"Baby, What Do Want Me To Do\\" with a bluesy growl. Other songs, such as \\"Something's Got A Hold On Me,\\" show off her gospel roots. Unfortunately, some of the material on the album, such as \\"Losers Weepers,\\" and \\"Two Sides To Every Story,\\" sound extremely dated and not of particularly high quality. Though there are some exceptions, James generally sounds best on ballads, such as \\"At Last,\\" \\"Fool That I Am,\\" and \\"I'd Rather Go Blind.\\" She employs a silky smooth delivery but then suddenly explodes with roof-raising passion, and making the songs both surprising and memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as scary as you would think.","review":"This book was a nice collection of short stories, but not as scary as you would think it would be. The reviews make is seem hard to put down. But it wasn't hard at all. There were one or two stories that were creepy. But as a whole, I was dissapointed. I didn't like the way that the author presented the stories either. It was confusing. He didn't introduce the person he got the story from well. His comments on each story, written in italics, and with too many ellipsis marks were overdone...I don't need to have the author's voice try to scare me as I read. If it is a good story, it will do that naturally. I wouldn't label this book as a waste of money, because it goes on my shelf with the rest of my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Next Door","review":"I would recommend this book. A book of short stories that I haden't read anywhere else. Easy to dismiss a ghost story as being at least part of the imagination, when told by just one person, but these stories came from all walkes of life and are told by people of all ages. Very believeable stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ghost Next Door: True Stories of Paranormal Encounters from Everyday People","review":"AAA+++ very clear straight to point book doesnt go on an on with jibber AAA+++"},{"rating":"2","title":"haunted house","review":"I read anything I can find related to ghost stories. I really enjoyed this book. Fast and easy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chef's night off.","review":"I'm beginning to feel that I have just had a terrible meal at a restaurant that everyone else has raved about! Try as I may, I could not get through Jane Hamilton's recent book without struggling through every chapter. I found the plot rather thin and for the most part, boring. There were countless times when I put the book down for the final time. A few memorable sentences held my attention, but for the most part I did not find the writing to be of the standard I expect from this author. I have finished- and just as I thought, the dessert did not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same author?","review":"Judging by the reviews, this is a book that readers either really like or really don't like. Count me in into the latter group. I have been a Hamilton fan since \\"Map of the World,\\" but I was very disappointed in this book. The characters were not realistic, despite an intriguing and viable premise. In my opinion, the adolescent son's voice was stilted and the parents were both too weak to inspire the readers' empathy or interest. I didn't like any of the characters and forced myself to finish the book, hoping for a meaningful resolution, which didn't come. I hope Jane Hamilton will get back on track with her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disobedience Disappoints","review":"I have read other novels by Jane Hamilton which I liked; so I was excited to see this one. But I was very disappointed. Actually, I didn't finish the novel. It started to bog down about half way through and I didn't really care enough about the characters to finish. I just could not relate to the main character and the others did not seem real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family life","review":"Jane Hamilton takes us within another Midwestern family through the eyes of Henry, the older son. It is written as a memory of his senior year in high school from the perspective of an adult. We see his pain, anger and confusion over his mother's affair. She is commuting from Chicago to Wisconsin to be with her violinist lover.Henry is navigating through his senior year in high school in urban Chicago after the family has spent his earlier years in rural Vermont. His younger sister, Elvira, is a hard core Civil War re-en actor who is passing as a boy with her fellow soldiers. His father is a history teacher, whose unflagging optimism, Henry finds galling. His mother is a talented pianist who is making beautiful music with N Ukrainian violinist in Wisconsin.Henry observes his mother's affair through reading her e-mails which he prints and keeps for posterity.Ultimately it's the dynamics of relationships and what holds a family together that makes this an interesting and satisfying novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly detached","review":"Being a huge Jane Hamilton fan, I have to admit I was disappointed with Disobedience, in no small part to the detached, third-party view of the characters through the eyes of Henry, a world-weary and not terribly insightful teenager (which in my opinion, he should be, if he is going to be telling the story). I also found quite tedious the numerous ways Henry refers to his mother, ranging from \\"mom\\" to \\"Mrs. Shaw\\" to \\"Beth\\" to her \\"Liza38\\", her e-mail screen name. These references are used interchangeably and frequently, using up to three of these monikers in a single paragraph! Not sure what the point is of this particular literary device. I never really understood the motivations of any of the characters, thus could not sympathize with them. Also, events in the book evolve without a sense of how much time has elapsed between them, so context is lost. Would have appreciated at least alternating chapters in different characters voices to get their perspective on events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disliked most of the characters","review":"I've always enjoyed Jane Hamilton's books and still think she's a gifted writer, but had to force myself to finish this book. The main character's voice isn't remotely believable for a 17-year-old, then 20-something-year-old young man. His use of \\"Mrs. Shaw,\\" \\"my mother,\\" \\"Liza,\\" \\"Beth,\\" etc. etc. etc. for his mother is likely a metaphor for a life lesson, but I found it extremely mannered and annoying. Why change her name 8 times in one paragraph?Absolutely detested the Elvira character--also totally unbelievable for a 13-year-old. I never found myself warming to her and was quite unmoved by her \\"ordeal.\\" His father was never anything more than a vague presence, which is possibly the point.The basic premise is a great one and could've been a thought-provoking, insightful, more enjoyable read without the self-conscience intellectualizing and the Civil War obsession."},{"rating":"1","title":"The First Book I haven't Finished Since The Golden Notebook","review":"Did Jane Hamilton (one of my all-time favorite authors) really write this book?? I agree with a previous review: \\"Who cares?\\" I thought the story line was potentially interesting, but really bought the book based on Jane Hamilton's name. I am throwing in the towel after 150 boring pages...anxious to get on with the rest of my summer reading list and, hopefully, something with a little more reason to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"By no means this author's best work","review":"Having considered Map of the World one of the best books I have ever read, and having considered Book of Ruth a very unique and special book, I could not believe this book was even written by Jane Hamilton. The narrator seemed to accurately describe the other family members without really caring about them. (Is his detatchment supposed to be proof that he is adolescent?). After observing his mother's affair electronically, he seemed to have learned nothing from the experience, and come to no realizations afterwards. Most of the events in this character's life were isolated and without any theme or connection to a \\"point\\". A brief conversation with his mother at the book's end was supposed to suffice as a conclusion. I finished this book feeling totally disappointed and dissatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamilton's best so far","review":"I've read other Jane Hamilton books and enjoyed them to a point--this one, however, is a tremendously good read! It captured my attention immediately and it was one of those books you just can't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless teen angst bores me","review":"A story of teen angst and adultery. I couldn't identify with the characters, I found the writing excessively self-indulgent, and I didn't enjoy the story. I wish I had the hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Mediocrity","review":"At first glance, this book may appear intruguing. At second glance it may entice you into picking it up and exploring. The superficial attraction you may have to the characters; to the seemingly \\"intricate\\" family plot. It is only at your third eyeing that the book seeps into a soppy, sit-comish, bland story line. Very, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring boring boring","review":"less than one star, actually. Could not even manage to get to page 100 - which is my minimum. I refuse to waste time reading boring drivel when there are so many good books to be discovered and so little time to read them. I bought this hoping for another 'map of the world.' i probably should have known better since i didn't finish her last book either. i agree with a previous reviewer about the narrator's voice sounding inauthenthic. the civil war daughter was a silly and boring distraction. the father - less than one dimensional. nothing ever happened. there was no there, there! Though I LOVED a map of the world, it was clearly an anomoly in hamilton's body of work. will not bother with her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"Why all the stars for Disobedience? I was excited to begin Hamilton's new book since I have loved all her previous novels. But this one is flat, flat, flat. Dumb plot, unbelievable characters except for Elvira who is more quirky than real. Somehow I canot believe in Henry even though he is writing about all this 10 years after. Miss Hamilton's writing can be arresting and it is for fear that I will miss a beautiful string of words that I am plodding slowly and painfully to the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"disobedience=disapointment","review":"This is the first time that I have read anything by Hamilton. Maybe it just takes some getting used to, but there seemed to be pages of rambling that had nothing to do with the core of the tale. I found myself continuing to read the novel soley to finish it, not because I was consumed by the story line. While the book was readable, it was a struggle to finish the 176 pages that seemed to lead nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I have read all of Hamilton's other books and loved them, so I was disappointed when I had to force myself to get through this laborious book. None of the characters were likable, nor was the story line exciting enough to keep my interest sustained. The story had potential had the relationships between mother and son, mother and lover, and mother and father been more developed, but I was left wanting more dialogue, more confrontation, instead of listening to the son prattle on and on about his adolescent angst. If you're a Hamilton fan, wait for the paperback version or get it from your library - save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is the first Jane Hamilton book I have ever read. I received Disobedience as a Christmas gift this year. Since I see the person who gave it to me (who wanted to read it herself)everyday, I knew that she would be watching me to see if I read it. I really tried to like it. Hamilton is undoubtly a talented writer, now if she only had something to write about. There are few books that I can't finish, unfortunately this is one of them. If I had to sum up my feelings for this book in one word it would be: BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"disfuntional family","review":"This book was boring, I couldn't become interested in it, the characters, the story and everything else about it. I liked the 'Book of Ruth' and 'Map of the World', but this was just uninteresting. The characters were unlikable, the bossy mother-in-law who held her money over the family, the incompetent father who was ineffective with his family, his high school students and with life in general.Then there was the wife and mother who had an affair and her nosy son who found about it when working on her computer. There was Elvira who hated being a girl and bonded with her father as both liked Civil War Enactments. I struggled through the book and finished it though it was difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gifted writer","review":"I loved every paragraph of this book. The Shaws are an All-American, intellectually and musically gifted dysfunctional family and absolutely rang true to me through Henry's sharp wit. Jane Hamilton's \\"Book of Ruth\\" was a disturbing, powerful book about a poor, uneducated family unraveling to a terrible end. \\"Disobedience\\" is also about family relationships yet could not be more different than that earlier book, demonstrating, to me, Jane Hamilton's incredible range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that useful","review":"I had high expectations when I purchased this CD.

The Berlin Philharmonic, under the direction of Igor Markevitch, is in top form on the 3rd and 4th Symphonies by lesser known composer Franz Berwald. These are very unconventional, yet fully satisfying romantic works. Schubert's Symphony No. 4 is altogether more recognizable piece, and it is the perfect fit after the Berwald symphonies. The recordings are in mono (from 1955) but they are first rate. Finally, the CD logs in at almost 80 minutes, so you get a lot of value for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute - For Witches, not Wiccans","review":"I saw this book at Barnes & Nobles and thought it was funny. I like little books even if they aren't very practical. I am amused by the \\"don't buy this\\" comments from some reviewers. First of and foremost - all Witches are NOT wiccan. Witchcraft and wicca are NOT the same thing. Life is not all love and light and positive. Sometimes it's painful, seething anger, and darkness.

Witchcraft and Wicca is a deep and rich spiritual tradition based on the principles of nature. We do acknowledge, accept and use natural forces that many call magic.

I think you can see that Mr Marsh doesn't actually state that the Riga murders were made by the Galician Division and that you are the fool for thinking this. The Galician division was a bunch of murderous butchers like the rest of the SS. This book tries to make a positive case for them and it is unsurprising as it was written by the son of one of their members. Members of the Galician Division were not charged with any war crimes after the war and many of them settled in the United Kingdom, as did Michael Melnyk's father, but this does not mean that they didn't commit any atrocities. At the end of the Second World War many people escaped prosecution in an attempt to merely move onwards much like the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa after the fall of apartheid. No-one would would assume that certain white South African police officers were not responsible for brutal crimes merely because they weren't charged."},{"rating":"1","title":"NAZI APOLOGIST","review":"It's no surprise to find out that Michael Melnyk's father was in the Galician Division of the Waffen SS.

In my attempt to fix it (with a knife, really poor choice on my part) I ended up stabbing myself in the hand 7 days before my pole competition. So. Not. Awesome. But I did end up fixing the shoe. Or so I thought. the night of my competition, the exact same thing happened, to BOTH shoes. Thank the sweet Lord someone happened to have a pair of pliers, so I could fix the shoes. It was an easy fix, but it's also an easy thing to do correctly when the shoe is made in the first place.

Size 8 usually fits me perfectly in every shoe so I got these in size 8. The front toe area of the shoe is so wide that my toes hang off the edge of the front of the shoes. Maybe if the toe opening had been a bit more narrow, it might have improved the way they feel on my feet. Size 8 is not exactly big enough and a size 9 would've been way too huge. A half size probably would've been perfect in these. The fit is just really awkward.

There are some flashback scenes that delve into the Daryl character's past...abuse and such leading to her being a hit woman, I guess. Save your time and money.

Alongside of collaborator Phoenix Orion, Canibus towers above the mainstream rapping crews that were part of his very own mix tape drama. Years ago LL Cool J invited Canibus to appear on one of his posse tracks, \\"4321\\", and after a silly comment about one of LL's tattoos, LL dissed him and left him off of the track and feuded with him for a while.

I love that you can program from 3 to 7 press combos, and each press can be any combination of all four numbers. I also have a smaller Bulldog vault, and its buttons are much stiffer and lack the handprint shape, making it harder to use at an awkward under bed angle in the dark, when you'd usually use this. Also, Bulldog makes you use a five button combo with one button per press, limiting its combo options compared to this model. Bulldog's fit and finish of the door might be a tiny bit tighter, but I don't think either model is designed to keep out a determined thief with tools. To keep loved ones from having accidents or slow down a thief, both models are great. To get you in fast at night in the dark, I like this one's design with the handprint and easier button press a little better. So far, it has worked perfectly. Will update if this changes.

The story reads like a mystery, but from the beginning, you know Santiago is going to be killed, so it is not so much a mystery as it is a puzzle.

It's well written, but it's about an idiot caught up in a land of idiots. Supposedly, it's a honor killing. But he's just an idiot. I suppose that entering the mind of an idiot can be interesting, but we don't enter idiot's mind. We just watch the idiot mindlessly act like an idiot. 2 stars for style, 0 stars for content. A real disappointment after the great One Hundred Years of Solitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Plot, Poor Writing","review":"I felt like the plot of this book was interesting enough. I always like a good story about a murder. However, I was not impressed by Marquez's writing style. I felt that the book was really too...short or fast paced, which made the book much more difficult to read. If the book was just a little longer, and Marquez took a chance to tell the story much more slowly, then I wouldn't have had so many problems with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh..

My students love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a good intro to Marquez.","review":"Someone offered this to me as an intro to GGMarquez. I loved the book. It's short and engrossing. You feel like you've read a great big book in 2 hours. I then moved on to 100Years and discovered that Chronicle is not typical of GGM. Still love GGM, but be warned, this one is different.

This book is a short and brutal rollarcoaster ride of events leading up to the enevitable fall in the end. I read this book in about 2 hours, and when I was finished I couldnt believe it. It is amazing! I have since read it about 6 or 7 times, but the story has so much it is still new. A definite must read for everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively, colorful and engaging","review":"This book by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is different from his other books. On the surface, it's a thriller, in the middle of which is a homicide. Supposedly, a very ordinary story, expect for one small detail. The ending of the story is well known from the first sentence. The murderers tell everyone in the village about their intention to murder Santiago Nasar. Soon enough, the rumor spreads around and the entire village knows about it. And yet, despite the widespread awareness in the village of the Vicario brothers' plan to murder Nasar, he is still murdered. This is a very witty and full of humor of book. Marquez's writing is very lively and lucid, and ought to be enjoyed by any of Marquez's fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS BOOK!","review":"I have to say this is one of my favorite books! Gabriel Garcia did such an amazing job writing this story. The style and narrative structure is astounding. I highly recommend this book to all of my friends who are looking for a good read. It is not long, but with its clever content, it does it justice! No need for a bad book with 400 words when you can have a great story in under 200. If you like mystery, drama, and suspense, then this book is good for you. I especially like the documentary style narrative structure. This really impressed me to write this way and deliver so well inside of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard-to-put-down novel","review":"This novel is certainly written by an author who had full control of his story. It is an easy read, once you get passed the character's names, and you soon realise that you've been caught up in a delima which puts the question back on to the reader-what would I have done in this situation?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic social drama","review":"Marquez creates the appearance of a murder mystery, when, in fact, he is writing a social drama. I think the novel's true protagonists are the Vicario brothers, who give society countless opportunities to stop them, and who desire to be free of their social obligation to avenge their sister's disgrace. The Vicario brothers are not the murderers of Santiago Nasar--the villagers who collectively ignore the brothers' warnings are. This is Marquez's ultimate message in this book--Nasar was killed by society, not the Vicario brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie","review":"I love this movie but the dvd was not made from an original tape of the movie.It would not play on my dvd player.

Camp it up people!!!!! This tries too hard to be BBC-esque, which is fine I love a good BBC production, but my goodness this was produced in the 80's, the last decade of the fun, enjoyable mini series and this one ended the decade on a sour note in my opinion, I've watched the first disc and doubt I will continue on...SNOOZEFEST!Lest we forget the acting, Claudette Colbert is outstanding, Ann Margaret is fine, but Stephen Collins better thank the Lord every day that he is gorgeous because at least in this movie, he CANNOT act his way out of a wet paper bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"I enjoyed this movie as well as Ann Margret fan.

But those facts don't jade my review. Story too short and predictable? Maybe, but Disney did so many clever things with this sequel, that they're difficult to recount here...the clever work with shadows early in the movie; the brief \\"re-telling\\" of the original story by Tink as she's scanning the clouds; recreating the voice inflections; great soundtrack...all first rate stuff. I miss the Indians (my favorites in the original), but they are paid their tribute as well. But the best work is the animation...Lilo and Stitch has been given raves for it's retro look, but this stuff REALLY nails the classic 50's Disney style, with great 3-D camera work, lush backgrounds and for a knock-off Disney sequel, well-drawn character depth...Buy it, own it, and shed a tear for a more innocent day gone by...the Pan lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"My niece loves it, so that's good enough for me","review":"I have to admit, I barely watched this sequel to Peter Pan, but had purchased it for my two-year old niece, who loves the Disney original. From the second the animation began, she was clapping and giggling and her interest was held for the full 73 minutes. She cried in some parts as well, but mainly just loved to see her familiar Peter Pan friends in a new adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"No faith, no trust, and little pixie-dust...","review":"When my son first saw Peter Pan, he almost wet himself with laughter. He was completely in the spell of the story, and was delighted from beginning to end. When I showed him this sequel on DVD, however, he spent most of the hour or so with an anticipatory look on his face that was rarely rewarded. On the few occasions something halfway funny happened, he looked at me as if to say, \\"Was that funny?\\"You can't fool a five year old. This film [stank]. It had no faith in any aspect of it's story, and was painfully self conscience about not being \\"racist\\" like the original.The music was too modern; a hodge-podge of old movie scores...oooh so magical! Avoid this dud like the plague!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen to the magic?","review":"This cartoon was nothing like the first one. It was Disney's attempt to make money. I did everthing I could to stay awake. I am so disappointed with movies lately. I mean, instead of a crocodile, they have a giant squid. Their was no magic adventure. Peter Pan was a great cartoon, Return to Neverland was stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MUSIC DOES NOT FIT THE MOVIE","review":"This is a good follow up to Peter Pan story but the songs employed -- the style and the singers - are for today and do not fit with the movie. The story takes place during WWII and in the timeless Neverland. The songs, and the singers, are blatantly comptemporary. Even the closing theme does not match the movie. I was VERY disappointed with this feature. If it were not for this inconsistency, I would have rated this movie five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it worth returning to Never Land?","review":"Disney's most recent direct-to-video sequels aren't very entertaining. Sure, most of them are entertaining to youngsters, but for us older kids and parents; it's not even worth buying or RENTING from a video store! I was afraid that Disney's Return to Neverland would turn out bad; like all the other Disney sequels. All I thought it would be was another Disney failure, just in the theaters. Since I'm real interested in history (especially World War II), I decided to test Disney's knowledge of World War II in \\"Return to Neverland\\", and actually, it was pretty accurate! When Hook's ship was flying through London, with the air raids and the planes, it makes it look like you are right there flying!Some of the animation isn't the best, but it's very good for a Disney sequel. I thought that Disney made this sequel a LOT better! I really recommend it!When \\"Return to Neverland\\" comes out on Video/DVD, I'm going to buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD","review":"This dvd arrived on time and brand new!

And of course the movie was great. Had no problem buying froma 2nd party"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible sequal","review":"This movie was a poor excuse for a sequal. It sounds like they did not even try to find voices that sounded at least a little like the original characters voices. Hook was just about the only one who sounded close! Also, Disney could have kept the music like in the first one instead of using the upbeat stuff that did not fit in. Neverland looked completely different, and they didn't even show the Indians. They used too much computer animation. It is not even worth renting. I would save my money for something else if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather short with little plot","review":"I'm not really a fan of the old Disney \\"classics\\" (Dumbo, Peter Pan, stuff like that), because I find them a little bit boring. This was done in that style, so of course, I didn't like it much. The start is sort of interesting, as it takes place during WWII in London, when the children are being sent to the country. But after that, it sort of becomes plotless and short, and rehashes a lot from the original \\"Peter Pan\\". At least it's appropriate for children, though. So, if you really like those old animated Disney films, you'll probably like this. But if you don't, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disgrace","review":"Peter Pan was a great escapist moie for little kids, this tripe is another example of Disney bastardizing its franchise with direct to video movies using beloved characters. The tone of the beggining of the movies is bleak as London is experiencing the blitz. The interaction of the characters later is a pale reflection of the original movie. The cartoons on the Disney channel are a better view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not go over well","review":"No where near the original, kids were bored after 20 mins and we had to put the original in. Rent it, don't buy it, they will never watch it again"},{"rating":"1","title":"War, Bombs and Family Abandonment","review":"My 4-1/2 year old daughter begged for this movie, but we never made it past the first 10 minutes of the film. First I had to explain what war was, then bombs (thanks, Disney, for the uplifting family values). I kept hoping we'd get to something enjoyable soon and wondering why so many Disney movies have such negative story lines. But when my daugher realized that the children were being sent away WITHOUT THEIR FAMILIES, much to her horror, she screamed for me to stop the tape. I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"dosen't add up.","review":"The 1st Peter Pan took place during Edwardian England.(1910s. Before WWI).

This is beyond junk, its on the verge of being untouchable waste. As far as Disney sequels go, this one ranks with Cinderella 2 and Air Buddies. I wouldn't even recommend showing this to a baby that has no ability to understand bad movies from good movies, because this will teach them to enjoy nothing of value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Military Fam hated it!","review":"I have a sweet 5 year old girl and a 2 1/2 year old boy.

I kept thinking...please don't let my little girl immitate Jane. Not to mention the opening is a family saying goodbye to their father going off to war.

But, though it has useful information, its scholarship is only randomly reliable. Kimmel is unaware of the primary symbolism of the roasted egg, imagines that Ashkenazic Jews refrain from serving lamb at their Seders only because it was absent from their diets in eastern Europe and, in a misbegotten stab at ecumenism, makes the astonishing assertion that \\"theExodus is as important for Christians as it is for Jews.\\" The book can make a pleasant addition to the Passover meal if it's served with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"WANT TO FEED MY HAMSTER, MR.

In fact, it is his only recording I don't really like. I'll guess that country music fans would like it better. As usual with Burnett, the lyrics are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-Bone goes acoustic","review":"Long tall Texan T-Bone Burnett has one of those nasal, Dylanish voices that you might call an acquired taste. Still, once you've gotten past that initial barrier to entry, you're hooked. On this eponymous release, T-Bone takes the neotraditional high road: there's not an electrified note to be heard. Instead he's assembled an acoustic ensemble to die for, including dobro wizard Jerry Douglas, fiddler Byron Berline, and Los Lobos' Dave Hidalgo. The songs--particularly \\"River of Love\\" and \\"Shake Yourself Loose\\"--are smart, lovely, and low-key. And even the bits that T-Bone clearly tossed off on the way to the studio receive eloquent performances. Jerry Douglas fans, please note: the disc includes two unaccompanied, CD-only tracks by the Slide Ruler himself, who makes Burnett's melodies sound more desolate and Appalachian than usual. Beautiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had such high hopes!","review":"Just like his book on cats, the literary aspect is good. However, the illustrations are more than disappointing. They are awful!

My favorite things about Brockmann are her use of rougher more natural language (her dialogue is the best around), and her storytelling depth. I wouldn't want all romances to start trying to tell three stories at once, but for this series it works. Because of the incredible depth, the series makes an outstanding candidate for books to be stranded with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody does it better than Suzanne Brockmann!","review":"Does it get any better than The Defiant Hero?

John Nilsson is called upon to negotiate a hostage situation and finds himself face to face with a woman from his past. If only this desperate single mother would trust him enough to put her life in his capable hands...but of course she can't. These two main characters have a lot of issues to work through on the way to rescuing Meg's daughter and grandmother that kept me turning pages. The secondary characters are equally riviting with a heartwarming WWII love story told in flashback by the captive grandmother to her grandaughter and one of their guards. And as if that weren't enough there's also a hot romance kindled between Sam from Nils' Team and Alyssa the FBI agent--I want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I bought this DVD for my husband, he so has enjoyed Campbells work.

For the parish minister or pastor who needs guidance, this book should definitely be on the shelf as a mandatory reference work. For seminarians, it might be overwhelming, but would be a wonderful book to own. For more experienced religious leaders, pastoral counselors and pastoral psychotherapists, however, there is much here that can be gotten more easily and in more sophisticated form from smaller, more specialized books on theology and especially aspects of psychology/psychiatry.

My understanding is that indigenous Peruvian people suffer pretty bad from discrimination within their country, and here's a little movie that invents a backwards tradition and portrays an indigenous community's fictional wife swapping and a father/town mayor that can't wait to have sex with his pretty young daughter. Imagine an American movie that portrayed Latino, African American, or Native American cultures that way! With no basis in fact it would never fly. The interesting aspect of the movie is that it makes you think about how such a tradition would cause nothing but suffering for all involved, and if it were, for example, an American movie about white country folk it might be like a Children of the Corn/ Twighlight Zone kind of creepy concept, but in this context the racial implications are impossible to ignore (or forgive)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Racist Movie","review":"This movie portrays an extremely negative, sadistic and morbid picture of indigenous people of Peru. I have no doubts that peruvian indigenous culture has it's downfalls, but I feel that a critique of it's society should not come from an elitist white Peruvian who lives in Europe. This movie is part of the history of using film to inseminate and reproduce cultural ignorance, prejudice and racial superiority.It's unfortunate that the spectacle- beautiful cinematography, colors, sounds- mesmerizes most audiences without eliciting any real critique.

This may be why I thought the book was so offensive, because it is truly all common sense. Also, the way the authors choose to write the book? I just feel like this book was written for stupid people who just complain about everything, because this can be the only reason why a book written so poorly can seemingly change people's minds.My life philosophy: Find a job you enjoy and throw all of your passion into it.

Clark's radio show and books have saved me well over $900 this year with useful info I did not know about. However, this book was a letdown.Most everything in this book was common knowledge or common sense. Example: Want cheap clothes, then buy them from a thrift store or discount store like TJ Maxx. Want cheap books, borrow them from the library, or buy them used on the internet. Too often the answer is buy used, or buy at a warehouse club.I can't recommend this book unless you are a novice at saving money. You are better off saving your money and buying Clark's far superior book, \\"Get Clark Smart: The Ultimate Guide to Getting Rich in America\\", which despite its title is not a get rich quick book.

The movie ends with the young Catholic boy proclaiming to the Rabbi that he needs to pray to his dead son, and Jesus has nothing to do with salvation. Priceless. Let's see someone produce a movie that launches a similar attack on the Islam faith. Yeah right. This gem was produced by Matt Damon and Ben Afleck leaving little doubt where they stand regarding Christianity.

I could care LESS about Karsten & Kassandra (the exes of the 2 main characters) and their relationship. I wanted to know about Sloan and Norwood! But her tryin to have a 2 for 1 book killed any anticipation and it made for a LONG, BORING read. We got no in depth background into the main characters and she didn't put enough into their story for us to get the gist of what was going on with them. Please save your money and borrow this from the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stories in One???","review":"I enjoyed the last book by this author and I bought this one because I assumed I would enjoy this one also. However I was wrong!The story line about the main characters was the only thing that made me finish reading the book. I just flipped over the New York chapters and read all the Barbados chapters. That's the way I was able to complete the book. I agree with the other reviewers about the double stories. The minor characters were not essential to the main story. I have read books like this before but there is usually a certain flow or connection to the scenes other than being the fomer lovers of the main characters. I wished I could get a refund on this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Boyfriend's Back","review":"My Boyfriend's BackThis was the movie I have been looking for, it has been years since I have seen it on TV and was very surprised that I could get this on DVD.To me it is a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The prince who loved Emma","review":"This is a good book, because it tells a beautiful story about a prince that loved Emma, but Emma doesn't want to live in a beautiful castle. This story is about love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for movie fans, but enjoyable for the rest of us","review":"It's great that this is a real soundtrack, rather than music \\"inspired by\\", or yet another mishmash of pop tunes. Because the music did such a good job of supporting, not dominating, what appeared on screen, it will probably be enjoyed most by those who liked the movie. However, there's still plenty here for the non-fan. Anyone who doesn't respond to the final track \\"Logan and Rogue\\" doesn't have a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator Music","review":"I must confess myself not to be much of a Michael Kamen fan, having in the past either tolerated his work (Don Juan DeMarco) or downright disliked it (Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves), but his score for X-Men is by far my favorite thing he has done , based on just one track: \\"Logan and Rogue\\". The relationship between Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Anna Paquin's Rogue is the brightest aspect of the film itself, and inspired Kamen to create a theme for them that is both hauntingly beautiful and achingly sad. Unfortunately, Kamen never reaches such heights again with his score (although \\"Death Camp\\" almost succeeds at creating a pensive mood) and ultimately I agree with one reviewer who called it \\"white noise\\", neither obtrusive nor memorable. His biggest failure is in the main theme, which is dull and vaguely annoying. The best-selling comic book heros deserve better; hopefully in the sequels they will get it, although probably not from Michael Kamen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Knowing Michael Kamen's work before, this was a great disappointment! There is no \\"leif motiv\\" throughout the soundtrack so you really don't get a feel for characters while you are listening to the music. Its more of 'elevator music', fillers for the film and can not stand on its own without the image of the film. Where in his other work, \\"Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves\\" the music stands on it's own and really is a beautiful score. I expected more of a beautiful piece for \\"Logan & Rogue\\" a more moving piece but it's just more 'elevator music' to me and it didn't move as it should knowing what those two characters have been through in the film. It also seemed rushed, maybe if Mr. Kamen had more time with the score it would had more of an impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"The score just about ruined the movie.

I've seen it three times. The score was perfect! Okay, not totally perfect, but I still give it 5 stars. The only things I did not like was the new theme. I want the theme you hear on the animation! I don't see why they couldn't put it in, the new theme is really close, they are even in the same key. I also don't like that it is so SHORT! I want more! but that's okay. It was a great sound track, and a great movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"I purchased this about a year ago and, after very light use, the dial will not hold zero.Even moving the caliper very slowly to a fully closed position, the pointer will indicate anywhere from three to five-thousandths of an inch off from what was set at zero.I emailed Chicago Brands and they said that although it could be repaired, the repair would cost more than getting a new one.Seeing how this caliper became absolutely unreliable after light home use, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Precision measuring instruments have to be reliable. Otherwise it defeats the purpose of providing accurate measurements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this...","review":"I received this caliper on it's box and packaged as it says on the description, but as soon as I looked at it, I knew there was something wrong with it. The needle was pointing to about 5 o'clock not 12 o'clock like it's supposed to. Then I opened it and closed it, and it pointed to 2 o'clock... it never repeated.It looks like the needle was lose on the pin and just slides on it.I returned it and decided to buy a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional","review":"I purchased this so that I could check the shim sizes on my motorcycles valves. It did just what it was suppose to. As with any instrument, don't drop it.

The world he writes about is bleak, devasting and brutal. In Shella he delves into the world of a young boy abandoned at places where he lived with fear and the constant threat of abuse and grew up to be a cold-hearted, brutal killer for hire who is known as Ghost. Only Shella, a street toughened dancer, ever saw beneath the hard shell. They are separated when Ghost is thrown in jail and now that he's out his one goal is to find Shella.This is an interesting look into the life of a killer. How cold-heartedly it happens out of necessity and survival. The book is bleak (have I said that already?) and disturbing. This was a difficult to put down book but it's not one I'd like to revisit due its complete sense of despair."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever","review":"All I can say: I started drinking my drinks in two glasses and watched TV whithout sound after I went through this book.

The main character, Ghost, is a psychopath brought up by the foster care system. He is a quiet, thin man who seems slow-witted. But, he possesses a steely calmness and fast reflexes which makes him dangerous. After being separated from his one love, Shella, he is offered information to her whereabouts. In exchange for this information, he must infiltrate a cult of white supremacists and kill their leader. The novel covers the hate crime, rape and child abuse.

The only downside to this is when I was reading through it, it says \\"listen to the playback on the CD\\" and I never received a CD.

I always feel she is more interested in appealing to the critics than to the public. She's famous for claiming she only records \\"positive\\" songs for women and yet her biggest hit was the whiny, dependent HOW DO I LIVE WITHOUT YOU and to top it off she gets into something of a catfight with the other singer who put it out (Lee Ann Rimes, I'm not that crazy about her, either). She definately is the female Garth Brooks - arrogant, pretentious, unctuous.

Since the Honda VFR is famous for unreliable regulator rectifiers, I would like a way to display the voltage. I would like the audio volume to be raised or lowered as a function of the speed; motorcycles do tend to get noisy, being out there in the air.Mounting on my Y2K Honda VFR was simple (thanks to ram mount).Overall, I am pleased with the Zumo.

As someone else mentioned below, 10000:1 ratio is overstatement. There is no difference at all.The brigtness is a bit dimmer compared to other brands. But worst of all, the speakers. The speakers sounded as if Samsung just put them on for decoration. 5.1 Home Theater speaker system is a must for this pathetic TV. You will be disappointed, and you will long for Panasonic.I see that the TV has mixed reviews. But why does Amazon keep changing the price? It started around $1700 then $1800, now it's at $2000.

She leant such color to this story with the setting in Bermuda. The texture and tones of the island seeped through and captured my imagination. As always, she delivered an interesting mystery.

She is invited to the wedding of her former son-in-law, Lloyd to a wealthy and beautiful widow, Connor Bailey. Although she is not that eager to attend, Henrie O decides to go in order to support her grandchildren. Connor is not particularly happy to be in Bermuda because the last time she was there, a friend of hers plunged off a tower to his death. From the minute Connor arrives, she is frightened by ghostly apparitions and supposed visitations from the dead man. Both Connor's and Lloyd's families are unhappy about the marriage between them, but the family members seem to try to make the best of the situation. When a murder occurs, someone is put on the spot and accused of being the murderer. Henrie O doesn't believe that justice is being done, so she sets out to find the perpetrator.

This is in all ways perfect album, anyway you look at it. The first track, \\"Twighlight\\" is possibly one of the best melodic death metal songs ever written. \\"Blood Colored\\" could be considered as death rock and roll, and Swano started experimenting with clean vocals more on \\"Black Tears\\", not to mention it has one of the best/catchy riffs ever. \\"Elegy\\" has great lyrics, and \\"Of Darksome Origin\\" is just great, very evil. In short, this album is sweet, do yourself a favor, if you're into melodic DM, heard previous Swano efforts, you can't miss with Purgatory Afterglow. It's one of the best Swedish Melodic Death Metal 'representatives' in the field. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swano knows what he is doing","review":"I've been a fan of EOS since their first full length release 'Nothing But Death Remains'. They never disappoint me because the mastermind behind the band, Dan Swano, KNOWS what he is doing. He is a fabulous songwriter, very creative, and has lots of influences that really help make their material stand out.While this release has more \\"clean\\" vocals and melody than previous efforts, it doesn't detract from their overall death metal sound. What it does do is make the songs stick in your head. The riffs and melodies are infectious and Swano's clean vocals are excellent. He has a great voice.Favorite tracks: Blood Colored, Twilight"},{"rating":"2","title":"The mother of all death metal albums","review":"With Purgatory Afterglow, Edge of Sanity with mainman Dan Swan, released what is considered to be the best death metal album ever. If one listen to songs like \\"twilight, elegy, velvet dreams or black tears\\" you get the feeling that it's hard to do it any better. Where can one take from here? This is it. The definite death metal album. You just haven't lived until you've heard this album. A pretty bold statement, but true in fact. Go get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just my opinion","review":"Edge of Sanity may be very talented musicans, Dan Swanö might be a great producer and songwriter, but I think this Cd lacks one thing. Feeling. There aren't any really agressive or melancholical moments on the whole album, in my opinion of course. They seem to try anything, Gothic/Romantic (Twillight), Black Metal (Of darksome Oregin), Entombed ( Song of Sirens)... but I don't get the impression that they really put any emotions in it. The whole Cd sounds so static and predictable, the lyrics are as poetic as the daily news about the stock market exchange and Dan Swanö's Voice sounds tiring, boring and overproduced. I didn't get to hear any other EOS album exept \\"Crimson\\" which is just one 40 minute song, so I can't talk about their musical evolution or what has become of them. It's just my opinion, be happy with this CD if you want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"French numbers review","review":"This book is an English translation of a French title for small children.

The production & mixing is top notch and the songs sound WAY BETTER than the versions on XX. If you know anything about this band and like them I don't think its possible for you not to love this.

She kept her father's temper at bay, preserved her life and her faith, and against all odds, won the throne.

There are important people involved in this conceptual framework, such as Petty, Quesney, Smith, Marx, Keynes, and so on. Rima manages to take this simple history and create something far more complicated than necessary, and at times, incoherently pedantic. For example, Rima tries to explain derivation of a demand curve AND Hick's optimum conditions in 13 pages. Get real! Rather than issue a prolegomenon (Rima's word, page 202), I will make a suggestion: if this book is required reading for a college course, throw it away, and purchase Stanley L.

There were noticeably less fleas on the cat washed in dish soap.Use it on animals you don't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved the original version of this product","review":"I HATE the version I was sent with the new formulation.

This was only a few dabs of Adams mind you. We called the Vet right away and was told \\"oh yeah, that happens some times. Your cat will stop foaming within an hour\\". What the f*k ? The smell of this horrible product made both me and my wife nauseas as well. It is so highly scented as to be noxious. We had to remove from the room the cotton ball we used to apply the test on Christo.The only reason we tried this stuff is because our kittens aren't yet old enough for the really right flea treatment - apparently called \\"revolution\\". In the meantime we're going back to plan A for our kits - Dawn Pure Essential baths with lots of fresh water for the rinse.Stay away from Adams.

Absolute junk. The machining quality is poor, the mechanism is absurdly stiff (opening it one-handed is basically impossible), and it wasn't even particularly sharp when I got it. The open edge of a tin can would be sharper.There is no country of origin mark on this knife, but I have been informed that Gerber is now outsourcing the manufacture of some of its smaller knives to China. I suspect this is the motive behind this knife's significant price reduction in recent months.It's really too bad. I have some older Gerber knives that are of exceptional quality, and they have always been razor sharp until now.

There are good sections on the issue of property (p. 41) and how those issues are being fought over. In Russia, for example, they go over the various groups that have grabbed the property - ex- communists, mafias, etc.Patient ants will eventually enjoy higher standards of living than impatient crickets.

Respect and compassion toward all living things is makes the world a better place and us better people. Such compassion thus fulfills two of the major responsibilities of every human being on earth. I love Ms. Lauck for the vision, courage, and compassion which made it possible for her to write this book, which is destined to become a classic. Whether it becomes a best-seller or simply a perennial underground classic (like the One Straw Revolution) I cannot predict.

It seems so wacky to write a whole book of love and appreciation for bugs, but by the time she's done, Lauck has you convinced that this is just common sense. She's as persuasive and irrefutable as Gandhi. How on earth is it that in a world with thousands of creatures on the endangered species lists that we have targeted around 10,000 species for extermination?

I very seldom will stop reading books until giving them a fair shake, but I was so unimpressed with this book that I had to move on.The book spent alot of time examining the roots of why insects have been looked down upon for years. And they were interesting, except that the reasoning often used such cliches as \\"many native tribes believe...\\" Which native tribes? How do you define many? Then, at about the point the book seemed about to follow up the debunking of theories with proof, it would stop short with something like \\"the reasons why the fly is good are beyond the scope of this book, suffice it to say that...\\".

As for the art work, other books in the series are far superior. I am a storng supporter of Osprey with some 60+ of their books, but this one was not among their best.

I wonder if anyone could really live the way the author portrays- constantly in the narcissistic annals of their own mind, without regard for those around them or others feelings.

Not the artiface of super heros (super lawyers, super bankers ad nauseum that one sees in contemporary pulp fiction) rather the protagonists come alive as real people and are thus all the more believable and richly portrayed.Heros emerge as in real life - by the split second decisions they make.

This story is slow, almost unbearably so...the narrative is confusingly told from multiple points of view, and that might be okay if any of them had something interesting to say. Unfortuntely they don't, because the plot is so slow in developing and the characters so lifeless that it leaves the reader with few places to turn- except to the unskilled prose of a first time author that seems so enamored with the sounds of her own voice that she has completely lost any regard for the reader. I wanted to like this book, I really did- but it is hard to embrace a story as poorly executed and ill concieved as this one. Perhaps the author should give up on the histroical constructs and the multiple personalities of the narrator and try being real for a change. There is a difference between knowing the path, and walking the path."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow, ponderous, and boring","review":"I had such high hopes for this book- until I read it! There could have been so much more going for this story based on the subject matter. The character development is almost non- exist, the story has no arch, and the trite mismatched metaphors and confusing descriptions(\\"he had eaten the pages\\"?) left me confused about the authors lack of connection to both the reader and the character. The prose seemed to get lost in the head of the author- not in the head of the character- and that made the book both difficult and unenjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing","review":"I wanted to enjoy this book however I could not. There was more description than story. It was so discriptive that this reader forgot what was being described! In my opinion, I think the author missed an opportunity to create a story from the era and S.E. MA and blew it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to tears..how does one get a refund","review":"I bought this book because of some interest in the New England coastal communities of the time. However, this book is bad. And not just bad in the pedestrian sense...I mean shockingly, train wreck, unjustifiable as to how it ever could have been published bad. The book jacket says the author went to Harvard..maybe her college roommate is the editor at Random House now, because other than that there would be no reason to ever bring these words to print. And I say \\"words\\" as opposed to \\"story' because there is no story here- just the almost incomprehensible rambling on of yet another young author more in love with the sound of her own voice than with conveying anything of substance to the reader. If that is all the author Tripp cares to do- then I suggest that she sticks to writing in her journal and save everyone else the anguish of reading this peice of dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very difficult and disconcerting","review":"Usually I like a challenging book- it makes me feel a tiny bit superior to celebrity culture of most books yu find lining the shelves. But in this case I had to take a step back and decide weather or not to hack through this very dense, very convuluted plot and prose. It truly is an effort that I doubt very few will be willing to wade through. It is the kind of book I suspect many at first would think they want to read- but because of the stagnant plot and too many narrative voices I'm sure most will never finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel worth savoring","review":"Reading Moon Tide, to me, was like savoring a nice, full-bodied glass of red wine. I not only read Dawn Clifton Tripp's words, I swallowed them. It is simply that rich. She went where most authors do not dare to go - to the otherworldly spiritual place where dreams are formed. This is precisely where real awakenings can occur. Tripp treats her characters with the same respect she has for the coastal setting for the stories. Her characters, like the landscape, are powerful and earthy. In her characters, she weaves the dark and light in a sympathetic, natural way. Like the landscape, they are rich, complex, beautiful, luminous, and dark. Ultimately, Eve is the story of so many of us who shut down. Yet, what was so compelling was how natural and gentle she is with the characters who face pain and also cause pain. She writes like someone with life experience beyond her years. This is so much more than a regional novel, it is the very organic stuff of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it 2 stars because of the cover photo...","review":"otherwise, I was bored to tears.

While there are a few lovely passages in it, they tend to trail away from any thread to the main story- which tends to get lost in the myriad of voices used by the author in some type of attempt to create tension and drama in the circumstances of the story. The author seems to get lost in the details of the characters thoughts, while forgetting the biggest detail of all: that there has to be some kind of movement in order to push the story forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better...","review":"I am still amazed this album does not have one review??!?

The premise is that Laurel has decided after way too many failed romances that she is not going to marry for love and in fact the best idea is for her to \\"arrange\\" her own marriage. This premise is cemented in her brain when her boss gives her a book to review that is about the very same subject. (Point)Joe is a wealthy self made man of coffee shop fame. But, he has gone undercover with a coffee cart to research a new shop location. He is immediately drawn to Laurel. Joe is definitely a believer of love before marriage. (Counterpoint)Laurel decided to use her and Joe's opinions for her article (to prove she is right) which throws them together in different situations to see how each opinion will play out.Fun story that also looks at speed dating in a humorous way.

These two experiences have shaped his view of leadership. Unlike many other books on leadership, Eims has structured his book sole on leadership and management principles taken from the Bible.His belief that any pastor can be a better leader is the chief strength of this book. Eims points out that the source of spiritual leadership is not found in natural charisma, but in the infilling presence of God; thus, leaders in the church must be men of faith before anything else. They must set the example before the congregation of what it means to be a Christian.There were some significant weaknesses in this book. There were just too many sermons. Page after page is devoted to biblical illustrations. For instance, in chapter nine over three pages of biblical exposition are devoted to Moses resolving conflicts.It was an OK book, I've read better."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIss Browne end a downer","review":"This edition ends in a way that is not appropriate for younger children.

Not as a singer on the starched, staged Grand Ole Opry; not as a recording artist in the studio, but as an entertainer. You hear what her fans of the day bought a ticket to hear. Yes, the audio quality is inferior (it was 1961, after all) but if you want to get to know a side of Patsy Cline that you won't hear on her \\"Greatest Hits\\" this is a must-have. As most other fans, I only wish more locked up, live PC material would become available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patsy, we hardly knew ye!","review":"Patsy Cline's career was short, but brilliant. This live recording is a chance to hear her while her star was still on the rise. I was prepared for the worst after reading about the poor sound quality, but I was pleasently surprised. As a fan of obscure blues field recordings, I've heard much worse. If you're already a fan of Patsy, and in all honesty you should be before buying this CD, the sound glitches won't bother you at all. For established fans, it's a chance to hear Patsy in real world conditions: singing with a different band every night, taking requests and putting up with the primitive PAs of the day. What a talent! What a trouper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Poor Quality of This Recording Needs to Be Emphasized","review":"This should not be anyone's first Patsy Cline album. Or even second or third. It's perhaps only for the connoisseur who's heard lots of recordings of all of her work and desperately needs something different.Yes, sure, she's great, but this CD often sounds like an AM radio not quite tuned to the right frequency.

However I was hoping they'd spend some time talking about how to lay out your forms so they are mor effective and less likely to cause problems for the user in the first place.Especially useful would have been web oriented techniques for forms that span multiple pages.Anyway they didn't put it in the book and that's their choice. What they put in is servicable if all you're interested in is recovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Much","review":"The contents of this paperback would make an interesting series of articles, but it lacks the depth needed for any good book. Everything is already upfront in the table of contents and it does not go into any real substance inside. Although the authors do provide some good ideas, they don't suggest anything that isn't already common sense to those in the web development field. The problem is that the book makes no assumptions about the type of site that you're running or the server environment, so it doesn't tell you how to achieve anything.

A lot of critics went ga-ga over this film; I thought it was okay although it's clearly a Hollywood film that desperately wants to be arty and meaningful. It's definitely evocative of the psychology-based dramas of the 1940s and '50s... with swearing and abortion thrown in for good measure.

But even though most of the time they are telling the truth you can almost always sense that in some way they are somehow unhappy. This is what this flick is about. This movie captures the dark essence of family life. I'm not saying everyone who is married is unhappy. And not everyone of them ends in devorice. But there is a reason most do. I think the main reason people don't like this film is because it deals with aspects of life that are very upsetting.Now that I got that out of the way let me get to the review. I think this is a great film. It's very well acted and brutality honest. If you don't mind watching a downer of a film you will find much to like about this tale of oppression. Can't family life feel like that sometimes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A film that stays with you","review":"I never thought I would like this film,about a married couple in the 1950's but for some reason it gets to you.This married couple's living the American life,the nice house,2 kids,and a good job,but want more,and almost make there dream come true,but something happens that should have been a blessing.The acting is fantastic.Kate Winslet and Dicaprio are 2 of the greatest working actors today.I would love to see them in a comedy next.\\"Revolutionary Road\\" is a movie you still think about after its over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this movie made?","review":"I found this film to be very depressing and of no social or moral value what-so-ever. April is sooo unhappy, yet we never see her playing with her children? She took no joy in having her kids? What kind of mother and wife is she? She is unhappy because she lives in suburban CT? What is sooo bad about that? Her unhappieness comes from within herself, not in her conformist surroundings. The ending is horrible and leaves me doubting April's sanity. Skip this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful & great. ...","review":"Oooh - what a pain it was watching that couple. ... subject matter: \\"Marriage's UP & DOWNS\\".

They make such crap these days it just keeps flowing. If a train had come and rum both of the lead characters after the first 20 minutes it wouldn't have hurt my feelings in the least. Both of them are ROTTEN people who get what they deserved. She married a man for fortune and sex (all the wrong reasons) he can't figure out what the hell he wants and should be SHOT! CRAP, plain and simple..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolutionary Road","review":"I don't know about the movie but I hope it's better then the Audiobook. The book was all over the place with the characters. It was very hard to keep up with the story.Hope the movie is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"too dark too depressing","review":"The actors and actress did a wonderful job however, the content was dark and depressing. Frankly, I felt miserable after watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"american beauty part 2","review":"I saw this film because I had just sen The Reader which was brilliant and wanted more of Kate Winslet (her acting I hasten to add). The plot never materialised. After 1 hour I felt I was watching De Caprio self-indulging. I was expecting some plot, twist to happen but it never did. I couldn't wait for the end to come round quick enough. Then I heard that ominous piano music which reminded me of American Beauty ( another couple trapped in a loveless marriage); likewise her suicide at the end was reminiscent of Amerciab beauty. Sorry but the film just dragged on and on and on. Acting wise, Kate was great, but I just wanted to watch a movie and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and plodding - lame script","review":"I mean REALLY slow and plodding. This is a snoozer. Acting is pretty good for a script that is really lame. I suspect this was adapted from a play. Whoever adapted it just doesn't understand how to write an effective script for a motion picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"More depressing than \\"Promises in the Dark\\"!","review":"Two hours of my life I can never get back! That's how I felt after watching this depressing movie. I was going to see it in the theater but never got around to it. A friend of mine rented it and I watched it with her. I haven't seen a movie this depressing since \\"American Beauty\\" and \\"Promises in the Dark\\". Aren't movies supposed to be an escape from reality? Don't waste your time or money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A MISERABLE DOWNER OF A FILM","review":"This is probably one of those instances where the book was better than the movie. And maybe one of those instances where the book could/should not have been made into a movie. I suffered through the whole mess. There was not one character in the film that I felt sympathy toward. They all deserved to be miserable. Was this film produced by a cigarette company?I've never seen so many cigarettes smoked. Even films made back in the 50's didn't have so many cigarettes lit up. My lungs were starting to hurt at one point - I was thinking \\" if he/she lights up another one, I'm going to start coughing\\". I could almost smell smoke in the room. Wow!I never got the tone of the piece, either. At one point, in the middle of all the depressing misery, I thought maybe this was a some type of dark comedy.What a waste of top notch talent. A forgettable film. Leaves a bad taste.Yuk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Dicaprio Movie ever!","review":"Revolutionary RoadUsually you can depend on a DiCaprio movie to be Good, but this was really bad.Wow, I didn't expect to set anyone off. I only wanted to save others from wasting their time viewing this Bad Movie.If you enjoy downer movies about people fighting and cheating, by all means watch this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's complicated","review":"This is a hard movie to explain. Two people, who genuinely love each other, find themselves in a life that's expected and don't know what to do about it. They both have wishes that they can't define and can't translate into reality. They don't know what they want, they just know they are miserable with what they got. Then one of them has an idea she thinks will solve everything, except it doesn't.If you watch movies to escape reality, skip this one. It's too realistic. There are no good guys and bad guys. If you like everything neatly tied up by the end of your 2 hours, skip this one too. It doesn't.You forget you are watching actors perform. Kate Winslet should have gotten the Oscar for this role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally entombed characters in search of real emotion and a human film director...","review":"Yet another addition to the Sam Mendes catalog of films celebrating emotionally entombed, intellectually marooned suburbanites and characters cut off from each other by one form of quiet, long suffering dysfunction or another, a race of coffin dwellers who might as well be vampires. These people were beaten even before they started, their strivings a grim charade of escalating anger and disappointment. If it all meant something it might be bearable, but Mendes is only interested in the ritual of these stories. He is a cinematic parasite who attaches himself to weakened characters, striving without any real hope of surviving their own stories, who then sucks the life from them frame by frame with his camera and lush, perfectly staged and art directed productions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their acting hasn't improved much since Titanic","review":"Kate Winselt and Leondaro DiCaprio, that same duo that brought youTitanic, now star inRevolutionary Road [Blu-ray], a very different film. This movie isn't really a lighthearted love story, which is what I expected based uponTitanic. Rather,Revolutionary Roadattempts to show the struggles of a young couple seeking to break out of the traditional mold of 1950s suburbia. The premise of the movie was interesting, but it's a very dark movie and not a great date movie (my date fell asleep). Furthermore, Winselt and DiCaprio just weren't the actors to carry this out. DiCaprio is very stiff and can't get beyond being boyish, despite being 34 years old. Winselt is way too dramatic and overacts. At the end of the movie, I felt little personal connection or sympathy for either character. This movie might appeal to some audiences, but it was entirely forgettable for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars, one for each actor","review":"This is a horrible movie. It's funny how people rate this movie based on their affection for Kate & Leo from the Titanic. This is not the Titanic. This is a foolish movie that never moves along, nothing happens until the last 15 minutes. It's one of the slowest most shallow movies you will watch, there is no depth in this movie. If your in love with Kate & Leo well you will watch this movie just because but if you are not, you are wasting 2 hours to watch this movie there is no redeeming value. I don't post very often, I don't review movies but I had to vent on this one. All the hype is sad, this movie sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Sampson movie?","review":"Found this when looking for his movies. Don't believe he was in this one! Never wanted to see this one when it came out, and don't think i'll be buying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good acting all around","review":"This is a story of young married couple living the middle-class life in suburbia. Time is in the 50's so for many of us, it is a foreign world when men wore suits, ties and hats to work, wife stayed home, and a live band played in local clubs. Winslett and DiCaprio unite once again for some serious work, no more kiddie stuff. Topics of their arguments are following one's dreams, cheating on spouses, children, etc. All of which could be very boring and redundant but these actors are fully capable of entertaining us with their looks and skills.There are some fine supporting actors including Kathy Bates playing the helpful real-estate agent who by trade is talkative and has a son in a mental institution. Story asks the question: who is more insane? One who day in and day out trudges off to a job that he detests or one who rebels and pursues his dreams giving up the comforts of steady pay check."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winslet and DiCaprio do their thing","review":"Winslet and DiCaprio performa masterfully in this film. The Blu-Ray option gives full respect to this dramatic production. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing","review":"I thought the movie was well done but the story is very depressing. Not too much more to be said here; I don't really want to provide spoilers but had not realized the story was so depressing prior to watching (I find movies better if I see them without knowing the full story in advance). I gave the movie four stars for solid quality but the fun factor would be 2 or 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolutionary Road","review":"A decade after Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet again find themselves playing characters on a sinking ship; however, in Revolutionary Road the vessel is their marriage. The movie is handsomely crafted by Sam Mendes, but the result is an exquisite downer. DiCaprio and Winslet star as Frank and April, a young couple with dreams of ditching their humdrum suburban existence for the freedom and excitement of Paris; however, circumstance stymies them, and resentment follows. Revolutionary Road looks immaculate, and the performances are outstanding, but I feel the movie is more tasteful than emotionally resonant."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete waste of time","review":"Remind me why KW was nominated.......maybe because husband was the director (?!)..........LD was the better actor but the film was all over the place.................was this supposed to be ENTERTAINMENT..............why didn't she shoot herself or her husband an hour into the film and we could have saved some time.COMPLETE waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"As a big movie fan who buys and watches hundreds of movies each year, this movie makes my all time bottom 10 list. In addition, it blows my mind that some people consider this a great movie. This is pretty much the only time in my life where a movie that I thought was one of the worst was ever considered by others a great movie. Be careful before buying this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring talkfest","review":"This movie plods on for 2 hours while you wait for something to happen or for the characters to do or say something that will make you care about them at all. These shallow people seem to have decent enough lives - but are somehow vauguely disatissfied and not having the guts to take responsibility for their own happiness the husband and wife blame each other. This was done much better in \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff\\" - at least that movie was a hoot - this was just a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thang","review":"Rented this title from Redbox a while back and I just didn't understand the gist or rather found the meaning boring. Perhaps I'm simple minded or this movie just isn't my cup of tea. Top flight actors and production but the subject matter is just too common and boring. While others may write a detailed analysis, I have a single word that describes this suburban couple, spoiled.Entertainment wise on the secondary market \\"Revolutionary Road (2008)\\" doesn't appear to have sustainable value compared to titles like \\"Mulholland Drive (2001)\\", \\"While You Were Sleeping (1995)\\", and \\"Angel-A (2005).\\" All of these titles have a much higher secondary market value than Revolutionary Road. Revolutionary Road as of this writing can be had for less than $5 OTD (out the door)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Depressing, depressing, depressing. 2 depressing hours of arguing and fighting. Just when you think it will start to get better..................it doesn't. Take Paxil, Prozac, and Zoloft before starting this movie. The only thing I got out of this movie was, if there are too many \\"me\\" instead of \\"us\\", the marriage will not last. Maybe that's why the divorce rate is so high. Did I forget to mention that this movie is depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Maybe the problem for me is that I am in a stable, loving relationship and have been for a long time. I just could not relate to the extreme depression and animosity that the characters (mostly April for Frank) had for each other. I realize that, it being the 50's, April did not have many choices or ways to escape the marriage, but 2 hours of sad to sadder and then saddest was not for me. Perhaps this was better as a book, but I somehow doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"another classic ruined","review":"Really over the top (shouting and screaming the whole way through) and rather unsubstantial. Like the book, the film often slid into self indulgence.To make matters worse, Kate Winslet is rather unconvincing as the 'stepford wife' type character, and is incredibly self aware. Even DiCaprio, whom I usually love, feels ill chosen.And the ending, well that was just disgusting (I think it would have been far more effective to not actually show anything)A roller-coaster that slides from delight to utter despair. Sadly, although we see the characters are smiling, we never feel like doing it ourselves. There are no 'normal' moments, moments that actually reflect real life I.E. humour or love. By the end, you'll be feeling distinctly cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I never saw!!","review":"I LOVE the actors, Besides that, I hated this movie. If you are pro marriage, pro love, pro life, You will hate this movie. I bought this and now it sits on a shelf. I will never watch it again. So depressing. Just an sad, sad movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary & Dreadful","review":"The description for this movie might lead one to think it's a chearful movie. It's not. The entire movie is down and dank; every one is yelling, screaming, and cheating. It should be rated \\"A\\" for Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary Road by Brandon M. Moskos","review":"This movie was based on the book with the same title by Richard Yates. I pre-ordered this dvd mainly because of the cast in it. I didn't see this movie in the theaters. I watched it and realized that DiCaprio and Winslet make this movie a good movie. It is about a couple in the 1950's who are not happy with the modern life of those times, and want to break free from everyday life. Like I said, DiCaprio and Winslet are tremendous in this movie. The viewer really feels like they are in the 1950's. Other than the acting, I was disappointed in the film. I don't think all of the arguing was needed in this movie, and I found myself being quite bored at times. Please watch this movie for the great acting, but don't expect too much from the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANTED TO LIKE THIS MOVIE...","review":"It's not that it was depressing, or dark. It wasn't the predictable ending. It wasn't the era it took place in... It was just not that good. It was over-acted and had a story that really goes nowhere.I like deep movies from time to time, like AMERICAN BEAUTY, or MAGNOLIA, but this just didn't make sense. Why didn't they just go to Paris for Christ sakes? And the kids weren't even in more than 2 shots. Must've been playing marbles in the attic.Anyways, Leonardo's been on a roll with THE DEPARTED and BLOOD DIAMOND, I guess it was time to phone a friend or vice versa. Kate was good in ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, but not much since. I still hope for good things from her, but this was a bit off for her...sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature and Complicated Film - About our Ilusions","review":"As a fan of Ernest Becker, and The Human Manifesto: A General Plan For Human Survival, by Vincent Scarsella, this movie had marked overtones from the theories of Becker - that we all are trapped in illusions of meaning programmed into our souls by the cultures in which we live. Mrs. Wheeler, played so convincingly by Kate Winslet, seeks escape from her illusion, and finds only submission and death. Mr. Wheeler, played equally convincingly by DeCaprio (who is under-rated, I think, as a superb American actor of our age, perhaps the finest), finds only submission. This is a very grown-up, complicated Beckerian movie - but, alas, a movie which does not have Beckerian overtones is nothing but fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What exactly was the point?","review":"I love both of these actors SO much and wanted to like this film. When it was finished, it was \\"what the\\"?? What WAS the point of this tedious film? They were unhappy in their marriage - we get that. Maybe it's another film that didn't serve the book well, I don't know. The whole film lacked heart and depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to be depressed, watch this film...","review":"What a downer. Yes, the acting was superb, but why? Personally, I don't want to delve into the lives of two people going nowhere, who have every opportunity to change for the better but refuse or can't see to do so. If they had only listened to the ''crazy guy!I get what this film was about, but why? What is the point of re-hashing this tired old opinion of 1950's suburbia? When it was over, I just felt kind of angry at myself for wasting my time and felt cr@ppy for the rest of the evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable characters in a prison of their own making","review":"Frank and April Wheeler are unlikeable characters trapped in a prision of their own making...It was hard to maintain sympathy for April Wheeler. She could have taken her husband up on the offer of therapy, but she did not...instead she chose to wallow in her misery and shriek at Frank. Frank Wheeler, no prize either, could have found a position elsewhere, yet he too chose to wallow. Frank's consolation prize was the young woman from the secretarial pool. This is the type of movie that has some people reaching for the anti-depressants and beginning a course of therapy...not because their own lives are wretched but because they are depressed by the unecessary wretchedness of the Wheelers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mendes And Cliches","review":"Moviegoers who found \\"American Beauty\\" forced and its satirical targets largely way over the top (viz. Annette Bening's character and actions) would do well to avoid \\"Revolutionary Road.\\" This film is positively dug out with a steam shovel, its revelation of 1950's conformity by Sam Mendes about as revolutionary and exciting as a rediscovery of the wheel.An equally tiresome aspect of the film is the blatant overacting of both Winslet and DiCaprio in just about all of their scenes -lots of screaming and yelling, with less going on than meets the ears.Finally, there's the casting of DiCaprio in grown up roles. An excellent actor as a youth, unfortunately, like Patty Duke, he's hard to believe when cast in adult parts. He invariably resembles just a high school boy made up to portray someone years older, and it's too easy to separate the actor from the character being portrayed. All in all, this is in no way a memorable film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, depressing & sad","review":"Purchased this movie thinking it was a romantic drama. It started rather slow & sad & got progressively worse - bad language, horribly sad storyline. I literally threw it away - not fit to even pass on nor sell to anyone else"},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain awful","review":"hate to disagree with so many others, but we watch this last night and my husband and I both thought it was totally awful.It was depressing and there was no real point to the movie other than showing a totally discontent marriage, people having affairs, and horrible language. Yey. It didn't even have any kind of take-away message.Maybe we missed something, but we would NEVER recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up","review":"I love Leo DiCaprio and he's an amazing actor, but this movie put me to sleep. It's just boreing as hell. Not every movie can be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtle Propaganda Film","review":"There can be only one purpose in bringing this story to the screen (besides trying to make money on a low-budget effort) - to further undermine Americans' belief in their culture and values and replace it with empty Hollywood cynicism. If you stop believing in the American dream, then you should be happy in today's world where the \\"with it\\" people believe in nothing smacking of integrity, optimism, or deeper meaning. If you want to see famous actors constantly smoking, drinking, cursing, and self-destructing while pretending to be Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver, and if you want to reinforce the idea that middle class values are fraudulent, then this movie is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Board Cover","review":"It is the perfect width and length for my large ironing board.

This book made me realize that this was only a minor part of what this group endured, and atrocious as cannibalism is they saw even worse aspects of humanity.Originally written in the 1930s, Stewart does an excellent job of creating and telling the story from original materials. 25 years later, Steward made revisions and clarifications based on further scholarship since the books original publication. Honestly, I skimmed through most of this material, being more interested in the story than the sources. I trust that Steward did his homework.I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in the settlement of the American west."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only read one book about the American West,here it is","review":"This is the first nonfiction history book that I read in three days.

I was with the party, I wanted to be in the first party to march out, regardless of the menu. I cringed and groaned toward the end as the rescue parties must have. I shivered for the book is a page-turning experiece of how far one can go.A must read for anyone interested in the American West, and those who wonder if they could do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordeal by Hunger","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It was one of the most powerful I have ever read and almost unbelievable. The experience of the Donner Party is one that is impossible for most of us to imagine. There were passages that brought tears to my eyes.This book will leave you paralyzed with wonder and with horror. The Donner Party saga may be one of the greatest stories of all time that is both triumphant and terrible.The Donner Party was a group of 87 American pioneers who set out in a wagon train headed west for California, only to find themselves trapped by snow in the Sierra Nevada. The subsequent casualties were extremely high, and many of the survivors cannibalized members of the party who had already died.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"Having researched my husband's family trek from Missouri to California in 1846, I have learned that the \\"Donner Party\\" was part of the same wagon train as our family -- to a point.While the plight/demise of the Donner Party is tragic, this book does not address the background of the days on the trail nor why the party split off from their group in 1846 to follow an unproven path to California and therefore suffered their tragedy.In order to record hisorical events, careful research must be done -- Stewart did not do this. This book relies upon some historical facts but a lot of \\"ain't it awful.\\"The Donner Party could have survived had they stayed on the route with their wagon train out of Missouri instead of wandering off to their tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six Star Material","review":"Yes, the maps are next to useless.

The text is nice and I think my 3rd grade students will respond well to the way it approaches a very serious moment in American history. Unfortunately, on many pages, the focal point of the picture is lost because it falls in the folds where the pages are bound together.

I come from a family riddled with some sort of mental dilemma(probably manic-depressive) including most recently two adolescent sons. All have been remarkably successful, but devilish all the way. I hold out hope for my sons, but see little progress while they wear myself and ex-wife to a frazzle. What a vast wealth of knowledge Dr. Barondes shares with us.

Instead, you get a series of poorly designed gene linkage studies that are never successfully repeated, although printed as fact in large national newpapers after newsconferences by overexuberant, tenure-seeking scientists. Show me the money (or the gene)! The idea that we are genetic robots is a myth created by scientists who want to believe that human nature, including great art can be reduced to genes. The notion is absurd and, in my opinion, dangerous.

Its all new material but none of it is anywhere near as innovative as her Miseducation album. Not only is the music weak but Lauryn spends half of her time preaching about God and religion etc etc and stressing how shes no longer a \\"performer\\"... or something like that anyway, by mid-way through the first interlude i'd fallen asleep. WE DONT CARE!!! JUST MAKE GOOD MUSIC!!\\"So Much Things To Say\\" is the best track and is just about the only one that survives the the fact she doesnt seem to have been looking after her voice. She also hits the wrong chord two or three times in each song and, rather than keep going, stops the music and then starts again a few moments later.This is the biggest dissapointment ive ever had in a CD. Oh, and one other thing - the UK edition wont play on computers so if you dont have a hi-fi beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT LIVE SHOW","review":"You really have to listen to what she is saying, forget the sound of the music.When is everybody going to start listening to the words instead of the beat.

Unfortunately for those who shelled out hard earned cash for \\"MTV Unplugged No 2.0\\", it appears that the success of Miseducation went right to Ms. Hill's head. Besides a few more guitar lessons, it appears Lauryn could use a nice helping of humble pie. Lauryn Hill is extremely talented and everybody knows that. However, perhaps she has yet to learn that great music typically requires some hard work. Most of the reviewers on this page are right- this album is disrespectful to the fans due to the lack of effort that Lauryn has shown.

I was futher convinced when I saw her at the Smokin Grooves concert(zzz.....boring). Her songs lack originality, creativiy, excitement and her guitar playing is average at best. Sorry Lauren...for this genre of music, I'll stick with someone who know how to do it, Tracy Chapman"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this?","review":"Lauryn Hill is having a breakdown, right before our ears. Not only is this a bad album, but it makes you wonder why it was even made. I understand she's working through some stuff, but she doesn't make a lick of sense. I don't understand why this is called \\"music\\" since she plays the same three chords over and over, and all the songs have the same meandering nonsense. I don't think I've ever laughed this hard.

But my happiness was ruined from the moment I stuck in Disc 1. 15 minutes into track 1 I began to hear a loud clicking sound and scratching noises that constantly continue to the end of the cd. Then I tried disc 2 and found no problem. Is Disc 1 defective or is it something else because I have no problems with Disc 2. My dad keeps telling me that it's just the instruments and the clapping of the audience. This is just a poor quality cd from Columbia Records and a disappointment to many Lauryn Hill fans. Get the DVD of this cd or get any of the other choices in the MTV Unplugged seriesRegis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of talent","review":"Ah now she wants to play the freaking acoustic guitar, between she and India Arie I don't know who plays the worst, damn, how boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"A WHOLE LOT OF RUBBISH","review":"LAURYN SHOULD EITHER STICK TO HER OLD STYLE,RE UNITE WITH THE FUGEES OR JUST BABYSIT AT HOME.GIRL YOU'VE GOT TALENT BUT YOU ARE WASTING IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Lacking...A Huge Disappointment","review":"If you want to hear meaningless rambling by Lauryn Hill this is the album for you. Almost every song is preluded by her talking for almost 1 minute. I purchased this expecting something fresh and original but instead, I got this disappointing album. Hopefully Sony has more to offer, it's no wonder it took almost a year for them to decide to release it. I understand she's having personal problems, but keep that off of the album Lauryn!!! On this cd she reminds me of a weak India Arie. If you get a good deal purchase it, but it's not something that you'll remember for years, months, weeks, or days to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"O.k. I am very happy for Lauryn Hill that she is growing spiritually and all that but I felt like this cd is laced with way too much Christian sap. I liked Lauryn Hill, the rapper, much more than this current version of her. These songs just kind of go nowhere and stay there. Practically every single one of them is ridiculous long and they just don't do it for me. Anyone who liked Miseducation of Lauryn Hill may find that this cd is not their style. It feels like I'm preached at rather than sang to and frankly, that just doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"God is obviously working","review":"These reviews are crazy. People either loved the CD or hated it. THATS GREAT. When the word of God is put out there for people to hear it will never return empty. Lauryn never asks anyone to agree with her, all she says is open your eyes and listen. If you like it praise God, if you hate it Praise God. As long as you acknowledge that you are not turning her down but God's word. God doesnt just speak through Gospel. GO AHEAD LAURYN WITH YOUR BAD SELF. the Cd is truly amamzing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much talking","review":"Way too much talking - at least 1/3 of the 2-CD set features Lauryn talking about various topics - this could easily have been a single CD. The large amount of non-musical material is a real drag.The music is good, but Lauryn's limited experience on the guitar is evident in the fact that nearly every song sounds similar.Overall - a big disappointment. I can only hope that the next Studio release makes up for this clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"Lauryn Hill is singing for herself on this album becuse she certainly isn't thinking about her audience. Her voice is hoarse. She's playing the guitar (badly) with no back up. She has several spoken monolouges in between songs and cries at the end of one. In the movie Coalminer's Daughter the actress playing county singer Loretta Lynn has a scene where she cracks up in front of a live audience. That's just what this album reminds me of. I realize that Ms.Hill has had some tough times but don't ask me to pay money to listen to her navel gazing. This half baked album is an insult to her audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing wrong with being Simple","review":"My friend told me last year Lauryn Hill came out with a another cd. I was surprised because I didn't hear or see anything about it.among other reviews...i hear people commenting on how she didn't pay much respect to the fans for because the quality of the performance. Personally this cd is a big encouragement for me. Lauryn Hill is baring her soul, letting the rest of the world see her weaknesses and her strength. the cd itself is kept quite simple because the songs are more focused on the lyrics. she's got a message and she's just letting it all out. the lyrics have depth and are beautiful. Lauryn Hill has an amazing voice. eventhough, from the beginning of the cd, it sounds like she's losing it, she still has power in her vocal chords. sometimes i'm surprised at some of the notes she lets out. It's an honest cd of herself and the thing(s) that should be and are important.i recommend this cd if you want to hear something honest, encouraging and touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 Stars. 7. 8.","review":"I just read about 40 of the reviews. I honestly am concerned with the lack of depth in some of the reviews. This album is not a \\"follow up\\" of \\"Miseducation...\\". This is TOTALLY on another level. Man, I cried when I heard \\"I Gotta Find Peace of Mind\\"... and that was on CD! When I saw the DVD, it was all over. This album is pure music. Not some doctored up, studio [crud] that gets edited to death and re-done so that it is \\"perfect\\". Only something natural can be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Tribute to Emotional Honesty","review":"The N'Sync Britney Spears generation will not understand the emotional clarity and strength it took for Lauryn to make this albumn. This is an awesome collection of emotional honesty, raw talent and truthfulness. Some of the songs brought me to tears, as I sought to work through similar emotions in my own life. A generation of apethetic self involved attitudes will be too shallow to appreciate the truth and honesty involved in this project. If you are just looking for something to bob your head to, then I would suggest you bypass this albumn, it is not for you. But if you are a person who listens to words, and not just hear music, and can truly appreciate emotional honesty, then you will definitely want to pick this albumn up. The spiritual journey is well worth the fifteen dollars. And that's real!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauryn definately raises the Bar","review":"Phenonmenal Lauryn is as real as real can get. Lauryns' Marley influence is definately evident on this CD. It is simply a breath of fresh air. She is unmistakeably on point. Big up's to her! KEEP ON KEEPIN ON, Lauryn. SHE IS A living Legend to say the least. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY COLLECTOR ON A CONSCIOUS TIP."},{"rating":"1","title":"so much for talking...","review":"A very strange record this is. Lauryn Hill sings her songs in a demo format, and talks a lot. It is a very demanding experience. And after listening to it for more then three times, you really want to hear ONLY the songs, if at all.Hill says it's her reaction to fame, but what this really sums up to is a bunch of songs (some great, some so-so) that have potential and might become big hits for others, after they put them through a studio and a producer works on them.Sorry. A big pretentious disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talking","review":"Way too much talking (disc 2 opens with a 12-minute monologue, and there are others). Could have been a single disc - easy. Songs are good, not great - all sound similar - Lauryn's not real versatile with her guitar. Overall: disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point your fingers in another direction, this woman is livin","review":"Yes, this album seems unpolished, incomplete, unperfected and raw but it's a piece of Lauryn. Alot of music today is contrived, over-produced and made to please, which is why I commend Hill's efforts on this 'album'. She wrote what she wanted and played as she wanted -- most valuable artists practically sell their soul while playing the music industry. It's a damned-if-you-do,-damned-if-you-don't situation; you can't please everyone with music, all I know is she pleased some people [ie me] and did what she felt was right at the time.Very raw and simplistic album. Lauryn Hill may be going through a personal struggle right now, but I hope she continues to make music. She's a valued artist in my musical library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Lauryn Hill!","review":"This CD is awesome!It matches all of her work as GREAT! I love this CD not only is it good music but she talks about life in a great way. This CD changed my life in the things that she says. I definatly recommend this to you. Yes you! Reading this right now. Go buy this CD! You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's a great musician!","review":"This album does not appeal to everybody. It's only her and her guitar so the production is not really top-notch, but it's not supposed to be either. The focus are on the lyrics, and Lauryn is an simply amazing lyricist, if you apprechiate complicated and thought-provoking lyrics and acoustic guitars, buy it. If you're looking for beats and melody, listen to the miseducation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked Masterpiece","review":"Anyone still waiting for Lauryn Hill's follow up missed it. This was it. This is reality TV right here. Only in retrospect do I now see what she was trying to do here. This album should be revisited by critics and the general public. It's a masterpiece and represents the future of music. This is not Lauryn Hill doing the \\"MTV Unplugged thing\\" - doing all her past hits acoustically and covering some other songs by friends (ie. Nirvana Unplugged.) This is Lauryn Hill performing her entire new album live, one time only, sometimes stopping and starting over in the middle of a track and making personal, reflective comments between songs. Artists need to look to this album seriously and consider that what was being done here was much deeper than it appears on the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lauryn Hill blows","review":"Maybe Lauryn shouldve worried more about how bad her voice sounds than playing guitar at the level of an 8 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please make another album after this dawg","review":"OK, Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was nothing short of phenomenal. With this follow up you're left wondering how such a talent could fall off so dramatically---and so thoroughly, and it's two CDs worth of garbage! Save your money and buy another CD from another artist. I'm just praying to a higher power that she ever comes back from this nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete disappointment","review":"When I first saw this album I was intrigued by it since the usual MTV unplugged series are worth listening to. The artist Lauryn Hill and her first album, the miseducation are a great inspiration to everyone, but she must have had a total blackout on stage while recording this album. What a crap. Some of the songs are worth listening to but most of the babbling she does in between could be removed without any pain. It feels like when she put this filler between the songs for reflection and inspiration she must have been thinking, mmm maybe I need to give my fans some motivation why I am NOT 100% at the moment. Come on Lauryn!! Give us another miseducation or rejoin the Fugees!! You could leave the songwriting to Wycleff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth a star","review":"Giving this album one star is one too many.

And two of them are supervillians and one is the devil...I'll let you guess who."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back, Lauryn","review":"The much awaited album from Lauryn Hill(can we still call her L Boogie?)was indeed worth the wait for its release. Those who saw the Unplugged episode will remember sometimes you couldn't hear all of the interludes and song explanations, but on the two discs, its all crystal clear. With raw and revealing songs, Lauryn is a raspy voiced heroine who seems to be performing these songs not for exposure but for therapy. \\"Mr. Intentional\\" is the gem here, but each song is a powerhouse of female angst and triumph.In all of its sorrow, longing, and feelings of imprisonment,this is an album worthy of a spot on the year end best of lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"The quality of the songs, the message in them, and Lauryn's voice and outlook on life lifts this album from a mere recording to a powerful social phenomenon. Listening to this album makes you wake up and experience what music and being human is all about. I don't know of any other contemporary musician making music with so much relevancy and significance. Lauryn, your star shines bright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power","review":"Lauryn has blessed us with an honest gift of love and freedom. Many people will review this CD and criticize her lack of perfection on her guitar and on her Voice on this perticular day but people will fail to see the connection she will make all over again with millions of people all over the world. Lauryn has surpassed just being an entertainer, she has become a teacher of life and womanhood. Listening to these lyrics I can't see why she wouldn't be concidered for lyrisist of the year or does she need to go into the studio and re-record these songs and make these complex songs simple for the simple man's ears so that we can begin to \\"truly\\" critic this great body of work. If this CD doesn't empower you to look at self and take inventory of your own life, which I believe is the motivation behind this CD than i'm not sure if your even alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauryn Hill: The Conquering Lion....","review":"After one listen to this double-cd set, one is brought to the realization that in order to completely appreciate this musical milestone and the message conveyed within it's lyrics, one must be willing to (boldly) search/evalute the depths of the heart without compromise. Stripped to the soul, Lauryn eloquently exposes (truth) that has been \\"ignored\\" for too long, and rejoices in her newfound discoveries, without apology. Brutal honesty is the name of this game. Song after song is presented with such unabashed intensity and conviction, that an overwhelming thrust of exhiliration is admonished upon her listeners. In \\"Freedom Time\\" she sings: \\"Everybody knows they've perpetrated inside ...\\" Ladies and Gentleman, this is the \\"diary\\" of Lauryn Hill. Unpolished and unrestrained.... Read it and weep."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Jerusalem","review":"With this new album Lauryn Hill returns to us in the purest of forms. Accompanied only by her own guitar playing, and some of the most intensley introspective lyrics I've ever heard come out of the mouth of a highly marketable, mainstream artist, Hill throws all pretenses aside and shows us what's really on her mind. Beautiful love songs like, \\"Just like the Water\\" make this album a truely emotional experience, while the political messages in songs like \\"Rebel\\" provoke the listener to consider the state of the world. The recording is less than perfect but somehow the few odd cracks in Hill's voice combined with her detailed explanations of the songs only add to the album's general mood of truth and honesty. All in all \\"Lauryn Hill Unplugged\\" is an amazing body of work that will inspire you."},{"rating":"2","title":"In your face truth","review":"This presentation by Ms. Hill is daring and a challenge to all who say they know God."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Car Wreck of a Album","review":"funny how just a few Years Back Lauryn Hill was the Toast of the Biz.when you hear this Set you have to be reminded of that time because this two-Set will make you think what Happened?? the Guitar Playing&Her Arrangements go nowhere they just are like One Long Random Play that has no Start,Middle or End.Her Voice isn't that strong over the course of the set either.I give Her Props for Being Daring to drop a Double Live Set but that's as far as it goes.this Set Crashes before it has a chance to turn the Corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauryn's Re-birth","review":"Sincerity within modern music is rare so what Lauryn achieves here alone with her acoustic guitar is admirable.Although at times the \\"Take me as you find me\\" attitude (Complete with vocal errors, guitar mistakes and her crying mid-song) is a bit overdone through the lengthy speeches/song introductions, the songs themselves are beautiful and display someone achieving their own personal peace.The industry may write this album off now the Grammy-nominated India Arie has the \\"Acoustic Soul\\" market covered and the album is certainly not made for radio as it contains no real standout singles. It is in fact a set of equally worthy brand new songs and messages (Aside from one Bob Marley cover and a traditional) that Lauryn wishes to share with the audience in this live, emotional and raw setting.Not everyone will be able to adust and enjoy \\"MTV Unplugged 2.0\\" but those who are willing to U-Turn with a previously multi-platinum artist may well find the proceedings fulfilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely magnificent","review":"Can I give it 6 stars?Lauryn does such a beautiful job on this album. It is incredibly refreshing to see an artist truly strip away all the corporate glitz and bare their soul. Her words mean so much and I just pray that people actually listen to her because there are view times that we get such wisdom from a music artist. This CD is what music should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"I was looking forward to this release for years...it's lacking quite a bit, though. All the songs sound very similar. Lauryn and a guitar just do not cut it. When these songs are re-worked and produced they will be much better. It sounds like a demo folk tape. Sorry, Lauryn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troubling Rough Draft","review":"Love Lauryn, love her lyrics, but this album disappoints. Borrow it before you buy it. The excessive confessionals and complaints between songs become tiresome, and Lauryn is in poor voice throughout. Unfortunately, it's embarrassing. Even the 2-disc format makes me uncomfortable. Although the spiritual and Christian content is awesome and refreshing and her guitar playing is enjoyable, the album feels like a rough draft. I hope Lauryn polishes up these songs and releases them in good voice without the awkward rambling in-between. Until then, I'll be wishing I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? Lauryn why?","review":"I did not read any reviews I went out and got this album. Now I was not expecting Misdirection 2 but I did not expect to hear Miss Hill ramble on and on about her awakening. The songs were good but She got in the way of her music. I mean good for you Lauryn, but face it we buy your albums because we like your music, if you don't think you should protect your voice (your God given gift, if you will) and show us some respect and dress up to perform, tell me what are you doing here? Miss Hill needs to get over herself and soon. If I want salvation I know where to find it. If she wants to talk about her life she should write a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milestone","review":"Lauryn's album does for hip-hop, what A Love Supreme did for jazz.Listen up and listen up good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I got to listen to this CD again.","review":"Because I do not know what this people are talking about.

Please do not buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real, the raw and the gritty","review":"Lauryn Hill has done it again and this time, she has raised the bar even further. I loved L-boogie from the second fugee album-\\"the score\\" and always thought of her as one of the dopest female MC's, up there with Lyte. She always had a warrior spirit, conscious of the battle against falsety and unrighteousness, similiar to Bob Marley. With this new album, I believe she has shown us how human she is and it is so refreshing in this day and age of \\"perfection\\". To her I say thankyou for touching my mind, body and soul.This is truly life music-from her praising the creator of the universe, to her hommage to her husband Rohan. I rate it with 5 stars because she is one of the fearless ones, revealing the real, the raw and the gritty."},{"rating":"1","title":"so much for talking...","review":"A very strange record this is.

First, the principles, if a bit simplistic and basic, are still sound ones. Second, the authors wrote the book in a way that I wasn't lost even though I hadn't read the first book in the series. And last, some of the activities in the second half of the book might be useful for some people.I personally didn't find that there was anything new in the book that I hadn't read in other places. I got bored fairly quickly, even though it was an easy read. There are only two groups of people I'd reccommend this book to -- those who absolutely loved the first book and want to have the sequel for personal, sentimental reasons, and those who in skimming through it are intrigued by the exercises and want to do them."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Need To Reel This One In","review":"Where's the beef?

The band is very small, barely fits on my arm. The button area on the front does not match up with my ipod Nano so when it is in the sleeve, i can't switch songs or mess with the volume. I would have to pull the nano out of the sleeve, switch songs, find a good volume, and then put it back into the sleeve. When you pull it out of the sleeve, the headphones often pull out of the bottom. As you can imagine, I found this all out while running on a treadmill and almost killed myself trying to get a song i liked to play at the correct volume. I really thought I was getting a deal because this was a Nike band, but it seems even Nike can put out a turd every now and again. This is fine if you don't need to switch songs or change the volume, and have skinny arms. I guess you get what you pay for, because this was pretty cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one yet","review":"I purchased one at TJ Max maybe 2 year ago. Love it! I have 24\\" biceps and it's the only one that fits and stays in place while working out. Holds my ipod in place. The one I have is getting worn and starting to fall apart. I've been looking high and low for a replacement for months. I have not encountered anything remotely close. I finally found it on AMAZON for much less than I paid originally. I purchased 3 at a time. It breaths nicely with not plastics. Velcro adjusts easily. Yes, can't see through the fabric, but who has time to be looking for music when you are serious about your workouts! If you know your Ipod you can scroll easily and adjust volume without looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst product in history","review":"The title is accurate.

It's makes it hard to use the Nike+ feature, because you can't see the screen. Mine stretched out quickly, from multiple times pulling my iPod in and out to start and stop the program. There are better models out there. Nike has tried to remedy the problem by putting out one with screen, to see the nano's screen and work it easier. I replaced mine with a Marware wrist holder for my iPod, with a space for the chip. I like it much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs view window","review":"I like everything about it except the lack of a window. It is comfortable to wear on runs and doesn't slip but if you like to look at your screen or playlists, you are out of luck with this armband.

It will teach you how to make Boston Left Turns, how to park in Back Bay, even how to cross a street as a pedestrian. Yes, it's amusing, but it's also a survival manual.

I have yet to find a recipe from this book he won't eat. I always do a taste test on everything before I give it to him and everything tastes good too.My only concern is that she introduces foods my doctor has told me NOT to give my son so early. For example, in the 6-9 month secion, she introduces citrus which I've been told not to give yet. She also introduces spinach, which my son loved, but my doctor told me is dangerous due to nitrate/nitrite conversion which can cause problems in children under 1.So, I would say this is a great recipe book, but make sure you understand what you can and cannot feed your baby before making some of these recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I love this book and have used it a lot. I love the format and pictures. It was very helpful having this when I wanted to make food for my son rather than buy it at the store. I used my own judgement as to what foods he should and shouldn't have at different ages and I found no problem with feeding him pureed meats at 8 months. He never had a problem with any foods in here either. This book is perfect for the novice baby food maker and is fun with lots of good pictures and easy to read format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much work","review":"A friend gave me this book since she didn't use it. It had great ideas for purees for my then 6 month old daughter but past 6 months the recipes were not safe for her to eat as she didn't grow her first teeth till she was 7 months old. Of course, some ingredients are too exotic and the prep times seem way off.Ms. Karmel must have had a nanny watch her 3 kids while she cooked because as a mom of 3 myself, I can't imagine having time to cook these fooods and still have time to spend with my kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I got this book on the advice of a friend and boy am I disappointed and wish I had not bothered.For me it was a waste of money for two reasons. One, I was hoping for more advice on a picky eater and there just isn't a whole lot in this book. Two, many of the recipes are nothing that my toddler would eat, and many aren't recipes I'd even want to bother with creating. I have a toddler, I don't have an hour to prepare a lunch for him.

I was wondering how it was possible for one song to make the transition from Trance (Rank 1 mix) to New York house (Johnny Vicious) to Eurodance sound (Almighty) without losing some of its credibility. Boy was I wrong!! This is the remix single of the year! Rank 1 and Johnny Vicious have the best mixes on the CD... the other ones are good, too, but they just can't compare to the greatness of those two. My question is... Curb Records is a little label from Nashville that usually releases country music (Leann Rimes, Tim McGraw, etc.)... Who is the genius on their staff that suggested a Rank 1 remix for this single? That team is barely known in the US as it is (\\"Airwave\\" is making a name for itself with a single and its inclusion on Tranceport 3).

I can't describe the smell, only that we did not care for it.And it actually did cause a reaction. Sneezy, watery eyes, etc. But it took longer to affect him than most fragrances and it wasn't as severe as some reactions he's had. Like hairspray!

I keep 4 extra AAs in the front pocket, as well as an extra memory card. I don't use the little zipper pocket inside the main pocket (in the lid), as I'm afraid the little plastic case for my memory card will scratch the camera.

To totally get the whole thing (coz these 40 minutes contain lots of transitions), it needs a couple of spins in your cd player...and lots of time. Unlike Crimson II, the first one is one big track of 40 mins and not cut in sections. What amazes me the most is that...being a musician myself, it would have been easy to write a big suite of different riffs that goes on for 40 minutes. Here, it's different. Some parts come back, wisely placed, to get a real song structure. A must to have.Sincerely."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely brilliant!","review":"this is one of my favorite albums.

The rhythm guitar sound is awesome! do yourself a favor and pick this album up, and while your at it try to stay open minded because this is simply amazing.

His life stories and reflections are definitely the most interesting parts of the book, but most of the rest pretty much boils down to 'love everyone and do onto others', so set your expectations accordingly. He may be the greatest of all time, but I don't think that entitles his book to get a free pass.It's a little ironic that while I was reading this, his religion of peace made the news, having been responsible for several recent deaths at the American embassy in Libya, as well as other parts of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"An excellent read about an amazing person, a true legend in and out of the ring.

We adore this book!","review":"My son received this book from a friend when he was born in 2009. From the moment he became interested in books this has been one of his very favorites. He calls it his 'bunny book'. The story is so simplistic - a bunny living in the forest, capturing the fun he has with each passing season. The illustrations are great, and the sentences are easy for a young reader. I'm not sure if you can get this in paperback, but if so I would advise against it. Ours is a board book and is already showing a little wear from so much toddler love. A paperback probably wouldn't stand the test of time as well. We have enjoyed this book so much I now give it to parents-to-be for their own new baby's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bunny Book Review","review":"Great book and great price. Agree with all others on 5 stars for this clever story. Regular read at nighttime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perennial favorite","review":"This is a short and sweet story narrated by Nicholas, a little bunny. He walks us through his favorite activities of each season, from chasing butterflies in the spring to watching the snow fall in winter. Only a few pages are dedicated to each season, and there is only one line on each page. This is an ideal bedtime book, as it ends with Nicholas curling up to sleep in his hollow tree home. My favorite parts about it are how beautifully it is illustrated and that it encourages discussion with your children about the seasons and activities associated with each one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books Ever","review":"This book is great for kids!! It is just like the old one (I Am a Mouse), which was my favorite as a kid! I would recommend this book to anyone who has a child!

I had it when I was a child, and it was one of my favorites even throughout adolescence! Gorgeous illustrations. Richard Scarry was and is still one of my favorite childrens' authors and illustrators. I still have my copy of the book from my childhood, and my brother has his copy from his childhood, I've purchased copies for both of my children, and I frequently gift it to young ones and new babies.

He's only four months old, but he already listens to our words and his eyes seem to begin to follow the pictures as we read to him. My niece loved the book so much she had it memorized. It's just the right kind of book for starting out the very young on a lifetime of reading. The hard, pages of the this \\"Sturdy Book\\" should last a lifetime.

Having read the manga, I can say that the it only gets more depressing and bloody, which is not neccesarily a bad thing. All things aside, Gantz really explores ideas about human interaction, and this volume really fleshes out the character of Kurono, while at the same time making him a complete badass. This show just gets better and better with each volume, and I hope that ADV will decide to extend the series beyond just the two announced seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Turn Based Strategy","review":"Pacific General is the best, the third and the last of the Panzer General games that I enjoyed. (I find Panzer General 2 and 3 graphically much better, but the maps are smaller, gameplay more confined, and Rpg elements superficially added.) Pacific General has the same system as Panzer General and Allied General with an added naval combat system. I found this game both addictive and fun. There are also free mods on the internet which allow you add scenarios and campaigns. The only thing I dislike is the sickly green colored maps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pacific General","review":"I have Panzer General and Allied General and this game is a disappointment.

Participants are asked to draw numbers in the air, sometimes adding a wavylegged motion or two; even as a beginner, I think I know that this is nowhere near authentic Tai Chi. It has all the depth of a two o'clock in the morning infomercial, and will require about as much of your attention--I did, however, wake up at one point where Bright-Fey holds up a cardboard Yin-Yang diagram and attempts to expain what it means. The important thing, he expounds in kindergarten teacher vioce, is that \\"it's round\\". He then chucks this Yin-Yang medallion off stage right, like a frisbee. In short, Bright-Fey knows exactly nothing that I am interested in learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you're 80, pass on this one.","review":"Most Tai Chi videos are pretty bad. Either the moves are too intricate, the pace is too fast or the camera is in the wrong place for the spatially challenged. I have owned several and most ended up in the trash.New Forest Tai Chi breaks new ground - it is just plain silly. Essentially, you paint the numbers 1 through 10 in the air with your hands. There! You just learned Tai Chi - Finger Paint Style.But in truth, this might be good for someone with limited mobility and who could care less about \\"grasping the bird's tail\\". Still, its a little pricey.My recommendation is a VHS tape called Discovering Chi by Linda Modaro. I wish they would re-release this in a DVD format. In my opinion, this is the only one worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tai Chi that spoke to me.","review":"This is a great beginnner video. It was simple, the instructor was personable, I felt like I was in the room with him. I was able to do each step, each movement.

If he has another tape, I will order it."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Forest Review","review":"I have medical problems that don't allow me to exercise the way I would like to. I started using the New Forest Tai Chi dvd about 3 weeks ago. It's a slow moving flowing motion that's very easy to do. I enjoy doing it because it's low key, but at the same time it's toning up the body. I love the \\"painting\\" motions. I actually find this dvd very relaxing and fun to do. No more do I dread doing exercise!!

What a complete waste of money.1. The DVD was obviously made from a poor quality VHS version2. The instructor was annoying, knew nothing about Tai Chi, and he did all of his Tai Chi showing you his back (there was no mirror in front of him, so you just had to guess what he was doing)3. There is no music at all4. There was no Tai Chi done at all! A Tai Chi routine does not consist of drawing 1-10 in the air over and over again. His \\"40 minute tai chi workout\\" was not a work out, not tai chi, and not even 40 minutes (more like 5 minutes repeated 8 times!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"How to fake Tai Chi and Impress the Undiscerning","review":"I bought this video based on the glowing reviews, and was extremely disappointed. While it undoubtedly has some exercise value for impatient westerners, this quick and dirty \\"T'ai Chi\\" resembles the classic form in the same way air guitar resembles Segovia.Basically, the method consists of three steps forward, one to the side -- three step backwards, one to the side, while tracing the numbers 1 to 10 in the air. Add to this some \\"wind and water\\" (sway), and some straddle-the-railroad-tracks posture and you have this method in a nutshell.I suggest this use of the tape: seize the tape box, take one step forward, sway, trace a large zero in the air, and drop it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading label; Awful for anyone in decent health","review":"This is labelled a beginner's introduction to Tai Chi. I'm a beginner. Unfortunately it too easy for even beginners and only vaguely related to Tai Chi. It's essentially a rehab tape.

I tried watching the video, but turned it off after five minutes. Why? I found the instructor to not only annoying, but condescending as well. It was like he was teaching a group of six year olds. The annoying part was that his presentation style resembled an aerobics class more than a dojo. If it were possible, I would give this video a neagative one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money painting by numbers","review":"This video is awful!

It's also very irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever it is, it's not Tai Chi","review":"This was a complete waste of money. The routine was simplistic and repetitive. This wasn't a work-out.

First of all, psychoanalysis is not a science, which makes these authors' approach to Anne Frank and Etty Hillesum's respective ordeals cheap enough, but even with that, it's an abomination to put two women who were victims of the Holocaust under such horrific, over-analyzed scrutiny.

This book is so bad it's unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adonis and So Much More","review":"Iron Men by Lorenzo Gomez is spectacular! There is not as much full-frontal nudity as one might typically expect in this genre of book but that in no way diminishes the magnificent photography and selection of models. The choice of men that appear in Iron Men is outstanding - well developed specimens of all that is naturally male and wonderfully athletic. It might be easy to create a photospread of men posing around an industrial site but to do so without appearing \\"queerly campy\\" takes real artistic talent! Iron Men achieves this and celebrates the incredible beauty of the male form as art. Lorenzo Gomez is the kind of creative master for whom professional cameras are made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit stopped working after just 2 weeks.","review":"Initially I was impressed by the performance of the Nuvi370.

Or bring it with you on a place and put it in the rental car. I went to Brazil, and aside from having to get the Brazil maps loaded on in advance, worked very nicely, with Points Of Interest there too.The fact that they made the traffic antenna a seperate thing is a bit ugly, hopefully that part is integrated into the devices soon (if not in the newer models allready)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help for travel","review":"Bought this to go on a trip to Europe and as a present for my wife to use at home.

Loudspeaker volume (for me) was a bit too low for noisy situations (radio or music being played). More seriously, spoken commands arrive a moment too late, when one is approaching a turn; in city traffic, it is easy to miss a turn if one doesn't drive extra slowly. In this regard, my experience with a Tom Tom Go providing really timely instruction was much better. The compactness and portability of the Garmin Nuvi 370, however, are most enjoyable, and the multiple means of charging the battery, with all the necessary hardware provided, is truly splendid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had purchased it long ago","review":"I love my Garmin Nuvi 370 and wish I had purchased it long before this. The directions are spoken in a clear voice (with street names) and if you make a wrong turn or start out in a diferent way it recalculates the directions quickly. It is also bluetooh compatible for hands free talking which is a plus for me because I make a lot of calls from the car. I will be trying out the European maps in Dec. when I take it to Germany and am excited about that. I love that it is small and lightweight so I can just drop it in my purse. Don't worry about putting it through xray when going through airport security.........I've done it and everything was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS","review":"This is the first portable unit I have owned.

I drove from Florence to Venice and back. It took me right to my reserved parking area. From Florence to Pisa and back with a side trip to Lucca. No problems. Florence to Rome one way straight to my hotel which was hard to find even by the local taxis as we were sort of on the outskirts. Then finally from my hotel in Rome to the international airport. Again no problems. I even got it to locate the flight we were on once. At 700 MPH plus I had a problem having it log on more than once though.If I could add an option it would be to add a view current location. It always wants you to go somewhere. It has the option but it seems to stick to the last location you went to.If you are using this unit to travel with I recommend you pre-save the locations that are important to you saving time when you are ready to start.Careful driving in Italy though.

I bought it because I want the European Map. Everything works as expected and better than my three previous Garmin units. However, there are at least two things that can be improved. First, the text-to-speech sound is very tinny and not loud enough if you are over sixty years old or your radio is playing. Next, it cannot pronounce Spanish names correctly. This is very annoying living in Southern California. It will be fun when I go to France or Germany. By the way, if you want a lot of POI, you will be disappointed. In my opinion, Garmin has never been great on POI, but they excel on the important things on navigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"I bought this for an extended trip to the British Isles and Switzerland.

In no time, it has become one of my favorite gadgets. It is still able to do things I have yet to figure out, of course. But for the basic get-me-from-here-to-there, it is quite magnificent, and I look for chances to go somewhere new for the fun of using it. It has been rock solid accurate, right down to where the place is on the street. Choice of routes is excellent. It's pretty easy to tell it where you want to go. The instructions are given in very timely fashion. I am now working on my timing: if I ask, \\"What do I do next?\\" at the right time, I can sometimes trick my passenger into thinking it's a real conversation ...P.S.It finds addresses in Italy perfectly well, although I won't be there until next month.

The only real problem for me is that many locations are not up to date. The strip mall down the street opened over 2 years ago and only around half the locations are in the Garmin. I did an update of their software and none of the locations missing came up. I realize there is some turnaround in getting this stuff mapped, but 2+ years should be enough time especially given that around half the businesses are there. They all opened pretty close to the same time.

In Pagosa Springs, CO the Nuvi sent us to an incorrect address for our motel. After driving around the arrival location several times, we found our motel's address was 260 EAST Highway 160 while the Nuvi had sent us to 260 WEST Highway 160. While we were driving from Chinle to Kayenta on BIA Highway 59, the Nuvi kept telling us to take unpaved side roads to Kayenta. This may have been because I had set the Nuvi for 'shortest distance' instead of 'least time'. Overall, we are very pleased with the Nuvi's performance and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Nuvi 370 Review","review":"A wonderful service and product sold by Amazon.It is idiot proof, easy to use.

Many of the flies covered in this book have prooven themselves as excellent patterns in their original state. Not all patterns were meant for cdc!

Its narratives are the literary equivalent of a Grandma Moses painting: a moment of time in rural America. Most of the narratives of ghostly encounters are charming, but not very frightening, because there is no evocation of tension or suspense. The first story in the book is probably the scariest because it is one of the few that does build up to supernatural climax. One of my favorite stories is about a guardian spirit who warns his human if there is speed trap on the road ahead. Another is about an old woman who made a pact with the devil, so that she could spy on her neighbors through a flour sifter.At any rate, although this book did not really haunt me or frighten me in any way, you may be charmed by its tales of rural Appalachia."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"I recently bought two AMCOR air purifiers, the AM-90, and this purifier, the AM-40. I was impressed with both, AMCOR makes cheap but solid products. Usually good air purifiers run hundreds of dollars but these purifiers get the job done for much less. If your on a budget, and need a dusty basement made breathable (what I used the AM-90 for) it works for that. I used the AM-40 in my bedroom. I did not notice as much of effect as the AM-90, but the filters in the AM-40 did pick up dust, and the air is a little easier to breath in the bedroom. For a big room or a really dusty room, I would spend the extra 50 bucks and get the AM-90.Just as a side note, I was unable to find the square footage the AM-90 covered until after I bought the product, when I was reading the manual. Its 400 sq feet. The AM-40 is a much smaller purifier, it works for a small to midsize room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I just picked this up at the library and totally enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

Because the family had a somewhat famous ancestor, it was possible to assemble information going back that far.

While no fault of the prose, it just seemed too soon for this writer to tackle the subject from a biographical standpoint.The insights and personal revelations therefore had a more superficial, anecdotal feel rather than the wisdom and depth that I had expected.

What's so brilliant about this multi-generational memoir is that by the end of the book you know exactly what the author means by \\"Sedgwickiness\\" and the word lingers in your mind long after you close the pages. Nowadays, I catch myself thinking, \\"Well, that's a very Sedgwicky person,\\" or \\"Oh what a Sedgwicky thought I just had.\\" When an author changes the way you see the world, even by one or two clicks, he has achieved greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic crystal","review":"I was disappointed to find this model watch has a soft plastic crystal that scratched the first day I wore it to work.

I read it for the first time about three weeks ago and loved it, but I rushed through it a little and wanted to take another look. After the second reading, I am only more impressed. Michael Koryta is the youngest mystery writer I have ever read but he has still written one of the finest first books I've ever read. The book is dialogue-heavy, much like Robert B. Parker, and I love that style. The conversations are fast and witty and most importantly, they seem real. Lincoln Perry is a wonderful narrator, and Koryta creates his supporting cast vividly without getting into too much detail. The characters are developed through their words and actions in a plot that takes one twist after another. With Les Roberts no longer writing detective novels, it looks like Michael Koryta is poised to take over as Cleveland's finest noir writer.

Actually, these are the only two flavors that I enjoy drinking alone without mixing other things into the drink. The only other one that I can stomache in Chocolate Fudge.

More importantly to me is the fact that I have seen very few audio receivers that support a turntable, and I have a great collection of old vinyl - sometimes I like to reminisce! For those interested, my needs are for more background music, so I can't comment on how it sounds amped up full tilt, but overall, I think this was a great value and suits my needs just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke after 3 months","review":"I bought this receiver in May 2006 (made in China....).It broke in Aug due to no signal could be sent to speaker.

Upon contacting Teac America I was treated discourteously and informed my only options were to send it to them for repair or return it to Amazon. When I asked why Teac did not support their new product with an out of box failure again their attitude was less than caring in fact they seemed uninterested at all. I contacted Amazon for return and was treated as I would expect from them very apologetic and helpfull and a full refund was promised which I am sure will be the case.

This is especially unreasonable in my mind since the pre-Trib viewpoint is the one that has the least support from the Scriptures that I can see.Different escatological viewpoints should be approached with respect and humility, with an open mind and an understanding that the Bible is not clear on exactly which view is correct.

It is unfortunate that more undergraduate curricula and textbooks don't follow the axiomatic, yet cleanly-written style of Apostol. Standard texts (e.g. Stewart) pull theorems out of the error without proof, as if the point of taking calc is to get it done and over with as quickly as possible.To be sure, Apostol isn't for everyone. If you are fascinated by color pictures and your primary interest is to learn the bare minimum, buy another book. But if you want to get more out of your undergraduate calc, whether you're a math or science major, or you're studying on your own (I meet both criteria), Apostol is the way to go.This is a must if you're thinking of taking any higher math.

I found Apostle's book to be the best in three fundamental respects, first, he treat each subject deeply and masterfully leaving no confusion in the reader's mind- see for example his treatment of several variable differentiation .Second, in advance he penpoints the main issues of each subject and discuss complexity of developing theory and generlizing theorems toward more advanced levels. Third, he supplied in his book very intersting and illuminating collections of exercises throughout the book. If you think you are a mathematically oriented thinker you should study advanced calculus the way apostol exhibited in his book. I just say this is a distinguished book for a distinguished student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but only if you want a deep treatment","review":"This is one of the best math books I have ever used; Apostol does a great job of giving you intuition and telling you why the topics are important. The exposition is very clear.However, this is not your usual Calculus I book. The level of approach is halfway between an intro to calc class where you learn HOW to calculate derivatives/integrals, and a real analysis class where you learn why derivatives and integrals are related and their axiomatic foundations.Bottom line: this is a great book if you want to understand calculus deeply. It is a warmup for real analysis. However, there are probably better books if your only interest in calculus is for using it to solve engineering or physics problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thoughtful Interpretation of Lovecraft","review":"Despite some of the film's peculiarities and idiosyncrasies, this adaptation of Lovecraft does an excellent job of accomplishing the primary objective of any cosmic horror -related weird tale: atmosphere.

The film looked interesting, but upon viewing it that was the extent of it. Its look was the best thing about it. The script was weak, and while I'm sure the actors did the best they could with what they were given they really didn't do that well. Of course, that fault could well lie with the director, as sometimes they can be so intent on visual atmosphere that they suppress the emotional atmosphere. It wouldn't be the first time that's been the case in a movie. The end result, whatever the case, is a pretty boring film with fairly unsympathetic characters weaving their way through gloomy events, and in the end I really didn't care at all what happened to any of them.

To some it up quickly, guy's mom dies...guy gets involved in this sinister plot of the cult his father runs...weird stuff happens...irrelevant weird stuff...bad twist ending that is in no way relevant to the way the character has acted the entire movie. The most ridiculous part is the previews were all gay dramas, but the fact that the character is gay has nothing to do with anything, nothing at all. Its mind boggling how any of this movie works.

It fails to build suspense or terror, while the actors flatly deliver their lines. Like other one-star reviewers of this film, I wish I could give it zero-stars.It never ceases to amaze me how H.P. Lovecraft can inspire so many writers and yet no one seems to be able to adapt any of his stories to the screen without ruining his work.

It's a book for those who enjoy plays, adventure, and books that take place in the 1800's. It's also a book for those who enjoy historical and realistic fiction. I think it's neat how it didn't even happen but it fits into time like it really did. I believe it's an interesting book, but it's also in some ways true. Even though it is called the Shakespeare Stealer it's also about some of Shakespeare's greatest plays. At different points of the book they're either at a play, practicing for a play, or on a trip to an other place where they will enjoy another one of Shakespeare's great plays. I would probably recommend this book to boys because I'm not sure if girls would enjoy the fast paced action of this book.

Although this sentiment unfortunately is somewhat accurate within the historical framework in the novel, its use in the novel was completely unnecessary to the unfolding of the story. There was nothing of relevance in the story that made its inclusion sensible. The anti-semitism of the characters came across as intentional and hateful rather than part of the historical fiction. It was apropos of nothing in the story. It just hung there and left you wondering \\"From whence came this?\\" \\"Is this what we teach children?\\" It was very disappointing. I would advise against reading this book unless you're prepared to explain anti-semitism to your children, historically and in today's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morgan's Review","review":"I loved the book.

The story did kind of fit the title because there was a person who was like a stealer in the story. I only gave this book 4 stars because I felt it could of been alittle better. It wasn't bad or anything but it really didn't have a lot of action. So if you want a book that has some act but if not the greatest book i ever read you mint like it.

It was fun to read about what life might have been like for an apprentice at the Globe theater, working with Shakespeare. There are enough sword fights and adventure to keep boys interested. I would have liked more details about Widge's moments on stage, how it felt to become an actor, etc. The story is told almost entirely from back stage, and it would have been exciting to have been inside Widge's heart and head while he was on stage.

I definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to write!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, not writing.","review":"This book starts off very slow. I was hoping for more writing advice, but all I got was super-wordy. Bare Bones takes awhile to get to the point. Mainly the writer has a bunch of stories rather than advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing Down the Bones","review":"This book is well written and teaches those of us who aspire to write exactly how to go about it. I definitely recommend it without hesitation as it is positive, encouraging and clarifies a step by step approach on how to write; that is not just think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book","review":"Writing Down Bones is a good book for a start-up writer. It shares the passion, the heart, and the depth of being a truly heart-felt writer.However, the book does seem to concentrate on the romanticism of writing rather than any reality that is connected to being a writer. A real writer wants to be read not only just write. A real writer wants to be able to earn a living somehow from their writing not just to write only for the pleasure.It is true that a real writer has an urgency to write more than anything else; but a real writer also wants to advance and succeed in their writing.As I said, this is a good book for the beginner to learn how to delve deep into the psyche and pull out the heart.Be aware, viewers, that this is a book originally printed in the 80s and written by a product of the 60s so there are some very anti-traditional viewpoints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unleash the writer in you!","review":"This how-to style account of writing without limitations is filled with great advice to unleash your own writing style. Excellent advice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Free Flowing from the Heart","review":"Natilie Goldberg inpires and motivates writers to be true to themselves and write from the heart. Ms. Goldberg's experience with her desire to connect with herself spills off the pages. She allows herself to be self-absorbed in her work, and offers the reader wisdom from her past experiences. Her titles are humorous, and they help to build metaphors pertaining to writing. Goldberg's writing is easy and free flowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you own one writing book...","review":"This is the one book that I would recommend to aspiring writers. After re-reading several times, I felt so much better about my own writing that I had nearly tripled my good output! This is a fantastic book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Too hokey.","review":"I've read a fair amount of books on writing. I know this one is considered a \\"classic\\" in the genre, but I didn't care for it. It has some good practical advice. Nothing I haven't heard or read elsewhere, but good reminders nonetheless. But what I'll probably remember about this book is the flakiness of Goldberg, who insists on referring to her Zen training in every chapter. Enough about Katagiri Roshi and your meditations already. I'm sure they're wonderful for you. And the chapter that starts, \\"There were several time in Taos that I called a story-telling circle,\\" makes me want to rip the page out and eat it. Try BIRD BY BIRD or even STEPHEN KING'S ON WRITING before this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading for anyone passionate about writing!","review":"Hands down one of the best books I've read about writing. Goldberg is refreshingly honest and candid about herself and the process of writing. There is no beating around the bush in this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for everyone","review":"This book is excellent in the way that if you follow the instructions in the book, you can not only improve your writing, but also your life. Natalie Goldberg taught you how to establish a habit of trusting your inner self, your intuition, which let you have more confidence in your own thinking, and more acceptance to your own self. This in turn promote your self esteem. Through practising writing the way Natalie told, you may transform the habit of intergrating your real thought and actions to your daily life. It is wonderful that a writing guidance book can have such psychotherapy effect"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrasing Proselytizing of Eastern Religion","review":"The book has little to do with writing and more to do with Eastern religion. If you don't want to hear about the mindless philosophies that have transcended into America in recent years, then don't buy this book; the author bondards you with it. I felt it was not only a waste of my money, but also deceiving. I wanted a book about writing, instead I had to hear about this persons religion, and pay for it! Total disappointment and a feeling that I was ripped off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-intentioned, but more therapy than writing","review":"I heard an interview with Ms. Goldberg on To the Best of Our Knowledge about a year ago in which she told ofher utter shock that her guru Ravi (whatshisname) was sleeping with students. I couldn't believe the naivette of this woman. Years earlier, when I read her book and she was quoting the guy, I had the same response as Tom Bissell in his Believer article, \\"Uh-oh.\\"If you're looking perhaps for a way into creativity or to rearrange your ideas of the word, this insight-lite book might give you some pointers. The more skeptical aspiring writer, however, will find it a little too airie fairie for their tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear oh dear oh dear","review":"I was recommended this book by a songwriters' forum as a must-have. How ironic that a book specifically about the art of penmanship is itself written in such a clumsy style. While there are some useful tips about ways to discipline yourself to write, nothing would induce me to pick up anything else by this author. While Ms Goldberg means well, I'm sure, the fact that one can do something does not automatically imply that one is good at it. At best turgid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & Lacking Substance","review":"This book is lacking substance. She talks about Zen & it's teachings. I'm not interested in reading about Zen. I don't share her opinion in writing practice. I believe quality is more important than quantity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me","review":"I somehow thought this book had something to do with writing. It was more how to view things from a Buddist perspective...waste of money if one wanted to actually learn to hone writing skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"A triumph! Very inspirational","review":"This is perhaps one of the most helpful books on writing I've ever read. Natalie Goldberg is part guru, part therapist, part best friend. I highly recommend this book to anyone who writes for a living, wishes they wrote for a living and especially for anyone who's convinced they can't ever write for a living. She'll remind you what you love so much about the written word and reawaken your enthusiasm for literature. Best of all she'll encourage you all the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"guaranteed to spread misconceptions","review":"\\"Writing Down the Bones\\" is filled with a bunch of vague, generalized \\"writing exercises\\" which are of no help to serious craftsmen. The book is guaranteed to spread misconceptions as to the nature of Zen Buddhism. Worse, it is guaranteed to spread misconceptions as to the nature of writing and will lead the reader to believe that discipline and order have no place in writing. As Richard Wilbur said, \\"The strength of the genie comes from its being imprisoned in the bottle.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and to the point.","review":"If you are a writer, or think that you may be one, buy this book NOW. It offers to-the-point advise. I LOVE this book. Actually, I think I'll read it again after I write this review. I recommended it to several friends, and now they are hooked too. BUY IT... YOU'LL LOVE IT....!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you teach this book is excellent","review":"I have done MANY of these excercises with students in my creative writing classes and they get a LOT out of them. Sure, not everything in this book will work with everyone in every writing situation. But there are some really very good ideas in this book. It does help if you can think creatively because then you see where the author is coming from. But if you're trying to write your first novel at 55 and are stuck after 12 pages, this is NOT the book for you. Keep browsing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivational","review":"Natalie Goldberg is very transparent. Her honesty is refreshing. This book was very motivational for a person who thinks she might want to try writing a book and doesn't have a clue where to start!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller Than Expected","review":"This book has some interesting writing tips, but its so small and unsubstantial! Not what I expected, but great if you're looking for a fun, pocket-sized writing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have Bed Side Reading","review":"Natlie Goldberg's \\"Writing down the Bones\\" is a welcome addition to my life. Her insights on the craft of writing gets to the heart of the matter with a zen like simplicity. Goldberg's combination of practical tips, personal experiences, and sage wisdom motivated me to break out the pen and paper and pour my heart out. Her stripped down writing style makes each chapter a short soundbite of inspiration. \\"Writing Down the Bones\\" is easy to pick up and put down so it fits right in on my crowded nightstand. I found that I can rely on it to give me something new and different each time I pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I might have liked this when I was a teenage hippie.","review":"I have to agree with most of the negative reviews of this book. There is little of substance that would help a serious student of writing. It is also terribly repetative. How many different ways can you say \\"write all the time even if it is drivel?\\" I stuggled to get through this book for three months, reading a couple of the small chapters at a time. Finally couldn't stand the boredom and lack of substance. I recommend \\"Writing the Wave\\" by Elizabeth Ayres instead for a stimulating, immediately engaging help for aspiring writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"My problem is not with Natalie Goldberg's book...","review":"This edition is TINY. I would love to be reviewing Natalie Goldberg's book right now, but apparently Amazon saw fit not to include the warning \\"This book is only 3 by 4 1/2 inches in size (text inside occupies a 2 1/2 by 3 1/2 inch area on the page).\\"The is not the sort of book I already have mostly memorized; but if I had, perhaps it would help to have this tiny reference around to jog my memory now and again. Indeed, I do not foresee ever reading it because it is too tiny to hold, or to see. Moreover, since it is a guide to writing, I would ideally like to be jotting notes in the margins. But the margins are about an eighth of an inch wide. So you see my problem.Amazon, please carry normal sizes. There's a reason for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless fluff","review":"So what is it that Goldberg is trying to accomplish? Is she trying to convert people to zen? Is she a mouthpiece for Katagiri Roshi (whose name she brings up about every fifteen pages or so)? If she's trying to teach people how to write, she fails miserably. She takes a lot of time to say absolutely nothing and instead delivers common sense wrapped with pseudo-sagely drivel. The only redeeming feature? It proves that ANYONE can be published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychobabble Mamma!","review":"This book is good for a very specific and narrow purpose:IF you are a newly-hatched, fuzzy writerling, and IF you are seriously low on self-esteem and confidence, and (most importantly) IF you are a fan of unfocused, vaguely New-Agey spirituality and guru-isms as a substitute for actual information, then this book will be greatly helpful to you.Otherwise, give it a miss and spend your self-esteem money on a nice new pen and some chocolates."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book about writing!","review":"This book motivated me to take a dream I had had for years and actually do something about it. I loved everything about this book, especially the author's sense of humor and ability to take all the rules about writing and ditch them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunshine Book","review":"So, years ago, when i was in college, we called this the \\"shooting sunshine up your **s book\\". Ms Goldberg is unfailingly and irritatingly cheery about writing and also about the reader's ability to write, even to write well.However, in the years since i first read this book, it is a book that i refer back to frequently. Writing is difficult. Writing well, writing with truth, writing down to the bone, is gut wrenching. That's why sometimes, Ms Goldberg's cheer, her certainty that it is possible, lingers in the back of my mind. At the end of the day, the difficulty in writing is cutting thru the crap to the beautiful simplicity. She gets it - and she'll help you get it too.So, as much as this book annoyed me when i first read it, I'm glad I did. It has served me well. It'll do the same for you.Maybe we all could you use a little sunshine shot up our...Happy writing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good things come in small packages...","review":"This is the first pocket book I ever had that truly fits into a pocket! Physically it is delightfully diminutive. Reading it has been delightfully inspiring. I started writing after about two and a half chapters, and I haven't stopped writing since. (I even started drawing again after a 25 year hiatus). Natalie has totally conquered novice and veteran writer's block. With an informal combination of attitude, method, tips, personal anecdotes and an overall deft touch, the reader quickly comes to understand how to write. Everything about this book is authentic. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most practical tool a writer can have in their kit!","review":"Natalie Goldberg has given us a handbook that no serious writer can afford to be without. Writing Down the Bones brings us through fun and inspirational exercises to get the creative juices flowing, while all the while reminding us just why it is we write. I've never been the same after reading and taking this book to heart. It should be on every writer's bookshelf at the very least; carry it with you if you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just The Bones","review":"For the money, this book isn't so hot. Just a collection of essays that tend to be repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing down to the bones","review":"The book was delivered 5 days later than scheduled.

Rather than offering practical advice, I found the book romanticized the process. At the time I read it, I was looking for a guide similar to Vicki King's How to Write a Movie in 21 Days (except for novel writing). I have yet to find that sort of a book, but I just completed the first draft of my novel mostly on the advice from Stephen King's On Writing, and a few select parts of Jack Bickham's work. If you actually want to get some work done, read the aforementioned books. If you would rather read about writing (or are looking for advice like, \\"Try writing at a coffee shop\\"), then you might try this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and off-topic","review":"I have to agree with several other people. The 'rah-rah, you can do it!' attitude might make beginners feel good, but it will probably seem like empty calories once they are facing the task of actually placing good prose onto blank sheets of paper.Also, I could have done with more mechanics and less biography. The Buddhist proselytizing was unexpected and unwelcome.For good nuts and bolts of how to write well, there are other books to try, such as the Writers' Digest series or \\"How to Write a Damn Good Novel\\" by James Frey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Not very helpful for screenwriter, although I got the recommendation from Scriptbully website.

I can't remember where I first heard about \\"Writing Down the Bones,\\" but the recommendation was so intriguing that I had to order the tapes. Now I drive along in my car listening to Natalie Goldberg describe all the things we have in common, and her words validate me as a writer. Because of \\"Writing Down the Bones,\\" I acknowledge writing as my \\"practice\\" and have stopped scattering my energies. Thank you, Natalie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are her assumptions?","review":"Natlie Goldberg seems to make two ustated assumptions:1) that what you are writing is very autobiographical2) that you have a hard time writing (Oh, poor author. Let me hold your hand.)If this is true you may find her book useful. If you are writing more imaginatively or if you are interested in making your writing more intense and effective I would not choose her book. If you seek technique, rather than just encouragement, try Marge Piercy's \\"So You Want to Write.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"indescribably bad","review":"This lady, herself, can't write a lick, and she tries to teach you to do the same. She comes off exactly like Deepak Chopra or one of those similar new-age hacks, putting together a series of meaningless, stream-of-consciousness psychobabble catchphrases and then marketing it as some kind of how-to book. There isn't one sentence of useful information in this thing. I say all this from the perspective of a person who has actually had things published, including a how-to book, in fact, and it strikes me that what is presented here is the sort of romantic fantasy about writing that people who have no chance of getting anything published like to delude themselves with, which explains its popularity. I guess that the most amazing thing is that every so often one of these clowns does somehow manage to get one of these vague, feelgood books in print that then sells a zillion copies to other, like-minded dreamers. Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short Chapters with useful information...","review":"When I first began this book I wasn't sure what to expect... when I browsed through the book my first reaction was that it had short chapters. It was an easy read but it contained a wealth of information.Some of the information I was already familiar with; but it was a review of the techniques that I had forgotten. It also reminded me of the simple things in life that I could write about and how easy it is choose a topic.I really liked the idea of setting up a writing practice and Natalies's suggestion of filling a notebook per month is a suggestion that I will follow.Overall, this book had many good suggestions for developing a personal writing practice, overcoming writer's block, and other writing issues.

Although it may be useful as a background read, it is so fraught with misinformation that it is worthless as an actual travel guide.In addition to pervasive map inaccuracies, misquoted prices, misprints, and overly generous descriptions, the book's major shortcoming is that the country has changed so much since this edition was released that many of the businesses reviewed no longer exist and newer businesses aren't mentioned.Do not buy this book until they come out with a new edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dominican Adventures","review":"I had only a brief five day visit to the DR in the Fall of 2006 for a wedding. Even though I was traveling with a local-speaking partner who had been to the DR many times, I still bought the Lonely Planet book and used it to help build an itinerary. I only had a chance to visit the Southeast corner of the country, as well as the city of Santo Domingo. The Lonely Planet guide helped me find clean and affordable accomodations for less than $50USD/night right on the beach where we rented a local fishing boat for two days to go diving and snorkeling in the local reefs. I'm looking forward to going back to explore other parts of the country. Rental cars were inexpensive, but driving in the DR is an experience as it almost seemed like a \\"free-for-all\\" at times.

The long tines allow for deep cultivation and the length of its handle makes it easy to reach farther while staying upright (better for my back).So, this is a great tool, well made and quite strong (necessary here as I remove fairly good size rocks from the soil). So of course it is a little heavier than perhaps the commonly found smaller cultivating hooks, but it is worth it because you can use it for many other things besides cultivating your beds, such as making big piles of prunnings, moving rock piles, pulling down hay bales, etc...So, if you are serious about gardening and have a large garden or a small farm, this is the tool for you.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed feelings","review":"The soft cloth is O.K.

The acting is pretty much bad across the board, with the exception of Rochon. There is very little horror in this movie. I swear, this thing wouldn't scare a two year old. And the killer has the worst weapon I've ever seen in a horror movie. The weapon looks like a spork. A knife would have been far better, even if it's been the weapon of choice in hundreds of slasher movies already. The sound is also very bad in this \\"film\\". I had the volume turned up all the way on my computer, and was still having trouble hearing some of the dialogue. Santa Claws is just trash!

As you might expect of someone who was considered \\"precocious\\" as a girl, I could definitely identify with Dorilys the Stormqueen. But don't let the book's title lead you to ignore the other well-drawn characters -- Dorilys would certainly enjoy the attention if she were around for it, but there are other powerful and interesting characters central to the sad tale.Stormqueen! is the kind of book you want to read and get a good friend to read so that you can discuss all the issues it brings up -- the ethical questions it raises have no easy resolution either within the story or in real life, but the book is worth reading and the issues it raises worth discussing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Touching","review":"Of all the Darkover novels (a wonderful series, everyone of them), this is the one that most captures the beauty of the planet Darkover and the horror of laran gone wrong. The protagonist Dorilys Rockraven is understandable and amusing. A true heart-breaker, especially the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stormqueen is the book that pulled me into Darkover.","review":"This was the first Darkover novel that made its way into my hands. It describes the \\"Gifts\\" of several families, and the hazards and heartache that led to/resulted from the breeding programs of the Comyn.

For one they changed the title from Laputa to just Castle in the Sky. Laputa refers to the floating island in the classic tale of Gullivers Travels. Which I adore and had hoped Castle in the Sky would pay tribute to it.I thought Pazu's voice was a bit old sounding for him and Anna Paquins voice dub just annoyed me. I would have enjoyed this film more if it weren't for the poor choice of voice actors.The film is gorgeous and for its time it is remarkable. But I feel that it is best viewed in the original Japanese.Castle in the Sky"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like it!","review":"Ok, so I heard of this movie when I was about...7 on a trailer on the movie 'Kiki's deleviery service\\" ( Great movie, I reccomend).

I love all things Celtic and was excited to pick up a good piece of historical fiction since it got decent reviews. But instead of being a fun novel about druids, it was a long drawn out whine about an old man who was losing his faith and withering away.In her defense, the author does use good imagery and detail, and the descriptions of magic are convincingly authentic. But the book itself is way too dull.And for a quick criticism of the audiobook: I hate male narrators that use falsetto when they do female voices. It sounds absolutely ridiculous.

And in fact, when i got it, i have to say that i was initially pleased considering the price i paid for it. When it came to real day to day use, this watch is a clunker. First off, the analog screen and time hands have such low contrast, that it takes a few seconds to really see the time. Why would they design it this way - silver hands on a silver face??? Then setting the time is a detailed, annoying process. Once i figured it out, it was fine, then recently, when he went into daylight savings time, i was able to set the digital time, but now, i cannot set the analog time as one of the buttons seems to be sketchy!!!! Highly NOT recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS GRT","review":"This Watch is gud but the major flaw in it is the setting of time zones i.e.,world time of many cities ,its setting is completely wrong.I am really shocked on the settings ,but overall appearence is gud.Moreover shipping is bad because its jus dropped in front of the house without any notice ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the $21.00....+ some!!!","review":"Great watch!

This one cost about $20, looks nice, keeps time in 2 zones: 1 by analog hands, the other in the digital screen at the bottom, just like before. But the analog hands are not set by a twist screw as before; you push a button to change it, then hold another one down till the hands reposition.But the hands only move clockwise. So when i need to reset them for an earlier time zone, I have to go all the way around 23 hours to get there.THEN - when it's dark and you want to know what time it is, you push a button to turn on a backlite. BUT - it's glary and the hands are the same color as the face so you can't see the hands anyway. And no way can you read the digital face in the dark with the lite on.REally dumb. Very surprised at Casio. A very thoughtless product. 2 stars, that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"alarm is so polite that it can hardly be heard","review":"If you are buying this watch for it's alarm feature---forget it.

This watch provides an audible alarm that meets my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch","review":"Some years ago I wanted to buy this Casio watch, but then I found some other one, more stylish and thin. This year I nevertheless decided to order it and was somewhat disappointed.

With a build in hubris, the Bush Admin has systematically ignored countering evidence and gone gung-ho into Iraq without a plan, thinking \\"they will rush into the streets and hail us as heroes.\\" How wrong they were.

Fantastic summary of the evidence that Saddam's Iraq underwrote the 9/11 attacks and was ready to attack again.

Buy this book if you have an open mind and want to better understand why the liberation of Iraq was absolutely necessary for America's national security.

My daughter is 6 years-old and absolutely loved it. There were a few chapters we read aloud together, and I have to admit that I too was LAUGHING OUT LOUD. What I love about Roald Dahl's books is that you can trust that the content will be age-appropriate. Unfortunately, it is generally difficult to find books that are fun yet wholesome, especially if your child is young but a strong reader. This book is a reading level 5.8 but I think the content is acceptable for just about any age. Depending on how conservative you are, the only chapter that some people may find offensive is the chapter where the BFG talks about \\"whizzpopping,\\" his term for passing gas. Personally, I thought the section was hilarious and my daughter and I could not stop laughing. It's very playful and innocent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Childhood Memory","review":"I remember my teacher reading this book to me in second grade and I loved it, I read it many times following that.

This book was extremely funny, and really fun to read. It was about a little girl and a big friendly giant. That is how the giant got his name, the BFG. As you know from the giant's name, he is very friendly, unlike the other giants that are bigger and ugly. The little girl helps the giant stop the other giants from eating children, after she gets taken away from her home by him. She is taken to another land where the BFG lives, along with the other mean giants. They might eat her if the BFG doesn't take good care of her and keep her hidden. In this book, the BFG and the little girl go through lots of wild things getting to know each other.I have always loved all of the Roald Dahl's books and I think this was one of his best that I read.

When the BFG tells Sophie thet the other giants are off to eat human beans, Sophie is determined to stop them. Will they achieve their goal?I think that the BFG was silly, but there was one thing I hated. Frobscbble, Whizzpoppers, and Snozzcumbers are not words. This a VERY non-educational book.

Probably because the story would be too short if the writer didn'y do that.In the story, a little orphan girl named Sophie sees something during the \\"Witching hour\\", a time at night when everybody is in a deep sleep.

One night a giant was walking around the neighborhood, but only one person saw him and that was Sophie. The giant grabbed her and took off running back to his cave. The reason he took her is because she saw him and if he didn't take her she would tell everyone in the world, and giants are supposd to be a big myth.

It begins with a girl named Sophie being kidnapped by a giant from a home for orphans in England. Naturally, she is frightened of him at first, but as she gets to know the Big Friendly Giant (BFG), she hatches a plot to help him get rid of his nasty neighbours.I particularly like this book, because unlike many other books with children overcoming problems, instead of adults helping the child, Sophie actually helps the queen of England get rid of a problem. This has great action, but it could also be a comedy because of the funny scenes, which is why I like it so much (I love funny books).

No human can see them. The BFG can only hear them with his gigantic ears. He uses a net to catch these dreams. All of this happens in the chapter called Journey to Dream Country. The BFG goes to a house next to an orphanage. There lay awake on her bed, a little girl named Sophie. When the BFG saw her, he took her because he didn't want her to tell anyone that there was a giant outside her window with a long trumpet and a briefcase in each hand. He took her to his cave in Giant Country where there lay nine giants, double the size of the BFG. When the got in the cave, Sophie could hear them galloping off somewhere. What she didn't know was that the would or could be in the headlines of a magazine. I shall not tell you anything more about this book except that if you're under the age of six I think this book may be too harsh. If you like action and want a good hoot well all I can say is good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"My 8 year old daughter just finished this book and loved it!!

I read the book the BFG. Sophie, a little orphan gets taken to a cave with a Big Friendly Giant.Sophie has to live with a Big Friendly Giant but she knows danger is near.What made this book funny is that the giant always gets things mixed-up.

I read to him every night. He really liked this book. I also think that it was a good book, but the one thing I would change about it would be the way the BFG talks. It's hard to read his lines at first, once you get use to it you're fine. For a kid it might be frustrating since the giant makes up words and speaks oddly. The story as a whole was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl is kidnapped by a giant","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.I feal that this book is a easy book to read and understand.It was a very adventerous book and I like books like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Friendly Giant Went over Big","review":"I bought this for my son, and he greatly enjoyed it.

James' parents being killed by a rhino and then the awful cruelty of his aunts, and in the BFG the giants and their horrid names that eat children... am I the only one who sees a problem here?? No more for us. I really do not understand why these books are rated well. I really do not understand why they read the BFG in my son's second grade class either.

But the headphones that come with it are pure junk. I mean, seriously, they literally fell apart almost without even touching them. Weird, but true.

That is the way I felt throughout this book. There wasn't any real chemistry between Anne and Connor and Anne was at times incredibly weak and pathetic in her attempts to get Connor to reestablish a relationship. Connor clearly did not deserve her and Anne was not as strong as the author tried to make us believe. Anne and Connor hardly spent enough time together to learn about how each other had changed and even then, they clearly weren't ready for any kind of committment. There were also several characters the book could have done without and at least 3 subplots that just sort of died without being resolved.I was not impressed by If the Slipper Fits. I sincerely don't think the slipper fit at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"bonton","review":"I am very disappointed in this book. It is the 2nd most terrible romance novel i've read. It's soo boring and throughout this book, it's scene after scene of Connor and Anne arguing about why the split up and why Anne dumped Connor. It gets to a point I felt like saying out loud to Annet - Just tell Connor why you broke up! This is my first Elaine Fox novel and I will never buy another book and will be the last one"},{"rating":"1","title":"The slipper DOESN\\"T fit","review":"What an awful book! I'm a modern girl and books like this grate on my final nerve. Here's why; Anne is a doormat, who grovels around and has no pride or dignity...she is weak. Connor is a big jerk willing to believe bad things about Anne from the slick realtor in town...duh. He is overbearing, pouty, a real class-A jerk! He has no redeeming qualities, which really make this couple deserve each other, as Anne has no redeeming qualities either.My advice- skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped Me Learn to Cook","review":"My mother bought me this book when I moved out on my own for the first time, and I did not have much experience in the way of cooking. To this day I incorporate a lot of her ideas into my meals - her tips are especially helpful for weeknight dinners when you have two full-time-working adults in the house. I still refer to it every now and again, but would reccomend it mainly for the novice chef or the person who has a difficult time tearing him-or-herself away from recipes and cookbooks. Sometimes clarity can be an issue as well, as stated by another reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Reading","review":"This was a very good book.

None of the songs however, sound remotely \\"Benedictine\\" or even British.

My grandmother would have loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MIRROR OF LIFE FOR THE FEW","review":"Like everything else in life, this book tells about sad times and happy times due to the fact that a military man was awarded the highest honor for valor this nation offers. This book gives descriptions of the battle event that was reponsible for the medal for a number of veterans from the Civil War through Viet Nam. The writing is interesting and points out what some men are capable of when their back is against the wall. If you like war stories, this is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book. Any book which honors the actions of our veterans is a \\"must read\\" for me. But I was greatly disappointed by this work. While I enjoyed Mr. Wallace's introductory essays, I was confused by the politically correct agenda he presented in the selection of some those who earned the Medal of Honor. Also, Mr. Mikaelian's prose is awkward and laborious: I didn't think it possible to take such incredible acts of bravery and make them almost tedious, but this is exactly what happens here. Spend your valuable time reading well-written books like \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" or \\"Ghost Soldiers,\\" which give proper homage to the legacy of American heroes. Mikaelian's book does not do them justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political motivated","review":"I've spent the last 20+ years in the military and I really enjoy reading about our military heroes. But, it bothers me when someone uses the military to espouse their political ideology. I don't know anything about Allen Mikaelian, but I'd guess he was very unhappy with the presidential election in 2000 and felt he needed to do something. The author selectively picks recipients that provide a positive image of the left wing and a negative image of the right wing. There is nothing wrong with highlighting minority or women recipients. I think that is great and much needed, but the author should have been up front with the title and foreword and should have left out the political propaganda. Instead he covertly gives the impression that these 11 individuals represent your typical CMH recipient, both historically and politically. This book definitely has some value, but unless your polical views are a little far to the left, you may get a bit irritated at the political rhetoric."},{"rating":"1","title":"More politics.","review":"The book is not bad if you can get over the liberal agenda.

After playing around with a voltmeter, found out that the leads are connected backwards to the output... -4.20 Volts at .6 Amps doesn't work so well for charging a battery. After finally getting the case open and switching the leads, shut the thing up, plugged it in, and almost had a heart attack, I had shorted out the input pretty much straight from the wall (the flip plug mechanism is a bit sensitive, I bent one of the connectors when I took the case apart). So to make a long story short, if it doesn't work just box it up and return it. I was not impressed with the quality of product or the circuit board to be honest either. Looked like shoddy soldering, and obviously carelessly put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DEAL on a GREAT PRODUCT!!!","review":"This camera battery charger is great... it comes with a wall adapter and car adapter as well...

The software seems to have issues trying to read it. The flashing went away once I removed the card. I am going to replace it with a 2GB SD card. MSN direct is still worthless and the Bluetooth is kinda noisy on the other end.The GPS works well except it sometimes flashes BRIGHT white. DANGEROUS at night. The MP3 player is OK, but it is no iPod and it has issues with 8GB SD cards. It seems to max out at 500 songs no matter how much space you have. MSN Direct Traffic is WORTHLESS. It hardly ever gets a signal on the Baltimore Beltway, let alone out in the country. The BlueTooth works OK, but sometimes needs a couple tries to sync up.

The interface is easy to use, the maps are clear, and the MSN Direct is a great add on. My old GPS took a while to connect to the satellite, but the Garmin is pretty fast. The only real complaint I have is that the screen could stand to be a little brighter. I would recommend this unit to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional, Cost Effective","review":"Good little unit for the money. The MSN feature is nice when you are in areas that it supports. I'd love to see them add a doppler radar page to the MSN service to really raise the bar. I don't like the MSN hardware portion being built in to the cigarette lighter adapter but it is what it is for now. The price was right when I bought it and it has been worth the amount spent without a doubt. My father has borrowed the unit and enjoyed it as well and he is not tech-savvy.

Clear audio and clear visual. Easy to setup and use. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent gift","review":"I bought this GPS as a gift for my dad. My mom borrowed it on a recent trip to Las Vegas and it was great. It helped her get around without having to deal with all of the traffic on the strip. The announcements of street names and pre-turn announcements are great - plenty of time to react but not so many announcments that its annoying. My parents especially love how portable it is. Definitely would recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Traffic jam","review":"I really like my Garmin. I personally wanted a GPS system that was small and compact. The screen is smaller than other models but I did not have a problem seeing the menu icons. It comes with a carrying case and the window mount easily comes off which is important against theft. The menu icons are easy to see and follow. I love how it tells you the street names before you approach them. The only problem I have with it is that the traffic feature sometimes loses reception and therefore doesn't work. Also, traffic does not appear on the normal map screen. It's a separate map you have to go through the menu to find. Otherwise, it's a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear directions, traffic feature has a long way to go","review":"I bought the garmin because of the additional features like traffic and the speaker phone. I love the speaker phone and the gps itself is very useful,it gives the directions in bold letters so you can't miss it. The traffic function is still a work in progress and is not reliable, at least in New York City. It misses a lot of traffic, and sometimes still shows traffic after it has long since cleared up. Over all I like it. I had a mio before this and I like the mio graphics better, but the garmin's directions are more clear, so you don't miss turns. (Which is the whole point)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"The product is very easy to use even for someone like me who had never dealt with a GPS before. The start up is really straighforward and requires no expertise.

It was worth what we paid for the service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS!","review":"I bought the Garmin StreetPilot C580 for my husband to replace a 7 year old StreetPilot. We wanted to stay with Garmin since we have been so pleased with the previous unit. The C580 is wonderful! It is so easy to use right out of the box and has many nifty features such as announced street names, touch screen, and it is extremely quick! Very readable, too, and we love the suction cup mount. We also like the MSN Direct service. You can't go wrong with the Garmin name and this unit is a good deal here at Amazon. It was over $100 cheaper compared to everywhere else! Highly recommend this model. The only cons are it doesn't appear to have the ability to enter actual coordinates and the optional tour guides are very limited, mostly for Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Garmin StreetPilot c580","review":"The c580 is my first GPS unit. I decided that now that we are retired it would work out well for traveling with our travel trailer. I found it to be quite useful on the first occasion that I used it. It guided us back onto the correct route after encountering a closed entrance ramp. The touch screen is very easy to use. Voice is easy to understand, and commands are given far enough in advance to make for easy navigation. Satellite recognition, even inside a building is outstanding, which makes it nice for programming before leaving on a trip. I am a little disappointed that it will allow only one \\"way point\\" during a route. The \\"MSN direct\\" feature is nice, but updates are too slow to be useful while driving. Overall I am quite pleased with the unit and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This was my first GPS system and I Love it. It is very easy to use and worked right out of the box. The MSN Direct does not work in the area that we live it but works great when we travel to a metropolitan area. The Bluetooth works great. As with any speaker phone system, if you have a lot of road noise it can be difficult to hear and be heard, but 90% of the time you can hear fine. I had no problem pairing it with my Motorola KRZR even though it was not on the list of compatible phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service makes Garmin a no-no","review":"The c580 is an adequate product in terms of GPS capabilities but suffers from the following problems:(MAJOR Issue)1) Poor Customer Support (Read - if its breaks - you're on your own)The suction mount on my GPS stopped working (GPS would fall off) and I promptly called the number given on the manual to get it replaced under warranty. The lady who picked up the phone initially asked me what the problem was and said \\"ahem...let em transfer you to the auto dept\\". The auto dept had a pre-recorded message that said \\"All agents are missing. Pls accept to wait at least *30* minutes\\" - which is ridiculous. My call was never picked up and I eventually gave up. Needless to say - I'll never buy Garmin again.Other problems (minor)2) Bulky Design: This is a older generation of GPS. Look for other families (i.e. not c500 series) if you would like a sleek/lightweight device.3)Slow Startup: Often takes > 1 minute. During cloudy days - can take longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for the MSN service","review":"GPS functions on this unit work great, similar to other Garmin products. Don't buy this unit if you're getting it for the MSN service. The service is spotty at best and the service and the unit don't appear to work well together. A simple web search will reveal many others with similar complaints of poor or no signal in the middle of coverage areas. Need traffic info consider one of the other Garmin units that use a different traffic service. I called MSN Direct, their customer service is useless, the guy couldn't even find Redmond, WA on a map, you would think Microsoft customer service would know where Microsoft World Headquarters was. Again the Garmin piece is find, beware MSN Direct"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Garmin StreetPilot","review":"We bought the StreetPilot because we were going to be visiting the Los Angelos area.

Higham seems to think drinking a Mint Julep is the one way to identify a 19th Southerner Southerner! He's also sloppy, mixing up the year of Lincoln's assassination several times, (sometimes it's 1864, sometimes he has it right as 1865). Worstly, this book reads more like a list of coincidental meetings of 19th century cranks. Who cares who met who at some hotel in 1864? Higham has no real new information and he really should be ashamed to have written this thing.

No I read his books as a work of fiction rather than the truth. In that sense, they are simply amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the parocial of mind","review":"Highly entertaining. A fast fun read. I would not make the mistake of doubting this work and dismissing the book out of hand. I have read many Lincoln books in my time, this really puts the shady conspiracy cabal under the microscope. Lots of research weaved together by someone not afraid of what the \\"caught in a squeaky clean history rut\\" naysayers would say. Most of what Higham writes has been indeed hinted at before by mainstream historians. Higham's sources are impeccable. He combed through government archives untouched or unused by main stream historians (they are/were afraid of stepping on toes and myths?). He does list every source. He backs up what he says with official documents. Nobody had the guts to come out and say until now what really needed to be said. A brave author.For the readers that view this book as fiction or nonsense, you are exhibiting your shallowness.

It presents the mainstream christian view of hell, and attributes other views to the cults. The cults do a better job of explaining the scriptural view of hell and many christian scholars are begining to believe this view as well. All of the mainstream christian churches love to cite Rev. 14:11 \\"And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.\\" Ms. Burns cites it four times yet this scripture has nothing to do with hell.

Many other scriptures are omitted and some prove the exact opposite point which Ms. Burns is trying to make.

It picks up where the movie left off but this show is hot and the show only gets better throughout the season.

Is it because it shows blacks in a positive light instead of the jive talkin', rappin, loud talking, fool acting people that blacks potray in most of these dumb tv shows on today? Blacks can be successful and it is about time a TV show like Soul Food was made to show it. This is one of the rare exceptions that the TV remake is actually better than the original movie. Most white people don't believe this, but there are sucessful blacks out here that are not sports stars or rappers. This show potrays middle class blacks going through everyday (and some not so everyday) problems that people go through. If this was a white show it would have earned several Emmys by now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb show","review":"Like a lot of other reviewers I would like to know what is taking so long to release the rest of the seasons on dvd.

But really, it turned out to be more of a cheesy murder mystery, with lame attempts at humor. The back of the book is really not a good description of the gist of this story.

On almost every level, I found it pretty awful. The characters were flat, the setting uninteresting, and the plot required a massive suspension of disbelief. I can't understand how any editor could let so many absurd and unbelievable plot elements stay in a book. And the not so cleverly reworked names (\\"Moonburst\\" chain coffee store rather than Starbucks, \\"Bookmakers Monthly\\" magazine rather than Publisher's Weekly) were indicative of an overall lack of originality. Did like that cover, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Entertaining","review":"Does your sister drive you crazy? Is she cute and charismatic?

The characters were also weak, I never really cared about what happened to either the \\"smart\\" sister or the \\"pretty\\" one. Just a jumbled jigsaw puzzle of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Completely disappointing... Instead of spending time developing the relationship between sisters, Frankel spends much of the novel discussing coffee.

I bought this book hoping for a larky read-I'd admired Frankel's sharp writing in Mademoiselle. What a disappointment! From the \\"pretty\\" sister's going on about auras and the narrator, who so obviously IS Frankel, I hated this book. The characters were stock and so dull they were hard to keep straight. (The main character hooks up with a J. Crew model..puh-leeze! ) The plot was insipid and contrived....a cuppa Maxwell's if you ask me, not a great Sumatran roast. The ending was pat.

I was half-way in the book when I had serious doubts about my choice. At three-quarters, I was telling book club members to hold off on buying the book. I barely finished reading it, that's how predictable it was. By the end, I had to call all the book club members and issue a revised choice for our June book.This book was interesting at first, but then it became too convoluted. There were attempts at interesting conflict, which in the end, weren't interesting at all. It would make a nice premise for a sitcom, but it's not a good book. Not at all.

The book was rather dull and the smart/pretty connection never really surfaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I think any woman with a sister would be attracted to a book that promised an intelligent perspective on the \\"smart versus pretty\\" issue. I think the author is right when the says that all sisters have their own views on which is which. However, after promising such a satsifying subject, the book wanders off into a poorly written tangle of weird and implausible plot twists and vivid descriptions of what everyone is wearing.

Highly recommended fun that should be read at a coffee bar near you."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEYOND BORING!","review":"While I was expecting nothing more than your basic, pleasant beach read -- entertaining story about two very different sisters -- this boring, poorly written book about one-dimensional women (gee, the \\"smart\\" one, and, um, the \\"pretty\\" one) made Cosmo seem refreshing and unique. The title says it all -- one sister is \\"smart\\" and the other is \\"pretty\\" -- and that, literally is what gets repeated over and over in this stupid attempt at capitalizing on the popularity of books like Bridget Jones (which this is NOT). There is no irony, no wit, a storyline that a 5-year-old girl could have invented, and the writing is laughable (unintentionally).Despite the spate of negative reader reviews, this book seems to be getting a lot of undeserved hype. Good thing the author has a publicist working so hard, or no one would ever have bothered to read this book. Pay attention to the actual READERS and not the hype: this is just plain awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"a delicious fix for any humor junkie","review":"Before you buy that Starbucks stock, cozy up with this tale of two sisters and their struggle to save their family-owned coffee shop. The hilarious duo will find friends in anyone who sympathizes with what evil corporate giants (\\"except the Gap,\\") are doing to the small business owner. The story of the sisters' fight to stay afloat (okay, and to meet great men) is better than a latte for lifting your spirits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"The beginning of this book was so clever, it made the rest of it all the more disappointing. Don't be fooled; this is NOT about two sisters... it's more about an author's dismal attempt at writing a farce. If this novel were to be made into a movie, it would have to have a cartoon soundtrack, the plot is so ridiculous. The characters are so unappealing that you begin to wish you hadn't read past page 5. Do yourself a favor and skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Sara Lewis, you will like this book...","review":"Unfortunately, I am not a big fan of Sara Lewis' books. In Smart vs. Pretty, the writer tries too hard. The storyline is forced and writing flat. It's as though Frankel is trying too hard and all of the \\"mayhem\\" really detracts from the characters. This is not a story about two sisters. It really is just a poorly written \\"who done it\\" and I never really cared to find out who did it. I finished the book because it was easy to read (short, large print) not because I cared about any of the characters or the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"This book is not what it holds itself out to be. I expected a book about the relationship between the \\"Smart\\" and \\"Pretty\\" sister; I got a book that barely addressed their relationship and instead became a murder mystery--how to succeed in business despite yourself story.

While creating over-defined characters the author forgets about two things: an interesting storyline and realistic characters.As far as the sisters are concerned, it is easy to tell them apart. But \\"Smart\\" seemed more like a sulky pessimist and \\"Pretty\\"... a flaky daydreamer. With the addition of misplaced supporting characters and an awkward 'who-done-it?' subplot, this book will always be better unopened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Read","review":"I was really hoping for a fun trashy summer novel. Instead I was given a slow, boring, poorly written crime wannabe. It would have been better if the foreshadowing didn't give away what was to come so blatantly. (Typically foreshadowing *suggests* what is to come, not flat out tells you.) I didn't find the dialogue to be realistic, nor the characters believable. In fact, they were horribly annoying. Honestly, I only finished the book so I could write this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun beginning to end","review":"i loved this book from the first page to the last. I couldn't stop reading, even when I wanted to. i stayed up all night, was a zombie all day at work, but it was worth it. i can see this as a movie, easily. a must buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, truly awful","review":"I suggested this book for my book club based on the strength ofthe reviews on Amazon.com. You can just imagine my embarrassment whenevery single one of us hated it. Who is Ms. Frankel related to in the publishing world? ...I can't believe how truly appalling this book was. In fairness, it would probably be a good read for someone in high school, but it is not being marketed as such. The plot line was ridiculous... We are now in the year 2000 and I find it hard to believe that women are to be classed as either smart or pretty. I did not detect any traces of humor in the book that would show that the author was poking fun at the notion of smart vs. pretty. The characters did not undergo any development by story's end. And, of course there's the rich knight in shining armor at the end, just in time to save the day. I can not find one thing about this book to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather weak","review":"This was not the book I'd hoped it would be. I was looking for another entry in the \\"single woman's fiction\\" genre. You know the type: Bridget Jones, Sex and the City, etc., etc.... Instead I found a rather thinly plotted, weak book where descriptions of clothing stand in for characterization. I am a relatively generous reader, usually giving a book the benefit of the doubt, but this one lost me. For the first time since junior high I quit reading before the end of the book. Maybe something great happened later and I just missed it, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This book was not worth the .25 it cost me to reserve it from the library. And thankfully, I did not purchase the book to begin with. I thought I would like it because it seemed to come up on ...lists of other books that I enjoyed. But this is where I took a chance and lost.The author is attempting to write a mystery/romance at the same time - which is fine, but the character development, plot, writing, and the author's ability to write a good story is not there at all. I was annoyed that I wasted my time reading it. It's written in a pre-teen fashion,(something I find insulting in an adult novel), but it's not a pre-teen book due to some of the sexual & violent references. Don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dillusional...","review":"This book starts out wonderfully. Unfortunately, it turned bad quickly. I kept reading in hopes it would improve. The characters in the book are very believable, but the things that happen to them are just silly especially where love is concerned. The author just took a wrong turn, had the characters' lives been more realistic, I would have loved the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farfetched and preposterous","review":"This book starts out innocently enough, seeming to be about two sisters (one smart, one pretty, just like the title says!) and I figured it would pretty much be about what the title suggested. However, it sooned turned to a ridiculous suspense/thriller with some of the most ridiculously contrived scenes I've read in quite a while. Furthermore, it really didn't even seem to know what it wanted to be about. I was hoping this was Ms. Frankel's first book but apparently it is her third or fourth. If you're looking for someone who knows how to mix contemporary fiction and suspense, try Susan Isaacs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Par","review":"Compared to other Willa Cather adaptations to film \\"The Song of the Lark\\" was a real disappointment. The film was apparently done on a shoe string budget. There were no actual views of Chicago, nor were there any views of the cliffs in Arizona.The dubbing of Thea's voice was sloppy, and the movie just fizzled at the end. We never get a chance to see Thea perform in big time opera.The acting was only average; the actor playing Dr. Archie (Cowboy in \\"Full Metal Jacket\\") was embarrassing.Other Cather adaptations, such as \\"O Pioneers\\" and \\"My Antonia\\" have been done so well, but this film is a waste of money. Avoid it and buy the others.Oh yeah, read the novel. It is captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old fashioned","review":"More for the gardener of heritage seeds and cultivation; not for kitchen gardener or recipes of culinary herbs and uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our gardening adventures","review":"We've decided to grow our own vegetables and herbs that are either our favorites or aren't always available where we live.

I received a used library book in poor condition, many of the pop up figures are bent and do not open well. Also I don't know how many different hands have touched this book so I didn't even bother letting my son have the book. If they are selling a used book in less than perfect condition it should be clearly stated in the description."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit much for my 3 year old","review":"George was taken from his home and put into a bag.George was put into a prison.These things can be scary to a young mind.George enjoyed a pipe (smoke and all) after dinner.Nothing needed to be said about that.Not trying to be over-politically-correct, but this was a bit much for my 3 year old and she even asked if I could take it back to the store.Obviously others have same age children who like it. This is just another opinion for others to consider.At the same time, she loved \\"Caps For Sale\\" which we got at the same time. And she loves the more recent Curious George stories that don't deal with kidnapping, imprisonment, and tobaco usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Terrible book! My 3yo started asking right off the bat why did the man took George away from his home?Terrible taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate Curious George!","review":"First of all, I hate that the explorer kidnaps the monkey out of his natural habitat and puts him in a zoo (\\"what a nice place to live\\" . . . yeah, right).Second, I hate having to explain to my 2-year-old son what jail is and why Curious George was put there.Third, I hate that Curious George always gets rewarded in some way for breaking the rules. This is a recurring \\"theme\\" in all the books, and as a parent, I disapprove. In my opinion, it's not okay to feed the ostrich after you've been told not to, and just because you subsequently rescue a baby bear does not make it okay that you broke the rule.On the other hand, my son adores the whole series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is no longer for today's kids","review":"I got this for my son and it had been so long since I read any of those books I forgot how I hated the original story. Fist George is kidnapped and then he is arrested and then for the \\"happy ending\\" he is put in a zoo!! THEN I remembered why I was not more a fan of Curious George as a kid. I like my son's books to be fun and full of imagination not trauma and woe. Needless to say my son also hates that book, but loves the other books in that series and loves all of the newer and updated to today's standards and the new movie and PBS show. I know it is a classic, but to me a classic is still great many years down the road, so to me it is not a true classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to agree with Jennifer Rogers . . .","review":"I picked up this book recently to read to my 2-year-old and was shocked at the underlying negativity. How a cute little monkey is ripped from his family and homeland and tries to acclimate unsuccessfully to his new surroundings resonates uncomfortably with the accounts of African slave experiences. This is not entertaining by any means, and I think it would give a child nightmares. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original masterpiece","review":"\\"Curious George\\" used bolder and more colors than most picture books of its day. It remains a bright work full of wonderful facial expressions. Children will identify with the childish monkey with the good heart and natural hubris. I love the way this first one throws in details that would be prohibited today, like when George has \\"a good pipe\\" before going to bed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel","review":"This is a wonderfully narrated story, and our boys (ages 3 & 5) loved listening and reading along during a long trip. Curious George's fun adventures kept them smiling and giggling, and the story is well recorded on the CD.I definitely encourage this as an alternative to putting on another portable DVD or video game. It was great to have the kids entertained by storytelling while we concentrated on getting us all to our destination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Orlando Pops play well...except the Star Wars Tracks","review":"This was originally released in the U.K. under the title \\"The Magic of John Williams\\" a 78 minute long CD. That title was also released here but only 45 minutes long. This album is the rest of that plus a couple other songs. The non Star Wars tracks are superb, I don't know what it is, but the Orlando Pops orchestration fo the star wars tracks are not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Help for Dads!!","review":"Tween Time is a great book for dads, too!

Jain's books. This is by far my favorite (I now own all three and am veryyyy happy with all of them!). It provides great vocabulary on each section, and you can go through good examples of Hindi literature without having to flip through a dictionary. All the tough words are at the end of each excerpt. Good poems, articles, essays, short stories! I only wish that she would put something on there by more well-known Indian authors, not just herself and Gandhi. Although she does have some, she should have put more ( I realize, however, that it is difficult to find texts for intermediate students). A fantastic reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Story","review":"This is a well written story with complex characters. However, there were times that I would have liked to shake Lily until her teeth were loose. She was so determine to let Doyle and everyone else think the worst of her instead of trusting someone. It didn't have to be Doyle it could have been her Grandmother. If she had told someone the truth of had happened to her that night things would have gone more smoothly. I also think she have trusted Doyle's love a little more. I think he would have forgiven her almost anything. The book was fustrating in many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"great one! so many different combinations in one dvd.","review":"1) This DVD has a variety of workouts- 10 min yoga, pilates, abs, buns and thighs, and upper body.

Songs for the Apocalypse is a very well put together metal cd.It has nice clean sound to it yet is down and dirty. It's doom metal with less grunting amd more actual singing. For me this is a big plus as bands who's vocalist just grunt out the lyrics become boring after a while and frankly, they all sound the same.This is very good release and deserves a little respect from the Doom crowd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of names - Little information","review":"There are a lot of names here, but very little information - only one sentence on my family, which I already knew.

It is old and outdated information (reprint of English (as in England) book from 1959)and if followed by a novice could result in serious injury in some cases when referring to the various stall vices horses develop. It does not deal with the real reason these horses develop issues, but tries to effect a cure that is not feasible. This book was thankfully inexpensive, and really does not offer the reader with any useful advice. Its only saving grace is that it was interesting to note what methods are now considered archaic and which have been around forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tea maker","review":"This is a wonderful tea maker. My first one broke after 2 years so I bought another one as I love my morning pot of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heats water, but awkward to use and not very good for tea","review":"Pros: it looks cute and it heats up the water. No electricity/wiring problems after 6 months of use. Useful for lipton-style black bagged tea.Cons: Really difficult to get water into the device without spilling all over the counter (if you buy one, you will see what I mean). Does not work well with green teas that need to be seeped at just-under boiling temperature. Not good with loose teas at all. No auto-off feature. Loud when boiling the water. Does not stop pouring tea if you take the glass kettle off for a minute to pour yourself a cup (it just keeps pouring onto the hot plate).Eventually, I ended up replacing it with a Braun WK200W Electric Water Kettle and I am much happier. The Braun is more expensive than this, but it's well worth it if you drink at least one hot beverage per day. Not to mention the Braun is faster and much more user friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sumbeam Hot Tea Maker","review":"This is a neat little tea pot. I was into tea for a good long while, and used it every day. That has been a while, but it still works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like Extreme and Produced by Nuno","review":"If you like \\"Pornografitti\\" by Extreme you will like this. Produced by Nuno Bettencourt (guitarist from Extreme), this disc sounds awesome and has some very cool guitar riffs. Although not as explosive with guitar solos as Nuno's work, this is definitely guitar-heavy party rock from the early 90's with some fun lyrics about havin' a good time. The singer is Paulo Bettencourt. You can buy this cd for less than 5 bucks so if you want more quality party rock in your collection you should definitely go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product arrived with visible defects, low quality...","review":"I purchased this item and other Botanic Garden pieces as a gift. Several of the items, including 4 of these mugs arrived with defects in the glaze, showing unfinished porous ceramic in places on the outer surface of the mug, including around the rim where the rough ceramic could injure a user's lip. This is the kind of poor quality I would expect from $1.99 Walmart no-brand item, and it was immediately visible upon opening the package. At this price, a ripoff and a disappointment for the recipient. Not a premium product.A reasonable inspection would have rejected these defects."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful mugs","review":"My set of 6 mugs came in a Portmeirion box packed with lots of bubble wrap, and then in another Amazon box.

When you make a documentary that does nothing but trash someone that most people like your going to get negative feedback. Arnold is a hard worker, fair and honest.

I can already guess what Dan Cox's next film is going to be; an auto biography called \\"Running away from Arnold fans\\" because he just pissed off the NRA, body builders, and any guy who grew up watching \\"The Predator\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have Used It for 10 years: Refrigerator and CD's!","review":"I've used Novus #2 and #3 for 10 years, originally because it was recommended as the only way to polish the black plastic faux front on my refrigerator. It has kept the plastic smooth and shiny all this time, and the little bottle has lasted forever.My most frequent use for it has been on CD's and DVD's. I borrow lots of DVD's from the public library and often they're a wreck-- especially the kids' movies. Even badly marred, scratched DVD's that freeze in the middle of the film (and you know how frustrating that is) usually polish up nicely and are playable after a polish with one or both of #2 and #3. If not, a second polishing usually does the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Product","review":"This is an amazing product. You will think it is magic the way it removes scratches from plexiglass. The windshield on my golf cart was very scratched up and I thought I had to replace it.

Two, the emotional/spiritual aspects of such a walk. The author is very successful in translating her experiences both good and bad into this book.I was surprised (should not have been) these pilgrims were a sampling of a normal population complete with thieves and those who had no respect for others or for the ecology of the land."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overkill","review":"I initially thought this book would be an engaging and spiritual description of the Camino experience.

If you would like to be discouraged from going, then this is the book for you. The author shines an unforgiving spotlight on anything and everything that is negative. She places herself in the position of judge and finds herself to be cleaner and smarter than the giving and kind people who run and operate the refugios, restaurants and shops along the way. The spiritual lessons she gleans are uninspiring in contrast to the glee she appears to get from dissing just about everyone and everything. Why didn't she stay home? She never finds a satisfying answer to that question. If you are called to walk the Camino and are excited and happy about what awaits you, skip this account.

Of special intrest (especially in retrospect) is his description of how anyone who has come in contact with her (Titanic) has had their life altered by the experience.

The only way to shut it off is to pull the electrical plug from the wall. There is no consistancy in the amount of pressure it builds. Sometimes 140 PSI and othere 165 PSI. Fifty percent of the time the safety valve blows. I called Porter Cable to send me a new one and they wouldn't. Referred me to a service center 30 miles away. I phoned the service center and they said they may not have the parts for this compressor and may have to order them. So far I am not impressed. I had a CH for 7 years without a problem. My PC is a week old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged Compressor due to defective design","review":"I agree with the other reviewer on this item - it is a defective design. My compressor arrived damaged due to the gauge assembly being bent during shipping resulting in the nipple to the tank splitting open. The compressor was unusable.

It has good, even very good actors with at least an A- storyline. It creates what could have been complex and dynamic relationships between our lead characters. And then it limps from start to finish. Some nice moments between our lovers, and that's about it. Except for the romantic leads the rest of the relationships in the film don't develop much depth or feeling, and the ending is thin and disappointing. Wanted to like this film. Gave it away once I was done."},{"rating":"2","title":"And unexpected gem","review":"I'm learning not to underestimate young writers/actors.

Simple, yet complicated.Many of us know all too well how we can be drawn to people who need help even when we know deep down our help is not wanted and not working. It is sometimes the person offering the help who is truly in need of being needed. That seems to be the case with Trevor and Darrell.Ephram comes along and messes everything up. The announced that Ephram loves Trevor is what the audience needs for Trevor but it turns Trevor's world upside down.This film has neither the look or feel of something low budget.I would have offered a much different ending, but I'll hold out for the sequel if Brent Gorski would bless us with that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"Well, I just stopped watching this film, or shall I say a part of it.

The rest of the actors were terrible. This could have been a great story if well told and acted, but unfortunately it was poorly scripted and horribly acted. Half way in I couldn't give a toss for any of the characters. They all came across as whiny, self-absorbed and devoid of any positive qualities.

We were reading it in a sunday school class as a background for a discussion on biotechnology and bioethics. After the first chapter, it went downhill quickly.

Examples of this include repeated references to an \\"artificial womb\\" and when he talks about a study done in the Netherlands on euthanasia. When I decided to look up the research to verify his facts, I found his numbers to be off by more than a factor of 10.

It seems to me this is some sort of temperature sensitve problem. Once the player warms up it starts having these problems.

Although this flaw is minor in some DVDs, it becomes especially troublesome in action movies and fast-paced scenes. I have sent the unit in for warranty repair, and I am awaiting its return.

Almost none of them have the resources to turn a feeder drug into a commercial one, and the risks are so high they'd sink themselves. Selling to pharma companies is a way of significantly reducing the risks and costs of their research, which lets them proceed with it in the first place. She also misses all sorts of important points about survivorship bias among the drugs pharma companies sell and all that to make the pharma industry out to be way, way more profitable than it actually is.She seems to be more concerned with her political point than actual economics.

The characters are weak and events seem to be taken from newspaper clippings related to Dawood Ibrahim or even an infamous movie of Ram Gopal Verma.The constant cussing and local slang is the only taste of Mumbai that the author cares to provide and nothing of the vitality that makes Mumbai ever comes on the surface.Narrative skills are worthy of being compared to the skills of Jackie Collins!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and scattered","review":"I am so disappointed in this book, I thought it would be really fast paced and exciting. I am about one third of the way into it and can hardly bring myself to continue. It is so slow and there seems to be way too much useless information that the author offers and I find myself thinking: \\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on get on with it and just tell a story!\\" I don't think I can continue reading, it is just to slow pokey for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"Sacred games almost ends before it begins. Chandra wallows in mediocrity as he struggles to develop and redevelop characters who seem to loose their identity as he describes in never ending detail the daily life and customs in a particular section of India. The plot is straight out of a (you pick it) James Bond movie with The God Father thrown in. A most boring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top","review":"The title, first of all, in no way has anything to do with the bulk, and I mean BULK, of this book. This book should have been edited and re-edited to 400 pages. The repetitiveness of character descriptions were boring and I kept wanting to say, Hey, I got it! The Hindu language is wholly unfamiliar to me and the glossary was of very little help. However, I learned how to swear in Hindi just by reading the first 50 pages.The ending was flat and uninspiring with an extra chapter tossed in that had nothing to do with the preceding 875 pages! An epic novel? This doesn't come close to anything that Clavell, Edw. Rutherford or Robert Elegant has written. I'm disappointed that I wasted so much time on plowing through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring thriller in...the whole world","review":"Look, this book is not bad reading in terms of the writing? Does that make sense? In any case, I was kind of hoping for something that would be all zig-zaggy and page turning. Chandra is a good writer but the whole story is not super interesting.This sounds like a contradiction, but that might be the point. It's like a great car running on bad gas.So, don't look for a thriller, or even a police crazy. It's like an NPR thriller. Terry Gross...why did you kill my teacher? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dreadful Time In India.","review":"I had high hopes for this novel, as I thought we had another Khaled Hosseini in our midst. However, it was unfortunately not to be. This paperweight of a book is quite a bore. The main character is as mundane as sheet rock. I could not finish this tome. The author seemed to have a dreadful lack of self-confidence in his literary acumen. So much so that he went overboard trying to make up for his shortcomings. The proses continue listlessly ad infinitum. He seemingly writes just to fill the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over yet?","review":"Sacred Games is too complex for its own good. The main story line of Sartaj Singh and Ganesh Gaitonde is fantastic. It's all the \\"interwoven\\" story lines that interfere with the flow of the book. This book was a tough read in that it was hard work to maintain my interest. As soon as Chandra had me hooked he'd go off on a tangent again...for an entire chapter. And when I was hooked again...he'd go off on a tangent again...There are better books about Mumbai (Bombay) out there...Shantaram and Maximum City."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooorrrrriiiinnnnngggg!","review":"While this book is factual, it is the dryest Psychology book that I have ever read.

Some people keep their zest until the day they die. They keep their sense of curiosity. They reach out. They enjoy. They risk failure. They may even allow themselves some moderately cheerful expectations for the time ahead. Such expectations may be greeted with skepticism in the current climate, but we should welcome the buoyance from which they spring. Otherwise, in our world weary wisdom, we shall be unresponsive to the challenges that keep societies alive and moving.\\" This little book is packed full of good reasons why we ought to care about what is going on around us.

They are cheap plastic and, in all, not acceptable for drinking wine.

The movie was made for more than hyper teens looking for a way to break out and rebel. Not that i'm dissing the furious series. They're ok if your looking for bad plots and fast driving.The situations in Biker Boyz with Jaleel's family were real problems often found in teens and families today. Making the movie more real to me.

Every time a movie ( like Fast and Furious ) becomes a surprise hit you get a load of copycats. Will Hollywood ever learn? Please! Save yourself and don't even think of watching this mess. This film has the intelligence of a dead dog and the excitement of Sesame Street. With good actors like Larry Fishburne, Vanessa Bell Calloway and Larenz Tate I expected more. Well, no I didn't but I didn't think this film would suck this much. How can something with so much glitz be so boring? The guy who plays Larry's son is an actor who's popped out of nowhere and wasn't terribly impressive. He's good looking but he didn't fit the role.

I hope that people will not compare this movie to The Fast and the Furious, because that movie is an Oscar winner in comparison to this. Even the special effects are lousy. In Biker Boyz, a young motorcycle enthusiast wants to become a member of the Black Nights, but he can't, and then his father is killed in a motorcycle accident, so he starts his own biker group because he's angry with the world. Under the right direction and the right talents, this could have made for an emotional movie sidelined by decent action, but it's far from that. Instead, it's a bunch of lousy motorcycle races coupled with an uninspired, no brains plot. I actually had the urge to leave a few times during the movie.

And then there's the racing scenes which aren't CGI enhanced, but REAL bike stunts. What more could you want in a movie? This movie has nothing in common with F&F, nor does it try to be a clone. Comparing the two movies doesn't hold water. If you want a shallow, badly acted action movie then go watch something like F&F---but if you're looking for an alternative that doesn't leave you feeling empty at the end then this is the movie for you. I had doubts when I read reviews, but when I saw this movie for myself I just had to come on here and speak my $0.02. Don't pass up a chance to see this movie.

I don't know anything about bikes or riding, but the movie seemed like it would be an entertaining bit of drama. It wasn't. It was just too slow and was hampered by uninspired dialogue. I think the actors did a good job with what they had to work with, but this was a bad movie. Luke is the stereotypical young buck rebel without a cause. Fishburne is the old dawg trying to fend off the youngsters.

Why is their house dark?\\", my son asked! It's hard for me to explain poverty or why our worlds are so different, but at least now he seems to be a little less focused on \\"I want that!\\", since he realizes how much other children of the world NEED. It's worth buying for your family, and would be great for starting classroom discussions as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racism and stereotypes thinly veiled as cross-culturalism","review":"The first time i looked at this book, i was reviewing the children's library at the preschool where i work. i pulled it from the shelves as an embarassment to both cultures explored. For those who didn't know better, most African children don't spend their days shirtless, they go to the store, they attend school in uniform, and play modern games. An equally true reality is that of many White Americans whose lives are more like the \\"bush-boy\\" in this book.

Yet miraculously, Donna learned to walk. During her junior year in college, Donna had the opportunity to wear artificial legs that made her 5' 8\\"... for 32 years, a troubled marriage, a divorce, and the loss of both parents. Then Donna came to reevaluate her life and her choices. Now retired and speaking at 12-step meetings and conventions in the United States and Canada, she tells her story in a frank, open, and matter-of-fact tone. An inspirational, intimately personal autobiographical account, The Short And Tall Of It is truly memorable and confidently recommended reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Damn good book!","review":"Like to book claims, 'Pass Microsoft's Active directory exam with flying colors!'. This book is well-organized, containing only relevant information that you need. The book is only 300 pages and the content is written in a easy to understand format(short chapters). Curt Simmons knows his exams, he stresses design considerations rather than 'how-to configure the OS' stuff which is not on the exam and justs wastes your time. The 5 case studies included (although not as complex as the real thing) gets you familiar with the format and helps you identify the info that is important for answering the question(s). Also comes with a Training CBT and companion website. I highly recommend this book for preparing for 70-219, if you can find it as availability is scarce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good History of adventure and heroism","review":"Well written with the richness of reading a novel. But this is not fiction. Dugard really explains and tells a wonderful story of the adventure and hurdles Columbus had to endure during his fourth expedition. No poitikal korrectness here. Columbus is a true hero. Steadfast to his beliefs and objectives. I look forward to reading a second time. Columbus Day 2011."},{"rating":"2","title":"The conclusion of the Columbus story","review":"In spite of the title, much more is covered than the fourth voyage. The previous voyages, as well as history of the life of the great explorer are detailed in much more than the \\"history class\\" detail. This helps to give greater clarity to the events of the 4th voyage. The book presents Columbus as a human who really enjoys navigation and exploration. He is not a \\"scientific hero\\" or a \\"new world demon\\", but simply a dedicated sailor. He makes blunders, has friends and enemies, but manages to stay cool-headed through shipwrecks, jail time and mutinies to continue on his voyages.The audiobook is very well done, told in a very vivid manner with bits of music for extra flourish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent account historically, Exciting to read","review":"Highly recommended and easy to read. The writer worked hard to maintain a smooth narrative flow. You will meet some formerly unknown characters who round out the story well.This book makes you appreciate what Columbus accomplished in his voyages, but also makes you cringe at his treatment of the \\"native\\" people. However, Degard helps put Columbus' treatment in perspective by discussing the genocide carried out by his contemporary, Don Nicolas Ovando.Finally, you must read this book if for nothing else than the discussion of the origin of the nautical phrase \\"poop\\" deck.Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this delightful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh.","review":"This stuff is disgusting.

I eat a lot of diet foods and strange fake foods (e.g., various fake meats), but this stuff is gross. It doesn't satisfy a sweet tooth and I don't really see the point in dipping fruit in it so that you can make your fruit taste of chemicals. I even tried it on regular ice cream (eliminating much of the diet aspect), and it made perfectly delicious ice cream taste of chemicals.

I cannot get enough of it! Having particular dietary tastes and needs, to find a product this rich and tasty is incredible! That it has no discernible fat or sugar is even more wonderful! For those who don't care for it straight up--to each his/her own! It's the only way I eat it (since I can't consume ice creams, etc.). I put it in the 'fridge, let it get ICY cold and then eat it from the jar. For me, it is delicious! I also love the Marshmellow Dip. The Caramel Dip is OK, but only in a pinch (like when the whole foods store runs out of Chocolate Dip or Marshmellow Dip). I've not tried the various fruit dips. The problem I am having now is that the supplier has not been able to supply the store. I hope this isn't indicative that Walden Farms is going to stop making this EXCELLENT product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay...sort of","review":"I thought I would try to cut a few points out of my day by using this chocolate dip to help my cravings...It tasted okay. It was okay with fruit, but the fruit was way sweeter than the chocolate. It almost tasted like a very bitter chocolate. I think if I didn't eat any chocolate for a couple months then ate this I would like it, but that's not the case. It will probably sit in my fridge until it expires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not half-bad","review":"Nobody will mistake this stuff for a fondue pot full of melted 65% Valrhona, but I think this is pretty good for dipping strawberries into for a daytime snack. The trick is that it's a dip, so you have to dip something into it. You won't enjoy it if you stick a spoonful of it in your mouth, but mixed with fruit or other flavors, it adds a pleasant chocolatey taste. Most people I've given it to have enjoyed it and a few have hated it; it may be one of those things like grapefruit that you're either genetically able to tolerate or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible after taste","review":"I was so excited to get this after reading some really good reviews.

While an author has the right to focus on one specific group, as Schweizer does, in this case his justification for doing so (that when liberals misbehave, they harm their principles, but when conservatives do the same \\"they harm only themselves and their families\\") is so absurd it makes it hard to take the rest of the book seriously.Try telling the families of each one of the 2,000-plus American soldiers who have died in Iraq that no one but Republicans and their families got hurt by a war based on a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic example of hateful calumny","review":"For those of you who revel in reading hate books like this one, I would also recommend a little bible verse:Matthew 7:5 \\"Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thy own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mere Parlor Trick","review":"Inconsistency can be found in the Bible (on almost every page), the writings of Thomas jefferson, the deeds of Ronald Reagan. This book purports to find incosistency (propogandized into hypocrisy in the usual rightwing polemic way) among liberals. Well it's true. That does happen. And in the same day George Bush can prodly announce to the world \\"We do not use torture.\\" and threaten to veto a bill that would prohibit torture.It escapes me why the rightwing needs a constant dose of half-truths to keep its emotional high. Indeed, emotionalism is what the rightwing has descended to. The genuine heroes of conservatism: Irving Kristol, Richard Posner and the like are discarded in favor of an ideology whose adherents favor idology over country.Fanatacism reaps its own rewards -- a whirlwind."},{"rating":"1","title":"This joker is a moron!","review":"This book comprises the moral soundness of a goat in heat.

That's overly generous to this tripe.Save your money and read about the issues, whereupon the reader actually gains some pertinent information instead of useless gossip.

The sincerity of the author cannot be denied. However, he must not think much of his audience, as the repetition, self-righteousness, and the overall pedestrian presentation just undermines it. Sad.

Regarding Chomsky receiving military grants, that's hardly surprising and is something that Chomsky has pointed out himself on several occasions. The massive state directed sector of our economy is largely funded by research money provided via the Pentagon and agencies like DARPA which established the internet. Fortunately, Chomsky put his funds to constructive uses, not shameful uses like developing depleted uranium ordnance.People who like this book must be wanting to be deceived. Probably because they're wedded to the money and the mythology of empire. The way some are needing to wish away what Moore, West, Franken and others have to say is kind of sad. So much fear, so much self-imposed mental slavery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"This book commits the ad hominem fallacy from the first page to the last.

Because it was too short. I wanted the author to expose more hypocrites before I was finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth hurts!","review":"Hilarious and to the point (as in skewered).

Interesting, Al Franken, one of the people scrutinized in the book is reportedly threatening legal action against the book's author.

Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This book doesn't point out what it proports to point out. 'Proving' that progressives who criticize the actions of corporations and the government does not mean that they advocate abolishing these institutions. Rather, if you read Chomsky or Moore you know they push people to think and then to advocate for better policy. Why can people not be a part of something and also critical of it, to make it better? This is not hypocrisy, this is being a productive citizen. While I applaud the author for raising questions about these figures (never stop being skeptical) I came away from this book thinking he mostly wanted to smear people's names, not pay attention to issues, and in the end to be mindless and uncritical subjects to the throne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocrisy?","review":"Liberals are the hypocrits?No mention of George W.

Has it ever occurred to them that if what they say is true (that the book is nothing but lies) that the author would be sued and could lose everything? Franken has threatened a law suit, not for libel or slander, but to find out how the writer found out what he reveals in the book. Of course, Franken will never go through with it, for it would expose him to even more uncomfortable publicity.The book is well-documented and vetted by lawyers to make sure it does not expose the writer to lawsuits.

I enjoy the outing of hypocrisy as much as the next person, but this was not even remotely fun to read. I knew at the outset (as any reasonable person does) that most people on both sides of the political spectrum (and everywhere in between) tend to talk the talk a bit more than they are willing to walk the walk.

Yes. Sure. For that it gets one star. However, the statement, \\"when conservatives betray their publicly stated principles, they harm only themselves and their families,\\" loses it four stars. This is naive and dangerous. The bipartisan Select Committee on Intelligence and Iraq Survey Group have proven that the publicly stated principles of the conservatives running the current administration are the reason for the 2,942 dead Americans and 48,880 wounded Americans in Iraq, as well as the fact that America's safety, freedoms and economic strengths have been compromised. Yes, Liberals and Conservatives can be hypocrites. I don't need to spend $11.62 to tell me that. However, when conservatives betray their publicly stated principles, they can do a lot more than harming themselves and their families. I would rather this book put petty hypocrisy into perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does Schweizer hate America?","review":"This book is especially amusing in light of the fact that the Republicans, those supposed practitioners of \\"moral clarity,\\" have recently been getting indicted for fraud, corruption, and treason in record numbers.Meh. People are people, hypocrisy resides everywhere, and no ideology can claim a monopoly. Writing the \\"flip\\" book to this one on the conservative side would be astonishingly easy. And no doubt someone is, as we speak.In the meantime, destructive, divisive books like this only hurt America.

While \\"Book Man\\" is in line with the ravings of the other one stars it is interesting to see the \\"Cannot support armed action unless you have military service\\" argument here. I guess citizenship has some restrictions I was unaware of.

I'm sure the same hyprocrisy could be summaried for many of the \\"other side of the isle\\", but all-in-all, pretty subdued and still entertaining with the appearance of being even handed.

When a Republican/Conservative states facts, with all kinds of research data, they are called liars. This book certainly points out all kinds of hypocrisy on the left, WITH documented proof. I certainly liked the book, would highly recommend it to anyone that can actually think. The title tells it all, too bad the people covered in it have no shame.

I mean, just watching the nightly news this past week I saw how the Kennedy family wants those \\"unsightly wind generators\\" away from their property in Nantucket so that they don't have to look at them. Forget about non-polluting wind power; they'd rather burn oil while blocking construction of new power plants. It never ceases to fascinate me how so many of these prominent liberals show no shame whatsoever in vilifying the right on the very same vices they practice regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! The Other Side of the Story!","review":"This book gives an honest, no holes barred approach to the reality of liberal thinking in the U.S., especially Hollywood. I appreciate the author's courage to go against the grain (to be sure, he has his enemies) and his expose of those who declare themselves to be progressive. (Personally, I wish someone would do the same in-depth study of academia.) Contrary to what critics might say, he \\"humanizes\\" liberals by making them less of media icons and more like ordinaly people. This book also reminds me of another recent one on the media, \\"Making the White Man's Indian: Native Americans and Hollywood Movies,\\" a 100-year history of Indians in Hollywood which actually shows Hollywood's side of the story (finally) and reveals that sympathetic Indian images were more common than what many have previously argued. Strongly recommend both."},{"rating":"1","title":"More right wing propaganda by sub-intelligent dishonest author","review":"Schweizer puts forth ad hominem attacks, fallacious arguments, and borderline libelous assertions and calls them fact.

Just like the retaliation to the Wilson's, this book tries to muddy the enemies of the white house. Unfortunatly for the author, in order to muddy the enemies of the Whitehouse, you'll have to muddy the names of about 70% of Americans and about 99% of the rest of the world.

Congratulations to Peter Schweizer for capitalizing on the uninformed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"misguided?","review":"Schweizer is at best misguided and at worst shameless when he attempts to smear Democrats in this fashion. As any student of politics knows, the Democratic Party stands only the tiniest fraction to the left of the Republican Party - both are assuredly parties of capitalism, for example - so to attack Democrats in this way is just juvenile.What's more, the best current example of Do-As-I-Say-Not-As-I-Doism would have to be the Chickenhawkery of the Republican administration, almost all of whom wangled their way out of active service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the most glaring hypocrisy of all....","review":"I guess the author forgot to mention how wars to spread \\"freedom\\" are in large part financed by the Chinese buying T-bills.

If you ask Steve Phelps to come up with an example of his rant, you will hear the same lame polemic that has been disproven and refuted over and over again. And as for SystemStructure, I would like to clarify that Libby was charged with obstruction of justice, not letting out state secrets. And Rove probably won't be charged with anything. Now if you want to talk about state secrets, look at Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J, and John Kerry, BOTH of whom revealed CIA agents' identities and got away with it.

It is better than the first, tremendous, and I was on the edge of my seat for the whole 3 hours. I honestly was not ready for it to end.The battle is breathtaking, especially because of all the emotions involoved with all the different characters. I was overwhelmed by these men who clung to a glimmer of hope, and kept going and going, even when swamped in a hopeless situation.And of course the comeraderie of Aragorn, Gimli, and all the rest is what keeps it real and makes this one special movie worth watching.

I won't bore you with the rantings of a Tolkien aphile and other glaring omitions and additions,those of you who know, know what they are.

The two female characters in the film are \\"fluff\\" and do exactly as they are told. Not to mention that I had a huge cramp in my back after sitting watching battle scene after battle scene for three hours. To the other reviewers, no one cares whether you liked the trailer or not, that's the gimmick to get you to spend your money on the film. Don't you get it?

Only see it to get the basic picture of what happens between the 1st and 3rd movies. It is dreary, unimaginative and badly filmed. All the actors have gone weird and tried to make the movie their own, while all failing. It has no scenes that give you a real feeling of the trilogy and the scenes themselves do nothing but explain, or repeat, what's happening.Do not bother buying it unless you're one of those nuts who has to have the whole series, no matter what.

I recommend this movie if your into kind of adventure sci fi movies. The ending is the best at the fight scene. It is a good price and a good deal. This will remain one of my favorite movies.

Though The Return of the King has yet to be released, I will say that I would enjoy this second movie much, much more if the producers would delete one scene. I would bet that you know the scene to which I am referring.It is where Legelos takes the shield and slides down the stairs as if the shield were a skateboard or snow board. In a clear attempt to reference modern culture, he slides on the shield and does everything except grab the rail and say, \\"Dude.\\" Why, oh why, is this scene in the movie. It is as out of place as if the Fellowship were going to get a cappuccino together or if women in Middle Earth were wearing low cut pants with their thongs showing.Well, enough ranting for me. Great movie, must own DVD, just one scene messes up the illusion and fantasy of being in another time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm all alone","review":"Anyone who has read the book will be likely to find this film to be jarring. If Peter Jackson is such a Tolkien fan, why does he find it necessary to make so many gratuitous changes? My personal unfavorite is the new character Faramir who Jackson wrote in. By a strange coincidence, Tolkien also had a character by the same name in his book. I am not a purist,and loved the Fellowship despite its changes, but this time the spirit of the book has been trampled and I really don't care if I am the only person in the known universe who thinks so."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great dvd!","review":"I love the whole trilogy.

Once again, Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece, and one that is truly worthy of praise, but there is just something about it that just isnt quite as good as the books. Honestly, there is just one major problem with this one, like with the first one. The Fellowship cut out Tom Bombadil, who was one of the best characters in the books, and this one threw in a very strange side story with Aragorn, Arwen and Elrond. While the overall movie was very good, especially extended, the part where Aragorn fell off the cliff was useless and stupid. They didnt even do anything with it, just had him come back to Helms Deep later. So, you get the idea. Like the title says, very good, but it could use improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"All I have to say is that this movie is amazing. Wonderful acting and special effects.

Now I know that a movie can't follow any book exactly and I was impressed with how 'The Fellowship of the Rings' was amazingly close to the book. But the Two Towers takes some of the most key events, characters, and relationships and totally changes them around. The first movie did not.Great action... I think parts would be hard to follow for someone who hasn't read the books. There were some serious director liberties taken in this movie... many, many more than the previous. Some major events resembled the book. Others were totally changed and made less effective. Readers of the books who liked the first movie will be seriously disappointed with this movie.

Great stuff!Again, I wonder why they just didn't show this version in the theaters? Not really that much longer than the original and much more entertaining and clear. Closer to the book in a variety of ways and for you Gollum lovers there's a lot more of the slimy little creature with all of his enduring qualities.The four-disc set is also packed with extra features up the ying-yang. And don't viewing everything until you've found the hidden extra feature hosted by Peter Jackson himself.

I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I read the trilogy (it was my favorite of the three books), and was so let down by Peter Jackson's imitation of what this movie should have been. He focused too much on the battle of Helm's deep, and there were PLENTY of scenes that simply never happened in the book that they just crammed into this movie. Now I know that this makes me sound like a nerd- \\"stuff that was never in the movie,\\" but it's true- the stuff that Peter Jackson stuffed into this movie not only didn't flow with the context of the movie, but contradicted the entire thing. Frodo NEVER went to Gondor in the Two Towers. They totally left out the part where he and Sam go to Shelob's lair, and, oh man I can't even go on.

So I watched the extended version. It seems to include quite a bit of extra footage, maybe 40 minutes. You can't really tell what's all that new because it is seamlessly edited.

Perhaps I was just in a bad mood the day I watched the Fellowship and had taken my irritability out on the film... Unfortunately, Two Towers was even more horribly tedious.First, the good - the cinematography is great and the CGI animation is excellent.Second, third, and last, the bad - the characters are not at all compelling, the plot is pointless, and the entire monstrosity of a movie is so mind-numbingly boring that I had to start doing finances for some variety to avoid watching it.I am completely baffled as to why LotR is so popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"To tell you the truth, the movie is just boring!!!!","review":"I dont see peaple like this movie, I saw it the other day and it was just boring!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Platinum Series Extended Edition, because","review":"I bought Platinum Series Extended Edition Fellowship Of The Ring.

The scenery is spectacular bringing me right into Middle Earth! Gollem is the best digital character I've ever seen!! Gollem deserves an Oscar! Treebeard and the forest is awesome. Music is great.My only two complaints are as follows:1) Aragorn is more confident in the book. In the movie he seems unsure of himself and more full of self-doubt than he does in the book. Love Viggo, but he's supposed to be almost arrogant, but magnanimous, at times in the books, he's Stryder after all!!2) Boo hiss to the portrayel of Eowyn! She was brave and courageous in the book and the movie portrays her like some swooning lovesick girl and barely touches on her tremendous bravery and courage! She wanted to FIGHT in the book. The movie makes her seem like she can't decide what dress to wear.

The environments and special effects make each frame suitable for a book cover. The look and feel of this film is very much enjoyable. The action scenes are energetic and suspenseful. In the last movie the big action scene was with a huge fire monster. In this one the peak is with what seems like an unwinable war. Fantastic.

If you have not seen any of them, get both of the extended versions, and just watch. Also, the extended versions give you extra scenes, which more or less adds to the storyline but mostly are just scenes added in and should have been cut in the first place.

It's a pity we have to wait another year for the final part.The SFX in the movie are in a different dimension, far better than the last Star Wars.The only fault with the movie (as in the book) is that too many characters are wandering around in search of a plot, seemingly waiting for part three i.e the duo up the tree for most of the movie. Great stuff"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolkien must be turning in his grave","review":"The media hype surrounding this film should be an indication of how laughably bad it is. TTT has to be one of the worst movies since Plan Nine From Outer Space. It is just a muddy plotless mess, full of cheesy special effects, lame wannabe dialogue, lookalike characters, and totally devoid of any character development. I've seen better films on the SciFi channel, and that isn't saying much.The only people who could possibly enjoy this are videogame addicts, or individuals who get an intellectual challenge out of Wheel of Fortune reruns.The only reason to watch TTT is Gollum, a hilarious yet surprisingly pathetic cross between a homunculus, George W. Bush, and Donald Duck.Next time, the producers should pick a real director to film the Rings series - someone who knows how to humanize tragedy. Maybe Julie Taymor (\\"Titus\\") or Ridley Scott (\\"Gladiator\\") will take the challenge someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true fantasy movie...","review":"I confess: I never really liked the first movie, the plotline was shortened, the acting never lived up to my expectations and the whole thing had a feeling of cheap and poorly written D'n'D adventure. But the second movie simply redeems the first. First of all unlike FoTR TT preserves the epic tolkien feeling that was in the novel, and the soundtrack is just awesome. Though Eliajah Wood as Frodo still bothers me a bit (by his a la Leonardo di-Caprio appearance, not by acting) I daresay its the best movie I've seen for a very long time. Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf was great, not to mention Chris Lee as Saruman. The style is just epic (no other way to describe it) and the beginning will just left you breathless (as the batlle of Helm's Deep). The whole movie got a slight Warcraft feeling to it but it only adds to the movie. In short: if you want to see a perfect fantazy epic(and you liked the original novel), this movie is just for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fix the frickin case!","review":"I love the Lord of the Rings extended edition DVDs so much; but I often wonder if the wonder of the extended editions are half in the cases that hold them: Amazing leather textures, beautiful artwork, and symbols from Tolkien.

Walmart will refund a peice of chewed gum, they are probably on of the best companies about that hands down. If the edition doesn't play on your machine, it's probably YOUR machine, not the discs. This edition is CHOKED full of special footage, extended scenes actually added back in the film(not seperate like most editions), and awesome packaging. If you love these movies don't miss out on the TRUE directors vision and extended scenes. WAAAAAY to much to talk about, just buy it already!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic piece of movie making","review":"I can see where some people have a problem with this film. Some of the events are inventions of the film makers and it isn't the perfect companion to the novel. But come on, this is an adaptation of a novel with such depth that it certainly appears to be impossible to translate, unchanged, to the big screen. I enjoy the film for what it is, a wonderfully emotional and engrossing tale, with very believable performances and top notch production values. It is in my opinion, the best middle part of a trilogy yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware the Ch. 51 pixellation glitch!!!","review":"New Line has released a huge batch of defective discs with this film.

There is literally no way to tell whether your disc is defective simply by looking at the surface of the DVD. Only by bringing it home and watching through Ch. 51 will you be able to tell whether you received a clean copy or a defective coaster. Please BEWARE when purchasing this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walks like a duck, talks like a duck...","review":"Okay, let's all be honest. This LOOKS like the best film trilogy ever made, and it SOUNDS like the best film trilogy ever made, well, it must be! Even the Star Wars original trilogy (which is classic) has the sad connection with episodes 1 and 2. Indiana Jones has episode 2, which took that trilogy out of the running, and the Jurassic Park movies...I need not say more.

I just CAN'T wait to see the end of the story (Return of the king). I guess these movies will be around for decades. They're the best movies on the universe. These movies have changed my life.

FOTR is a wonderful movie while its sequel, TTT, is even better. ROTK will most likely be the best movie in the trilogy. However, I must say that the first two movies do deviate from the book trilogy at some points. But that is why the Extended Cut DVDs were made. The Special Extended DVD Edition of FOTR was wonderful and went by the book trilogy very well. I am sure TTT Extended Cut DVD will go by the book trilogy very well also. I cannot wait to own it!

Thinking it had all the scenes. I found out it also has the Theatre Version.

There are admittedly one or two boring parts, but the rest is completely worth it. The battle of Helms Deep is the best cinematography I have ever seen and I love how they created Treebeard. My only problem is the climax of the battle with the Wargs. I felt that was only put it for more drama and more scenes with Liv Tyler in them. But in all, you would not waste money if you bought this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly sad showing","review":"I was very dissapointed in the second installment of The Lord Of The Rings movies. They took the most mediocre book in the series and turned it into a sub-par action film. It has its moments, but the action scenes drag on and on and seem to have no character development what-so-ever. I was extremely pleased with the first film. Even if it wasn't Tolkien's middle earth. It was still a fine rendition of a classic novel. After this poor showing I certainly hope Jackson and friends can deliver in the third installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely Awesome and explosive ride through the Middle Earth","review":"This is the best movie of all fantasy titles! The story is not very true to the book of t he movie. But it does has very cool scenes, good acrting and spectacular battles. The ents were superior, Helms deep was awesome. A must watch.The tiny problem was that it didn't follow the book. But it makes up this flaw from the visual effects and quality of this movie. Watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Version You Want to See","review":"This is definitely the version of the film that you want to see. With over 40 minutes of extra footage, this version of Peter Jackson's Academy Award Winning film is deeper and fuller and closer to the book. Although Tolkien purists do not care for the changes Jackson made to Frodo's story line and the character of Faramir, Jackson otherwise captures the spirit of Tolkien's second part to The Lord of the Rings. Among the extra scenes are: a sequence with Merry and Pippin which draws from \\"Old Man Willow\\" in book of Fellowship of the Ring; a very helpful and interesting conversation between Gandalf and Aragorn about Aragorn's destiny; more of Frodo and Sam; more of Treebeard and the Ents (including their attack on the orcs in Fangorn Forest); and the delightful chapter from the book, \\"Flotsam and Jetsam.\\" There are also HOURS of documentary material which show just how much work it really took to produce such a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer Alert! This re-release in blu-ray is theatrical version (179 Min) , not Special Extended Edition (223 Min)","review":"The skinny is this should be subtitled as \\"Theatrical Edition\\" (179 Min), but it's not. Since blu-ray tech came well after the release of the DVD special extended edition release (223 Min), one would think Peter Jackson would only re-release the superior special extended version in the stead of the theatrical edition? Bottom line, he didn't. So why would Mr. Jackson make this release of the shorter version instead? Well to fool those consumers who would think that the blu-ray would naturally have the extended version. Thus those foolish costumers (my hand risen, as one of them) will end up buying both versions, Theatrical and the more aparently impending to be later re-released Special Extended, separately on blu-ray... pretty ef'ed up, but true. LOTR Fan consumers beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment = A Great Movie","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, unlike other movies that were released in 2002, has a lot of great excitement and entertainment to offer.

For the Two Towers, if it says 170-180 minutes, it is the theatrical version. if it is over 220 minutes, then it is the extended. I am very disappointed in amazon for saying that I was purchasing the extended version in their description when it was ONLY the theatrical. The \\"What do you Get\\" section is WRONG for theatrical version. Amazon providing an in-accurate product page caused me to purchase the wrong version.

It doesn't need a bunch of sex and bad words to make it worth going to either. The only problem people might have with it is violence, which can be intense for youngsters, and even adults.Still, I loved the movie. It works excellently with Tolkien's second book in the trilogy, though there ARE some bones to pick with it: some things are definitely changed, the biggest one taking place in Faramir, who in the books is a stout, brave-hearted nobleman who refuses to give in to the temptation of the Ring.

At several places they mention how little they think about the way Tolkien developed this or that character or plot element. They completely misunderstand what Tolkien was saying about Faramir's character, and where they do retreat to an almost-Tolkienian love story between Aragorn and Arwen, they admit that this was after trying to make Arwen into a warrior and failing.The movie is entertaining, and the casting, staging and effects are superb.

Along with the incorrect emphasis on the battle of Helm's Deep, the interaction between Frodo and Faramir is absolutely incorrect. I don't understand why the tale was so corrupted by this film. I dread the release of The Return of The King because who knows how the wonderful original Tale will be corrupted like it was in the Two Towers.

Even the mumaks (oliphaunts) and ents looked outstanding! The battle scenes were very intense , especially the Batte Of Helms Deep. I cannot wait untill this film comes out on DVD!

But one of the reasons the first movie was so good was because it followed the book so well, while still eliminating unnecessary parts and with few additions. It's hard to believe the second and first movies were made at the same time. Two Towers has pretty much the whole story rewritten! And the saying, \\"If it's not broken don't fix it\\" holds true. the movie becomes boring, with repetitive and pointless action sequences that were apparently added for the purpose of making it more engaging.

To be honest, the way Tolkien wrote the books I felt like I was at the dentist having all my teeth pulled. His way of writing reminded me of the only teacher I have ever had who put me to sleep in class. Therefore, I think any departure from the way the books were orginally written is not a bad thing. After all, the first movie had things that were not true to the story as well and yet it was hailed by even the \\"purists\\" as a wonderful movie. If any of you remember the actual story for the first movie, Arwen actually had a very very small role in the book. Yet in the movie her role is greatly expanded. The council of Elrond was much much longer in the book than in the movies and the part with the Watcher was a much smaller threat in the book than in the movie. So I really think that the deviation from the book in the second movie really benefits the story just as the deviations in the first movie benefitted it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will probably be the greatest trilogy ever filmed","review":"Great movie, great visuals, and the battle at Helm's Deep is spectacular. My only complaint is Peter Jackson's straying from the book, which becomes more pronounced here than in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\" In the book, the people of Rohan are noble and great warriors. In the movie, they're essentially some mopey wimps, who fight because they have to, and aren't really that good at it. This is sad, because the book really establishes them as major and important characters to the story line, especially Theoden and Eomer, but they're really relegated to minor characters in the movie. A pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" is the best movie of 2002! \\"Chicago\\" is the worst movie of 2002! Who cares about the dumb Oscars! At least \\"The Two Towers\\" won two. No movie can get better than this! Only \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\" will be even better than \\"The Two Towers. Believe it or not this movie is even better than \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" it's wonderful prequel. Buy it for DVD or VHS when it is released in stores! \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" is amazing and spectacular!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific presentation, poor screenplay","review":"Visually this movie is a masterpiece. The sets, the towns, landscapes, the creatures.. everything is right out of middle earth. In this area, the film truly shines and those working on this film are to be commended for it.I found the screenplay to leave a lot to be desired, however. Someone should tell the writers that they don't need to have a climactic moment every 10 minutes. This really killed the momentum of the movie. I was also a little disappointed at how they turned Gimli into comic relief.Watching this film was certainly a pleasure, but I can't say that I'd do it again anytime in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has to be the worst movie ever!!!","review":"This movie was SOOOOOOO Not worth buying, seeing, or renting!!!The only reason I gave it one star was for the special effects. They were very well done! But the movie itself is so far off from the books that I am in doubt as to whether I will even see the third one even at a $1.00 theater! I know that film makers can't follow the book exactly but they could have at least gotten a few things right. In the book when Frodo and Sam were caught by the men from Gondor they were released from there. They never went with them anywhere else. What is this malarkey about going to see Boromir's father? And what's this about having to trick the Ents into going to war? Yes they debated for several days in the book, but never had to be tricked.All in all a complete waste of time. If you really have to see this movie, go rent it from your local grocery store where you can get it for $1.00 for 5 days. I wouldn't spend any more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spectacular Film! Better Than Its Wonderful Prequel","review":"This is an awsome movie! I loved it when the Rohirrim and the wargs faught against each other. The battle for Helms Deep was triumphant! And when the ents stormed Isengard: VERY ANTICIPATING!!! With a lot of intense action, adventure, drama, wonderful acting, stunning special effects, and great music (score) \\"Lord of the Rings: Two Towers\\" is a must see movie sequel. I can't wait to see \\"Lord of the Rings: Return of the King\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling fantasy epic that never bores or fails to excite","review":"There isn't very much at all to be said about this film that hasn't already been said ad nausem. It totally manages to outdo the first film in the series in every way possible, especially in entertainment value. The characters are well developed and always interesting, and the massive battle scenes (especially the Battle of Helms Deep) are undoubtedly the best ever filmed for medeviel epic, and that includes Braveheart. Anyone that even vaguely enjoys any kind of fantasy/action and has two and a half hours to kill should pick this up as soon as possible. An essiential piece to any DVD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!This is the best movie I've ever seen!","review":"WOW!And I thought the FOTR was good!!!!!!!!!!!!This is the best sequal EVER made!The acting,visual effects,direction,everything is so mucher better than the first(well,except for maybe the story.I think the first one had a better story).They made a few changes from the book,but it is still an enjoyable movie.I can't wait for The Return of The King on December 17.See this,but see the first one first because you wiil be REALLY confused if you don't.A must see!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings Two Towers","review":"Good action, Its hard to put the books to movie but they are giving it a try. A little hurried / If you have read the books You would be disppointed But give it a try its worth watching. Only problem and complaint I have is with the music on both dvd's that drowns out the dialog!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A whole new world","review":"I am a big fan of Lord of the Rings and I bought the Fellowship Extended Edition. With the extended versions it opens the story up to you. It gives you more of the story and fans of the book will be especially please that alot of left out scene's were put in the extended edition dvd. The Ent Draft scene i was especially pleased was put in the extended. The extended editon is the ideal gift for a fan of LOTR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Fantasy Movies Ever!","review":"Place me in the camp of those who think that the LOTR trilogy is the greatest fantasy series ever. Any one of the movies is better than any fantasy movie before it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even more than meets the eye","review":"This extended version puts back in all of the scenes that the directors wanted to keep but due to time restraints were cut out. But what I found the most interesting were the Appendices after the movies. These were just as long and were a pleasure to watch, showing behind the scenes footage of the movies. I would recommend this to anybody who liked the movies or the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's taters, precious?","review":"Oh, my. I cannot believe how much better this was than the theatrical release. Even that was nearly perfect. Now, I'd say this is the perfect movie. Extended and new scenes added so much to the film, and they were placed in perfectly. I'm very glad the Faramir scenes were added. Definitely fixed it a lot. Everything about this movie is great. I haven't watched the appendices yet, but I did find Smeagol/Gollum's MTV award. It was hilarious. Watch it. NOW!!!Just 2.5 weeks til Return of the King!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Two Towers","review":"When I first saw the Two Towers in theater opening night, I was only half-way through the RotK book. Being a 13 year old, I was pretty happy I was going to finish the Hobbit and the LotR trilogy before the third movie ever produced its trailers.The Two Towers was an excellent movie. Fast paced, energetic, tense at some parts. I too, have some complaints of some of the things that they left out of the movie, such as the Entmoot, and the fact that Haldir was at Helm's Deep, I don't remember that in the book. It was a great movie nonetheless, and thus I thought it was better than the first.See, the first movie or book was like a platform, the pillars to construct a structure, introducing the characters, laying out the storyline, but where the Two Towers picked up, then it started getting action packed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Movie!","review":"'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is an outstanding movie sequel! It is as outstanding as its prequel 'Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring'. The special effects were great! Musical (score) was incredible! And the acting was superb! The best thing about 'The Two Towers' is that it goes by author J.R.R. Tolkiens 'Lord of the Rings' book trilogy in a unique way! I can't wait to own 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' for VHS when it is released in stores!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forth Eorlingas!","review":"This movie is spectacular! I thought the special effects, music (score), and cinamatography were wonderful! Gandalf's fight with the balrog, the warg battle, the Battle for Helms Deep, and when the ents storm Isengard are amazingly stunning scenes! This Oscar-winning movie is something I highly recommend you buy for your DVD collection. I do not own the origional version of \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\". But I will soon own the Special Extended DVD Edition of \\"The Two Towers\\" on November 18nth. I can't wait to own it! I am glad to own the Special Extended DVD Edition of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\" movie prequel. It is fascinating!"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],M={key:0},H={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-3de00540"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/11.md","filePath":"quotesmag/11.md"}'),N={name:"quotesmag/11.md"},j=Object.assign(N,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{G as __pageData,j as default};
