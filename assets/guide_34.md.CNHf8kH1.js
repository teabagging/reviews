Shame on Amazon for selling such low grade product (the movie is most definately not remastered). When I found this movie I was excited to order it after watching the TNT version with dubbing and clear picture. The \\"remastered\\" picture looks like someone recorded the master copy from a VCR tape that had played on a loop for 15 years. Totally unwatchable. You can't even read the subtitles half the time because they are so washed out. I felt the pit of my stomach drop when the credits came up.Now out 15 bucks, though a cheap lesson was learned: Amazon does not check the products for accuaracy.Unfortunatly, since Jackie Chan no longer allows American companies to buy his film rights (due to the hacked-up versions), the only way to get this movie will be if yesasia.com stars to carry it, and even then it will not likely to be in english."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan of racing and Jackie delivers","review":"I love this movie first saw it 10 years ago my friend owned it and I had forgotten about it until I ran across it on Amazon.

Recommended only for diehard J. C. fans, & even then only as a rental (there's a reason New Line Cinema, who purchased the rights to Thunderbolt way back when it was being made, never bothered to release it theatrically).

Out of desperation for some new books I picked up three of his recent novels, including this one.I am very tired of Mr. Robinson's sidebar negative comments or hints about the left wing and on-going praise for the right along with the current administration. It distracts from the story and just comes across as unprofessional and childish.And this adulation for the retired Admiral Morgan saving the day, over and over and over is just riduculous and laughable.

He always receives 'A' for accuracy.Sure, the attention to details on geographic and cultural are there in this book as with his others.

He has SEALs stumbling around in the dark without night vision devices, A-4 Skyhawks with 2 engines, a SEAL team that turns into a SAS team after 40 pages, SEALs carrying the tripod for a M60 on a long mission, a long time SEAL with no parachute experience, and a poorly thought out campaign by the British to retake the Falkland islands (apparently the British do not have any stand off weapons such as cruise missles).I gave up on Robinson while reading Scimitar because he had Iranians speaking Arab to each other. As most people know, Iranians speak Farsi because Iranians are not Arabs, they are Persians - the original Aryans.I gave this book a try because the jacket made it interesting but I will not be reading any more of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in the extreme","review":"I've been a big fan of Patrick Robinson's books -- until now. Adm. Morgan's my kind of officer and the writing was, up until now, quite good. Ghost Force, however, feels rushed and stilted. The writing, sentence structure, and general feel seem almost like a basic high school creative writing exercise gone awry. Even the military action, usually so well-crafted, feels wrong. As a former U.S. Army SF Medic, I know a little about combat action and this just doesn't come off as well as Robinson's other works. A good novel doesn't have to be hurriedly shaped around current events and most of us don't read this type of story for political edification but for a good old-fashioned, kick butt escape. Better luck with the next one, Mr. R."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Robinson really write this?","review":"I usually look forward to reading the newest Patrick Robinson book when it hits the shelves. So when I received Ghost Force in the mail (I'm stationed in the Middle East right now) I was excited to see how Admiral Arnie was going to save the world this time. About an hour into the book I had to check the cover again to see if Patrick Robinson's name was on the cover. That's how horrible I found this book to be. I hoped it would get better the more I read; It didn't!

There's a bandoneon, awakening echos of Astor Piazzola, and what looks to be a Brazilian cavaquinho - a guitar-like instrument,and bata drums. Eliane Elias, a beautiful Brazilian jazz pianist, performs a swinging \\"Samba Triste\\". And the list goes on. Jerry Gonzales and Fort Apache are memorable, as are Chucho Valdez with his dad Bebo; Michel Camilo's fingers fly across the keyboard with the speed of light- there's Cachao,Puntilla Rios and more.Tito Puente gives us an energy-filled farewell, sounding as great as ever.

It's also kinda creepy. After all the orchestral tension, who would have predicted the rising wail of a chorus in the Miraculous Mandarin, brief as it may be? Bartok's music is full of surprises. Probably the most enjoyable on this CD is the Miraculous Mandarin. Obviously that's the meat. And it presents some of the finest orchestral playing I've heard in a long time. All the performers are in their element, and Bartok's music can shine clearly without the marring of bad playing or bad interpretational decisions.

Sent it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Game, Cheap Components","review":"Farkle is a very fun game to play. The problem with this unit is how cheap the contents in the box are. The dice cup is small and plastic, not the typical leather bound dice cup most of us are used to. The dice are also very low end. My suggestion would be to go out to a bar game store and buy a good dice cup, good dice, and then download the rules for this game off of the internet.It was only $10.00, but it just wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable fun","review":"I bought this game to take along while traveling. It is a very easy game to learn, and a lot of fun. I took the game out of the box and put the dice and a few score sheets in an altoid tin. Since the score sheets include the instructions for the game, that was all that was needed. You can play this game anywhere. We played it in our hotel room during our last trip. Since it fits so easily in my pocketbook, I can imagine playing in a restaurant while waiting for our food. I think my 7 year old grandson will enjoy playing it with us. Strategy, luck and even some math skills = a great game for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"This is a nice \\"Farkle\\" kit.

This would be perfect for someone who loves red, or wears a lot of neutral colors. The flowers are delicate, the red enamel is bold, resulting in a ring that is very striking yet feminine. When the light hits it, the glow of the enamel and the sparkle of the flower design makes it quite the attention-getter- I've already gotten several compliments on it.Having read other reviews, I think there may be a color difference between batches of enamel. For what it's worth, my ring is a very definite ruby red, just as shown in the Amazon photo. The enamel and design are only on the top side of the ring- the areas not shown by the picture are smooth silver and also taper to a slimmer area in the back, which is great because it makes the ring more comfortable to wear and less prone to chipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious????","review":"My husband got this ring for me for Mother's Day, when it got here not only was I disappointed in the quality of the ring but it was missing one of the crystals- I realize that this is not an expensive piece of jewelery but it was something that I wanted to wear as a fun accessory- Anyway, my hubby sent back the ring and asked them to exchange it for a new one. Well we got a new ring- it is a gaudy, fake, cubic zirconia, wedding set! Nothing like what he originally ordered and definitely not the ring that he purchased and exchanged. I mean seriously- do you just send random rings to people when they ask for an exchange???? My husband is in the process of sending back this ring (again)and at this point I told him just to ask for his money back- Never again will we order something from Eve's Addiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't look as impressive in person","review":"I've had this ring for two years now, and I've hardly worn it.

Whether with Ducks Deluxe, The Tyla Gang or on his own, his everyman voice and his savvy choice of musicians gave each and every project he worked on a gritty, no-foolin' around feel that'll appeal instantly to Dire Straits/mid-seventies-Clapton fans. Mau Mau/Demon U.K.'s superb reissue teams up the band's only two albums (the first was released in North America but Taxi To The Terminal Zone wasn't) on a great disc. And Amazon makes it available for a mere pittance! This is great rock and roll with its heart and soul in the right place. Key tracks include \\"Don't Mind Rockin' Tonite\\" and \\"Fireball\\".

Even the video is shot totally in a party scene. It is slower to be made aware of Italian music here in the states. I have been a dance music freak for years.

I loved running across names we today know went on to assume very powerful political positions (Rhenquist, Jarvis, Cap Weinberger) etc., yet reading about these guys when they were just \\"tots\\" in the political process.Other fantastic background included the Knott's Berry Farm connection in a nascently fascistic Orange County! Who could've known the power of the...blackberry? Nixon, Rockefeller, Scranton and other so-called Republican moderates of the early 1960s were also maddeningly inept against the more \\"extreme\\" Goldwater supporters. Good drama here.My only gripe, and it came up again and again, was the writing. Perlstein isn't a bad writer, but he most definitely needs a talented editor in tow.

THIS IS THE BEST!!","review":"This is THE best super soaker EVER!! I have like twenty soakers and this is definitely THE BEST ONE EVER!! First of all the Flash Flood has a nice water tank to fill so you only run out of ammo if you waste it.

Buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely fun gun","review":"This is the first time I bought a super soaker and playing tag with it. The tank can hold a large amount, although not surpassing the other big guns. The pumping is kind of hard to pump, but the results after 30-35(recommended)pumps can get someone seriously wet. Its weight is a bit heavy for me with the full water load and after a while my arm gets tired of holding it.The cannon on top of the gun is an awesome feature. After the pumps, you can blast out the water to catch someone on the run. What I think is good is that the blasts have a good radius and can hit someone easily, but then you are vulnerable while you pump again. I think other kids would enjoy this gun as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gun, since when were waterguns educational","review":"I was reading all the reviews and most of them said that this gun was bad and broke easily. so i bought it because it was the only one they had in stock.

Most kids thing it has good range and power. If you want to see good range and power, get a cps2000 or make a gun! It only shoots 35 feet which i am sorry to say is rather pathetic. The triple shot shoots further.The \\"flash flood\\" riot blast is not that great either, it basically retracts the cps pressure chamber and empties all of it's contents, which hit a grate and spray with pathetic range and a shot time of about 1 second. If you poke the grate out the stream is better. Also mine broke, when i pump it it automatically shoots. i thought this may be good for acting like a blaster that uses a piston-based pressure system, but it shoots about 2 feet. (The Gremlin which has a piston shoots about 40 feet) if you want a good blaster, get an older cps cannon like a cps2000, 1500, or 2100. or get an aquamaster precharger (argon, krypton, or xenon) or a blazer."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GUN","review":"If you are in a battle this is the gun to get. not recomended for small kids the blast will push them down. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great water gun","review":"This water gun has many advantages.

They've lowered the market age by at least 5 years with their new pathetic \\"soaker tag\\" blasters. They discontinued the fast filler, no pump technology which had been newly developed by larami, constant pressure system, and the amazing guns which were coming off the assembly line in 2002. My splashzooka is a reminder of a sad day when super soaker was bought out. I am an addictive super soaker user and have boycotted every weapon produced by hasbro.

The flash flood nozzle may be powerful, but it empties your firing chamber in the blink of an eye. Here's a tip: cut out the mesh over the nozzle and you'll get, like, 10 feet better range. Probably a check valve freeze would bring up the range considerably, but I wouldn't know. My Flash Flood got 30 feet at the most. To state it simply, there WERE air-powered soakers that are better than this \\"CPS\\" soaker with a pint-sized pressure chamber. Some of the better soakers of the XP-line were better than this, but that's a separate rant. Oh yeah, it's got the Max-D style trigger system, so you know it's going to break in, like, a few weeks. I mean, if you see it on a Wal-Mart clearance rack for twelve bucks then, yeah, go for it, but don't pay full price for this sad excuse for a CPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Flash flood water gun is great!!!!!!","review":"This water gun is cool.It has two different streams of water power. The regular stream which shoots almost 35ft. And the flash flood stream that hits your friends like a tsunami.

It is remniscent of the first EP, but with similar production to their full-length. Amidst their stylistic contemporaries, Pelican stands out as a great atmospheric metal band, avoiding some of the pitfalls of bands like Isis and Neurosis (bands I also like, but they are no Pelican). After about 15 mins into 'March into the Sea,' look out for that flute! Also pay attention for the bowed guitar. At 20 minutes, the title track is longer than many EPs with half the musicianship, and that isn't even mentioning the remix of 'Angel Tears' from Australasia, which is interesting and good, but really just a bonus track at the end of the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Really...","review":"As I read the reviews, I got excited but upon listening it's nothing much to shout about.

I don't hear nothing new. Get any album by Mastodon put it beside this offering and you'll immediately see how pale Pelican is in comparison.I suggest anyone reading to go and get Corrupted's El Mundo Frio (2005) instead and you'll hear true heaviosity, skill and invention.

Anyone who read Mr. McGill's slipshod review of Christine Northrup's \\"Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom\\" knows of what I speak. How anyone could review that book without noting that Dr. Northrup is quite a looker for a woman of her age is beyond me.

Yes, the man can drink. Both men can, in fact. But isn't it also important to note that Mr. Blend can, when he chooses, have a totally bitchin' 'fro?

Not because of the music's beauty, but because of its monotony. Every song is sluggish and depressing. I love acoustic music, but there's no life here. Ron Sexsmith, who is on this album also does lots of acoustic songs, but he mixes it up a little. I bought this based on Shear's good track record as a writer and on his choice of duet partners. But there's no tune here that sticks with me. To top things off, Jules' singing is poor--his pinched voice is really irritating on this album.

One of the underneath corners was cracked all the way through. I did give this a 2 because after taking a permanent marker and filling in the corners and having my husband put in a new piece of wood under the table, the table does look very nice.

I've done what I can with a black Sharpie to color in the paint that was either scraped off, or was never painted on properly in the first place. I specifically chose this table instead of an extremely cheap one so that I'd have something that didn't look second-hand and shabby. I failed.

The case is of recycled plastic and does not look like it will hold up very well.My foreman bought one for us to use and it worked ok but the shield has a hard rubber gasket and it scratched the ceilings when it was used and did not do a good job of catching the dust.If it sold for half the price it might not be a bad deal.

I have to admit that it did feela lot like getting a tattoo in the first few minutes I used it (I have four)... but I didn't give up - I kept on going and was surprised to adjust to the feeling pretty quickly. It feels more like a vibration-massage than tweezing if you use the rolling-stimulation attachment. Also true is that hair grows in cycles so you'll need to do the epilation repeatedly until you catch each cycle. I'm looking forward to a hair-free summer this year! I was sooo sick of shaving!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work","review":"It didn't work by pulling the hair out, it broke the hair off.

I noticed that there were still little hairs the wax didn't get. I would go home and tweeze as many as I could with relatively no pain. Well, I thought I was getting tough and could handle doing it all myself at home. I bought this epilator (my first ever) and it hurt worse than waxing. When you wax, it's a quick motion, this thing has to be dragged slowly up your leg. I would have to force my arm to continue up my leg it hurt so bad. It did seem to cut some skin where it raises up around the hair. I even used it on my boyfriend who is very pain tollerant. After it was on his arm for 2 seconds he pulled his arm away. Spend the money to get waxed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peach!","review":"I decided to try this after years of shaving and several months of waxing. I absolutely think this is the way to go, never have razor burn, or sticky wax residue! The first few times you use it, it will hurt about the same as waxing but w/a bonus if it hurts to bad you can stop, unlike w/waxing which if you stop your going to regret it! Also you will save a lot of money in razors, wax and strips cause you won't have to spend money on them again! Just like when I made the switch from pc to mac... I'll never go back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am sorry to have wasted my money on this product. I purchased the Braun 5270 as a replacement for my Remington Smooth&Silky EP-1000 that has served me well for the last 6-7 years of regular use. By comparison the Braun left many hairs even after repeated passes over my legs, and yes, I know how to use an epilator properly. In addition, the construction seems flimsy compared to the Remington model which is no longer available for purchase. I wish I had tried the Emjoi AP-10L with the gold plated feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the older Braun epilators","review":"When I bought this product, I had high expectations. For years now, I've been using an old Braun epilator that I really loved. It was effective that it pulled my hair from the roots and didn't not leave any hair behind. I thought this new Braun epilator would be better. But when I tried it, it wasn't able to pull my hair from the roots. Hence, it left a lot of hair still. I didn't have that \\"totally clean\\" and \\"totally hairless\\" feeling afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time epilator","review":"I have never used an epilator before, and I read a lot of reviews before deciding. I am pleased with my purchase. I read mixed reviews on this one, but I have found all features to be useful.The light, some reviews said useless, I feel it's very helpful. Maybe it's just my lighting, but I love it!The massage rollers, helpful the first few times on the legs, and still very helpful on the bikini!One stroke removal, not so much with me. I have fine blond hairs on my legs, I have to go over it a few times to get them all. (That's why I only gave it 4 stars) But it could just be my hair, hard to tell as I don't have a comparison.I must confess, I tried the underarms, but it was much too painful for me. So I will continue to shave them.Overall, I am pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"smart product, good dealer","review":"When I use it at the first time, i can't help yelling for the unbearable pain. but next time, when i use it again, such experience doesn't go back again, and like it more and more. very smart product. delivery is also very fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy if you're okay with pain","review":"This is a great product for those of you who hate to shave except that it hurt REALLY bad. The first time is the worst...but it gets better after a few tries. Unfortunately, my leg hair is thick and dark and this epilator always leaves some hair behind. This is worth the money if you're willing to spend some time making your legs perfectly hair free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excruciating!","review":"This is my first experience with using an epilator. I normally wax my thighs and bikini area myself with minimal pain, so I thought epilation would be an easier and less expensive option to using wax strips. I thought I was a pretty tough chick, being able to do my own waxing. Boy was I wrong! This thing is incredibly painful to use. I have tried to use it on multiple body parts, while following all of the instructions, such as making sure the hair is the appropriate length, and holding it at the right angle. I even tried using it after a long steamy shower. I will continue to keep trying to get used to the pain, im hoping maybe it'll get better as other reviewers have said. Although, I'm unable to compare it to any other epilator, I think it does a very good job of doing what it is made for, and that is why I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really does a great job.","review":"I have used other electric epilators through the years so I am used to the slight pull as the hairs are removed from my legs & thighs. This one in particular is wonderful--not very much pulling at all and it has two speeds--the slower is very good over the knees.It is very efficient at removing all the hair. I personally do not use it on my underarms so cannot comment on that use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked at first, but it started breaking hairs off (instead of pulling them out)","review":"I bought this product less than a year ago and have used it about 4 times. I breaks the hair off instead of pulling it out. I noticed that it did this a bit from the very start, but it was not TOO bad. It rapidly became worse, and now that is all it does. It creates the worst ingrown hairs as a result. This is on the SLOW setting (as it always has been). I cleaned it diligently (which is a real pain in the rear with this one), and kept it in good condition. None of it made a difference.As for the pain, it is no better or worse than any other.Sadly, I thought that it might be better than the cheap Panasonic that I was using because the reviews were so good. It looks like I will be getting another cheap Panasonic. It worked fine and lasted a few years before it died, but it very rarely broke off a hair and it DID work up to the day it died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun 5270 Silk-èpil X'elle","review":"This is the fourth silk-epil I purchase in the past 12 years. I use it until I feel it is time to get a better and newer version of it. I have tried other brands -roventta, philips- and realized that Braun is the best by far.This last version, the X'elle one, is interesting since it has the little light which is always useful, and you do feel it removes more hair in less time. I also liked the blue color.None of the epilators I own have ever given me a problem. Indeed, I still use one from 7 years ago that I keep in my parents house so I don't have to carry mine when I go visiting them. My mother also has one and so does my friend.The legs last in good shape for about a week and then you start seeing those little ones showing and growing. Still, it is a better option than shaving your legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope to never shave again","review":"I love this, its a little more painful than waxing because I'm doing it myself and its slower but I can do it once a week and at home whenever I need it.

It's a relief not having to shave all the time and deal with razor burn or rashes. And I don't have to pay for waxing anymore (not to mention dealing with incompetence). This epilator seems very well deisgned.

When the hair grows back in, it looks like it has been cut, not pulled at the root. I used to use EpiLady and that thing pulled from the roots, you felt it and you could see the difference with the way the hair grows back. This seems like it is just cutting it really low. I would not really recommend this product if you are looking for something to replace waxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-stop use","review":"Yes, this item does work to pull the hairs out at the root and hurts like nobody's business...but I found I had to use the darn thing almost every day for a month!

It works great. My legs are smooth and it lasts a long time. Surprisingly, it didn't really hurt. I'm sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I got this because I was tired of paying all of that money for razor blades. So, my mom and I did a little research and chose this product. It hurt a little at first, but after a little time, it was no big deal. However, this cut my hair instead of pulling it out. I ended up with stubble all over the place and had to shave anyway. I also had a horrible time using this on my knees as it literally ate up and cut the skin on them. After using it for 4 months, I gave it to my mom and told her she was more than welcome to use it. And of course she does, with perfect results. (PARENTS!!!) So, I guess it really depends what you 'hair type' is. Mine grows back fast and is really thick. My moms grows back slower and is really fine. But for me, this was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product..lasted only a year","review":"I used this product for a year..loved it..but exactly at the end of one year it wouldnt work and the warranty did not apply.

I've been waxing most of my life, and this is so much cheaper and less mess and hassle. Also, if you've waxed a lot, the pain isn't that bad (though it's probably quite bad if you've never done this kind of hair removal before). You do have to be careful to exfoliate your legs regularly to avoid ingrown hairs, but that's true of waxing, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I own an older version of the Braun epilator which I have had for 11 years now and still works like a charm, but I purchased this in the US after after moving there: it is fantastic, I was so pleased with my first one that I wasn't surprised that this brand had the most positive reviews on amazon. The new one is quieter and lighter and I am loving it! Highly recommend it, the only thing I am not sure is why the price keeps going up...but hopefully I won't need to buy another one for at least another decade or more so definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it ladies!!","review":"Not gonna lie, it's a bit painful but I believe every girl should own this epilator.

I expected the style to have changed over the years but not the quality of the new epilator and shaver. It's now cheaply made and the shaver is duller than the one I have been using for several years. I have returned this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensitive skin beware","review":"For those of us with sensitive skin, this is not an ideal product. While one can expect an epilator to hurt, especially for someone new to epilation, this one hurts pretty bad. For me, it became somewhat tolerable after a few uses, but I have a pretty high tolerance for pain. Also, people with sensitive skin may experience redness. The first time I used it, I looked like I had a giant rash all over. Not a pretty sight!Overall, this probably isn't a bad product for most people, but if you have sensitive skin, please try another epilator."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!!!","review":"Didn't remove all the hair. Quite painful. Redness lasted less than 1 hour. Overall, not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun 5270","review":"The first time I tried the Braun, I was very surprised at how little it hurt compared to waxing. The next day, I realized why: It seems to only be breaking off the hairs and not pulling the hair out from the root. To be fair, I decided to use it for 6 weeks and then decide on effectiveness. I have exclusively used the product once a week for 6 weeks and have seen no diminishing of hair and definitely no reduction on the need to shave. After 2 days I need to shave and by the end of the week I definitely need to do something with the hair on my legs. As far as effectiveness, it is no different than using an electric razor. It is slower than shaving (electric or otherwise) and since there isn't a difference in the need to shave, you are better off just shaving."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite!","review":"I bought this epilator 3 weeks ago & absolutely love it! It earned a 4 star rating for one tiny reason - you have to plug it in, there isn't a rechargable battery. Other than that, it is fantastic. I was always afraid of epilators because of the idea that it rips your hair out from the root. Then I realized that it probably wouldn't be any worse than getting waxed. I was right, it's actually far less painful than getting waxed (and far less expensive). I don't have to use the epilator as often as I would have to shave. I love the little light - it really helps me to see what I'm doing. I would definitely recommend this epilator. It's well worth the cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for good price","review":"My wife liked it very much... she says it's very convenient and easy to use and it was not much from my pocket :). Additionally it came in 2 days with prime free shipping. So I would say, \\"Its cool\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"The light is great and the power/strength is fine, but the placement of the two rollers is a problem and will not effectively epilate in some places (forced to go at certain angles sometimes to fit) --- only an almost direct/flat application on the face of the rollers will work. Trying to use an edge or one side will not work. Also, the interchangeable cover would not stay in place after a few months and I just ended up using it open top with the rollers fully exposed. Recommend the 1) Emjoi Optima or 2) Emjoi Emagine instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it...","review":"I was a regular epilator user. The previous model I had was of philips. That one was great too, but since I purchased it in UK, there was a voltage difference here. Moreover, it was kind of bulky with the ice attachment.But this product is simply amazing. It definitely is less painful. What I loved most was the shaving attachment. If you are not in the mood for epilating, simply shave for now. Works great on all parts of the body. Have not tried it on the face though.Would recommend any one trying epilating for the first time to use this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish it were cordless!","review":"i've wanted an epilator for a while and it took me forever to decide which one to get. it was between this one and a panasonic i finally went with the braun because of all the positive review on amazazon. this one definitely epilates better than the panasonic - the light helps me see finer hairs, and it takes less passes. it's noisier, but i don't really mind that. the only problem with the braun is that it's corded! the panasnoic is cordless and it's wet/dry so you can use it in the shower (which is nice because of all the hair that falls...gross i know). so basically the braun is great but i'm only giving it 4 stars because it's corded :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously Painful","review":"Epilating is RIDICULOUSLY painful. While I'm sure this might be a good product, I used it once with the epilation tip and that was it. I could barely do a square inch, let alone an entire leg. Has worked great though with the shaving head. That's about all I'm gonna be using it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, FAST SHIPPING!","review":"I have to say it hurt a lot because I haven't used an epilator in four months, but I was very shocked to see HOW GREAT this product is, it really takes all the little tiny hairs out, VERY SURPRISED.Great Product,Fast Shipping, I got it in 4 business days, I live in Seattle.Very Satisfied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as painful as I expected","review":"I was impressed that it actually didn't hurt very much - it was a lot less painful than waxing, and after the first time using it it was even less painful. I feel like it is more surprising than painful at first. The only thing I didn't like is that it takes a while and you have to use it, clean it, use it again. A LOT cheaper than waxing, and I do recommend it, but know you have to dedicate a bit of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"After I read so many product reviews, I decided to get this epilator.

This is my first epilator and I bought it after my sister recommended it. It was painful for first few uses as I am not use to that pain. No pain if yuu just use razor head. After use your skin becomes very smooth and silky. I love it. But make sure you use it the night before or over the weekend as I had some red spots that were gone the next morning. Also, you need to visit the spots more than 2-3 times to get rid of all the hairs but if you use epilaor then you are good for 2-3 weeks. As far I am happy with the product but it is little pricky."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love with an epilator","review":"I only review things when I really, really love or hate them, and this one definitely falls under the 'love' category. I have waxed and epilated for a couple of years now, and the epilator I was using just never seemed to get those tiny hairs. You know they're there, but can't find them until your legs are highlighted in the sun and look like giant, hairy caterpillars. The little light on this thing really spotlights those hairs- and the tweezer heads actually GET THEM! I tried it on the 40 head attachment, on high speed, with the massage roller dealies, and I didn't think it hurt at all. It tickled a little bit at first, though. This is by far the best epilator I have ever used, both for being painless and getting the most hairs/highlighting them. I recommend it to anyone looking to stop shaving or waxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until you get ingrown hairs that scar your legs!","review":"I used this for 6 months and LOVED it! Then I noticed that my legs were getting bumpy. I was exfoliating regularly to try to ward of the ingrown hairs and thought it was working but soon my legs were covered in them. My legs were an unsightly mess for over a year. After not using it for over a year and using every ingrown hair product I could get my hands on my legs look OK. A few more scars to show for it but at least they aren't covered in red bumps anymore. So sad, cause I really did love not having to shave all the time. I know of 2 other people who I told about this when I loved it. They also bought it and had the same problem with the ingrown hairs and had to stop using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife loves it","review":"Ordered this epilator for my wife and she loves it. She says it takes some getting used to of the pain at first but overall it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of effective but painful","review":"If you never use this before, imagine use a tweezer to pull hairs. The difference is this is 100 times faster but 100 times more painful because the motor driven roller has built-in mini tweezers. It is common sense. But again, if you have a hign tolerance to pain, it is cheap and can pull where it goes. I gave it three stars due to the pain to the point I quit using it at all.Also, the tweezers need to make contact with hairs to pull. So this is good for hairs longer than 2 mm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun eplator","review":"I use to have one of the original epilators and it finally died....this new one is so much lighter and the light in it makes it so easy...If I knew how good this was I would have replaced my old one sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing accessories","review":"The product works fine, but it really came without its accessories, like the cooling gloves and the gentle start head, for example. Since she liked it very much, it thought it would be better to say here its flaws instead of its benefits ( the comment would then be much shorter). Well... the cord could be longer, the noise could be lower and it could come with the accessories its suposed to. Aside those bad things, its a GREAT PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ummm, wow","review":"I've used other epilators for my legs and this one is amazing! It really gets the short hairs that others miss. The light lets you see exactly where the hairs are. Very fast, too.

Used it a few times, and then had to stop--the shift from shaving to epilating created a GIGANTIC ingrown hair (!) problem.It's been over a year since I bought the machine, and about 8 months since I stopped using it. I still have healing areas on my legs which are red and angry, and severe scarring--lots of discolored white areas that I'm worried won't return to skin color.I don't know if I have extra sensitive skin or something (would be news to me) but SERIOUSLY consider if the risk is worth it before buying this!

It didn't take very long and not painful at all (except on the armpits the first time but even that was tolerable). I read other reviews on this product at other websites saying that theirs broke early but this product works so well I am thinking I wouldn't mind having a spare or two in my closet for just such an eventuality.My mom had an epilady in the 80's that was a wire spring that rotated. WOW did that thing hurt, it took flesh, drew blood...the works! so I was a little nervous about trying an epilator again. I am glad I did. I just hate that I spent 150 bucks on waxing warmer and all the lotions and potions that go with it. It isn't a total loss though. I use the GIGI products before epilation and it seems to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"midieval torture device","review":"From the beginning, I knew that ripping the hair out of my body would be painful. I expected that. What I didn't expect is that all those hair folicles would also get inflamed and turn into ingrown hairs (even when I followed all the directions). I stopped using this when I was getting a new scar on my legs (from deep ingrown hairs) every time I tried it. Using it on my neck and chin I looked like I had razor burn. I'm not even going to go into bikini line. For now, I'm back to shaving my legs and using Gigi Brazilian Bikini Wax Microwave Kit for my neck and chin.I hoped I could use the shaver for a while, but it dulled quickly and got really back clogged with baby-fine hairs.

Its been 2 weeks since i used it & i still don't have any new growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!!","review":"I have tried many different products in this category, laser removal, waxing (hot & cold), electric shaving and this little wonder I find does a better job than any of them. Each of the different attachments work well for different areas. It's a bit pricey when you think abut the cost of a razor, but it's well worth the investment. I would definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convenient","review":"I quite like this product. I've had it for about a month now and I think the investment was worth it. The first time you use it it is a bit painful, but after it is a breeze. I actually don't allow the hair to grow too long, as they start to show I use the epilator again and it is almost pain free. It is so convenient, the little light is a must because it allows you too see the very tiny hairs even in the back of the legs, so I would highly recommend the epilator that comes with light. Pain wise I think that for women with medium to fine hair this is a great option, but if you have really thick hair I heard that this can be very painful. Hair grows after about 10 days, but that changes depending on the person. Overall I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun is the best","review":"I purchased the Braun to replace an older model Braun. I wouldn't buy any other brand. I've never found it to be too painful but maybe that's just me. The attachments also work well. I would never go back to the blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like it","review":"It scratches my skin, and it is not as fast/powerful as others. I do not recommend it. It took me over 1hr to do both legs!!! When others epilators can do it in 20 or less minutes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I have been using this for a little over a month, and I really like it. I did follow the instructions of a previous reviewer and shaved before using it. For my legs, that was the last time I had to shave. For my armpits, they were more sensitive, so for the first couple of weeks I shaved another 2 or three times. Basically, anytime it really hurt, I shaved before epilating again. That way you kind of work yourself up to it. If you try this and it's just way to painful, I would definitely recommend that method.I haven't tried any other epilators, but so far this has performed perfectly. It's a nice shape and size. Easy to clean. I really like the light. I have also used the razor/trimmer attachment, and like that, as well. If I ever needed to replace this, I would have no problem getting the exact same one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Lots have said how much they love this, and I'm just echoing that. This is my first epilator, and I was expecting it to hurt more, but it's definitely bearable. Yes, some places hurt worse than others (I did try my underarms the other day, and I couldn't do it). The bikini area hurts too, but I can handle it.Mostly, I just think this thing is so neat. The light is great, and I like the option of the different heads and speeds.I wish I would've bought this years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes some getting used to, but it definately works!!","review":"This is a great product, albeit uncomfortable. It is like being tweezed a hundred times over, although the more you do it, the less uncomfortable it is. It does not have the rough skin side effects of shaving and the inconvenience of waxing. I use it most often on my chin and legs. Hell it also has a bonus interchangeble shaver head. I have not been as bold as to try it on my underarms and bikini line yet though. After a couple of uses it has more than paid for itself. And I am glad that I purchased it. I use it a couple of times per month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun - still the best !!","review":"I started using Braun silk-epil 10 years back. And it still works. But that was 220V, which I couldn't use here in the U.S. So I decided to get a new one. Someone recommended me emjoi, so I thought I'd give it a try as I'm getting a rechargeable one with the price of braun silk-epil. Emjoi left my skin with too many ingrown hairs and it didnt even feel smooth. It left me with a really bad impression. I immediately returned the product and got a braun silk-epil. And its still the best in my opinion. About the pain.. any brand will cause the pain when ur hair is plucked. Trust me, there is no way you can have less pain when doing this. Only way to ease your pain is do it as many times as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective!","review":"Highly effective product. I've never had such smooth underarms before! Sure, there'll be pain and maybe bruising (if you don't hold your skin taunt or if you have sensitive skin), but it's so worth it. No noticable regrowth for at least 2 weeks!It actually wasn't that painful except for areas where hair is extremely coarse. But the pain lasts for about the first 4 seconds, and if you keep going it's completely tolerable. And you do have to go over with tweezers sometimes, to remove weird-angled hair or ones that just don't pick up, but those are very rare.Definitely a money saver for waxers. For a little more over the price of a bikini wax, you'll have smooth skin until your device breaks!I definitely will buy again, after this one breaks. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"This product is great. So far, ive only tried it on my legs, and the results were great. Yes, it hurts but not as much as some make it seem. Personally, I would describe it as... medium discomfort. The only drawback so far has been the constant ingrowns, but with some exfoliation and moisture they seem to be going away. Plus you can't beat not having to worry about the unsightly dark hairs coming back after a couple of days. After using the epilator you can stay smooth for weeks!!yay!It's a good product overall, and the light is amaaazing for getting to all the hairs you didn't think you had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun 5270 - The wild hair zapper!","review":"The braun works great on a face full of wild hairs. If your like me the descendant of a werewolf, it'll be your new best friend. It hurts at first and creates little bumps but that resilient human body will soon adjust and it won't hurt or cause bumps anymore, really. Plus, its a Braun, they still make good stuff. It's a great tool and will reduce plucking time by 80%. There's no need to worry with Sunday sessions because one minute with this baby and your done.It's worth every penny!Dana"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Epilator","review":"I previously owned Phillips Satinelle epilator and thought it was very good. It worked for me for years until wear off, and time to get a new one. I also tried Kenwood \\"Emjoi\\" model, and it wasn't taking most of hear out. After some research, and reading reviews, I got this epilator about a month ago and it was the best I've ever tried. It saves a lot of time, and I thought it's not too painful even with other epilators, but with this one no pain at all even under arms. I didn't try the roller attachment, just didn't need to, it's probably only for the first time users. The light feature id great, and the best of all I can do it for probably for 1/3 of the time that it use to take me with my old epilator. If anybody looking for epilator, for the first time, of replace the old one- this model is the one to buy. It worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick epilator but.....","review":"I've been using the same epilator from Braun over 13 years, before this one. I thought change it because I had problems with the power cord of the old one. The new epilator works really fast, comparing with my old one, but it cuts my hair not from the root sometimes, so hair grows faster. The old epilator had a system that you select the hair thickness so it won't tear it up. I will use the new one to see if I can correct this problem using it more frecuently, so hair doesn't grow to much and the epilator don't tear it. But braun epilators are very durable, like I told I had my first one over 13 years, and my second one is this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew ripping out hair by the root could be so much fun?","review":"I love watching the hair fly off my skin and feeling the incredibly smooth after effects. I like watching the hair fly out by the root so much I hardly notice the pain. (well, most of the time anyway). I use the epillator everywhere except my legs and I never feel disappointed. I would highly recommend using it every day though. A couple of days off and you'll be sure to feel it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing (with a caveat...)","review":"Quite frankly, I was a little nervous about this product due to the multitude of \\"it hurt so much!\\" reviews. However, I just moved to a house with a pool and need an affordable hair-removable solution that doesn't take all kinds of time (like shaving) so I gave it a try. I was incredibly impressed. Sure, it pinched, but I did not find it intolerable. I didn't need any pain meds which surprised me. I started with my legs, both calves and thighs, but plan to use it in other areas as well.The only disappointment I had was that my legs were not super-smooth the first time. I don't know if this will improve or not, but as a married mother of two that is not my primary concern anyway. They look hair-free so I can wear a bathing suit or dress without an issue. It does not work really well on the super-fine blond hair on my upper thighs, but again, I didn't always shave there anyway!I will definitely be recommending this product to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great!","review":"I wanted to try an epilator for a lot of reasons:1. Wax works but it takes too long to warm up, and too long to CLEAN up2. I travel a lot and I hate that 3-days-into-the-trip stubble3. I kept shaving off my tan!This thing is great! With a little (very little) practice it keeps your legs/underarm/wherever (and my boyfriends back) smooth for weeks! Each time you use it it lasts longer; after 3 uses I can now go 3 weeks in between. And it hurts less each time too as the hair gets finer and you get used to the sensation. Easy to use, easy to clean and extremely effective. I know what all my girlfriends are getting this year for Christmas..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job well.","review":"This is a great product...I use it as a supplement to waxing, for places that are harder to wax, and also for the little hairs that waxing sometimes misses. The first time I used it was pretty painful, as other reviewers have also said. After a couple times though, it is much more tolerable, less painful, less noticeable. I use it every few days to clean up little hairs that are growing in at different rates, and my legs are nice and smooth now most of the time with little effort!The only thing I would say against it is it is VERY noisy, so if you have housemates they will all know (or wonder) what you are doing. HArd to be private with it.Mostly I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works... but is very painful","review":"This was much more painful that I had expected.

It is definitely worth the money! The light is absolutely necessary and all the attachments make it very versatile. Would definitely buy this again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Very good and very fast. Very painless. Massaging staff really helps and i like its light.Not good for underarms. The speed is too high for such sensitive and lots-of-hair area. Massaging doesn't help in this case, it is not plane area like a leg. So it is painful and hard to do. This is the only point in which my last epilator was performing better.In general, it is much better then the one I had before.It's speed is the point. You don't need to spend hours and hours to complete the process. If you work a lot and have troubles with free time - this should be best choice for you.---An update to add - today (Jan 31, 2013) it has died, its been 4 years and 2 months of work. I consider it a decent amount of time for small electronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this thing. At first I was getting a lot of ingrown hairs, but I started using a luffa in the shower everyday and they are all gone. It does hurt a little but it is well worth it. I only use it on my legs have tried other areas but cannot bear the pain, yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"Over the years, starting with its introduction in the 80's, I have bought several epilators, my first being the Epilady and never have I used them more than once, usually over a very small area. The pain was excruciating. Even up to a few years ago the experience was the same, however, the Braun seems to have solved alot of the problems that its predecessors and competition had.Now mind you I have only done one calf (I was so impressed I had to stop and write this review), but it didn't take long and the pain was minimal. I did find that due to my excessively dry skin that I had some itching and redness but the redness was no more than you would find during a waxing and some quality hand cream took care of the itching.Since I HATE shaving, I can say with certainty that I will be keeping this epilator and using it. I highly recommend this for hair removal. Wonder what it would feel like under the arms, yow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best epil' ever!","review":"This is my 3rd. type of eliplator. Over the years I have owned other styles and brands and the Braun 5270 is by far the best. I'm giving it 4 stars due to it not being cordless and rechargable. Otherwise it is perfect. Compared to my older epilady it is virtually a painfree shave and also shaves faster than my old one and it has a light to guide the way. With the guide attached it is pinch free behind knees. I am extremely pleased with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too painful","review":"I bought this over a year ago and have had to stop using it because it was just too painful. I tried every method to make it less painful and nothing worked. I tried doing small sections and taking breaks, big sections, taking pain meds, rubbing, etc. Nothing worked. I had red spots that covered my legs for days after using. I am going back to regular waxings. They hurt less and the pain and redness goes away in about a day.The light is nice and the electric razor part works well. It would be better if it was battery operated so you didn't have to haul out an extension cord every time you wanted to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Wimps","review":"When it first arrived I plugged it in, turned it on and was absolutely terrified. Thought it would tear me to shreds. I couldn't bear to use it. So I let it sit a few days and then tried again. It is uncomfortable. The pain is comparable to waxing, and so are the results. I LOVE IT. It leaves my skin so smooth and is just as fast as shaving; only it lasts much longer. I handle the pain better each time I use it. It works best when the hair is not very long. The attached light is great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"braun silk-epil","review":"Love this product! At first it felt like little pinpricks on your skin but then you get used to it.

Please dont buy this one.. you will have ingrown hair issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as waxing.","review":"Yes it hurts and Yes it works. I though this would be the solution to all my unwanted hair but I am really disapointed because the reason I bought this is because waxing breaks me out and this did the exact same thing! Every spot I used the epilator has red bumps on it that looks like acne and then it turns into acne! I used this on my face and on my lower back, so its either have unatractive hair or have unatractive acne.. I guess you really should just use on your legs but thats not where I need hair removal :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping for better results","review":"This is the first time I've purchased and used an epilator.

It met all my expectations and exceeded cause actually I was expecting it to be more painfull but it was not.

It works great, you may have to go over some spots more than once but it will eventually pull out all of the hair. The combination of epilator and electric shaver is a great bonus.

But, don't pay the full price for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful but ouch!","review":"The product came just as described and I was SO SO thankful that I had read reviews prior to ordering. I knew that it would hurt and used several of the tips others suggested. YES it does hurt a lot but the hair on my legs didnt grow back (with exception to the ones I missed) for almost 2 weeks. I know some people had trouble with their hairs not picking up but I'm very fair and have medium dark hair and it worked just fine. The arm pits are a little tricky since you need your skin to be pulled tight for it to work and wow thats where it really hurt. I would encourage you to use it at night like suggested as I did get red bumps all over my legs. Exfoliating is also super important, I still have some ingrown hairs in my under arms but in time this will go away.

She could not use it because the power requirements here were different to Europe and so decided to buy one here. The unit looked well made but on using it, did not pluck the hairs on her leg from the root but it was as painful as her European model. She attributes this to the fact that one side of the pincers was made of metal while the other side was plastic unlike her European model which had metal parts to both sides of the pincers. In less than a week, her legs were rough again unlike 3 weeks when she used her European model.

You can go over the same area over and over and over again and it still leaves hair. It doesn't grab well the well-visible hair, let alone the small stuff. I especially hate the fact that you have to repeat an area so many times to get all the hairs in the more sensitive areas, which by the time you are done, are all red and irritated.

Either way, the hair just broke off and left stubble. It also took too long and was slightly painful.I returned it and got a Panasonic ES2207P electric shaver and that ended giving me a shave comparable to using a disposable razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible hair removal experience!","review":"I decided to try this product because I was tired of constantly shaving and didn't want to spend a fortune on waxing. I got thought the pain of using it alright(it's about on par with getting a tattoo), but post epilation I had 2 different types of negative skin reactions. First, despite a rigorous course of exfoliation every hair on my calves became painfully ingrown to a degree I had never experienced.Second,the sensitive area on my upper thigh broke out in an obnoxious rash that has taken a month to heal.This type of negative experience may be due to sensitive skin but I would recommend that anyone whose skin is temperamental steer clear of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"cause ingrown hairs...","review":"don't know if its because of my skin, but it cause lots of ingrown hairs which appear as ugly red bumps everywhere. it's really a pity because expectation was high. though the pain is bearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - Ingrown hairs!!!!!","review":"This epilator removes hair very well and the pain is not horrible like some have stated. It actually feels kinda cool! The problem starts a week or so after hair removal. INGROWN HAIRS like crazy. I exfoliated every day and still had major ingrown hair trouble! My legs look horrible now. Wasted $. Am going back to shaving. Too bad, because this would have been really convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!!","review":"Don't usually write, but if you're on the fence about this it's great.It hurts, but beauty is sometimes pain. I can only equate the pain on your legs by saying that it must be like a tattoo and it does fade after several minutes. The hair doesn't grow in evenly, so by the second time you epilate there is a lot less hair hence less to pull out and less pain & so on and so forth.The bikini area is not something that I'd jump right into. I had a bikini waxing a month previous (first one ever) I would NEVER have been able to just epilate without having that done first.Also did my husband's back (I had waxed it several times before with the green goop that \\"heats\\" with your body heat) It was excruciating for him, but that's why we're having the babies isn't it?This item has already paid for itself several times over but don't waste your money if you're looking for painless....it hurts but the job it does makes it worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!!!","review":"This is a great product. It is painful at first, but with continued use, the pain is gone. It is totally worth the money...I was surprised to find that it actually works. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to remove hair...while the hair removal is not permanent, it has drastically reduced the number of times I have to shave a week, which is very nice. I am very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good device","review":"After not having removed leg hair for well over a decade, I had them professionally waxed. The procedure cost $115 and the result lasted less than a week. So I bought this epilator, and it works well. My legs stay clean for a couple of weeks, and there is not much discomfort (though I have little discomfort when waxing as well). I have not had any problems with having to re-do areas, I keep the epilator perpendicular to the skin and barely touching, as in the directions, and I go slow. The biggest problem for me is that the unit gets quite hot after a while, so I can't get both legs done at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Although the process of epilating is painful, I am going to keep using this product based on the reviews of others. The first time I used the epilator, the feeling was not like anything I experienced before. Now I know what to expect, so it seems that I am tolerating the feeling much better. The first time I used the product my legs weren't smooth like I had thought, so I am wondering if the hair was pulled out or just broken off. Maybe there is a learning curve for me too. Haven't attempted the underarms or bikini area yet, I'm just not that brave, but I hope to get there at some point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epilator is awesome!","review":"I shaved every 2 days and my armpits got darker and darker over the years without me noticing. Now, I'm embarrassed to even raise my arms. I wish I could wax but the money to wax was so expensive and would accumulate over time. My friend recommended me to buy an epilator which she bought hers at a salon for much more. I went to amazon, purchased this epilator and my mom and I tried it together. We were jumping up and down in excitement as we saw the darkness go away and my hair grew back thinner and lighter under my armpits. They were no loner itchy and scratchy and annoying like when I just shaved. You know how men have 5'oclock shadow, well that was my armpit. Thanks to this epilator revolution, I don't have to ever shave in the tub again, but epilate on my bed and then read a book. It hurts like a B*********!!!! But the results outshine the pain. Love yah and good luck purchasing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As painful as the old school Epiladies","review":"I have a lot of hair. Always have. I look for new better ways to get rid of said hair reguarly. A few years ago, I purchased an excellent well-reviewed epilator machine that worked like a charm until it finally died on me. I replaced it with this Braun epilator, and wow. I had not felt that kind of pain since using the original models of the Epilady about 20 years ago. I don't know what it is about it, but every rotation, ever hair grabbed, is too much pain that one should be having with such a machine. Also, the cord is just too short. I don't know how to return it, but wish I could. It just lays there now, collecting dust. I'll be looking for and replacing with the original if I can, with its completely reasonable pain level and option to go cord-less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent epilation!","review":"Braun Silk-épil, especially in its new double system (epilator and shaver), provides a accurate and easy to do epilation. The skin remains soft and smooth for very much longer than usual razor blades, without the unconvenient itchy sensations!!In its practical and elegant pocket, you can also bring it anywhere you need, in your purse or luggage!It is an absolute MUST for every woman! Say good-bye to the old razor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific product","review":"I wish I would have had this years ago!!! I've tried every method of hair removal available, this is far and away the best!Far less painful than waxing, more practical than shaving.Within an hour of first getting this I had done my legs, arms and face. It is very fast and works right into my regular routine.I noticed that it worked best on 1-2 day stubble after shaving.Tip: Use a loofah sponge to reduce ingrown hairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Epilator in the market","review":"This epilator is great, it can catch all hair (small ones included) without any pain.

My hairs are dark and thick. I followed the instructions and went on with usage. The machine does work as I looked at the hairs it was pulling out and could tell they came straight out of the root - However, my hairs are just to thick and deep and I ended up getting really red, irritated skins that lasted for a few days as well as blood coming out of a lot of spots where the hair came from.If your hair is thick like mine I would suggest waxing. I believe it works great on women's thick hair but not guys horse hair like mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pain no gain. That is not the case","review":"It doesn't hurt , actuallly it is quite nice to use ( on legs) but it doesn't do a good job at taking the hair from the root . It cuts many hairs, so those hairs come back as if you have shaven them. I wasn't able to use it for underarms. It just doesn't take anything out. Bikini line , tried once , but I need to get more courage to try again. it takes about 5 strokes to get it right.Nice handle, wouldn't buy the same one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"I found this product disappointing. It works well on my armpits but that's about it. The process is incredibly tedious when it comes to the legs and, since my hair grows at different speeds, my legs are NEVER completely smooth. It is impossible not to miss spots as well. So, if I want somewhat smooth legs, I'm having to pull out the epilator every other day, waste alot of time attempting to find new/missed spots, clean up the epilator, vacuum, just believe me..it's tedious. The ingrown hair problem cannot be overlooked either. I've gone back to shaving my legs b/c it works better and is less annoying. Yep, it sucks to be a girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier then waxing with a much faster clean up!","review":"Unlike shaving, when using the epilator the hair grows back thinner and much slower. It is less messy than waxing and cheaper than laser hair removal. I really love this product. Would have given it five stars but it is pretty time consuming..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth underarms","review":"I got tired of waxing my underarms so I thought I'd try this little machine. It works pretty well. At first it was intensely painful and I considered giving it up. At least with waxing it's all at once, right? If you use it every few days instead of waiting until your underarm hair can be braided, you can barely feel it! I did try it on my legs but I just don't have time for that. I don't have a problem shaving my legs, so no big deal. As for the people who say it ripped their skin out? Well, it certainly felt that way at first, but no skin actually came off.The cons: it's loud, you have to go over the same area several times to get all the hair and it just won't grab some of the finer hairs. Also, be sure to use it the night before you want lovely smooth underarms (or whatever else you use it on) - it's not something to use at the last minute.All in all, way better than waxing. No muss, no fuss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Meant for Blondes","review":"I recieved the epilator and decided to return within the same day. I bought this because I wanted longer lasting smooth skin. I have blonde hair, but I read some reviews saying that it worked on blonde hair, but alas, no. I ran it repeatedly over the same spot, but it didn't lift the hair. The pain wasn't too bad (but maybe that's because it wasn't working?), and I really liked the smart light, but I could never imagine using it on the bikini area. Definite cons - the the noise! and the short cord. It would have been even better if it was a wet/dry type one (and if it worked on blonde/soft hair)"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use epilator","review":"I purchased the Braun Silk-epil a couple of weeks ago. The first time I used it was very painful, but you get used to it and after a couple of times it get less painful.The result is ok. Some of the hair is only cut off instead of removed by the root. I have to use the silk-epil at least once a week to have smooth legs. I tried but can't use the epilator other than for my legs.The usage is super easy and it is a high quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall very pleased, great new way to shave!","review":"I never thought \\"shaving\\" or in this case \\"epilating\\" could ever be done out of the shower. It is great to just whip this out and epilate whenever I want wherever I want (granted you have an outlet to plug it in). It hurts the first time, but after finding the tricks (holding your skin very taut) the pain is easily erased. Now I don't mind it at all and enjoy it quite a bit. You need to exfoliate well, and I am only in the first month using mine, but do it each day or every other in the beginning. It only take a few minutes after the initial epilating. Far better then sudsing up and spending an hour in the shower wasting water! Try it! I bet you'll like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product - painful and occasionally misses a few hairs","review":"Good product. It does exactly what it says. It's a bit loud though, so much so that I can't hear the TV when I try to distract myself from the pain it inflicts. Also, the pain cannot be underestimated but once you get through it (it took me 4 days to complete 2 legs), it does not hurt nearly as bad. I gave 4 stars because of the noise and it does not always catch all the hairs on the first, second, third pass so I have to watch closely for stray hairs it misses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Silk Epil--- Very happy with it!","review":"I bought this thing a few days ago and I really like it. I had another one with a foreign plug and since moving to the US I decided to get another and I am very happy I chose this. Works perfectly, light is good, clean up is not a problem. I used to wax my legs (and still do on occasion) and axing myself is tricky when you do the back of the leg, I usually get wax on th floor... yet another reason why I like this so much.To those customers who complained about pain... it pulls your hair out at the root and it has no pain killers in it, OF COURSE IT HURTS A BIT! This one hurts more than my last one and I don't mind at all because I don't have to go over the same area 5 times. I'm very happy with this and I would buy it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for my legs","review":"This has been the best thing I've found. I've been using wax for the longest time, and this does the same thing, without having to do wax (danger of getting burned). I definately recommend this for people that prefer wax over razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to the hype","review":"Despite the fact that the reviews said you could hardly feel anything, i felt EVERYTHING! I do not get regular waxing done, so maybe that's a prerequisite. After a couple of really solid attempts and a lot of screaming i gave it up. If you're like me and you don't like pain this might not be a product for you. Plus it left ugly red bumps on my legs that did not go away after a couple of days. I did use the shaver portion for about 9 months, but then that broke and now it's completely useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"great epilator","review":"I've tried waxing, sugaring, and products that promised slow hair growth over the years to reduce and/or get rid of unwanted leg hair. I first got the $19.95 'touch up' epilator from Target to see if I could handle the epilator pain. Seeing as it wasn't too bad I decided to try this one and I absolutely love it. For minimum pain, first let your hair grow for a few days and then try this epilator with the roller attachment. It has a way of vibrating against your skin so you don't feel the hair removal as much. Then use the attachment that is bare on one side to get a closer shave. After, take an epsom salt bath to reduce the ingrown hair possibility. I used the epilator for a couple of days in a row, then waited a few days and did it again. Doing it a few times within a week was the way to get most of the hairs since they grow at different rates. I have to honestly say I haven't worked up to doing underarms yet- don't know if I could handle that pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"takes a long time","review":"works well, but I have to go over my skin many times. but a well-designed and made product and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am very satisfied with the product","review":"I bought this Braun epilator from Amazon, I am very satisfied with it and it is realy my best choice. I recomend it, it realy does a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not perfect.","review":"This epilator is pretty good at what it does, but the quality is not as good as it could be. So far it works fine, but I wonder how long it will last due to the mostly plastic construction. I found it rather painful the 1st application and had to take lots of breaks. I then tried waxing another part of my body, and recommend that for the 1st time if you haven't tried it before. Then the Braun epilator works great to maintain and is not very painful either. For the money I think it is well worth it if it holds up to time. Then again with the cost of a wax job, for maintenance it is great. Plus there is the advantage that it will grab hairs much shorter than needed to do a good wax job, so you can stay smoother more of the time. I would recommend this to others, if you are fairly pain tolerant. Otherwise do the wax 1st, and use it to maintain.Shipping was fast, and arrived in good shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Cool","review":"I decided to purchase this product based on the reviews that I read on Amazon. Well, they led me astray. Enormously! This product created ingrown hairs on every inch of my body. PLUS, this product hurts so badly!!!! I am very tolerant to pain (I ran, training for a marathon, with a broken foot for over a week and didn't even know it was broken, but knew my foot hurt). Anyway, this product is absolutely impossible. I am going to stick to Nair and my razor thank you very much!I used this product on my legs and arms with the same, very painful, results from both locations. I was really hoping that I would be able to use this on my underarms. NEVER EVER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My hair breaks","review":"Based on opinions from others, I purchased this Braun Silk epilator 5270. The pain is tolerable but the problem is, is like when I tried getting waxed, my hair breaks instead of being pulled out. I can't say it's the fault of the product but I won't be using it anymore. If my hair didn't break, I think it would be a fine product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ingrown hairs!","review":"I started using this product on my legs at the beginning of last summer, and at first I loved it. I have very dark and fast growing leg hair and just hours after I would shave my legs they would start to feel prickly. After using the epilator my legs finally felt smooth and I was really excited. I used it about every other day until winter when I decided that it was a little to time consuming and I went back to shaving.Well, now I really regret ever using the epilator, my legs are covered in red spots where the hair has become ingrown and some spots are infected. It looks awful, almost like I have chicken pox all over my calves. I'm glad that this epilator is working for some people but if there was even a chance that this would happen to someone else I definitely could not recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch","review":"Ouch!

Now I don't have to spend all that money on waxing. It is better and the results lasts longer than shaving. I highly recommend it. Of course it misses an occasional very short hair or two but they are not obvious and can be caught if you hover over that spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Best thing since sliced bread!","review":"I LOVE this thing..I wish I would have bought it long ago!! It only hurt the first time or so, and now it doesn't hurt at all. I guess everyone's pain tolerance is different. I use it on my legs, bikini area, and underarms. When the hair grows back it is so fine..not like the old razor stubble you get from shaving. I've recommended this epilator to everyone in my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well","review":"Based on all the positive reviews, I decided to get the Silk-epil to see if it was any better than my Emjoy Optima and it's not. It was a big disappointment. Whether using it on the epilator setting or on the shaving setting, it misses the majority of my hairs which makes it a waste of time and a waste of money. And I'm not new to epilating, so I know how to use one and what to expect via results.It could be that I got a defective product but some how I don't think so. My advice is to skip this one and go for the Emjoy Optima."},{"rating":"1","title":"It costs less than a nono","review":"I think this product does an okay job. One thing I dont like is that I still have red marks on my legs where the hair was torn out and that was a week ago. Maybe it will just take some time for my skin to get used to it. I sure wish I could afford a nono (an at home laser hair removal system) though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good design","review":"The attachments fall of as you are using it and you spend more time picking up the parts from the floor than using it.

The thing is that you do really have to be able to deal with some PAIN. This is a product that litterally pulls out the hair, don't be decived, that's what it does and that's what it feels like. Using it on your legs gets to be pretty natural though, dosen't hurt so bad after a few uses you kinda get over it. But on the armpits it kills everytime.

This causes very little if any discomfort on my legs. I would recommend using the ice pack before and after using it on the underarms, but again, discomfort was minimal and I had no irritation afterwards. I've never waxed, so this was a big switch from shaving. I think it's a great product, and I graduated to the advance tweezer head almost immediately. The light is a big help at getting those hard to see hairs. It's a little noisy, but well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rating this epilator very good but not excellent though","review":"braun epilator is a very good one.

The improvements over older models are terrific. The Smart Light really helps you see the \\"strays\\" and the rollers that are meant to make use more comfortable really do help.

Two years later, still no luck. I got it to use on my legs and I was so disappointed with the results. I followed the instructions exactly, but it still only broke the hairs instead of removing it completely from the root (I can tell because I can't see the rounded root of the hair it ripped out). I wasn't left with smooth results at all, even after doing it several days in a row. It really is painful, but you're ripping hair out, so that should be expected and has nothing to do with my rating. I just couldn't get this to work for me. It's a shame because it was extremely expensive.By the way, if anybody has any tips in case I'm somehow doing this wrong, please respond to this review. Again, this was really expensive and I hate to waste money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended if you don't want to use chemicals on your skin!","review":"Writing this review after using it for more than two years now.PROS:1) Epilator setting can remove even the shortest hair on my body.2) The mini light is really helpful when I'm in a not-so-well-lit place, or on some camping trip where there is no light.3) Epilating does hurt a lit bit initially, but I think the roller design is really helpful in reducing the pain. The good news is that in two years, it has stopped hurting almost completely.CONS:1) The epilator does not remove very very thin hair. It's hard for it to grasp those.2) The razor is not as good as I expected it to be. It's painless, but sometimes there are really, really small hair 'stuble' still left, especially if you have thick and long hair growth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cautious!!!","review":"I always used a braun epilator. They are great but this time Amazon disappointed me as I received a faulty piece. I had ordered one for my travel purposes and had carried it new. I didnt get a chance to open it while I was here. It never worked. The plates were not aligned well (probably) as it kept getting stuck and didnt pluck hair really well. I stopped using it immediately. I didnt have a chance to return it as I was travelling. I am sure Amazon will take better care in shipping products. Please be careful with what you receive and check your order as soon as it arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for guys...","review":"First off, I'm a guy who happens to be extremely hairy. I end up spending 70 dollars a month to get my chest and back waxed in order to keep the wife happy and from calling me 'Wolf Man'.My wife ordered this product thinking it would be a 'fun' (by fun I mean getting the chance to torture me), and inexpensive way to remove my excess body hair.I did all of the proper prep. I took a hot shower, and ensured the hair on my chest and back was trimmed using a Wahl trimmer. The first pass of this thing on my back was unbearable pain. The second pass on my chest wasn't any better, and I put a stop to it after that. Of course my wife is rolling on the floor in laughter at my pain and excessive use of profanity.I ended up returning this product, and will just stick with waxing once a month.I have a whole new respect for women, and what they go through in order to stay beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for the bikini area - DON'T BUY","review":"When I started looking for a product to remove hair from the bikini area, I went between this and the Philips bikini hair removal system. I went for this (initially) because it got slightly better reviews. Huge mistake! HUGE. I lost hair and skin using this on the bikini area and it was horribly painful. I am used to the pain of waxing so I consider myself to have a high threshold. If you want this for the legs, I think it would be wonderful. But for the bikini area, go for the Philips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me but Obviously For Others...","review":"I have thin blond hairs on my legs. I tried this and it hurt quite a lot and it didn't remove very well at all.(I had to run it over the same area on my leg several times and even then it was not completely smooth). On top of that, i got the most horrid red bumps on the areas i used this product on, which was thankfully remedied with severe globs of jergens lotion. I think this works best on people with thicker hair maybe? because then the device can really grab the hairs. Anyway, you will be pleased to know that I returned it and got a refund (at least i was). Hope this review was helpful; Happy hair removing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"Good speed, the light is not very convenient and unfortunately can't be turned off, not completely painfree, but close, a bit loud, but most epilators are, definitely improved performance compared to the previous Braun systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"epilator","review":"I bought this braun 5270 and I thought I made a good choice but I was wrong.It doaesn't do its job very good leaving short hair behind.

I strongly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best epilator I ever used!","review":"As a long time epilady user, this product rules! It is faster, more efficient, less painful than my previous epiladies. It even costs less han I ever paid. I recommend this product to anyone who likes this method of hair removal. I only use it on my legs so far - maybe someday I'll try it on other areas. The only thing I would like better is if it was cordless as I like to epilady outdoors & it would be more convenient not to be near a power source. Overall it is a great product that I will use forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item!","review":"For many years I had an old epilady, the kind with the coil. It finally broke down and I got the Braun 5270 Silk-epil and now wonder why I waited so long to replace my old epilady. The silk-epil works great! The first time I used it on my legs they felt a little stubby but subsequent use leaves my legs smooth and it really seems like it delays regrowth: I find I don't have to use it very frequently and when I do, it takes no time to remove the regrown hairs. I also used it on my underarms: the first time was extremely painful but the hair that regrows is softer and removal is virtually painless. The light is very helpful too. I highly recommend this product. It sure beats daily shaving!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"I have been using an epilator for years and was pleasantly surprised with this one. It works great and is faster than my old one. I am very happy with this product though I think the light is unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"My legs look like a horror movie.","review":"Well, I used the product for several weeks very happily. After that, I began getting really disgusting ingrown hairs all over my legs. I mean... ALL over.That was March 2010. It is now February 2011. I still can't wear skirts or shorts because of how horrible my legs look. They're still covered in ingrown hairs that can't be cured by any amount of exfoliating, lathering in lotion (3-5 times per day). I've seen a dermatologist and he's given me medicated lotion. No avail. I just want my legs back!! This is a horrible, horrible device, DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"This is an excellent product! I used to work in a salon, so I had originally intended to get a waxing setup, but after reading reviews I decided to give it a try. And I am very glad I did. It works every bit as well as wax without the mess! My underarms have never been smoother!In terms of pain, it is definitely a different sensation than waxing, but I don't think it was worse. I found that keeping the skin taught helped. When doing my lady area, holding my breath helped too. However, if you can't stand the pain of waxing, you probably won't be able to stand this.I am very glad I bought this. It is quick, clean and portable, all the things that waxing is not. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I can't imagine a better machine - except maybe a cordless version. Otherwise it's excellent! The daylight light is genius, and it's powerful. God knows why I put up with waxing for so long.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be misled, this is painful to use on the lower legs and torture elsewhere","review":"I bought this because I was tired of hair-removers that didn't work and shaving.I tried it knowing that it was going to be uncomfortable. Uncomfortable is not theword to describe how it feels. It is PAINFUL and may leave little dots of blood behind.It also misses some of the hair even though you go over the same area a lot!I would not recommend this product to anyone but those with reptilian-like skin.It is PAINFUL and DANGEROUS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MONSTROUS issues with ingrown hairs - BEWARE!","review":"I purchased this product in May 2009, as an alternative to waxing. I was using it every six weeks or so, and by the end of the year, my legs had turned into this monstrous web of hairs growing under a thin layer of skin. The ingrown hairs cause bumps, sometimes become infected and as a result, my legs are all scarred with dark spots everywhere. If I need to wear a skirt, I need to apply leg makeup even under pantyhose.I have olive skin with medium dark hairs, and I don't know if my type of skin has a tendency for ingrown hairs. If you are going to buy this product, test first... or you will risk paying $60 on the epilator plus $100 on creams and lotions, a couple thousand on permanent hair removal (which does not entirely solve the problem) and a few other hundred on skin treatments to minimize the scars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouchy but seems to work","review":"I have never epilated or waxed before and primarily bought this for my arms. I was surprised at how much it hurt. There hasn't been enough time for regrowth so I don't know if I will experience the ingrown hair issues that other reviewers have. After the initial shock at the pain, I tried it on my legs, where it didn't hurt nearly as much for some reason. I'm not sure if the vibrating rollers are any good for dulling the pain but the light is definitely useful - especially on the back of your legs. After my legs, I decided to go crazy and try my underarms. YEEEOOOOWWWW! That's soooo never happening again! But I do recommend it for arms and legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, great product","review":"The epilator itself is VERY loud when turned on. This is the reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.When used, the pain level is very high! I have waxed my legs before, and do not find it painful, but I did find this very painful. However, in areas with less hair, the epilator does not hurt, rather it feels uncomfortable. That being said, the results ARE WORTH IT!!If you can suffer through the pain, your legs will be hair free and smooth!! An advantage this epilator has over waxing, for example, is that you pay the price once, and are left with the convenient hair removal for as long as the epilator will work, thus saving money over time. Also, as another advantage, you can epilate at your convenience, in your home, or away on trips, rather than having to go to a salon.Overall, I am VERY satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epilator - Braun Silk Epil (5270)","review":"Braun 5270 Silk-épil X'elle Body System EpilatorThis product is one of the best and hassle free items. This is the first time I have used an epilator as I used to wax earlier, but loved it from day one.With the right way of using it, it is not painful. There is a tingling sensation, but then looking at the soft skin its worth the effort. Make sure to apply moisturizer after epilation.The product has a very stylish packing, which even my husband loved and it also has a small bag to put in all the contents and nice to carry too. The product was delivered bang on-time and absolute value for money.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's iffy","review":"I heard really great reviews for this, but to be honest, I wasn't completely satisfied. I was ready for the pain, that wasn't really a big deal. But if you are thinking about buying this product because of the little rollers; DON'T-they're useless and scratch your skin. Also, it felt like it was cutting the hair rather than actually pulling it all the way out, because I have had to use this everyday for nearly two weeks and my legs are still not completely smooth. The shaver is useless as well, even if I went four-five days without shaving, I'd still be smoother than I would with that thing. I'm really not impressed-I expected a LOT more out of this than what I got. The reviews were what persuaded me into buying it, but I was very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"i'm not a review writer, but wanted to say that this epilator is awful. i've been epilating for years and years... it is much better than shaving, hair grows back much slower and much thinner over time. HOWEVER, this machine is awful. it definitely gets rid of the hairs, but mostly be breaking them at the base, and not by pulling them out from the root as it should. i might as well be shaving since the hair grows back right away. definitely would not waste your money with this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best one of these out there","review":"Progress continues to be made in the field of hair-yanking. This device has more little wheels to grab your hair and rip it out - yes, it's as fun as it sounds - but this one hurts less than its predecessors, and that light feature was a stroke of genius.I've used several brands of these things and so far this is the best one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will never shave again.","review":"This is the best thing ever! I highly recommend it. It doesn't hurt at all. I would wax the first time before you use it. Then a few days later use the epilator. I have used it all over with great results. There were a few hairs on my lip I continually tweezed, and I'm sure I was breaking them off not getting the root. Hence growing back quickly. Now the Silk epilator gets the root and they are slower to grow back and much thinner.You do have to be careful about stretching the skin smooth in some areas. Under arms, behind knees, and lip area, but with practice you can do it. This epilator is so much better than the old ones. The light was a stroke of genius. Now when I epilate I only get a few hairs. It is well worth the money.Please give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm smoooooth!","review":"This is a great product. I used it on my legs and arms last night and it was fantastic. I does take a while to finish four limbs (two and a half hours) I'm new to the process so I hope that eventually it'll be much faster. I would suggest doing it inside the tub (with no water) that way the hair doesn't get all over the floor. Lets see how long it I'll be fuzz free. I noticed that if I prepared my skin with the beginer head, I could tolerate the advanced head for finishing and getting all the stray leftovers. I wish you happy Epilating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only hurts the first time. It's SOOOO worth it.","review":"I'll add to the chorus of praise for this product. It's just fantastic, a great solution to an age old problem. To be fair, it did hurt -- and more than a little -- the first time I used it. However, now I can just pick up a few strays every few days and it hurts pretty much not at all. And the hair does grow back finer, yahoo! This is probably my product of the year. It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Say good-bye to your razor!","review":"This product is wonderful!

Sadly, Timothy A. Westmoreland's \\"Good as Any\\" falls firmly and permanently in the latter camp. Each of Westmoreland's characters is more broken and pathetic than the last, and each character arc rings shallow and trite. Many of the characters are dying, diseased, or fragile; while this would typically elicit sympathy, I couldn't wait for each one of Westmoreland's cardboard cliches to meet painful ends. It's a good sign when you're rooting against the characters, right? To summarize each of these stories: boring, unsympathetic, one-dimensional character does something idiotic and suffers rightfully for it.There's a great deal of strange and beautiful short fiction in the world, but this is definitely not it.

Each individual story is less endearing than the last, and Westmoreland's characters are written as broad archetypes.For some reason, Amazon keeps seeing fit to remove the negative reviews of this text (without notifying the author of said reviews), but fans of fiction- especially short stories- should seek out other, better examples of the genre.

With prose both eloquent and spare and dialogue that rings utterly true, Timothy Westmoreland's stories call up characters struggling to reach beyond physical and spiritual limitations. These stories, beautiful despite (and because) of their dark, unadorned vision of life, shimmer with poignancy and clarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Imagery!","review":"Westmoreland's stories have a way of drawing the reader into the lives of the characters. His use of imagery creates a setting so vivid that I felt like part of the story. Rarely has a story brought out that feeling of compassion that I felt while reading about the characters' plight in each of these gut wrenching plots. While the plots focus on tragic situations, Westmoreland has a way of bringing just enough humor to make the doom bearable. I like stories that allow me to explore a variety of emotions. I look forward to more from this promising writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabethan England lives!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Anne Kelleher's latest novel. I read many historical romances and honestly feel that Ms. Kelleher has a better grasp of the history and language of the historical periods about which she writes than the other \\"power house\\" authors of historical romance. This new novel is no exception, as she takes the reader seamlessly from 1999 to 1587. The characters are real and believable and she does a superb job of sketching 16th century England for the reader. You can honestly see the countryside and hear (and smell!) London, Dover, Calais, etc. If you enjoy this book, I highly recommend her previous work \\"My Once and Future Love\\" and \\"The Ghost and Katie Coyle\\". She ahs also written a sci-fi/fantasy series that begin with \\"Daught of Prophecy\\". Enjoy! I'm already anticipating her next novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a Romance?","review":"I did something I've never done before I didn't finish the book.

I miss licorice - the candy is generally made with wheat starch, and that's verboten on my gluten-free diet. I find this tea is a wonderful substitute. It is fragrant, warming and has that thick, deep taste you expect from good licorice. The tea is high enough quality that I can get two 12 oz cups out of one bag.I should caveat that, while the tea itself is caffeine free, I've found licorice has a mild stimulatory effect. If you have a sensitivity to caffeine it may bother you, in which case I'd suggest one of Yogi's rooibus teas, which have a deep and robust flavor but are not stimulating."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE:","review":"I HATE THIS TEA, I LOVE LICORICE, BUT I HATE THIS TEA, IT IS TERRIBLE, THE SMELL AND THE TASTE.

It is perfect for those times in the day when you just need a quiet break, or if it is time to settle in with a good book.

I guess it works well enough but I didn't want the ongoing expense of replaceable filters.

However, the purifier has some major downsides. The biggest downside is the fact that it dries out the air. I can tolerate it but everyone else who comes into my living space has a difficult time. It is also very loud almost as loud as an air conditioner. So keep that in mind, I kind of wish I spent more money and went with the more trustworthy brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started chattering after a few months","review":"Seemed to clean the air pretty well and certainly liked the small-footprint tower design. But after a few months it now chatters loudly and is no longer useable. I didn't see anything obvious but sounds like something has broken internally.

I've good luck with Honeywell before but wouldn't recommend this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"The description is out of date - DO NOT BUY based on the description","review":"I intentionally purchased this filter because I do not want to have to buy replacement filters.

I bought this for the kitchen to replace the Honeywell HHT-011 (which worked very well but broke due to a fall) because we can smell cigarette smoke from first floor tenants coming up from under the kitchen sink cabinet. When I walk into the kitchen the whole room smells like smoke, whereas the previous Honeywell we had when pointed at the cabinet would suck the smell up immediately and we could never smell it. I really wanted this to work, it is attractive and sleek looking as far as air filters go, but I really think after two months of having it that all it does is use electricity, I don't actually think it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would've been nice, but...","review":"This would have been the perfect air purifier for me, but unfortunately, it's not the product described. I guess I should've checked the Honeywell official website, because they have advertised correctly; HEPA-type filters (Not true HEPA) and they will need to be replaced every 3 mo's. It looks like you can't get a true HEPA without having to replace them; they will have to be ifD. Extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for a Permanent HEPA filter, DO NOT BUY!!","review":"As other people have pointed out this product description is WRONG!

I smoke at various times throughout the evening and this is why I bought it - to clean/clear the air. I leave it running 24/7 with the exception of a weekly cleaning of the rear filter.It *does* however have a decent air output, decent enough that it doubles as a fan-type supplement in my room.Overall, 90% pleased... but the 10% is my over-estimation of it's capabilities.As far as the product goes - you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as stated","review":"It says \\"Permanent\\" filter, right in the description.

Think I will shop elsewhere from now on. Bad Business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description is totally wrong!!","review":"Amazon obviously never even looked at this box before writing the description.

I have no idea what HEPA-like means, but obviously it's a step down from what this listing says it is!

Enjoy Rick fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Is Life","review":"What Rick tries to show in this album is his lifelong devotion to the way of rock just as Japanese martial art. To Rick, rock is not just the way to earn a living. It is a way of life. So his penchant to Daoism naturally resulted. He tried to express the essence of Daoism through his rock in 1985 manner.Dance This World Away starts from Chinatown-like atmosphere. Celebrate Youth according to Rick is the modern interpretation of Daoism. State of the Heart starts from voice transformation showing the change of state from young to old borrowing daoism teachings. Walking On The Edge starts from gloomy dark atmosphere showing his inner struggle more vividly. But this album on the whole is positive, optimistic and never carried away into spiritual world. Overall, even if you are not aware of Chinese philosophy or things it is enjoyable ...and you will come across a new finding every time you play this CD.

It secretes an anticlotting substance. The vampire then seals his lips around a minimal wound and draws the blood freely.This book tells of five different parts of Dr. Weyland's existence. All are in present day. The first has Dr. Weyland on a campus. The second has him caged like an animal. The third is an encounter with a therapist.The forth takes place during an opera.

The cover comes all the way down over the metal charging tabs on the back of the controller, so that's an issue right there. But even if you cut a little hole in the back to expose the tabs (yeah, of course I did it!) the overall skin is still too thick to allow the controller to hit the charging connectors. So to charge with these covers on you need to pull the skin back up over the controller (skin-tight) and then back down to start playing again.

More like impossible!","review":"I have been practicing yoga primarily from in-home dvd's for about 3 years. I moved from pretty darn inflexible to being able to do most of the standard poses pretty well. One of my favorites is Rodney Yee's Power Yoga for the reasonably fast pace and mix of some challenging poses. Based on some of the other reviews I guessed this might be just a bit more challenging. About half-way through this dvd I got completely discouraged. Most of the later poses are basically impossible for anyone but a serious practitioner or very flexible. While he may give you 'options' this basically means sitting there and doing the same thing over and over again, without any flow.Maybe if you are already into 'ashtanga' and are looking for an in-home dvd to accompany your pracitice it would be fine. Otherwise, I'd stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality video - problems with DVD","review":"Instruction is great for experienced yogi - but I returned the DVD due to very bad quality video as wwell as issues with DVD function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality DVD","review":"This is the worst quality DVD I have ever purchased.

The quality of the picture could be a little crisper but fine for its purpose. The opening sequence showing David Swenson in various advanced poses is amazing! Don't be discouraged by this demo. His introduction is very thorough and reassuring that the goal of yoga is the effort, focus and breath rather than being able to achieve a particular pose. There are variations to every pose (which I utilize) to fit everyone's ability. If you think yoga is just meditation and not physically challenging, David will change your mind! I am not vigilant with this practice but always feel much better afterward no matter how much or little I get through the series. A great adjunct to any workout regimen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"I tried several Totes brand of overshoes and all of them were stiff and extremely hard to slide on.

The MAC interface doesn't bother me much (yes, I am a PC fan and I have used a MAC before) because all the HTML codes work the same way for a PC browser.

It is only 36 minutes long. Sound quality and mix are not very good.About half of this album is just noise, with the band members just clanking on stuff or making eerie sounds. Much of it sounds like one of those Halloween albums of spooky sounds.The other half is some interesting coherent music, with some interesting trade offs between organ, guitar and drums. The music is really harsh, churning and metallic. But, the whole thing sounds like a rip-off of earlier Pink Floyd music, specifcially Saucer Full of Secrets, Atom Heart Mother and Ummagumma. (Atom Heart Mother and this album would be released at about the same time, but Pink Floyd had been playing variations on Atom Heart Mother for a couple of years).This album is nothing like later Tangerine Dream album, where they would soften their sound and move towards more electonica and ambient."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged case looks bad","review":"the case that covers this box set was bent in some parts and scuffedi can't display it with my other cd box sets in my book casei would not have bought it if i new there were creases/scuffs on the box"},{"rating":"2","title":"NO ONE CAN TOUCH THIS GUY!","review":"elvis changed music forever in every sense and these great performances prove that. people always seem to forget how great a singer elvis really was. he had an incredible range and an incredible range in styles, whether it was rock, country or gospel. you get all that here. i just wish they would have included more 70's songs like \\"Hurt\\",\\"Moody Blue\\", and his last hit on the radio the day he died,\\"Way Down\\". even with these songs not included, it's still a GREAT set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Loaded!\\"","review":"The best collection to be released to date.

I had it tracking straight and re-sawing even cuts with just a minimum of tuning.The only complaint about the saw is the amount of effort required to change blades.To really adjust the lower bearings, the table is in the way.

I have kept the handle in what the instructions refer to as the A position which is also the setting that you carry the seat in. After speaking to a police officer recently trained and certified in car seat installation/safety, he said the handle absolutely needs to be as far back as possible and provided a very strong arguement why. The manual that came with the seat is very ambiguous and does not specifically say this at all. I called Graco and suggested that this statement be added to the book for safety concerns and she argued that the seat was \\"tested\\" with the handle being up and it was fine.The officer I spoke to was adament that an infant could be in GRAVE danger if the handle is up in a crash. I think I am going to believe the police officer vs. the manufacturer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"car seat handles","review":"For the mom who wrote about the handles. You're absolutely right. We purchased an Evenflo seat before our daughter was born and the instructions specifically said that the handle is not to be up while driving. It's supposed to lay flat along the top of the seat (as if you were rocking them). The police officer was right in telling you that and although we're looking at purchasing a Graco stroller for our second child I'm dissapointed that their rep. said otherwise.

The cd comes with the Album mix (3:39) that has burned up the radio for months now. it is just an incredible song lyrically and vocally as well. The main reason I bought this cd was the Thunderpuss mix of \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\". BIG DRAMA from this mix !This mix is one of their best work in awhile and it shows. From the loopy keys to the slowdown near the middle to complete force of energy you get from this mix is astounding. At 6:52 it is one of the shorter mixes they have done and that is good- not too much vocal looping here .Then you get the album version (4:28)of \\"Ciega,Sordomunda\\" which is good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stars in Life:Coaching kids to sucess","review":"This is a wonderful book.

If any of these strands don't work it would trivialize the whole affair but fortunately they do work. I was held in the film's grip from first frame to last. Ken Wahl and Cheryl Ladd, best known for their work on television, aquit themselves well. A bonus is the presence of R.

(One plot description mentions that the sorority girls order their \\"pledges\\" to make skimpy costumes.) But this \\"movie\\" contains neither sorority house nor scandal. No dialogue either. The picture is instead merely the amateurish taping of an \\"emcee\\" on a stage (no audience is ever shown) with several girls who take turns removing their tops and jiggling a bit. What did it cost to make this picture? Well, if the girls were lucky and were hired for $50 each (and actually got paid), the emcee worked for free, the camera man got a case of beer, and they slipped the janitor $20 to let them in the auditorium for a couple of hours . . . they overspent.The only scandal is that this production was ever marketed.

The variety and depth of stories told shows his care for the veterans involved. Interwoven amongst the personal histories is a fairly conventional history of the the war in the Pacific. As other reviewers note there are a number of historical errors, some more grating than others. A general reader will get a good overview of the history of war against the Japanese seen through the lens of the experiences of these two vessels and their crews. A more knowledgeable reader may be distracted. But it is a story worth reading, despite it's faults. One should read this book with a focus of hearing the sea stories and the drama of the tale. This is the story you would hear as told by a veteran, errors and all. For an accurate history or the Pacific war, there are other, better (and dryer) sources. But few more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky Lady Lose with Facts","review":"I guess it's too much to expect editors of history books to know much about history, but it's the least we can expect from an author.The little things I can forgive, but when Jackson tells us that \\"Admiral King . . . reorganized the Pacific Fleet . . . into three main fleets\\" and \\"The Fifth Fleet, under the command of Spruance, represented the rest of the Navy's presence in the Pacific\\" it's just too much. [The Seventh Fleet, under Kinkaid, supported MacArthur, while Halsey and Spruance took turns planning/fighting with the same ships, changing only the fleet number as they switched command.]A page later, Jackson tells us \\"Marine pilots in P-38 Lightning fighters flew from Guadalcanal to intercept\\" [Yamamoto].

Probably, but I'll never get that far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loaded deck shoots blanks","review":"Considering the sensational cast (Eli Wallach, Terrence Hill, Bud Spencer, Kevin McCarthy and Brock Peters), the Euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot, Ace High is a major disappointment. The plot is uninvolving and incoherent, the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style, the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever. The editing looks like it was performed with a butcher's knife. After the first ten minutes, I knew I'd made a mistake buying it.

Sure it gives you a general map for the prominent rivers around the state and tells you where the boat ramps are, but I have several other resources for that information.As for specific, detailed, useful information for each river -- there is very little. What there is, is generic. Yes I know there is a winter steelhead run in this river. It goes from December to March? Really? How illuminating (not)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Solid Survey Book","review":"This was an excellent overall survey of the material, and a great reference work that can be return to again and again, to harden up on the facts, and to get titles of other books and journal articles on each of the specific subject areas. It can at times get a little confusing, with the avalanche of place names and the vagueness with which he describes many of the artefacts, but you still come out knowing a heck of alot more than you did before going in. Also, he has no particular axe to grind--no big theories that can be so annoying in this field. Overall, an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bronze Age","review":"Dickinson has put together a wonderful and thorough text.

This tea is fine, but I was disappointed by the slight misinformation. I'm not sure why they simply call this tea \\"Ginger\\" at least on the front of the package. I am now paying much more attention to the actual ingredients of Yogi teas because this has 4 other ingredients of which 3 are in greater amount in this one. I just wanted plain ginger tea and this has licorice, lemongrass, peppermint & black pepper. Black pepper & licorice are very strong flavors especially if you aren't aware they are steeping in your cup. It's a fine tea, yet holds a misleading title. That's all. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"This tea tastes fantastic. The subtle taste of black pepper and licorice adds a great touch.Be aware that this tea has ingredients other than just ginger, including licorice, peppermint, and black pepper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lovely Pepper Tea","review":"If you are looking for a product that can bring you the raw intense power of black pepper then this is the tea for you!! While it was steeping I was actually thinking this stuff smells sweet and delicious... then I tasted it. It was packed with the pepper I was looking for! So again if you like ginger stay away from this tea but if you want a vile brew that tastes of nothing but ethnic pepper then by all means buy as much as you can drink!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful tea for stomach problems!","review":"I have been drinking this tea for over a year now, mostly after meals to help my stomach settle down.

Thank you Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ginger tea is delicious, light and good anytime of the day!","review":"I love this ginger tea and decided to buy it online from Amazon because it is MUCH cheaper than getting it in the store. It is good anytime of the day and it has a slight kick to it (from the ginger). I usually drink it plain but sometimes add lemon and honey when I am sick to make a great pick me up. Best of all it is caffeine free. It is offered at a great price and I will be returning here to get more when I run out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for morning sickness!","review":"I'm in my 8th week of pregnancy, and I'm currently experiencing the dreaded morning sickness (which is really all day sickness). I have read that ginger helps with nausea, so I've ordered crystallized ginger, and this ginger tea. I can't stand the crystallized ginger, but the tea has been very helpful. Early afternoon, when my nausea is at its peak I make a cup of this, and my sickness is all but gone. I don't like the smell, but I hate the smell of everything nowadays. It's pretty spicy and it warms my mouth, throat and chest, and when it hits my stomach it neutralizes the nausea. Love it. It's awesome. Not sure if I'll drink it once my sickness is over, I don't like the taste, but my taste buds are off because of the pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious & Spicy","review":"When I first got this tea, I was surprised by it's taste. I wasn't sure how I felt about it, and it certainly takes getting used to. It is really strong and has the spiciness of ginger with a peppery flavor too. After a few cups of it, I was hooked. Now I crave it and it does seem to help my digestion after I've eaten a heavy meal. It's also been good when I have nausea. Someone wrote that this is especially good in the winter, and I do agree. It warms your body quite a bit while you drink it and afterwards. Overall I love this tea, and it has become one of my favorites. It's not for those looking for a light tasting, delicate tea but if you like spicier things or ginger you will love this. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GOOD!!!!","review":"I know what Ginger tastes like and this is NOT Ginger. The only things I found pleasant about this tea is that it came in a beautiful box and the individual packs were nicely packaged, I don't care whether this is organic or not, the flavor of Ginger is absolutely absent. If you appreciate the aroma and strong flavor of good cup of Ginger tea then try \\"Prince of Peace\\" Honey Ginger Crystals. The aroma lights up the room, the flavor is strong and authentic and since they are crystals, there are no tea bags to deal with and the result is a good clean cup of genuine Ginger tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy strong flavor!!!","review":"While I do like this product I must say it is NOT for the person looking for something that is a delicate ginger flavor. You MIGHT get that if you just run hot water over the bag and not let it actually steep in the mug. I went by the directions that say steep 5 to 10 minutes and boy I wish I had not done so! It was so strong that instead of fighting migraine like ginger is supposed to, it made it worse for a little while. I suggest if you want something light in ginger flavor that you go for sweet ginger peach instead of this product. If you want STRONG knock you off your chair ginger flavor that feels like a kick in the face, get this one. EDIT NOTE: If you are a MIGRAINE patient, do NOT get this product unless you know that none of the ingredients are a trigger for you. I ended up with such a bad migraine after drinking this product I ended up giving mine away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"From Christmas to New Year's this book has stories for all of them.

I am glad that he was not trying to duplicate his previous CD.This album speaks to the current times that we live in. It's social, it's political and most of all it's the GOSPEL!! Kirk is developing spiritually and artistically and that shows on this CD. And he didn't have to big himself up and he will win many awards because he is not seeking them. Kirk's main priority is that GOD IS PLEASED and that lives are changed. I am proud to be a part of his generation and I feel he truly represents GENERATION-X Christian people like no other gospel artist.He speaks for me/for us.Kirk-stay real!! Don't ever change when so many are so phony!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This man is so blessed","review":"While I don't think this cd is better then the Rebirth it is a wonderful cd.

Hero delivers a heroic performance by Kirk's new group. After listening through most of the tracks I reviewed the making of the CD and the \`Looking For You' video at kirkfranklin.us. That said, I will have to say this is his best CD to date.I have noticed one reviewer that commented on the lack of worship music in contrast with the Rebirth of Kirk Franklin. Think about it, his first CD was in the footsteps of Rebirth and now we have a CD that mirrors Whatcha Lookin' For. He was reborn.A truly great production with beautiful melodies, grooves and samplings from the greats including Stevie Wonder, Earth, Wind & Fire and Patrice Rushen to mention a few. If you enjoy Kirk Franklin's young and fresh approach, I highly recommend this CD. If you liked the Nu Nation Project, Whatcha Lookin' For and God's Property, do yourself a favor and pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful!","review":"If you enjoyed \\"Rebirth\\" then you will enjoy this new release from Kirk Franklin!

I am one who is struggling with some feelings about my own father. I was unaware that I had these issues until recently and this song is a wonder.

It is a masterpiece from start to finish. Kirk even includes his children as one son beat boxes for his father and the other one delivers spoken word on the outro. Kirk is sentimental and tremendously personal on \\"Let It Go\\", and he is also really inspirational on \\"Imagine Me\\" (My favorite song on the album). Then artists such as the marvelous Stevie Wonder, J Moss, Yolanda Adams, Tye Tribbitt, and Dorinda Clark-Cole grace this album with their presence.

I was very disappointed to find only three songs worth my listening effort. Looking at other reviews I couldn't help wondering if we were all listening to the same album. Apart from \\"Brokenhearted\\", which of these songs come close in content to \\"My Life, My Love, My All\\" or \\"Brighter Day\\"? These songs lack depth. They are even worst than the first album, \\"Why We Sing\\". I think that right now there is a serious void for well-written songs that connect with the soul and usher you into the very presence of God. We seem to be getting more hype than substance. Artists seem to be working more with the clock than the Holy Spirit. I am praying for Kirk."},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss New Orleans","review":"This was a good video to tell you the history of New Orleans.

I was deeply engrossed in the details of their land and their life. The Novel is set in Smland, Sweden, but I kept envisioning it in the area around Bergsjö, Sweden.

I spent two weeks in that region of Sweden 18 months ago. I've been on those roads and seen those hills and forests. It is a beautiful place in the world and I can see why it was so hard to leave there for the unknown future of the US. They most likely left from Soderhamn, Sweden; the same port that my farmormor (my father's mother's mother) left from in 1891 to come to Seattle, Washington, the American Stockholm.

The book is at times very grim, but also shows some strong optimism regarding condition improvement.I would recommend this book to everybody with a Swedish background, but also anybody whose ancestors immigrated to America during the 19th century, and more generally anybody interested in the subject and looking for a great read. You'll get so attached to the Nilsson family you won't be able to stop reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep Coming Back to it","review":"The Emigrants is an unadorned story of why a handful of characters emigrated from Sweden to the U.S. during the middle part of the 19th century. It's a good reminder of the high cost of emigration at a time when a laborer would have to save five years of income to afford a boat ticket, when a voyage across the Atlantic took two or three months and could cost you your life, and when moving to another continent meant never seeing friends and family ever again.I have read this book four times over the last thirty years. It is the story of my ancestors, but it is also the story of characters who continue to live with me almost as though they were family.

I seldom read these authors [except Grisham] but if everyone else is reading them I figured there had to be something there. So I selected a Catherine Coulter novel and settled in.What I found was a plot that moved along but trite dialog and unimaginative characters. Dane is an FBI agent whose priest twin brother is murdered during a confession. Dane teams up with a supposed street girl named Nick. The cop dialog is simple and the technical details fairly accurate.Very predictable. It appears that this is a formula book. One that will be printed again with different character names, a twist in the plot and a different setting and reprinted under a different title. It will probably sell another half a million copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I started reading Catherine Coulter with her Savich books. I find the writing in this book to be of extremely low caliber. It does not flow at all and seems as though she gave it to someone else to write. It does not seem to be her style at all. The descriptions, words, story line all seem to be fake and lacking.I waited a long time for this book and was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's hard to go wrong with this series.","review":"Catherine Coulter writes a complicated and diverse plot with good action and a new romance in every story.

This story line could have been very effective, but I felt it feel far short. You have trained professionals from the FBI and a woman with a Ph.D engaging in dialogue that sounds like it was written by a teenager and inconsistencies in details that I found very annoying. If the target audience of this book was the under-21 crowd, I suppose it would be passable. I don't believe I will try this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than I thought ...","review":"There were inconsistencies in the plot that I found really annoying, the characters had no real rapport -- I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Coulter's standards","review":"Having read many of Coulter's books, I would not recommend this one as a must read. The plot was actually pretty well devised. However, the dialogue was incredibly unrealistic and the characters were not at all well developed. The protagonists had no depth and that, in turn, had a negative effect on the plot. I expect more from Catherine Coulter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Appeal","review":"I have read many and many of Catherine Coulter's books and have enjoyed them immensely. I have to say that this book was not what I had expected of her. It had a good plot with very few twists and a decent ending. The characters were very undeveloped and dialouge was not good. By the middle of the book I already knew who was behind both of the killings. It didn't explain enough about the crime scene or about the findings.The romance and the mystery was left out. The characters didn't communicate that well and definetly no romance.It is a decent book to read when nothing else is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first \\"Coulter\\" novel was ahit","review":"This is my first Coulter book and I was impressed with the story and how each character played out.

I kept coming up with excuses to put it down. It was slow moving not at all what one expects from this talented author. I may try reading the next new book that she writes but I won't spend the money on a hardbound book. I'll wait for the paperback and see if she can redeem herself.

Coulter since I read \\"The Cove\\", but her last two books including this one have been so disappointing. It's almost like she's changed her writing style. I say, 'if it aint broke don't fix it'. This book was so inconsistent, moving quickly one moment, then slowing to a crawl the next.There is no romance really to speak of, just a slight attraction with an abrupt sex scene thrown in, that seemed forced & gratuitous.If you haven't read her earlier books, skip this one, and get \\"The Cove\\" & \\"The Maze\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine Coulter's \\"Eleventh Hour\\": Duty or Deadline?","review":"Speaking as a fan of Catherine Coulter's previous detective novels, I am disappointed in this product. I wish I didn't feel compelled to refer to it as such, but the \\"Eleventh Hour\\" seems indeed to be a book that was written for commerce, and at the last moment to appease an editor. As with Iris Johanson's recent books, we have another writer with a fine imagination who has left her work poorly crafted. It might have been an acceptable first draft, but in truth, I feel even that is being kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitterly Disappointed","review":"I am an avid fan of ALL Catherine Coulter's books but found to my utter dismay this one to be a total waste of my time. From the first, I found the dialog stilted, the story line choppy and disjointed, as if the author was writing a screen play for a movie. This apparently seems to be her goal as indicated by her dedication of the book. The book showed none of her usual depth of character detail or gripping storyline. My request to the author is when writing the book, focus on the book, not how it would appear on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my last by this author","review":"Coulter has always been a real hit and miss author for me, but I threw this book down in disgust and I'll never buy another of hers. I know she can write--I've read evidence of that. So there's no excuse but laziness to put out this...tripe. The characters are flat, the dialogue made me laugh out loud--it was so incredibly lame. She gives romantic suspense a bad bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"There are inconsistencies in the plot, the characters are cardboard cut outs and the dialogue does not ring true constantly pulling the reader from the story.

However, I plan to still examine her historicals for possible purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me my money back!","review":"I have read all of Catherine Coulter's books in the last seven years, and spent a good chunk of money on them. Not only was this one chock full of bad dialogue, gruesome crimes and ridiculous cliches, but it didn't even deliver the cheesy thrills and romance I was expecting!To top it all off, Coulter (perhaps related to Ann?) goes off on several vicious political tangents that really alienated me as a reader. Hey Ms. Coulter, your loyal fans give you hard-earned money for some entertainment, not your own views on how immoral public defenders are (thanks so much) or what you think of the impeachment scandal!Either Ms. Coulter has lost her touch, or she needs to hire a new ghost-writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it - it was that bad.","review":"I'm one of those people that have to finish a book once I've started, and I have to say that this was so bad, I just couldn't complete it. Between the poorly developed characters that speak on a first grade level,the lack of a solid plot (well, I guess we could call it a plot), and the author using this work to speak her own political views, I thought it would never end. I just had to give up and toss it aside. Please don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"I LOVE Catherine Coulter, but this book left me cold. The \\"mystery\\" was very predictible and the main characters wooden. I was especially put off by the dialogue; it just did not seem to fit the context or the characters.

This, sadly, was not one of her better efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uriah's review","review":"I really liked the book Eleventh Hour,it was fantastic! I am glad that this book was made. So far I love this book. I think the author did an awsome job at writing this book. I think this is a very sad story but very exciting also. This book has a tendency to keep your eye's glued to your surroundings. It also has a tendency to want you to keep reading it. I think this book should be highly reccomended.

I have to say I love this book. The storyline was very well-written having Dane Carver's brother killed who happens to be a priest and trying to find killer with the help of Nicola was awesome. The plot was suspenseful full of twists and turns. and I believe you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely HORRIBLE!!!!","review":"The dialogue in this amateurish attempt at a crime thriller is laughable. The characters are flat, the plot predictable, and the dialogue is perfectly tedious. Ms. Coulter's expertise is in historical romance, not in this genre. I would like to ask for my money back on this (audio edition) because it was so horrible. If you want to roll your eyes a lot, check it out from the library. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be the end of this series...","review":"I have always been an avid Coulter reader, but I don't think so anymore. At least not her FBI books. I loved The Cove and The Maze. The rest of the books have gotten worse with each one. Eleventh Hour seems to have been written by a high school student. The charecters are so wooden, who cares about them? The dialouge at times is so silly and inappropriate, it's downright embarassing. Yes, this will be my last one of this series even if it's not Catherine's. I'm so glad I got this from the library, I would've been upset if I paid money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It got me the \\"A\\" I wanted!!","review":"The actual book is so hard to read and make sense of.

People who have lost their identity and are in search of their roots will find this book enlightening.

The writing is clear and engaging and the history and the science are well presented in a logical chronological order. The love of the author for his subject stands out on every page; and his enthusiasm is contagious - one feels like getting a telescope (if one doesn't already have one) and start exploring the heavens.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like science history, don't overlook this book","review":"There have been a lot of history of science books over the last few years - Dava Sobel in particular is very popular. If you like books by her or Jared Diamond or Amir Aczel, you'll love this volume. A smooth read, but with plenty of meat. The theme of the book is also rather more important than that of Sobel's Longitude; the program for the search for parallax was laid out in Galileo's Starry Messenger, and drove astronomical progress for centuries, and is still an important area of research, while remaining mostly unkown to the public. The only scientific theme which lasted longer, or generated more incidental progress, was the search for a proof of Fermat's theorem.I don't think you can grasp the history of science without being exposed to the material in this book. Give a copy to the budding bookish teenager in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emlightening and entertaining","review":"I caught the astronomy bug and found this aspect of research extremely interesting.

Their staff is also very helpful if you call or e-mail a question. It's my opinion that Dr. Teitelbaum may be an even better psychologist that he is a doctor. The only drawback that I see is that Dr. Teitelbaum's solutions seem to be quite expensive. The average person with a family using Dr. Teitelbaum's protocol would have to work pretty long hours to pay for the treatments and of course, the average reader doesn't have the capacity to do that or they wouldn't be drawn to the book in the first place.

Every type of cookie you would want is in this book(chip cookies to bar cookies to brownies to nut and fruit cookies). I found the introduction the most helpful - how to make the best cookies each time - and I have not made a bad batch since! There is a complete decorating section in the back, filled with techniques (color brushing to icing). Its a great book for kids too, there are cookies for every taste bud and difficulty level. It is filled with full-page, full-color pictures of mouth-watering cookies! Buy this book, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful cookies, but a bit pretentious","review":"So far I've only tried 2 recipes in this book - the lemon jumbles and the cranberry-cherry ribbons. They both turned out very good, if not quite as elegant looking as those in the pictures, and I got many compliments from the people I shared them with. I didn't have any problems following the recipes and they actually turned out to be easier to make than I originally anticipated.[...] I did feel she was being a bit haughty at points and I didn't really appreciate that. I am neither Martha Stewart nor a professional baker, and I'm sure the majority of Mrs. Baggett's readers don't fall in to these catagories either.But don't let her tone intimidate you. I'm very glad I bought this cookie book and I can't wait to try my next batch - the chocolate cranberry drop cookies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"There are some very tempting recipes in this book. Users should beware, though: The author uses the dip-and-sweep method of measuring flour, not the spoon-and-level method that most cookbooks and cooking magazines use.

I tried countless recipes, only to be disappointed with the results. I just about gave up on Black and Whites, when I purchased Nancy Baggett's All-American Cookie Book.I looked over the recipe, and decided to give it one more shot, and was I ever happy with the results. They were absolutely perfect. The cookie was cake like and moist, yet firm enough to withstand the heavy fondant. The fondant, was actually a true fondant, made with corn syrup, which all of the other recipes I tried were not, resulting in a delicious, and shiney icing.To those other reviewers who did not like the Black and White cookies, I say, give it another chance. I have made this recipe many times, and they always come out fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cookbook!","review":"Not another cookie cookbook... that's what I thought -- until Fine Cooking rated this book as a must-have.

As the guitarist for the Sex Pistols, Steve Jones penned the memorable riffs to such unforgettable punk classics as \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\", \\"God Save the Queen\\", and \\"Pretty Vacant\\". This solo effort is no exception.Originally released in America in 1989, it features 12 tracks of pure power. \\"Freedom Fighter\\" is a hot spot, as is \\"We're not Saints\\", co-written with Nikki Sixx. Nikki isn't the only artist who helped out as Axl Rose and Ian Atsbury of the Cult sing on the new version of \\"I Did U No Wrong\\". The album ends on a good note, with his cover of \\"Suffragette City\\", which I even dig more than Bowie's original.Even if you aren't a Pistols fan, I highly recommend this album. If you like AC/DC, GNR The Cult, or Hanoi Rocks, this little known gem is the record for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its like Dream Theater, but Less Good","review":"Theres a funny story that goes with this. My friend said he downloaded Octavarium and it sucked. Since Octavarium is great I went to find out what had happened. Turns out he downloaded this album. The guitar player does a good Petrucci, but hes not Petrucci. The keyboard is cheesey and doesn't come close to Jordan Rudess. And overall the songs are a lot less progressive than DT and don't have the virtuosity element. There are some good guitar solos but thats about everything technical. I'd give it a 2.5. LaBrie does a great job on this albums vocals so if your a fan of his singing by all means buy it. If your looking for more Dream Theater, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's lost! Show him the way!","review":"This is by far the worst thing James LaBrie released in his career, and it hurts me more to know that this is his solo debut. Only some sort of medium songs saves the thing, but the rest is pure garbage. I recommend to you that, instead of this bad album, get something like Mullmuzzler, by far the best James has released as a side project, or even Ayreon - The Human Equation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Dream Theater For Sure","review":"Hell its better than DT! Its a lot heavier and more modern sounding. James Labrie is an awesome vocalist and has an amazing range. The production, as everyone has said, is really clear and just about perfect. The lyrics, along with DT, are always perfect. I really didnt think James could make such as heavy album. No, its not Metallica heavy, but its still better than almost all the junk out there now. Its actually very smart unlike those other bands. Great album. Maybe the best album Ive heard in '05 yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for Dream Theater Fans","review":"This man can sing!!! It's a nice change of musical styles from LaBrie's Dream Theater gig, but still, his vocal prowess shines through on all the cuts. Well worth the listen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Schoolers: Proceed with caution on this one.","review":"Well, I guess I'll have to be the party pooper here. As much as I wanted to like this disc, I just can't. Sounds like James Labrie is singing for Incubus or Disturbed. I don't care for the techno samples and record scratches and all of the nu-metal hints that are here. I suppose I compare everything these guys are involved with to Images and Words and Falling Into Infinity. If you ever wondered what Dream Theater would sound like if they were influenced by Linkin Park, here is your opportunity. Sorry folks, but that's just the honest truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The is the album Dream Theater should have made!","review":"Instead of the insipid Octavarium, this is the albumn Dream Theater should have made. I'm astounded at the level of musicianmanship and songwriting that's on display here - in DT, Labrie may have to play second fiddle to Petrucci/Portnoy but here, he demonstrates that he's just as good a musician than they. All the songs are listenable and there's a good mix of heavy, hard-hitting rock, slower pieces and some jazzy numbers as well. Together with the latest Shadow Gallery (Room v), this is the CD I've been playing over and again for the past month."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're looking for Dream Theatre, look elsewhere","review":"Wow, this is heavy! On first listen, it almost seems too heavy for James La Brie's voice but after a second listen, nothing could be farther from the truth. With little to no effort, James showcases his unbelievable talent and ungodly range as a vocalist and once again proves he is the quintessential voice in hard rock today. This is definitely not Dream Theatre. With little keyboard and no sign of John Pettruchi's virtuoso fret work, this is just a straight forward metal record. It's not totally devoid of \\"Dream Theatreesqueedness\\". The guitar player was loaned axes from the great one himself (JP) for this record and John's signature tuning is previlent throughout. If you like James for his voice, he puts on a clinic. He showcases his diversity and ability, which is why vocalist do solo records. It wouldn't be worth it to record a Dream Theatre record with other musicians. Don't dig too deep into this one, it's not supposed to be DT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple beauty","review":"When I opened the box and saw the mobile I thought: Wow, that's a lot of money for a simple cutout! But it is simply beautiful. We hang it in the nursery over the crib. The elephants are actually larger than I thought (each is about 7.4\\" wide and 6\\" tall) so we centered it over the crib. Our baby boy is not born yet (I am due in 2 days) I am sure he will be able to enjoy it for a long time, as it is pretty high and there won't be a danger of him pulling on it. I love just sitting in the glider watching it. I have the fan on and the elephants are really dancing!I do have to say that the blue in the picture is quite a bit lighter and brighter (at least on my monitor) compared to the real thing, which is more of a dark, almost navy blue.

Lots of info about other IBD patients and what they can and can't eat. All of his comments make senseand I especially like the info about vitamin supplements. Neither my doctors nor my pharmacists have ever told me I needvitamin supplements because the meds I take to stay in remission leach certain vitamins from my body. Makes perfect sense so why didn't my gastro doctor ever tell me this? On the other hand, the diet he recommends is pretty strict and will be hardto stick to for most people, especially those of us who are in remission. It's a little hard to read because it's pretty dry but if you're as interested as I am in decreasing your meds and getting on a diet that makes sense, you'll breeze through it.This book was \\"used\\" but arrived in perfect condition. A real buy and one I will keep handy for a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read dozens of IBD Books - this is by far the best!","review":"After my son was diagnosed with IBD, I consulted with physicians, dieticians, and read dozens of books, but was still confused about meeting his new, complex dietary needs with such a limited list of foods that seemed to be allowed. The New Eating Right for a Bad Gut explains specifics of what can be eaten and how best to prepare it, as well as what needs to be avoided. This is a MUST read for anyone with IBD or IBS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Advice, realistic, very informative","review":"I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease when I was 12 years old. I went through the sulfa drugs, the prednisone, the sick-days. Figuring out the right foods was some trial-and-error. This book reduces the learning curve for eating habits for IBD. I learned things the hard way and just avioded what hurt, this book tells you WHY certain foods do things. It also tells you what foods can help reduce flare-ups and the runs. From my own 12 years of living with Crohn's this is the best resource I have found yet that keeps it simple and realistic. If you have had IBD for years you'll probably still learn something. If you were recently diagnosed, first I'd like to say I'm sorry, but next I'd add that taking care of yourself physically and mentally is KEY. Diet can play a suprisingly big role in both. Good luck, and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author not a sufferer=No Clue","review":"The Author of this book has never suffered from IBD and does not have a clue what diet to follow. His diet guidelines are not based on ANY research or anything of any significance. This was the first book I read when I was diagnosed, and it is awful. Waste of time, and waste of money.

It's poorly written and completely ignores events in season 7. The whole purpose of this book seems to extoll the wonders of B/A4eva.

In First Date, Buffy admitted to Willow that she was IN love WITH Spike. Series creator Joss Whedon confirms during his Chosen commentary that Buffy did love Spike. This book contradicts the evidence by stating several times that Buffy did not love Spike.Including a picture of the Buffy/Angel tongueless kiss is a dubious choice over Buffy/Spike's flaming hands, rather akin to choosing a pic of Buffy trying to kiss Riley in As You Were over the Becoming kiss. Judging from his commentary, Whedon considers Buffy/Spike's flaming hands to be the key moment but it is ignored in this book.In general, the author does not seem aware of Whedon's take on the finale, including Whedon saying that Buffy/Angel left their relationship at the graveyard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author Reaches Too High","review":"This is the third book done by Paul Ruditis. Isn't nearly as engaging as the first two. The book does, in fact, cover season seven, despite what some reviwers have been saying.

I would have much prefered it ifHolder and Golden had collaborated again to write the third book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly the Worst of the Series","review":"Simply put, the first two \\"Watcher's Guide\\" were fun and in-depth, this third one--not so much. The first Guides seem to add a lot of additional information even for the devoted BtVS fan. The third guide read like newspaper clippings and/or national magazine glib articles written by some one who wrote about the phenomena and not the creative essence of \\"Buffy\\" the show. And I loved Tara and her relationship with Willow, but for some reason, nothing new or substantial about their bond is added into the third guide. REALLY DISAPPOINTING. Why was this one so lack luster?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to own, most disappointing volume.","review":"After the first two Watcher's Guides were must-own volumes, I assumed that the author(s) and the publishers were looking to finish their BtVS guides with a bang.Not really the case.At best this book limps along, the main author's clear bias to certain relationships incredibly evident.It lacks the things that made the first two volumes great -- the special features, if you will. There's no character guides, no quote sections, no extensive interviews with the cast and crew. Yes, it has critical(?) essays. But most of the time the writers come off as either self-important or childish.Yes, I own this volume, but were the first volume this disappointing I wouldn't have purchased subsequent books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"I strongly recommend that you buy Keith Topping's unofficial guide instead of this. \\"Slayer: The Last Days of Sunnydale\\" is much more accurate because Mr. Topping bases his opinions on interviews from Joss Whedon and other writers of the show.\\"The Watcher's Guide\\" is just the opinion of the author and is completely inconsistent with what Joss Whedon has stated in multiple interviews.The sloppiness of this book is shocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the Slayer when this book was made?","review":"I had looked forward to the third installment of the series Watcher's Guides for quite sometime and when it came out I ordered it right away...BIG MISTAKE!Quite on the contrary to the first 2 Watcher's Guide Volumes, this book has NO CHARACTER GUIDE or Bio Guide, my 2 favorite parts! The \\"Restless\\" episode teleplay is interesting but, i would have given that up in a second for the character giude.The Episode Guide is done well but I expect a well done episode guide, that's why i'm buying this book. I could easily live without the essays wich are basically there to take up room, and speaking of room, the Watcher's Guide Volume 2 (containing two seasons) is thicker than The Watcher's Guide Volume 3 (containing THREE SEASONS! ~what's up with that?)A big let-down for all Buffy Fans and the end of the series. I just hope that the new Angel Casefiles will be better, which is sadly also going to be done by Paul Ruditis who I am ashamed of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done","review":"The first hint that this was not a well conceived book is that it's shorter than the Watcher's Guides 1 and 2, which each deal with only two seasons. Considering this current books is suppose to cover the last three years of the show, which contained some of the most controversial and dark plotlines, you'd expect a much thicker book.The essays are lackluster, the episode commentary sparse and the picture selection disappointing.This manual might be called the \\"official\\" guide but there is no input from Joss or the other writers.I'd recommend Keith Toppings new book about the series.

We are systematically receiving average profits, which keep us in the market.

It is suprisingly weak on psychological matters, unless you buy into the 12-step-program formula. Worse, the technical analysis seems suspect and much of the material is now out of date (this is no timeless classic like Market Wizards) ... he is certainly an intelligent man -- and this book is far from the worst out there; but there are much, much better books available (see Tharp or Schwager for starters).

The downside of this book is the cost. If you are not serious about trading for a living then buy one of the ra ra trading books for $15. If on the other hand you are thinking about telling your boss he won't be seeing you at the next Christmas party, then buy this book.Trading for people who don't know is one of the hardest things you will ever do. You compete against people who are faster, smarter and richer than you.

No get-rich-quick hype here, no promise of easy money, just plenty of good, solid tools one can use to vastly improve your odds of survival, and ultimately, success. How I wish I had read it sooner.

This really is the worst. The positive reviews here make me seriously question the legitimacy of amazon book reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Losers than Winners","review":"There is much useful information in this book. While Investor's Business Daily suggests you be careful of your entry point, this book has you making trades that could turn out to be risky. For example, buying on an MACD crossover, even though the stock is well below is 50 day moving average. You really need to be careful. If you place tight stop loss orders, maybe 2 percent below your entry, you could rack up a lot of small losses before you hit a really profitable trade. 50 trades (about one per week) losing $200 each amounts to a $10,000 loss.

Most of them end up broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Guy is a Psychiatrist","review":"Alexander Elder is first and foremost a psychiatrist, and it shows when he explains his insights into individual and mass psychology in the first two chapters of the book.These two chapters are the real gold in the book; i have not read a more succinct and hard-hitting explanation of the behavior of individuals and crowds, and these two chapters are the ones you want to read.The rest of the book is devoted to the basics of technical analysis. There is a lot of stuff out there on technical analysis so the stuff in Elder's book is likely to be somewhat outdated.Nevertheless, read this book for the part on the psychology. This is fundamental and basic for any investor or trader, and is crucial to your success in the markets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for beginners","review":"Elders book is a good introduction to technical analysis and the setting up of a trading system for beginners.After reading the novice trader should depart from the book and start to explore on his/her own.Elder touts his own system (which via backtesting does not do well at all) and his view on investor psychology is basically Freudian - which is very crude and decontextualized.Read for fun - not enlightenment.

One reason I can think of, maybe it is a good book for absolute beginners who has no idea about trading what so ever.But if you want to learn more about trading, ie. the skill to use, the way to manage your money. You will be very disappointed. Throughout the years, I read a lot of trading books which offer way more than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaches the importance of psychology in trading","review":"Although this book is a little outdated, I really enjoyed it. I learned several things mostly related to the psychology of trading. Psychology cannot be underestimated. If you've wondered why the market goes up and down on silly news stories and such (for example one company with bad earnings sends the market down but the next day it's back up again) then this book is for you.

When reading this book, you get the opinion, that Mr. Elder isn't a trader himself and doesn't really know, what he is talking about. This book is useless for traders, but it shows, that someone, who isn't able to trade for a living can still make a living writing books about it. It is well known, that vast amounts of money are made day after day by very few professionals because of books like this which promote an illusion. Anybody who is able to trade for a living doesn't need this book.

This guns only pro is that the water it shoots is cold, andyou can hardle consider that a pro. You can fill up any other gun with chilly water and shoot it too. The downsides to this gun are many. First of all the range, while most soakers reach over 35 feet, this one doesn't even make 30. Also the power is lack luster. The nozzle on this gun is tiny!

The live recording at Montreux should be the whole show rather than an edit. So much obvious improvement could have been built in with little effort, just good planning. A great opportunity squandered. Pity, cuz Lee is a pretty good player, and he's alive. Most of the pretty good guitarists are not with us at this time.

Lee, as usual, surrounds himself with some very talented artists here, and is more than willing to share the spotlight, and indeed shine it on some fine upcoming artists. This is a very enjoyable collection of songs and styles that he has explored over the years, re-explored now in collaboration with a variety of gifted older and newer artists in an interactive environment, and excellently recorded.

This is mostly just a long list of whiny complaints about the author's hard-luck in his efforts to trade with the Indians. He made three attemmpts and lost his shirt big-time each time.There's some occasional nice material about frontier travel and interactions with the Indians, but the author's bitter, self-absorbed attitude always intrudes and spoils it. Charles Larpenteur's narrative and Chardon's journal shared this miserable attitude. After all, these guys weren't out there for their health, selflessly bringing civilized enlightenment to the poor savages. It was a rough and tumble life and they took a lot of hard knocks, and some of them didn't take it with much good grace.You're better off reading Ross Cox (but beware for the Narrative Press edition) or Alexander MacKenzie's journal, or just about anything besides this bad-smelling item."},{"rating":"1","title":"one side doesn't work","review":"One of the ear buds doesn't work unless you pull the thing that plugs into the port out a little bit but if you touch it at all, it stops working again.

I figured theirs were just defective or something and i bought it anyway, but no. Mine don't work either. Plus, the wire is really really long for one ear bud and really really short for the other. It makes it extra difficult to listen to music on top of on side only working when the jack is exactly in the right position, the earbud with the short side is always getting pulled out of my ear cause all of the extra wire constantly gets caught on things.Don't waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff.

My kids' betta-and-terta tanks use this pretty much exclusively. Definitely improved the color of my bettas as well as the CPDs and the tetras: color improved very noticeably right after adding this in to the rotation. All fish love it and are thriving. However, it's a bit big for my CPDs to handle unless it's been chomped and spit out a few times.

The remote sensor, on the other hand, which is hidden in a medium size shrub to keep it out of the sun, reports the temp about 5-8 degrees too high consistently. The remote wired sensor probe, which I am using to monitor pool water temps, is also high by between 7-10 degrees.The number of degrees that the remote sensor and it's probe are off changes at different times of the day. The water temp in the pool stays roughly constant during the day, but the remote probe is just wrong most of the time. None of this seems related to being outside as it was also off, although not as much, when I was testing inside the house before moving it for use around the pool.I am wishing that I never bought this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"a piece of junk","review":"This is a piece of 'merde'!

I look forward to the sequel to this novel with great anticipation, as I could not put this book down for a minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a fun book to read and look up paintings for","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and looked up several paintings as I went along. At the end of the book she mentions the artist of the Robin Goodfellow painting as being Thomas Gainsborough. So I looked him up and found a gorgeous painting of a man that fit the description in the book which was fun since the cover model on the book really didn't do the character justice.

I read this in about one sitting, cause I just couldn't put it down. By the end it was so worth it, the book just makes you go \\"awww, that was nice\\". Now, this book was great because of the characters, the plot, the writing, and lots of other stuff. The book was definately romance too, not just sex, though there was that. Robin and Kate like each other, and after being friends for a while, discover they love each other's personalities, as well as the physical parts. I loved how Robin treated Kate as an equal... and Kate was just awesome. I loved how after the initial sex Kate teases and initiates the next round, and Robin was like, that was so sweet, I've never had a woman do that for me. That was the basis of the relationship. They were so good together. Basically this was a feel good book. Robin kept trying to get Kate to trust him and trust herself and know that she was beautiful the way she was. And he loved her for being her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"PRINCE OF CHARMING delivers what it promises. A charming prince and a fabulous fantasy.

I just got the leash in the mail today and tried it out; what a difference this will make for me. I have been walking the dogs with two separate retractable leashes that would continuously get tangled up especially if while walking we encountered another dog. This leash is adjustable so that I can lengthen the leash for one dog or shorten it. I was a little concerned about purchasing the leash due to the reviews mentioning that the coupler was too heavy for toy breeds but I don't find the leash to be heavy for my 10 lb. toy poodle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Pullers!","review":"I own two huskies, who walk fairly well on a leash. I thought this item would make it alot easier for me to walk the two together, but I was wrong. The clip that does the adjustment of the lenght isn't strong enough. It was constantly allowing slippage and the lenght that I had set between the two dogs was becoming larger. I would not recommend this item for dogs over 50 pounds that like to have a tight lead. My dogs don't drag me down the street, but they aren't the greatest walkers either, and this just plain didn't work for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Hardware","review":"Bought this leash for our two labs, one seven year old and one 6 month old.

With two dogs who pull, this makes walking so much easier. The dogs learn early on not to pull, since it pulls the other dog's weight. Walks are so much more enjoyable! It also has a great feature where you can adjust the lengths for shorter and taller dogs walking together, which sometimes I have. The handle is also super soft and comfortable, unlike any leash I have gotten at the pet store. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone with multiple dogs they walk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double dog leash","review":"I have two small puppies and one larger dog. Three leashes was a little much with all the tangling so I bought the double leash for the pups. I was not very happy with it. It still tangles just as if I had separate leashes. The only good thing is I don't have to hold three handles. I have purchased a better one I found in a catalog that actually spins at the handle to prevent tangling. I'm looking forward to receiving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it. BUT....","review":"Got this to be able to walk our 65 lb lab/boxer mix and our currently 40 lb Golden Retriever puppy. I love it! BUT - the locking mechanism does NOT stay locked and the dogs are constantly taking turns pulling ahead of each other. Instead of staying locked, it pops open and enables either side of the leash to be pulled ahead depending on which dog pulls ahead. Which isn't really a problem for us; the dogs seem to enjoy being able to do that and I don't mind. So I let them do their thing and no longer try making it stay locked. I tried countless times to make it stay locked just because I know it should be working that way. Gave up and we're now happy being able to do our thing. The length is perfect, the thickness and quality of everything besides the locking mechanism is outstanding. I am glad I bought this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea","review":"Came before date quoted. Sturdy and exactly as described. Definitely well made.

That said, I've had root canals that were more fun than this. The game tries to combine genres and, as usual with that attempt, does nothing well. The game looks promising at the character creation screen, but goes rapidly downhill thereafter. The character plods (running, the usual default, is difficult to achieve), switches weapons with no reason, and the combat is hard to control. The map is dreadful. Village management is a pain. Henchmen seem impossible to obtain in the beginning game, and there is no ramp-up in battle. Possibly the game improves in later stages, I have no idea, I gave up.

While modern US soundtrack composers usually take one theme and run with it, Geinoh Yamashirogumi has created an immense panorama of musical landscapes that invite the mind to wander. While some tracks are somewhat difficult to listen to at first (Illusion, Dolls Polyphony), others reach out and grab you immediately (Kaneda, Tetsuo, and Requiem). Strongly suggested because it also gives insight to the unique Japanese way of looking at music.

It's 192 pages of nothing. The main character, a young girl named Cherie, seems to express few or no emotions throughout the book, mainly, it seems to be, because not much happens. All the characters seem two-dimensional, with no personality of their own. When her close neighbours move, she seems confused about her emotions relating to their son, and never really seems to resolve those either. At best, don't buy it, and at worst, check it out from a library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad these guys aren't around anymore.","review":"I love this band, and always have. My friends in highscool refused to listen to them anymore. I saw these guys quite a few times, and they always rocked, whether at a bar or at an arena. They have that flare that can atrack anyone. Although most people remember them for their one song \\"Don't Close Your Eyes\\", back in 1988-89, they had been around for about 10 years already. Unfortunately, they broke up a few years ago and the last I heard, their guitarist, Brian Forsythe, was painting billboards somewhere in Maryland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoffs Abound","review":"There are some great riffs in this one. Unfortunately, most of them were lifted from better songs by better bands. Compare \\"Red Lite, Green Lite, TNT\\" with Zeppelin's \\"Communication Breakdown\\". \\"She Dropped Me the Bomb\\" cops AC/DC's \\"If You Want Blood\\". The title track \\"borrows\\" Cinderella's \\"Shake Me\\". Etc, etc, etc.If you can get past this stuff, it's a fairly decent rock record. Whiteman's voice can get irritating after a while, but the twin guitars have a nice AC/DC-meets-Thin Lizzy sound about them, and there isn't too much posturing going on (unlike most bands of the era)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of The Hair Bands","review":"Kix...Isn't that a cereal?

I downloaded both of those tunes, along with \\"Cold Blood\\", and hope to get the rest of the album on iTunes soon.

However, a friend brought me to see Kix at a small club in Boston in 1989 and I was blown away. The live show was great - these guys obviously had paid their dues for years on the stage, not just making \\"corporate\\" major label pop metal. I picked up \\"Blow My Fuse\\" as well as \\"Midnight Dynamite\\" and was quite impressed. These guys make catchy 80s metal - good riffs, great grooves and have a great vocalist. So why not 5 stars? The lyrics are just too juvenile - not just now in retrospect, but even as a teenager I realized that most of the songs were hokey and cliched (think first Extreme album). That being said, this is a great value if you like this style of music and are ok with silly lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Kix album!!","review":"Kix is a very unpopular and very underrated band.

I suppose it is a little too extended and extensive for popular consumption, but that is just kind of sad. May be it is a little old and everyone has already read and I'm just getting on the bandwagon, but I doubt it.Oh well, read the book, it is far better than whatever hesitations you might have to the contrary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snaking Through No Instructions","review":"The concept for this game is great for teaching kids word recognition. However, the game does not include ANY instructions as to how to play, leaving parents and kids guessing as to the rules. I would recommend the game if it came with instructions for play (like every other board game does) or even had instructions online that were easily found. I can't recommend it, though, because after searching for over half an hour, all I came up with were links to buy the game.

She has to foil a very positive character like Yonan, who is very unselfish, and will sacrifice all his interests for the good of the group, no matter how hopeless his task. Unfortunately the foil means 3 very unsympathetic women. Situation reads as hopeless as Dark Piper. Got the feel that the dark passage merely led to something darker. Very unlike Moon of 3 Rings whre the reluctant magic mess maker keeps trying to get things back in balance, and ends up being shipped off planet as the ship's cat.

The descriptions she protrays of her heros are just down right horrible. Poor Lily scraps by in this (love) story for some ounce of love from husband and recieves none till then very end and it was just not convincing for me in the least. I did read the other reviews (I always do) and I can't understand at all why anyone would who reads romance would find it romantic for the hero in the book to be cruel and the heroine to have no backbone and just take what she gets. Would you? Please!I love romance novels, mystery, supsense novels but if I am reading a romance am I not supposed to feel that while I am reading it. This author seems to be failing me at every turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, desperate Lily","review":"I felt disgusted at Lily the whole time. If she had been a man and acted the way she did she would have been labled as creepy. No matter how many times he rejected her and told her NO she kept throwing herself at him and it was akward to read...until he gave in unsuprisingly when she gave herself to him. It seemed he only married her out of pity and the fact that he thought he was dying and she was ok with that! Desperate! Lily was just everything you don't want to be as a woman.

However, the more I got into it, the more disgusted I became. The writing is extremely childish. Lily's character was PATHETIC - literally BEGGING Whitby for crumbs of affection. Have some self-respect, girl! Grow a damn backbone! It was disgusting. And Whitby's falling in love with her by the end was not convincing. Seemed like she browbeated him into loving her until he was too tired so he just gave in.

There are some special positions along the board like \\"Bank Exchange\\" (ex: the player can exchange pennies in for nickels) and \\"$\\" (the player gets to collect the money on the board).

Smoke Screen takes the reader throught the seamy side of corporate America, where moral choices are presented at every turn.The plot moves at a fast pace and always kept my interest.

The photography, in most cases is truly spectacular and very detailed there where it is supposed to be detailed. The only, slightly negative, comment I have is that information is cheap at best. Don't expect any information of why a piece was designed / built the way it was, or some of the woodworking difficulties that were overcome in building a particular piece.

The background description of individuals and institutions isn't bad. The rest is.Camille Paglia is not usually classified as an anthropologist, but this book reminded me of her - if she couldn't write well and ignored the culture she wrote about. This book has little bearing on its purported subject, and the author's personal views of science aren't interesting (largely because he's speaking on a subject he clearly doesn't understand).

Add in some supposidly evil monsters that look like the guest acts from the muppet show, and more corny acting jobs. The result is one of the stupidest films I've ever seen.

Steve Wang's special effects bring this sequal up a bar. The story is far superior to the first and there is an abundence of Tokusatsu style action scenes. The story does suffer some bad lines here and there and the length of the overall production is hindering. It is clear the producers were hesitant to edit anything out of this film. The Guyver suit is much better in this version than the last, the muscular appearance more resembling its anime counterpart. The coolest part of this film is the Guyver/Zoanoid hybrid, who provides an excellent final villian for the film.All fans of sci-fi and Japanese action films should get this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of the animated series","review":"this is by far the best episode in the entire animated series of the guyver. I don't know what's up with these reviews you guys have but all but one are in the wrong place. the death of the gyver is the best episode because of great animation, and a fantastic fight scene. no matter how many times i saw this episode it always kept me satisfied. if you like the guyver this episode is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"This model has been recalled!\\"","review":"Only a marginal improvement on the first film. The basic problems remain the same: repetitious fight sequences, monster costumes that look patently silly, cackling villains, and an obvious plot development: finding a space ship. They tried to take things too seriously this time out, beginning with the breakup of the lead character and his girlfriend of the first film (both played by different actors and not much in the way of an upgrade). While the first film was dopey, this one was mopey. Even worse, the plot was infinitely forgettable. It had something to do with an archeological dig half populated by rubber thingies prone to cackling and beating their chests for effect. I like camp and camping as well as the next person but in this case, they just went too far with it.

Although better than the first movie (by far!), this flick still feels forced, unnecessary and constrained, as though the producers ran out of budget money and couldn't afford to make it any better.If this is your first experience with the Guyver, go out to your local import store and buy the anime videos: this movie pales in comparison to them. If you're a dedicated Guyver fan considering purchasing these movies...don't. Even at [money], the movie isn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"One of THE Best Movies Based On An Anime\\"","review":"Anyone who saw the first Guyver movie and didn't like it, don't worry. This movie is AWESOME! For one, I have both animes on DVD. If you pay attention to the anime and movie, you will notice similarities between them. One is where Sean jumps off the cliff and changes into the Guyver in midair! In the anime, he jumped off a fence at his school (very high up) and did the exact same thing. Steve Wang and his crew did an excellent job.David Hayter I believed delivered a strong performance that is worthy of attention. Also, let's not forget that the first movie never showewd him using his laser (located above the Control Metal) even once! The fight scenes are superb (especially the fight between the Guyver and the Guyver Zoanoid). The only thing that I disliked was some of the dialouge, but it's forgivable. Anyone who likes sci-fi or anime based films, this is one I highly recommend to pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast , actionpacked Anime with good fight scenes","review":"As I have seen \\"The Death of the Guyver\\" at least 15 times , I feel that it is about time for other Anime lovers in the www to take a look at the older , but still thrilling Video series \\"The Guyver \\" .

It is classic Tarantino influence attempting to capture that old school drive in movie feel. Campy, Corny, and Cheesy but definitely entertaining.It is simply not more complicated that that and that's why it works. It satisfies some base need for violence, sex, and revenge that we as Americans love. There's a bad boy or girl in all of us even if we don't act that way in real life.

The plot is weak and hardly makes sense, the characters are undeveloped, and it was all around boring. Big name actors here, but none of them could save this film.

I can't believe it was actually written & produced by anyone who had ever had anything to do with this 'genre', even the 'B' class U/A flicks from the '60's'. It views like some high school kid's fantasy wet dream.If you MUST watch this piece of drivel, do like I did and catch it on Dish or cable (IF you can sit thru it!) and save your bucks for gas money. . . . .The actors, especially Hopper & Carradine, must either have been bored out of their minds or had some serious debts to pay off to get involved in this stinkeroo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a poetic parody of the biker exploitation film","review":"this movie is not typical. perhaps that's why it's so difficult to review objectively... why every reviewer has a different opinion.

When I called Brother, they advised my only alternative was to take it to another Factory Service Center. I did, same story. It appears that neither Brother or their Factory Service Centers care if their products stop working once the warranty runs out. That type of service I can do without.

I honestly didn't think that there was a way these Virginia guys could top \\"Change Is A Sound\\". That record was so incredibly musically driving, inspiring and heartfelt. This time around some of the instant catchiness and drive is traded for a little more dissonance and sprinkled musical twists and turns. By the third listen however, this group of songs had sunk in and I now like it better than \\"Change. . .\\". The emotional intensity and passion in these guys, particularly in singer Thomas is so great that you can't help but be inspired while rocking out at the same time. \\"Exit English\\" plays out like a musical \\"call to arms\\" challenging intellectual apathy and inspiring you to action. If you like meaningful melodic hardcore along the lines of Good Riddance or Kid Dynamite but also the emotional intensity and original sound of groups like Hot Water Music you need to hear \\"Exit English\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"THis book was my assignment for US History.

Shirakawa and I would like to know what are his credentials for commenting on the music made by Furtwangler and his life. Any temptation to give the author the benefit of any doubt, given the high reputation of publisher Oxford University Press, is eradicated by the howler of an error on page 177. In an aside, Shirakawa tells us that Theodore Roosevelt was Franklin Roosevelt's grandfather. I would have thought every schoolchild knows that Teddy was the fifth (!!!) cousin of FDR. (How could the prestigious publisher let this error slip by??) After reading that, it is very difficult to accept at face value what Shirakawa asks us to accept regarding his scholarship and expertise.

I used it on a few trips last fall and the tent performed very well. The last trip was in October with snow on the ground and temperatures down to -3 or -4C. It was large enough for two men(not a lot of spare room), with packs and rifles fitting nicely in the vestibules. The Vertex 2 was easy to set up, withstood some wind and rain, and the dual doors/vestibules system was great. It would be the perfect size for one man solo but for a few nights in decent weather two is ok. What surprised me was the price, it would seem to be a decent quality tent for for an economy price. I guess time and hard usage will tell. It is light enough, especially if there are two people to split the load with, ie I carry the tent my buddy carries the Scotch everybody is happy. I intend to use it a number of times this coming year starting in May or as soon as the snow comes off the alpine. Great price for a great tent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality: a cheap, infuriating waste of money","review":"It's my own fault for being tight and trying to save money, but the people who have previously reviewed this item are also partly to blame. They either work for the company, or don't know a thing about camping gear. This tent is an absolute piece of junk that should not ever be available for purchase. Weighs more and is bigger folded up than they claim, and shoddily built with heavy, poor quality materials. The pole across the top broke on the second night of use and I was unable to remove the jammed piece to do a running repair so spent the trip with the inner mesh in our faces. In the future will be buying another brand, and will never consider anything made by Alps again. There should be a zero star option to rate it.

While IMO Masterplan's debut album wasn't a masterpiece, it was strong, melodic, hard, varying and contained some truly amazing tracks. 'Aeronautics' is very predictable, less melodic, more metal (mostly due to lot's of double-bass drumming) and uninspired concerning songwriting and lyrics. Even Jorn's vocals which were truly great on the debut album sound weak, bored and kind of buried in the mix. The lyrics also try too hard to be radio friendly and catchy and thus fail. There are of course some noteworthy songs such as 'Crimson Rider', 'Wounds' and 'Back In The Burn' but nothing mind blowing.

It's the case with Wes Craven's THE HILLS HAVE EYES, a film presented by Anchor Bay in a special and definitive edition. If one isn't concerned at all by the fate reserved to most of the members of the politically correct Carter family, each of the appearances of Pluto, Jupiter or another member of this degenerate family is rather surprising if not frightening.The only problem is that the theme of THE HILLS HAVE EYES had already be magistrally treated by John Boorman 5 years before in DELIVERANCE. And that there wasn't anything to add to that masterpiece. So Wes Craven's movie suffers a lot from this comparison and if it wasn't for the quality of the acting of Michael Berryman, the film wouldn't deserve any attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess it takes a die-hard craven fan","review":"Low budget horror can be done well, but this film was simply awful.

You'll look across the sofa at your friend/partner and say, \\"What the heck is this, and why all the hype?\\"One thing does recommend the DVD version, however: The follow-up, modern day interviews with Craven, the Producer, and the cast.

I literally struggled for half-an-hour to remove the stopper from the bottle. My mom is in her 80's, and I knew she would not be able to handle it. When I called the vendor (Beauty Encounter) they were very rude, denied there was a problem and said if I wanted to return it I would have to pay for it. (Plus I had to pay for the LD phone call... apparently they have an 800# but don't print it on the packing slip).

Thankfully, I decided to read it first before I read it with them. On page 11 it says, \\"Planes stay out of these dark thunderclouds. The rushing air could turn a plane upside down. It could even rip off the wings.\\" REALLY???? This is a children's book! The last thing a parent wants is for a child to be afraid of flying if the weather isn't just perfect!

I've been waiting for Collective Soul to release an unplugged album for awhile now. The entire CD is great. If you are a true Collective Soul fan then you will love this CD. If you just liked one or two of their big radio hits then this may not be for you, especially if you listen to Top 40! I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who has an appreciation for music. The album title says it all. These are songs in their purest form. Ed's vocals are awesome and the guitar work is great. This CD is worth it for \\"She Said\\", \\"Satellite\\" & \\"Youth\\" alone. \\"She Said\\" is much cleaner than the hidden track version on \\"Dosage\\". And to the reviewer who said it was tiresome, if you want tiresome, listen to disc 2 of the Foo Fighters \\"In your honor\\". That is tiresome & uninspiring. Buy this disc, it is great, with a GREAT bonus track too."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Not unlike many other truly devoted Collective Soul fans, I was somewhat disappointed in their last album Youth. Some of us waited years for it, and it was an over-marketed and very different release.Although the majority of the songs on this album are from Youth, it is nothing like Youth. If anything, it gave me an new meaning and appreciation for Youth. This is the old Collective Soul I remember! From the moment you pop the disc in, Ed's voice will melt you. It contains two new songs (one hidden track), which are very good. I could not possible pick a favorite from this album, but I will tell you that I did not tire of listening to it over and over again.This is in no way comparable to Hints, but it has the same feel and is sure to leave you wanting more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another GREAT CD from CS!!!","review":"The follow up CD to Youth is absolutely amazing! I thought that the previous CD was an amazing new touch for the genuine CS sound, but From the Ground Up is just as much of a compliment to their repertoire of music! The vocals are flawless, as always, but even more pure. The musical interpretation is impressive. This CD is a must-buy for CS fans, and a wonderful acoustic introduction for newbies to the musical perfection known as Collective Soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Music","review":"If you are in to synthed out, heavily overdubbed mechanical music, don't buy this cd. This stripped down Collective Soul showcases the pure talent of Ed Roland's song writing and rich vocal abilities and scores in a big way with acoustic versions of such songs as She Said, Satellite, and the previously unreleased Youth. A must have for any music lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic Perfection...","review":"It is one thing to like a band for their unique sound, defining characteristics and enthusiasm, but this CD takes it one step further. You are able to \\"feel\\" the songs so much more. It gives you a sense of sitting next to the guys while they are playing live. By listening to the acoustic versions of these songs, one can surely see why this band is so successful. Thanks for sharing a new and fresh perspective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets not go overboard here","review":"A lot of solid songs here. Collective soul haven't went downhill. From a commerical standpoint they have but who cares. I like each of their albums. I actually dislike their first album the most. I still like it but the least.

After all these years, it's still my favorite Mannheim Steamroller work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Along with FA 4, My Favorite","review":"This album is more thematically organized than any of the first 4 albums.The first side \\"Fantasia\\" essentially repeats a simple theme in different variations, from pastoral to high energy synth rock.The second half of this album \\"Interlude V, Toota Lute\\" is very atmospheric and more in character with the other Fresh Aire albums 1-4. It winds up with the Steamroller's signature piece \\"Going to Another Place,\\" which restates the theme explored in \\"Fantasia.\\"I'm a big fan of the first 4 Fresh Aire albums. However, I think they kind of lost it starting with FA 5 when the concepts behind the albums were too grand, and adding an entire orchestra and choral group created monstrous, boring arrangements that bogged down Chip Davis' melodies.You won't find that here.

The lid pops off and becomes a tray so you can weigh larger things. I use it to carry in my knitting bag to see how much of a ball of yarn I've used or to weigh a finished sock and compare it to what is left of the ball of wool to know if there's enough for the second sock. I've found all sorts of useful ways to use it.Since the lid covers the scale totally and protects it well - you don't need to worry about carrying it around and having it getting damaged.The display is nice and bright and easy to read. It even come with a calibration weight - which I didn't need to use because it weighed accurately without calibration.I've tried several other pocket size scales for my knitting bag and this one works the best of all of them. The shape and size of it is perfect for my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of an adventure","review":"This was one of the first non-Doyle Holmes stories that I picked up to read, and I was quite disappointed.

There are some wacky chase scenes -- one involving a Trans Am and a Harvester in a corn field - but most the action is mundane especially compared to McQueen's other films.The movie would have benefited greatly with better effects (explosions, etc), some one liners and stronger characterization. The ending is somewhat sentimental and cheesy. The film is based on a true story - which probably could have used some embellishment. McQueen gives a pretty good performance and it's fun to see Levar Burton in one of his earlier roles.

This film is not in the same league and is frankly a bit silly, although it has some good moments (especially the Trans Am cornfield car chase) and a little light humor too. One of the worst aspects is the lack of any background character development regarding the psychotic killer after McQueen. Who is he? Why does he hate Papa Thornson? What is with the war paint on his face? There are no answers to any of these questions. I also found the score to be very cheesy. It sounds like the music from a Brady Bunch episode. Finally, I found the killing of an innocent bystander during one chase to be too cavalier, with no sense of regret on the part of the hero. All in all it is a poorly written and directed script."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad goodbye to the \\"king of cool\\"","review":"this was steve mcqueen's last film and that is sad as this is not even able to be called an action movie or a comedy. this mess is \\"based on the true story\\" of bounty hunter ralph \\"papa\\" thorson and it just never gels into and kind of film at all. not the way to say goodbye to the great steve mcqueen, get bulliet or the sand pebbles instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD purchase","review":"I am stationed in Iraq and recently purchased The Hunter(Steve McQueen) through Amazon and when I received it and went to play it, the disk started skipping.

This is Steve McQueen's last film before he died, and rates as one of his best in my opinion, along with The Sand Pebbles, Papillon and The Great Escape. The Chicago chase scene is awesome, and McQueen's acting as the unlikely hunter is very believable. They don't make action flicks like this anymore, with the lead as a real person, not just a macho gun toting hero. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old school action hero.","review":"Steve McQueens final film is always so refreshing to watch. It is all so very real, Steve comes through very genuine in the Hunter. I think this role fit him best, after all Steve wanted very much just to be a regular American guy. Steve always worked very hard to make his films as real as possible. I do not enjoy modern action films as much because the toughguy is usually as much as a jerk! as the villians. Steve always seemed to bring a sense of fairness and good will to his characters. His good sense of character shows through in \\"The Hunter\\". Steve as Papa Thorsen always reminded me of my Uncle. This was the very first film I watched with my Dad in the theatre. I was nine years old. Through the years other films have faded from my memory. I will never forget \\"The Hunter\\" nor will I ever forget Steve Mcqueen, he was a class act."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve's last film","review":"This was the best movie to bring Steve McQueen's incredible film career to a close. Steve is Ralph \\"Papa\\" Thorson, longtime bounty hunter. He'll do whatever it takes to bring the bad guys in. Released in 1980, it wasn't a box-office hit, but it's still a great movie. The best part is the long chase scene, filmed in Chicago. The rest of the cast is good too. LeVar Burton and Kathryn Harrold really stand out as Tommy Price and Dotty, Papa's pregnant girlfriend. The funniest part is seeing Steve's character being such of a lousy driver, when knowing he raced cars in real life.

After our first rain, both the mechanical and new La Crosse gauges were identical. In the instructions it says to remove the battery to clear the 24 hr reading. When I did that I would loose the signal from the sending unit and have to go through the setup again. I found out that if you only reset the top display the 24 hr will re-zero in 24 hrs.

Given up on La Crosse \\"Technology.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE do not waste your money to this!","review":"I purchased this rain gauge on Christmas Day for myself and my brother and it worked for approximately 30 days.First off, the outside component is flimsy - the battery cover broke when I inserted the batteries and I had to use tape to secure them, which allowed moisture into the battery compartment. The plastic holes broke when I anchored it on my fence, and even though the bucket and receiver were well within 30-feet of each other, they would not communicate so I had to go through the process of moving and securing again.Each time you want to zero out the meter you have to remove the batteries and then reestablish the connection, which is a pain. The second time I zeroed out the unit all I got were dashes on the display screen.I will stick with my reliable tube rain gauge from now on and do without the cheap toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Simply doesn't work. Batteries are OK and have changed the line of sight but there is no recording of rainfall.

After 2 days of trying to get it to zero out, I returned it and bought another one. It took several more tries to get it to work and finaly successed.

Most on Amazon's list are special order or out of print. Unfortunately, Parker and his writers produced a dry, dull, tedious tome that will bore even serious 30YW enthusiasts. Novices should special-order Wedgwood instead; enthusiasts will want to read S.R.

It is complex, and the political interactions of most of the nations of Europe make it a huge task to explain.This book lacks. I'm sure the facts are complete and accurate, but the writing is as dry as week old toast. None of the personae came alive, and none of the facts were made memorable. I would recommend it as a reference, perhaps, but not as an interesting read on the subject. It sits on my shelf while I seek better written works to capture my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"The reason many people dislike history","review":"I picked up this book with a great deal of enthusiasm. I wasn't too familiar with the personalities and issues surrounding the conflict and it was one of the few books on the subject I could find in english. The author did his best to drain anything of interest from his book. Mr. Parker spends almost no time or effort explaining the major players or their motives resulting in a confusing jumble of names and places that are difficult to distinguish from each other. Analysis is sparse and desperately needed. In frustration I consulted a 50 year old Cambridge Modern History and the 52 page essay on the Thirty Year War gave me more information and analysis (in a much better style) than the entire book by Parker. Leave this one alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent place to start","review":"The Thirty Years' War was a very confusing conflict on many levels, and to attempt any account of it in barely 200 pages is almost foolhardy. But this book succeeds, at least in setting the stage and following the people and politics. It is a good place to start a study of the conflict. It is not a military history (there is a brief account of some specifically military aspects toward the end) nor a social history, and a great deal of detail had to be left out. But the basics of the war are there, which can be fleshed out with more extensive or specialist works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not for the Casual Reading","review":"A previous reviewer said this is not for the casual reader. My rating is not reflective of the book itself but of my preference for what I look for in a history book. Reading the Dutch Reformation with particular interest in James Arminius, I thought the Thirty Years War might interest me. Yet, although I was intrigued by how it demonstrates the complexities of this war - or any war - it confused me with its intricate information and details. Chapter 6, part on the 'Universal Soldier', was quite intriging for me. However, this book is for those seriously interested in this partciular subject.

I heard so much about this infamous title, but never could apparently find a copy of the book itself. When I finally did get a copy, I was disappointed how short-sighted Hoffman's goals were.Even in the 1960's, the tactics in this book would not help the intended audience. The frequent advocacy of violence as a tool to make change appears to be more in line with the far right.There are some useful critiques of power relationships here, but the book suffers from very outdated information. What was cutting edge for activists in my parent's generation now seems like it should be a historical footnote in a Smithsonian exhibit on political protest in the 1960's.Individuals who are looking for an in-depth portrait of Hoffman should consider renting/purchasing 'Steal This Movie'."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind !!","review":"I turn 40 in 4 days.

Anyway, this retail version of the sauce is just as bad: tons of sugar and mostly vinegar. Marinate your steak in this and all you'll taste is the vinegar. This sauce will ruin a good cut of meat.

The examples and techniques are interesting, and I am incorporating the ideas in my schedule.

The authors could have spent more time on the meat and bones of methodology and less time saying which group experience what type of weight loss and so forth.

He was really more honorable than a rake and his cousin was just stupid and totally inept as a fiance or a potential lover - hopefully there will be no book about Harold. Damien proabably had never been fortunate to be so close to a woman of Adelle's depth of wonderful qualities. He recognized all those qualities and saw even more - her passion and zest for life that she had kept hidden for so long.

I think that Elvis Costello was out on tour promoting his PUNCH THE CLOCK album.

This is supposed to be an historical romance, but without the picture on the cover, one could easily think the action takes place in the 20th or 21st century. The story is about Rachel, an accomplished engineer and part owner of a corporation, who is desperately trying to get recognition for her abilities, as well as hold her division together. The head of the corporation is a childhood friend who was previously married to her best friend. There is some chemistry between the two of them, although it isn't really clear why they haven't gotten together before. Most of the action deals with corporate matters instead of the romance, so I couldn't really get into it. It is nothing like my favorite authors, Celeste Bradley, Jo Beverley, or those of that genre. If you like passionate romance, this isn't the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Match Made in Scandal","review":"This story was very disappointing. I have read several romance novels and by far this was the most disappointing.

The liner notes provide a great background to the album and provide great stories as to how the songs came about and were selected. The bonus tracks alone make this album worth purchasing - especially having the single remix of \\"Twist my arm\\". It's a shame they weren't ever able to recapture the popularity they once had, but their contribution cannot be overlooked.

Love the capability and ease of use though. When I first put batteries into it, I thought it was broken because I couldn't get the screen to react. However, it turned out that you have to have the screen at a certain angle to see it. That's my only complaint. The labeler has great flexibility and is a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job right!","review":"I have had many different labelers but non compare to this one. When I got this labeler I thought I was not going to like it cuz it was big and bulky but after I started to use it, I actually really like it. It makes really clear labels and it has a lot of good features too. so if I was to recommend a labeler to someone, this would be the one. I will never get another labeler to replace this one, if htis one brakes after time which I don't think it will, I'll just get the same one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made to sell label tape. GARBAGE - AVOID","review":"This thing blatantly forces you to waste tape. This isn't simply about an extensive margin, these boobs make you cut every label MANUALLY! An entire INCH of tape is wasted with every label. You simply have to cut it off. With every label, it has a 1 inch leader, marked with a colon so you know where to cut with SCISSORS!Brother label machines are normally great, but this thing has to be the most disappointing product I have ever seen from Brother. I hope somebody launches a class-action over this because they do not disclose that you will waste an inch of tape with EVERY PRINTING.I got this cheap from [...], so once the cartridge that came with it runs out I'll throw it in the toilet tank to help conserve water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to print file folder lables","review":"How do you print file folder labels correctly? the documentation doesn't tell you.

What a pathetic way to supply your customers with what they need!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother Labeler sold be Tech and Office","review":"Don't know if the labeler is good or not as it arrived and did not work.

Even if you adjust the trailer length, it still puts the wasted leader on the front, then adds dots to tell you where to MANUALLY cut off the excess. NOT an acceptable solution.What's worse, there's no way to know this before you start to use it - even the instructions don't directly state it, but only talk around the subject, so you waste a lot of labels trying to adjust the leader before figuring it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"My office hates it","review":"This is not a user-friendly machine. We have to keep the instructions on hand all the time. No one in my office knows how to use it, and it wastes one inch of tape per label. I've got a busy office of day traders and they're standing around with scissors like kindergarten children cutting these labels down to fit their files. Its a waste of time, not to mention the over-priced label tape.I have a Brother PT-65 at home which I love, its so user friendly I don't think I have picked up the instructions once. The labels cost 1/2 the price and it doesn't waste as much. I recommend that one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"This is a very good value for the money.

I don't like this because of the manual cutter and also the unit I received had a dim LCD display. Another issue was that I couldn't get my 6 volt power adapter to work well on the machine. It would power all of the functions except for the printing. This unit required a 6-8 volt input (couldn't find the current spec) and buying the recommended P-touch power adapter makes the overall price of the unit too expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I bought this because we have similar one at work and find it handy.

Also, no adapter and to top it off I can't see the typing on the stupid screen. I have to get real close and in just the right light or I can't tell how it's set or what it's going to print. Back it goes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipped without necessary parts","review":"This item comes with many of the needed items missing. Read the description very carefully as the picture and descriptions are not in sync with each other. The picture shows three colors of tape. The product is supposed to ship per the desciption with only one \\"sample\\" tape. (I didn't even receive that one!) The item can use an ac adapter, but per the description this is not included. You might have expected that this type of standard item was included, but it is not. Once you start buying all of the necessary items needed to make this product truly functional from a practical standpoint, it becomes a very costly purchase. Go to Costco and buy the label maker there. It's a much better value in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Tape Waster","review":"This product wastes as much tape as it uses to print each label. This is no exaggeration, this thing wastes like crazy. It's almost funny that someone would design a product like this; apparently Brother wants to get rich on tape sales - at our expense. I won't be buying any other Brother products after this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"No AC adaptor included? FAIL.","review":"I'm not even going to bother talking about the features on this thing.

They are very thin material and bend easily. The latch is stiff and the catch has very little detent so the latch sometimes catches and most times doesn't. The escutcheon pins that came with the catch are very thin and won't drive without bending unless the wood is very soft, like pine. I ended up discarding the pins and using #2 round head slot screws. They don't look as nice as pins but I was able to secure the latch to the box. I have 3 sets of these catchs left but think they are headed for the waste bin. There is little point to installing a non funcitoning cheap catch on a $40 box. My customers won't like it. I guess I'll keep looking for a decent small box catch. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mini-series","review":"The mini-series War and Remembrance, and also The Winds of War, both from the books by Herman Wouk, should both be viewed.

Unfortunately they will never be seen again. I taped the mini-series back in 1988 and have all the material, but it seems that without these spots there is something missing. In what I believe to be one of the greatest min-series ever produced it is a huge letdown that this material is not included"},{"rating":"1","title":"War and remembrance not very memorable","review":"A very disappointing sequel to Winds of war, for two main reasons: The script was written by two writers other than Herman Wouk, who 'co-wrote'; and the director was completely out of his depth, allowing the actors who played Hitler, Stalin, Eichmann, and several others to disintegrate into cartoon characters. The change of cast is also distracting for those who saw Winds. The film cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be a docudrama about WWII, the search for Nathalie and her son, or the soap opera between Rhoda and Pug. There are several more subplots as well, so the mind starts to wander rather quickly. There are far too many unnecessaery scenes of violence and graphic suffering. As a specialist in military history and uniforms, I was driven around the bend by the inaccuracies in American uniforms, insignia, and decorations. May be worth watching once to find out what happened after Winds, but all in all, a very expensive letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"War andRemembrance","review":"A great mini-series.

After having purchased Winds of War from Amazon I decided I had to have the complete series. Such a remarkable series put together by some very amazing people, not to mention Herman Wouk as the catapult. The acting was subperb and the action amazing. I have to admit that on War & Remembrance, I still have to close my eyes in some places. I know that's cheating but it's difficult to believe that we could be so cruel and vicious with our fellow man. I have great respect for Dan Curtis and Barbara Steele in their ability to produce an epic of this magnitude.

The songs are forced, senseless and were written for Grace Slick's ego. This album is horrible on many levels. If you really want an 80's throwback for positive nostalgic reasons, you could look into Men At Work, Crowded House, Madness, Van Halen, or the brilliant Yes 90125 album.

Still not convinced? Well - put it this way - if the clothes they were wearing could make music - this is what it would sound like. Forget Black Sabbath - this is what's really in Satan's jukebox.

Craig Chaquico's playing really shines on songs like \\"Tommorrow Doen't Matter Tonight\\", \\"Rock Myself to Sleep\\" and \\"Desperate Heart\\". The vocals, what can be said, that you can't tell, by just listening. Mickey Thomas and Grace's voices fit nicely together. Mickey is blamed for the Starship's commercial direction, which is just plain stupidity!!! Was \\"miracles\\", from Jefferson Starship's 1975 album, Red Octopus not commercial? Hardly!

He watches Caillou everyday so I had to get this movie.

I like that it differs from other Caillou episodes in that it is one continuous story...

Any children who enjoy the show will love this full length Christmas DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"My son loves Caillou and this video is no different. I have not personally sat and watched this through (I bought it so I could set him up in another room so I didn't have to watch it for 8 hours a day!) but I have watched a LOT of Caillou and for small children it is a great show. It has everyday situations, with Caillou's parents, grandparents, play school, little sister, pets, etc....that I think are great teachers for the \\"real world\\" even for small children. Great learning tool.

The thing about Ram-Zet is that they are not really Black, Goth, Death, or Doom Metal at all. But they do add in Black, Death, Goth, Doom, and any other kind of metal and other types of music you can think of. You may even be able to find some country or pop music some where in there music.Though this is not for ever one. Heck even people who listen to Black and Death metal have had a hard time getting into Ram-Zet. That has a lot to do with the fact that they really are any Insane band in ever sense of the word. The music garbs you and places you into a world that you really don't want to be in your own mind. It's not only a look at Zet's mind but also the listeners mind in some ways.If you want Metal that goes beyond what you are used to be it Nu-Metal, Black Metal, Death Metal, Power Metal, etc. then get this CD along with there other two CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten and boring","review":"This is an excellent example of why text book authors should learn to write.

The seams are very crudely done. Plus there are rough little nodes along all the edges. It feels like spray-painted plastic, and I think it might just be.

In each story Mr. Wolfe leaves his house! True, sometimes there was a good meal involved, but it is still rare to see him outside his brownstone. He has also been known to leave it because of flower related affairs, but you know how he hates cars, thinks they're death traps. And he might be right.Anyway, if you are a fan, buy it.

His pacing is perfect, his control of climaxes is impressive, and he understands the complex architecture of this wonderful work.Having said that, the New Zealand Symphony, while possessing a lovely string tone and good wind and brass, really can't give Tintner everything he asks for. Disturbingly, the strings, especially the violins, have frequent mishaps that often seem to mar the phrasing, especially at the end of long phrases. In light of this, unless you are understandably a huge Tintner fan, the sixth to get on a budget label is Skrowaczewski with the wonderful Saarbrucken forces on Arte Nova. Both conductors have similar takes on the music, but Skrowaczewski has the better orchestra, and sometimes he holds the tension a little better, too.The engineering is admirable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have heard them all, too....","review":"The 6th is my favorite Bruckner symphony and I have heard the entire catalog of this symphony, but this one is the worst. It is a difficult one to interpret, and there are only a few really good ones. This recording, though, is not Bruckner. It misses the essence of the piece. One star is one too many...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ist movement fine...but downhill from there!!!","review":"The recent performance of Bruckner 6 on Teldec of Barenboim led me to this particular recording of Bruckner's rather strange A minor work once again...for sure here we have a nicely balanced recording but I find the string work a bit feeble...again not the best combination in a work that requires a great string ensemble.\\\\I have long admired Barenboim and Klemperer in this work because at least they don't drag the proceedings so much as Tintner does. Naxos sound is good ...but certainly not any better than the previous DG record with Barenboim. Come on DG, get off you butts and re-release a great Chicago performance of this piece!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeble interpretation and performance.","review":"Almost all of Tintner's Bruckner cycle has been grossly overrated but this one is a real turkey. Slack performance by the N.Z. orchestra combined with ponderous and unfocussed conducting make this the most uninvolving and uninspired version in the catalogue. Almost any other alternative is preferable. Klemperer, Eugen Jochum, Kleinert, Haitink, Stein, Wand, Steinberg, George Ludwig Jochum, Barenboim, Swarovsky etc. (and even Karajan) are all superior. Get three or four versions, (most of those I mention are available cheaply), and see if you don't agree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intricate & intelligent","review":"This novel is not quick to read, and not a book that you can't put down. The story is intelligent and intricate, the details are not laid out simply, but sometimes need to be processed, through the reading.

This is a great summer series and exactly what I expected it to be- a teenage soap opera with the supernatural overlaid on it. The werewolves are fun though I would like to know if they can change to full wolf form. I love the writers decided to use la crosse instead of football for the main high school sport.The characters are fun and, as the season progressed, moved beyond their stereotypes into real characters. The bad guy's backgtround is not typical and, in fact, in most shows he'd be the hero or at least the anti-hero. Instead here he is unredeemedly evil. Plus the characters run into some real problems and not just the usual teen angst (though there is a fair share of that-unavoidable for a show about teens). I recommend this series for anyone who wants to spend some time watching a series which is fun without being heavy or too dramatic. A great way to pass an evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teen Wolf Season 1","review":"I watched Teen Wolf season one and I loved it. I am hooked. I saw most of the shows on tv when I could but I am so glad I bought this and caught up on all the episodes before season two came on. I can't wait for season two to come out on dvd. I was sort of skeptical about the show at first but it is really a good show with good actors and not just a teenager show. It has good special effects, action, drama and comedy. I think the cast works very well together. I highly recommend this to any one who wants to be entertained while watching tv which is a rarity these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this show!","review":"My mom says this is based on a movie from when she was young with the same nameTeen Wolfwhich I watched with her, too. That movie was pretty cool but I like this show better because it keeps going and doesn't stop like a movie does. Plus the guy who plays the teen wolf is really really cute!!!!It's not really scary for me when he turns into a wolf but it kind of scared my little sister. I like the mystery part of the story and how Scott the guy who turns into a wolf has to deal with suddenly being a werewolf because he got bit by one.

There is danger, love, and a surprise twist that you won't see coming, not to mention a shirtless montage in the special features. I would definitely recommend this series to anyone that loves werewolves or want to get a few laughs mixed in with the danger. Also, this series is not affiliated with the original eighties movie with the same title and follows a completely different story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!

It has all the makings for instant addiction..........good to above average acting skills, fantastic special effects, lots of build up in the script (from EXCELLENT WRITERS i might add) and a little comedy thrown in for good measure (love Stiles) It sure breaks up some Monday night boredom!! I cannot wait until it arrives on blu-ray. Bring it on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great eye candy","review":"Great show with a good story line. The characters have been well developed throughout season one and there's enough cliffhanger at the end of each season to make you want to continue watching. The special effects are a bit silly but overall it works. And the eye candy isn't bad either! Not as much skin as found on True Blood but given the channel and audience, it is enough. My only issue was with disc two getting stuck on one episode and I had to finagle around with the DVD player to get it to continue playing. Can't wait for season two to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Show!!!","review":"I have been watching \\"Teen Wolf\\" since the first episode aired on MTV.

I love all the characters and especially his young friend. Very well-written series and the characters are all perfect together. I really don't see anything I would change about the show. I would recommend the show to anyone who is interested in these types of programs (I love them and am always looking for something new). I don't like a lot of the movies of this type, in fact, I just watched a movie that I kept seeing at the stores and it was so dumb that I didn't really want to watch the whole thing but I did and now I know for sure that I never want to purchase it.

What is even more amazing is that these dinosaur fossils were actually the largest ever found. Yet they remain relatively unknown due to the stupid efforts of archaeologists and patrons during the early twentieth century when they were discovered. Sadly, this book lacks in that it could be a third shorter and pertain more to the actual subject at hand than going on fictional tangents. It creates a question of what is real and what is not, most important in the study of fossils many millions of years old.Originally published on November 25th, 2002.Go to BookBanter [...] for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is great, the documentary even better","review":"I saw \\"THE Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt\\" program this past summer when I was in England.

The book details alot about GErman scientist Ernst Stromer that wasn't in the documentary, along with many factoids about the dinosaurs. One weird thing -- there's a whole chapter on the guy who bombed the Munich Museum where the original dinosaurs were housed. Huh?However, the book, like the TV show, really comes alive whenever we're with the scientific team from the University of Pennsylvania.

As a handbook, it begins with how to install AspectJ; how to build projects with Eclipse and Ant; and also looks at how to deploy AO applications, web applications and web services. It then goes on to look at basic and advanced AspectJ features and usage. As a side note, the Eclipse IDE provides great visual AspectJ support and is worth having a look at if you are planning on using AspectJ ;)This is a book that a software developer can dip into when programming using Aspects - to find out how to do something; or using the design pattern chapters - how to do it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $","review":"If you're thinking of buying this CD because Sin-a-matic was so dope beware because this is nothing like Louis Logic's first proper album.

J-Love brings some real sh--ty rhymes on this album and the beats are pretty much subpar, aside from 1 or 2 tracks. The song with J-Zone and Celph Titled is okay but still doesn't save this waste of time and money. Maybe there's a reason there are 60 used copies for sale here on amazon, I always see a few in the used bin at my local record store too, thats where my copy went.

The boys tell their vivid stories of what they can remember while the father was emotionally and physically absent. The dexterous Mickey, played ball everyday and is still a very well-known name in the histroy of baseball. This story explains his lief and career while alcohol impacted himself physically, hi gamily, and his life mentally. It also touches base on his career achievements and how he became the amazing Mickey Mantle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea that has no staying power","review":"I read the first chapter online and decided I had to have this book. Upon reading the second chapter, I started wondering what I'd ever seen in the first one. While the book starts off strong, it immediately loses all its charm and is too full of its own cleverness to actually be funny. This reminds me of what Mad Magazine was like after they \\"Jumped The Shark\\" by losing Dean Martin and Dick DeBartolo.Near the end of the book I got a little more interested in the characters, as sort of a vicarious Harry Potter book. This is kind of a tongue-in-cheek \\"What If?\\" rather than an actual parody.I applaud the author for getting this published and also for trying to make an original story, rather than just a rehashing of the first four books, but ultimately this book is just not funny. It tries to be in the same league as Bored Of The Rings and Doon, but fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I bought this book, mainly because I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and while waiting for J.K. Rowling's new book (seems like an enternity) I tried to wet my appetite a little with this book. I really wish I hadn't. I really did try to give it a chance. I didn't laugh once and the jokes that may have been funny, I just didn't get because the writing and spelling were sloppy and horrible. It would have been much better if the person could actually write and form decent sentences. I don't usually give up on books, no matter how bad, but I couldn't get past the third chapter. So, all you Potter Fans, do yourself a big favor and just save your time and money for the next Harry Potter book, the real one and not this rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR KIDS!!!","review":"WARNING--THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR KIDS!!!

It was a meanspirited book with dumb jokes (dirty and otherwise). I liked the Harry Potter books, but even if I hadn't, this is an immature and lame book.

I've read my share of parodies, and I have to say this is the most pathetic. This book is more crude than clever, and has really bad jokes. Its not ment for children. But I was embaressed for it because of its overly sappy ending. Honestly, I think this book was more a fan fiction than a parody, and the author should be very, VERY embaressed. The only reason I gave this even two stars was because it did make me laugh a little before the author got too into it.

This guy is sick.... and, yes, he claims he did keep in mind that kids would also read this piece of \\"art\\", but fails to keep perverted jokes out of it. I'd be pretty [angry] if I were J.K.

The plot makes no sense and the author's sex jokes aren't funny.

I reccomend this book to trolls and Saddam Hussien and that's about it.BUY THE ORIGINALS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny, fun read","review":"Simply put, if you like \\"Harry Potter,\\" you'll enjoy this book. If, like me, you don't particularly like Harry Potter (but can't avoid the hype), you'll enjoy this book.

Definitely check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preety good parody of a awesome series","review":"Michael Gerber is the book equivalent of the Farrely brothers. Just as a Farrely brothers film is filled with un PC humor and jokes about bodily secretions so do this book have it too. But each Farrely brothers movie has a heart ( filled with dirty thoughts nonetheless) and leaves us with a bit of a thought at the end of it. So is it with this book. Maybe there is a really good book there somewhere in Michael Gerber's head. He is having a lot of pun and minting money while doing so. Waiting to lay my dirtied hands on the next 2 books so that I can read them till Rowling writes the final book.Beware: These books are PG13 and in some sections almost R.

While some of the jokes are quite funny, most just fall flat -proving that there really is no joke funny enough to last more than 20 pages.If you're bored and looking for a book to read while waiting for the next Harry Potter to come out, or you're looking for a bit of \\"toliet humour\\" get this book.

The exacting detailed recipe descriptions and technique notes ensure that you understand you are doing fine every step of the way, whether the recipe is simple or complex. A treasure for those who read cookbooks for pleasure; stories are scattered throughout. Although I only make a handful of the recipes ongoing, some are staples in my household and descriptions and techniques I picked up from reading it apply to other books.

In Bird's journey through Iraqi Kurdistan, every town she visited and every person she met reminded me of just how much I miss and love the Kurdish country and people. Bird's analysis is not deep nor is it political for the most part. What politics are mentioned, it seems are designed to pull out and investigate the Kurdish culture and psyche. Having lived among the Kurds, her interactions with them ring true and accurate.All this being said, and what is keeping this book from getting a five star review, is that I found the author's semi frequent (once or twice a chapter) pot shots at American politics leading up to the invasion of 2003 to be somewhat tiresome. If you are reading this book, it is because you want to find out what the Kurds think and do, not what the author thinks about American foreign policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books one worth reading more than once","review":"Creek Mary's Blood informs the reader about the good and bad of the Cherokee life.

No regrets here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tiny Criticism","review":"I agree with all the laudatory things said by other reviewers. I have known and loved this book since moving to DC in March 2002 and take it out every spring just to rejuvenate my soul. Although I know intellectually this book was written in 1947 before the term \\"political correctness\\" was even coined, let alone observed, I notice I am more and more bothered by the universal usage of the masculine pronoun. I also know the English language is awkward and cumbersome when it tries to be inclusive of the feminine half of humanity.

We are about 30 pages from the end, & just can't seem to gather the strength to want to finish it. Unlike The Shipping News & The Accordian Tales (which we absolutely loved), Ace in the Hole is filled with shallow, unlikeable characters (with silly names), rediculous side stories (a CD of songs performed by passing wind???), the obligatory, predictable incest, & painfully predictable plot twists - which adds up to the most boring 384 pages ever put into print.

I have lived in Texas and read about Texas for 70 years and this one was definitely not representative in its NAMES or occurrences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Modern Literature","review":"Once again, Annie has managed to capture a picture of a region. Her descriptiveness is so complete and detailed, yet not in the least boring, that one is drawn back to the book until it is finished. Annie shows real life on the Texas and Oklahoma panhandle, not just the scenery or a few characters, but the entire panarama and the true feelings, emotions and perceptions of those who spent generations in the panhandle.Annie also does something that few authors do as well as she does. She writes wonderful dialogue. But not just plain old dialogue, but dialogue in dialect. To do this with authenticism is very difficult, but Annie does it like it is just another note on the refrigerator.Annie shows a true brilliance for modern day fictional literature and no one who has a love for the genre should go without reading this book, as well as her others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew?!","review":"No modern writer is better than Annie Proulx at describing brutal environments and tragic characters. Who knew she could also present a wry, rollicking work of humor that keeps the chuckles coming from beginning to end? With this joyously fun novel Proulx widens the range of her talents and gives readers even more reason to eagerly await her next offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"I read the Shipping News which I really liked (The movie was terrible) and Close Range which was even better.This book was a loser for several reasons:1) It feels like several short stories strung together to try to make a novel.2) The charcters (especially the protagonist) are poorly developed.3)Charaters and situations are supposed to move the plot along. Here we have a number of characters and situations that contribute nothing to the development of the plot.4) It's preachy. I'm in complete agreement with her about the dangers of agribusiness but I don't need to be hit over the head with it. The CEO of Global Pork Rind reminds me of Mr. Burns from the Simpsons.5) She couldn't decide if she was writing a satire, a novel, or a polemic.I should have stayed away when I saw that the only favorable review they could find for the back cover was from People magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel?","review":"I love reading Proulx's stories. This one felt a bit slow and unsure; but now that I've said so, have to consider that it was intentional. Annie, if you read these reviews, please give us a follow up: I feel like I just read a prequel to an even better novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, boring and mostly depressing","review":"Feed lots, chicken farms and hog farms are the source of meat forthe modern America. Bob Dollar has a bad childhoodand actually finds a home among the back Texas panhandle people.He sort of backs into it. Trying to buy land for hog farmsfor a multinational company.The writing is very good if the action is mighty slow( and pretty much reported second hand).I've been telling people for years that they will call this era,the plastic layer: Bob's uncle is a second hand dealer and a plastic collector. The closest thing to an interesting character is Orlando, Bob's best friend, who has a taste for old B horror movies.It took me several weeks to finish this novel;I finally just gritted my teeth and read it!It is not Annie Proulx's best work by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try audio!","review":"I've greatly enjoyed Proulx's earlier books but was lucky in this case to get the audio version of it. It's not a great book by far, not one of her best, but it has a wonderful sense of place.The audio version is read by Arliss Howard who gets the accents just about right. A book which might have seemed a bit overwritten on the page (the reason for a four-star rating) is great good fun when read aloud by an actor as deft and humorous as Howard. I'd warmly recommend listening to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wished for more","review":"This story is clumsy and confusing. The main theme of the story about Bob Dollar and his job to find land for a hog farm in the panhandle should have been interesting, but it was not. There were far too many characters introduced in the book who really had no place in the story. The book failed to tell a coherent story about the geography and history of the panhandle. Some of the writing was quite beautiful, I wished I could have understoond it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Environmentalist pamphlet in hardcover","review":"This is not a novel. It is a political tract, the platform of the Green Party/Sierra CLub fundraising letter, with no characterization and less plot. Unless you are already a diehard lefty, it will have nothing to say to you. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late history of the Texas Panhandle","review":"The story drags as it informs. Hard to continue it, hard to quit it. One learns partly where the settlers came from, Germany, but not where the others came from and where the Panhandle got its religion: Puritans and Fundies. The sense of place and characters is incredible, as if one were there. I think, if you want to understand the mentality of a bedrock Bush supporter, then simply read this book. One should in addition read Larry McMurtry's \\"Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen\\", which tells more of the earlier story of the settlement of the Texas Highlands (we rarely drove through there in winter without facing an ice storm, and the remaining grasslands in that season are incredible to see). In particular, McMurtry explains why women of the earlier generations of the Panhandle 'did not talk'. By the time Proulx got there, they couldn't stop talking.Ok, ok, 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it some time","review":"Unfortunately, this book really doesn't get interesting or have much of a plot until almost two thirds into it. But those characters...they are all so alive. I've laughed outloud and some of the uses of the english language and reasoning of these folks from Wollybucket! Puts a smile on your face even if the plot isn't super think. I say that without trying to sell it short, there's a message in there and it may be diffrent for different folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"an enjoyable read","review":"Pleasant reading, includes lots of interesting characters, and the book drifts along enjoyably.

I am from the panhandle of Texas, so it was interesting to see the characters point of views about the challenges this region faces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"This book paints a vivid portrait of the Texas Panhandle - the scenery (breathtaking), the weather (unpredictable), and especially the people (strong, eccentric). It tells the story of a young man who goes to a small farming community in the panhandle to find land for corporate hog farms (hog farms are highly unpopular among the locals). During his stay, he gradually becomes part of the local community and he begins to get a sense of what he really wants to do with his life. The local characters that inhabit this story are absolutely delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't seem like the same author","review":"I adore every one of Annie Proulx's works of fiction. Except this one. It is little more than a series of short anecdotes, almost none of which rises to the level of any of her previous writing. The main character, whose sole reason for existence in the book is to drive around and listen to people talking, is as flat and dry as the Texas panhandle she writes about. The storyline of his inner conflict about his job and the issue of pig farms never really gets into second gear. This would be okay if it was written with the same unique and artful use of language that is the trademark of Proulx's writing. But it isn't. After the striking, monumental beauty and passion of her Close Range stories, it doesn't seem like the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"hot hot hot..

I imagine some of the critical hype surronding this film is due to the \\"state of the art\\" computer graphics that were probably impressive back in 1991 when the film was made. The narrator's voice was annoying, to begin with, and the whole thing was shot on video (which, sorry, DOESN'T add to the storyline just because of the television aspect). If you have pretentious tastes (i.e., you read poetry at coffee shops), this might be the ticket but I was very disappointed, especially after reading all the glowing reviews by critics.

I always ask myself if would I read this book again, would I bother, and the answer this time is...yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creole Fires","review":"Well, I guess I am the lone ranger.

Second, let me say \\"Kat, you have gotten better with time.\\" You can definitely tell this is an 'older' Martin book. And though I was torn with the rating - between 2 & 3 I went with 2. And though it might be better than a 2, it is DEFINITELY not a 5 or even a 4. Martin definitely has better out there! I have to agree with the other reviewer talking about the slave/non-slave and marriage/non-marriage issues. And Nicki's constantly planning to run away was so silly- that got old, too. The whole thing got old. I did finish the book and it's not a bad book, just boring. It is actually a good story and being a Louisianian myself (not cajun or creole) I was excited about the theme.

Many things stand out about this book, among them the way MacInnes always seems to find the right location for each scene, the sharp dialogue that avoids cliche, strong characters and the action that is never allowed to become gung-ho as in many wartime adventure stories.

However, after a couple of weeks I noticed that I'd been feeling unuasually irritable and depressed. I figured maybe it was depression or maybe even a touch of midlife crisis. But why did it just hit me so hard and so quickly? So I started thinking about what had changed in my life over the last couple of weeks. All my worries were the same worries I'd had before. And then it occurred to me that I'd started taking the Sleep MD. I immediately stopped taking it and within two days started feeling much better. Coincidence? I doubt it.

I found the dialogue, in particular, stilted and not very believeable. I also could not help being suspicious about all the detail of the sexual abuse by her father--it seemed rather lurid and unnecessary, and I couldn't help suspecting that its main purpose might have been to get readers rather than to convey a feeling sense of the pain the author endured.

For instance with the Jarkov mammoth 1999 and its inherent proof of a moderate climate about 1000 miles from the current North Pole in about the coldest era of the last ice age. Strange things must have happened indeed in those days. The notion of different pole positions will live on.I highly recommend the book and challenge you to solve the riddle.

The history of the Basque people is a fascinating tale, but this book was a dreadful slog. The writing style was too loose and chatty resulting in a narrative which was more of a jumble of anecdotes than a cohesive history. There is altogether too much space devoted to the Franco/WWII years. I did like the recipes and the food commentary. Historians often forget that food is an integral part of a national identity.Perhaps this book improved at the end.

Mark Kurlansky fixes that.The Author correlates the history of this little understood/known group of people, and how they have iteracted with neighboring countries, and how they have helped shape the world as we know it today.Great history book, and entertaining as well.

I had been asked a few times about Spanish history, and found myself quite ashamed not to know more. So I decided to grab a couple of books.My boyfriend and I read it together by night, and although it is quite catchy, and easy to read because of Kurlansky's love for Basque culture, it is amazingly biased. Kurlansky is definitely not a historian, and although it never claims to be history, I wonder what to think about someone who does not give any of his sources.The book is at the same time quite confusing. I knew the story -not the details or dates-, but my boyfriend got lost frequently.If what you want is an easy-reading, then this may be your book. Kurlansky is higly partial, and his history of events is rather incomplete, so in my opinion, it should never be used as a reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sectarian and misinformed depiction of the Basques","review":"As a Basque person, I find this book a poisonous gift. Kurlansky has obviously enjoyed his time amongst us (probably while researching his excellent book on cod) and all that cider at the \\"sidreria\\" has somehow gone up to his head while writing about the Basque Country. With the craft of an experienced storyteller, he manages to put together all the cliche, victimism, and bigotry that is still afflicting us. Ironically, his passionate tale helps to understand why so many people are still today passionately murdered, kidnapped, tortured, and forced to exile.

Again, a foreign party sees the \\"romaticism\\" of basque nationalism , ignoring the 858 victims ETA has killed.Identifying \\"basque\\" with nationalist is denying the history of the basque. Nationalism in the basque country only appeared in the 19th century, heavily influenced by catalonian nationalism. To say that the basque have been opressed throughout history is a lie.But it s very pintoresque to portray them as some sort of heroes ... the ffod is good, the sights are beautiful, but we basques are ignoring the victims, and around 300.000 basques that left the country because of threats , extorsion , and murder on their relatives. Those of us , basque through and through, that do not get a vote there, because we we told to leave or face the consequences.I don t find any of that in the history by Mr. Kurlansky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romantic compilation of lies","review":"Definitely, a fiction novel easy to read: a waste of time if you want to learn about Basques.The book tries to have a historical background but that is manipulated to suit the author extremely biased opinion.

However, this is what the book is, a book written based on the experiences and feelings of one person. It is just plain wrong to classify this books in the history section, and so the title is misleading.The author has taken a one sided, romantic, not sufficiently researched account of incomplete historical events to write an entertaining book that lacks rigour and steps into historical fiction (e.g. the theory that Basques must have discovered America before everyone else but told nobody).My recommendation: if interested about food read \\"cod\\" from the same author, but skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing History of an Inspiring People","review":"Excellent, pleasant to read, informative, and inspirational.

It turned out to be more of a polical manifesto than a serious, documented book on the history and culture of the Basque people and their wonderful country.

They kill people, including moderate basque nationalists (Korta, Goikoetxea, etc) and non-nationalist basques (Buesa, Jauregui, Iruretagoiena, Izaustre, Blanco, Zamarreno, Perdrosa Urquiza, etc.)and are classified as a Terrorist Group by the US Government.Mr. Kurlansky has, through the evil ignorance of a non-basque, at best portrayed a biased picture of Basque history and politics, and at worst contributed to the death and violence of ETA."},{"rating":"1","title":"how romantic, how misleading","review":"as a Baque, I became emotioned through parts of the book.

The sound quality is fantastic and the packaging and notes great .The extras are ok...perhaps Cruel to be Kind the best but I do feel the CD is missing some of the more obscure and interesting of Lowe's work of the period.It's a must buy but may I suggest burning a CD in the original US sequencing of just the original 12 songs to hear what a perfect pop gem Pure Pop for Now People actually was?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and sharp power pop for now people","review":"This album was called \\"Pure Pop For Now People\\" when first released in the United States (with a few minor differences). The phrase \\"power-pop\\" has come to denote an entire genre now. Back in the day, as they say, it was just Todd Rundgren, Jeff Lynne and a few other sugar-coated miscreants. And this guy, Nick Lowe. This album is sublime. Smart lyrics (there is a song about a lady who was eaten alive by her dachsund), great melodies and solid, clean playing. America missed out on this one, Nick deserves BIG credit. Let's give it to him, shall we?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus of cool has risen!","review":"This probably makes me sound like an old coot but this is the kind of album nobody makes anymore.

However, the 'new' book purporting to update 2005-2006 prices is a total ripoff. The title page simple reads \\"Copyright 1997, 4th Printing 2004\\" The \\"new\\" cover, in a different color, includes the words: 2005-2006 Prices. How on earth anyone could publish a new Frankoma 'price guide' in 2004 for 2005-2006 prices, is beyond belief to begin with, but there are almost no changes from the 1997 price guide pages. Either L-W Books, or Gary Schaum, or both is at tremendous fault here. Do NOT buy the 2005-2006 update. You are wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"nowhere near the classics","review":"I saw some reviews putting this new CD in the level of the classics \\"The Curse\\" and \\"Warning Of Danger\\". No way!The songs here lack the urgency of those in Warning of Danger (\\"Ruby Eyes\\", \\"Red Horizon\\") and the grandeur of those in The Curse (\\"Teeth Of The Hydra\\", \\"Destiny\\", \\"Holy Martyr\\"). The album looks like one big song and the vocals will bore you midway through.If you expect to hear classic Omen in this CD, you'll be disappointed. If you're a fan and want to have the band's entire catalog, it's a different story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skampa Quartet is great - the singer... yikes","review":"I honestly did not know what I was getting myself into when I bought this CD. I love Janacek, I love folk songs... how could I go wrong? Iva Bittova! I was concerned that she would have a 50yr old woobly voice, but instead what exists is a thin VERY nasal tone... perhaps she should be singing traditional Bulgarian music! The voice is expressive, just ugly.The recording quality is not very good, either. On many of the tracks, Iva seems to be muffled and in the background of the recording.Really - dont waste your time and money, unless you really would just like to have a recording of over 50 Janacek songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem for any fan of the ROCK to discover...","review":"Mr.Erickson could pen a great tune, that's for sure. Lyrics, music-the whole package nothing short of compelling. Once I heard \\"Cold Night for Alligators\\", I was hooked. It's no wonder that great bands such as The Hellacopters and Entombed cover songs from the Erickson canon. If you're looking for impassioned rock and roll, you really can't beat this. Check out the tune \\"Anthem\\"-an acoustic based number, the feeling and power Roky is channeling cannot be ignored. I envy those who saw these songs performed in the flesh, for many of these selections were derived from different live shows between the late 70's and early 80's. This would have received 5 stars, but in being live, the sound quality in some areas is lacking-but should by no means prevent it's purchase.

The idea of the book is great, complete with kid-attention-grabbing \\"peeing all over the floor\\" however there are a number of details in this book which are kind of disturbing and not well-chosen. In one place the dogs discuss whether or not they should bite the new baby and in another place they consider the idea of burying (presumably alive) the baby in the backyard with the bones. Uh huh. There are two parts that will make anyone who has been affected by SIDS or who is just concerned about it VERY disturbed: In one picture the parents are depicted using an extremly unsafe sleeping environment-- both parents are asleep in their bed and the mom has the baby asleep on her stomach. In another part one of the dogs climbs into the cradle and is practically smothering the baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some pluses, but they don't outweigh the drawbacks","review":"Not highly recommended, but the book has some nice pluses. First, I generally find that lift-the-flap books keep little ones interested when you are reading to children of different ages. The book also counts backwards rather than forwards. My mother-in-law, who sent the book, is a teacher and has said that children are unable to count backward from ten to one when they enter school. This book nicely counts down from 7 with 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 more egg to go. However, the language in the book is nothing to write home about: I could create a more compelling story line. So while the lessons of learning to count backward can be appreciated by an adult, the kids are disinterested in the text after only a few readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter nonsense","review":"...Although there are exceptions, In reality most Jehovahs Witnesses are extremely well educated in scripture and are happy balanced individuals.

A biased, unscriptural work such as this is not a book that inspires confidence in the true bible student. If you have a genuine interest in spiritual matters then I feel that prayer would be a better method of seeking truth than that of a man who clearly has his knowledge based on his own understanding, which I feel is written more from the point of view of an embittered man rather than that of someone who has the humility, patience, love and understanding of a true Christian"},{"rating":"2","title":"Especially...","review":"Especially poignant is Carruth's poem \\"Marvin McCabe,\\" the story of a man who loses his power of speech in a drunk-driving accident.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading the description on the case I'd had high hopes for this, but was sorely disappointed. While I did slog through it, only because I was doing other things while listening, I was not impressed. The premise was interesting, but it was a bit coarsely presented and really, frankly boring at points. The only thing I did like were Newton and Ellis's religious theories.Newton's behavior in the book reminded me Sherlock Holmes a little too much, with Ellis as a faithful Watson.While I did not hate the book I was not impressed and cannot recommend it. The reader, John Lee, however, did a very good job with the reading, making what would have been intolerable better. His reading really set the tone for the book and brought it to life in its time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better historical mysteries.","review":"In spite of the length of the book, it did read quickly, probably because I did a lot of skimming. Kerr's detail of the period is fascinating and well researched, but the characters of Ellis and Newton seemed a parody of Watson and Holmes and lacked any real depth. Even though you were aware the author was trying to make the dialogue appropriate to the period, it came off stilted and awkward. There were descriptive sex scenes which seemed gratuitous. As one who enjoys historical mysteries, there are many better choices than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Interesting concept but poor execution.

It was a tedious read, seeming to require a written list to keep track of the characters. The ending was incoherent, with all sorts of loose ends left dangling out there.

Grafton has not done her homework! 1)Little houses, even the newer ones, did not have showers in 1953; only wealthy people had such luxuries, we ordinary folk had bathtubs, only. 2)Television sets could not be carried into the schools for all the kids to watch; they were much too large and too heavy, besides they had to be hooked up to an antenna on the roof! Schools didn't have such things in 1953 (I went to school in Calif around that time.) 3)Don't get your \\"panties (or undies) in a wad\\" was not colloquial phrase in those days. It is much more recent. There are lots of other \\"gaffes\\" but those three stand out.

Some said she was murdered by her husband.But for the not-quite-seven-year-old daughter Daisy she left behind, her absence has never been explained or forgotten.Now, thirty-four years later, she wants the solace of closure.In S is for Silence, Kinsey Millhone's nineteenth excursion into the world of suspense and misadventure, S is for surprises as Sue Grafton takes a whole new approach to telling the tale. And S is for superb: Kinsey and Grafton at their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Sue Grafton's books are always terrific and this was no exception.

But when the culprit was finally revealed, I was left with a huge HUH?There weren't enough clues in the book to make you connect the killer to the crime. Because of that, the book didn't really come together nicely for me and was a waste of time as I had carefully followed all the subplots and paid attention as I usually do in a mystery book.Sue Grafton really got into a lot of lewd descriptive sex scenes in the book, which was more I have noticed in other books in the series. I could have done without the sex scenes and would have liked a better coherent satisfying plot line instead.Too many unanswered questions and a letdown for me. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"S is for Stop","review":"I've loved Sue Grafton and Kinsey Milhone since \\"A\\" but a little less lately. I only finished this book because I was on a long flight to South America with nothing else to read. Could the dialogue been just a little more cliched, the characters a little more flat, the denouement a little more disappointingly presented? Grafton can do much, much better. I wonder where her editors were on this one. After so many novels in the series her desire for experimentation is understandable, but she seems a little bored. I hope she gets her mojo back; I'm going to be very cautious about purchasing the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent kinsey M. mystery","review":"I enjoyed this entry in the ongoing saga of Kinsey Milhone, PI in Santa Teresa, CA in the mid-1980s. Mostly, I'll admit because we used to live in Santa Barbara, in the 1980s, which is the template for Santa Teresa. The last few books weren't so interesting to me, but this one had an interesting story and fascinating characters. Kinsey is asked to review a 40-year old disappearance of a woman's mother. As she searches for the truth, the chapters flash back and forth between the present (1986!) and what actually happened in 1953. It is well done and I enjoyed this light reading. We will all boohoo when Ms. Grafton reaches Z, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best Effort!","review":"\\"S is for Silence\\" is part of the Alphabet Mystery Series by Sue Grafton. The silence is the death of a hot blooded young mother/wife/woman named Violet Sullivan who disappeared with her dog and a new car on Independence Day. Her daughter, Daisy, cannot find closure on this cold case over 34 years old. She was just 5 years old when her mother disappeared. Some think her father did it, some think Violet just ran away with another man. Daisy needed to know and hired Kinsey Millhone a female Private Investigator to see what she can find out in 4 days, if anything.The book gets tedious with detail and flows back and forth in time to 1953. A Japanese Robe that Violet wore is mentioned and you think it is key to the story. The best part is a surprise in how she disappeared, which is more than half way through. However, the ending was disappointing and did not make sense. You finish with \\"Huh?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"S\\" is for Sex","review":"I have read every book in this series and this is the only one that has dissapointed me. While Grafton retains her terrific skill setting a scene, all of the other enjoyable trademarks are missing. There is no interaction in her personal life other than a couple phone calls and a quick hello. She included about six chapters written in first person by the suspects and players in the crime - which naturally adds no addition to the investigation since Kinsey doesn't have this information. Grafton doesn't need something this sloppy to add to the tone of the book. Addtionally, Grafton leaves out the trademark closure chapter we have all come to know and love. Lastly, if I wanted graphic sex scenes I would have purchased a romance novel. We made it from A-R without them - why start now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"**SPOILER ALERT**** disappointing","review":"I usually like the Kinsey mysteries.. as a matter of fact, I buy them in hardcover as a treat to myself. Today, I spent all day in bed reading it. (It's a ritual for me.) But I was disappointed in \\"S\\". When I got to the end, I was thinking TOM? WHO THE HECK IS TOM? And I thought the idea that he was going to bury Kinsey in her car was just a little too much silent movie drama. And this is too bad because I really really look forward to my Kinsey stories! I'll try again with \\"T\\". I guess I am just stubborn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I have resisted reading any of Grafton's ABC books because I thought they would be hokey since the titles are.

Readers are left guessing until the very end. A good mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but still good","review":"It ain't one of the best, I suppose it can compare to John Grisham in my opinion. It did keep me thinking about what happened to Violet and I was quite sad at how it turned out, but I suppose I already knew what had happened. The ending was interesting and I loved the plot. First book I read from this author and she made a pretty good impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grafton's characters are becoming more real - -","review":"Some popular writers get kinda lazy I think - but Grafton's characters are becoming more real to me as the series winds on.This is a very enjoyable tale and as some of her characters were teenagers when I was I found the description of the life and times very realistic.The last chapter also seemed to copy her formula of having at least part of the book with characters (in this case Kinsey and the perp) behaving in a totally illogical and unbelievable way. I can't imagine why Grafton needs to do that - in this case it seemed that it was - 'well this is the last chapter and I only have 20 pages left to spice the book up and finish it' - a huge disappointment. But I'd still recommend the book - and I wish she'd taken the needed several chapters to bring it to a realistic close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Kinsey?","review":"As a reader of all of the other Kinsey Milhone books, I am very disappointed in this last effort. Without Kinsey's wonderfully entertaining friends, her romantic entanglements, her business travails, and her problems with family, she seems to have no personality whatsoever. The characters created for this mystery are very ordinary and mostly unlikable. With Kinsey acting as a simple narrator, there is nobody to identify with to make the story engrossing. I find that I simply do not care about the fate of the woman she is searching for. The other books were always read in one sitting. This one I found I only kept reading out of love for previous books. If this were the first Grafton book I had read, I would never have gotten to the others. Please Mrs. Grafton, bring back the real Kinsey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"S is good","review":"Sue Grafton is a smart writer. I got hooked a long time ago.

Every reader wants to know why he committed such a heinous act. If it is greed, greed is too simple for this book because everybody is greedy in one way or another. Please, next time Grafton, let us in on the reason for a person's demise, especially if you have the audacity to take us back 30 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"felt compelled to read but mostly disappointed","review":"I too have read most of Graftons series and have enjoyed the lively/comic nature of her main detective character. But I found her to be very shallow and cold to read in this book. I applaud the author on trying a new way to tell a story so as not to become stale, but the \\"person who did it\\" was totally boring and a let down. I had to go back and read parts of the book to remember who he was. I really didn't like the ending, I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A struggle to read","review":"I have loved the alphabet books....till now. This book is slow moving and the constant back and forth between times is irritating. I honestly didn't for a minute care what happened to Violet.

Very very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"S is for Silence","review":"I have read all of the books in this series and have enjoyed them, until this one.

This one was a quick, easy, and entertaining read. The new format in which the reader gets to read the thoughts of each character/suspect was effective in keeping the suspense going. The fact that the death had occurred thirty-four years ago was interesting and the flashbacks added to the intrigue. Kinsey Millhone, as usual, is an entertaining heroine, who, thankfully, is not without admitted flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"S is for Semi Spectacular","review":"Sue Grafton's writing is mesmerizing. S is for Silence was less satisfying however than some of its predessors. It was touching, and enthralling, but....it had none of the personal insights that some have had....AND I would wish to know so much more about our heroine/detective Kinsey....But...it certainly gives us a careful insight into a small town -- microcosm of all our towns -- the people who live and inhabit our neighborhoods...and proves AGAIN that human beings all have similar traits...and similar loves...and similar experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what and who cares","review":"I've read all of Grafton's novels, and they vary tremendously in quality. Of the past 6 books, I'd say 2 were really good, the rest mundane.This one is the latter, easily. As I read the books and learned about the the characters, I thought \\"so what\\". As I read the end, I thought \\"who cares\\".The sentence structure is short and overly simple. The book is indicative of the \\"dumbing down\\" of American mystery literature in the case of many authors, where the publishers are getting writers to script to the lowest common demominator in reading circles. Just compare this book to Elizabeth George to see the difference in good versus very weak writing. When I finished \\"S\\", I moved immediately to start reading the first book by John Morgan Wilson - after one chapter the difference was crystal clear. I'm moving on to Wilson's 2nd novel and am not caring much about Kinsey's future after being an avid fan of Grafton in the E and F days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Sue Grafton really write this book?","review":"I have read every book in this series from the beginning and have enjoyed most all of them. This book has no relationship to the series, is boring, hard to follow and appears to be two different books that have been combined by alternating chapters, Book A is chapter 1, Book B is chapter 2 etc. I missed everything that is Kinsey and the Alphabet series. I would not recommend this book, don't waste your money if you are looking for a good Kinsey mystery this is not it. In fact, this is not a good mystery of any sort. The ending was like an after thought just plucked from mid air and dropped in. Frankly I do not believe Sue Grafton wrote this but must have hired a Ghost writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groundhog Day","review":"I eagerly awaited this novel. I have read A-R. Some are better than others. Maybe it was my anticipation, but this one disappointed me.Perhaps if it had been 100 pages shorter-why are so many books and movies currently on the just too long side-where are the editors. I felt as though the same information was repeated over and over and over again like in the movie Groundhog Day. Slightly different twist in each retelling, but not enough to make me eager to steal away and sit and read. Even the killer was disappointing to me.I did not find any new or evolving information about Kinsey in this novel either. I love a series' book that continues to evolve and sculpt the main character of the series. I really did not find any new info here. And most of the usual players of the Milhone series were missing or mentioned so slightly in passing.I will continue to read the series.

Grafton has also dropped the quest for finding the lost relatives introduced a few books back.If this had been \\"A\\" there would have been no \\"B\\" for me. This was a very pedestrian mystery and a very boring Kinsey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I just finished this book. As a longtime fan of the series, I am so disappointed in this one. Kinsey is normally a great, strong female character. But she repeatedly does the most stupid stuff in this book. She acts more like those females in the horror movies that are so oblivious to danger and walk right into it. I spent the last quarter of the book rolling my eyes as she did one stupid thing after another. There are too many plot points that just disappear or are never explained. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best!","review":"Unfortunately this is not a great book. I have faithfully read all of the \\"alphabet mysteries\\" and have enjoyed them all. This was a struggle to get through. Way too much description and detail, and way too much jumping from \\"then to now to then to now\\". Hopefully \\"T\\" will be back to Ms. Grafton's better writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"S is for \\"shabby\\"","review":"I am sorry to see Sue Grafton digress from what kept me reading her series. Mainly her character Kinsey, whose charm and quirky personality kept the books alive. In this latest book, I would describe Kinsey as boring and depressed. She portrayed little joy in the job or her own life.If this is the path Sue Grafton is going down, \\"S\\" Is For Silence is my last read in her series."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAAAAWN!","review":"This is the first Grafton book that bored me to sleep. 'nuff said.Please, please return to your old style and not bore us to death with things that are detailed to the max, when these things deal with matters in the 1950s and 1960s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worst one to date**spoilers discussed**","review":"I've read every single one of the Kinsey Milhone books by Sue Grafton and I have to say I can barely finish this one. I decided to read some of these reviews since I'm having such a hard time getting through this book.I don't care for the flashback chapters at all. I find them distracting and wish Sue Grafton would stick to her usual storytelling.Now that I've read a spoiler or two I know I'm not going to finish the book. I can't read anything with cruelty to animals and when struggling through the first chapter I got a bad feeling about where the story was going. One of the reviews I read confirmed this.I totally agree with another reviewer who said how implausible it was that people would still be around and working at the same places 34 years later.I used to love reading Sue Grafton's books despite the overuse of her favorite word \\"tuck\\" but I think I'll stick to the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I too preferred earlier books with more developed characters. I also question if it is the same author, and if so, is it a new release of a very old book. There were way too many new characters and relationships to keep track of and resolve satisfactorially, especially using a Kindle (harder to flip back and forth)."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE ending","review":"This book was \\"character heavy\\" - good heavens, I had to go back and reread several chapters to remember who was who. And, this ending is terrible - much too abrupt and insufficiently explained. I never did get exactly why she was killed!? After all the heavy character discussion, why not have a good ending telling WHY, WHEN, and HOW Violet was killed. And what did the dog have to do with anything? I was very diappointed and felt let down by the ending. Also, I'd have liked a little more detail about the lives of Liza, Daisy, and Tannie after the murderer was discovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine was missing a chapter also!","review":"I actually appreciated Grafton's new style of going back and forth in time. I understand she is trying to explore her potential while being stuck in a 26 books series contract. Still, I found that I kept wanting to skip to the end of the book. After finally making it through the whole book, I was very disappointed in the ending. Spoiler Warning - How could he have been the murderer? He supposedly had been her lover long enough to give her the dog?!??! Yet, Grafton spent a whole chapter making it clear he was the only guy who never tried to get in Violet's pants (the character's wording). That was just one of the loose (or downright conflicting) ends. I made my husband promise me he would not let me read T is for ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome mystery!","review":"Wow! Sue Grafton really gives a great mystery in this latest Kinsey novel. The way the story weaves and gives out a little more and a little more info. as it develops had me constantly changing my guesses about the outcome. I loved the flashbacks to 1953. Some authors seem to have a hard time creating a wide range of characters and making them seem life like, but Sue Grafton does a fantastic job here. Interesting turn of events at the end. I too felt the story ended rather abruptly and I would have liked more questions answered. None the less, an excellent addition to a wonderful series (my favorite of any mystery series around!). As usual I wish the next one would be available already so I could pick it up and continue the series immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most intelligent book in the Series","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. The story moved between current day and nearly 30 years ago, however the flashbacks were handled very well. Flashbacks are very difficult to get right, but Grafton aced it.The relationship between the 14 year olds reminded me how difficult it was to be that age and at that time. Violet was not a particularly likeable person. She was multi-faceted, frustrated by her life and desperate for change. I didn't empathise with her, but I could understand her need for escape.I never guessed the murderer until it was revealed. There were a few hints but there were also many red herrings.Sue Grafton has developed a more sophisticated style, now aimed at the more intelligent reader than the early books in the series.It a book with a feeling of redemption, understanding and forgiveness and the possibility fo new beginnings for old relationships.Sue Grafton spends time writing her books and it shows. This is as superb novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Case Classic","review":"Sue Grafton rarely dissappoints us, anc in S is for Silence she gives us a beautifully crafted \\"cold case\\" story with plenty of suspects and plot twists. If only she had given us more of Kinsey. I understand a writer's need to stretch, and Grafton did a great job of showing off her story-telling talent, but I realized that I read this series for the comfort of knowing the regular cast of characters. I'm hoping that \\"T\\" brings us back to Santa Theresa."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think she has hit the Patricia Cornwall problem","review":"I read this book on CD. I think the author has hit the Patricia Cornwall problem for me. This is where the first few books are really good and then they start getting really poor. I finally gave up on Patricia when she ran out of gas. I now feel the same about Grafton. Going to have to move on and find someone fresh again. This book simply was not good, left too much undecided and simply ended with a lot of holes in the plot. Good luck on \\"T\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"S is for Silence","review":"Another great Kinsey Millhone adventure.I love listening to these books on tape. The reader Judy Kaye is wonderful, the story is exciting to start with, but I think the author did a great job in picking out someone so perfect to read her books. I feel like I know Kinsey myself. Another terrific mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, a good read.","review":"No more than I would expect from Sue Grafton. A good mystery with a familiar character in Kinsey Milhorne, what is different though, is the switch from the first person to the third person in the past. Grafton carries this off well and it doesn't detract. All in all a good entertaining book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I highly recommend this book.

I can get some good out of nearly every book, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to Operate Consistently","review":"This unit fails to operate consistenly unless the rubber button cover is pressed in exactly the right spot. The manufacturer needs to re-design the button cover or make it from plastic, metal or some other rigid material so when pressed the cover contacts the concealed button underneath hard enough to activate the doorbell or chime. It is a nice looking unit but we have missed many visitors at our door because it simply didn't activate our chime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice quality Wireless Button","review":"This is made the way a wireless button should be made.

Indoor use does not work very well. The signal does not bounce as expected and does not appear to help signal strength within a residence. The unit is very directional and does not send a signal very well through normal building construction. You need to mount this unit outside to get best results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working like a charm!","review":"I'm guessing my two antennas are about 200ft apart. One is outdoors and one is indoor. Just put it to work and I'm super excited. I ended up getting (all from Hawking): 1 HWREG1 Wireless G Range Extender on the receiving end (not sure if this was needed, but got one just in case), 2 HiGain Directional Antenna, indoor/outdoor, 14dBi HAO14SDP and 2 HAC10N 10-Feet Outdoor Antenna Cable. Ended up being a bit more expensive than I thought. Also paid $60 to a handyman to go up on the roof to install one of the antennas and drill a hole through the wall for the cable to get to the router. Just got it to work and it's working great, almost same speed as I get on the other end. I'll update this review with its performance over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hawking Antenna","review":"I am not that excited about the Hawking Directional Antenna.

The antenna was in clear view of the camera. I kept losing packets so the camera was to choppy. I read that they recommended that I should get two antennas. That was not an option for me because of the location.Tech support was overseas and it was a joke. All they said was that this is a good product that usually doesn't have problems.There is no way to see if it is even working. No lights nothing...Maybe two antennas would work better.

Its been pretty consistent. This is one of the two finest disks in the series, the other being Arnaldo Cohen's electric contribution. Gekic is a Yugoslavian pianist, with a mesmeric sense of colour and an indefatigable technique. He plays the infrequently recorded Rossini transcriptions. The Soirees are individually quite slight, but they have grace and charm. La Danza is well known in its original form, and is presented with tremendous bouyancy. The final Soiree, La Marinari, has a convincing feel of apotheosis, a sense of repose beyond the storm. It raises the curtain superbly on Gekic's overwhelming version of the Overture, which is played variously with charm, terror, and, in the final gallop, a hellbent abandon. Gekic has all of the glittering technique of the finest Russian pianists, but couples it with an uncanny intuition for the work's soul. This is a most rewarding disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backpack sprayer","review":"This sprayer works great big jobs. It is much easier to carry 3 or 4 gallons as a backpack than 2 or 3 gallons on a single shoulder strap. Being able to pump up the preasure as you work rather than having to set the sprayer down to pump up the preasure is also easier and allows more uniform preasure over the whole contents. It helps to have a waist high shelf to set the unit on so you can just step into the harness rather than lifting it up onto your back. The unit also comes with a variety of spray nozzles for different applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two seasons","review":"2nd change: I have a large piece of property that I have used this sprayer on over the last two years. I have found the pump action to be a bit jittery and requires a lot of pumping to keep up the full pressure.Tried to start it up on the third season, and it would not work.Cleaned everything out and still does not work. For $140.00 a sprayer should last longer than two seasons without a major rebuild. Note: Total disassembly showed that the two major washer/seals had failed, so parts on order; Cost for seal parts $147.31 for a $140.00 sprayer (Don't I feel like a schmuck, I could have had a new sprayer for the cost of a few seals from SP). If you don't require 70+psi, go with the Stanley/Chapin sprayer (60psi) at less than 1/3 the price, it also has a full manual and you can pump it when sitting on a flat surface. (Better design, less money!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOOK MA NO LEAKS","review":"The SP2 Sprayer works very well and does not leak from the bottom seal [as advertised] I have had the pleasure to spray several gallons of different organic herbicides and insecticides through the SP2 and have been very happy with the performance and ease of use.

I have retired my old one hander."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first try !","review":"This review is probably a bit premature but here goes. I was impressed with the SP-2 when I first received it, the way it was designed and put together. After assembling the few pieces necessary to make it work I tried pumping with the handle without results. So i read the different fixes and with a gallon of water to simulate a normal liquid I tried again without any results. I really would like to make this unit work as I think it is a better designed unit over the box store models so I got a return shipping label and sent it back to the shipper and hope to get a better working unit in the near future. Hopefully I will be satisfied with the replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I had a previous model, I think it was the estate keeper, but was sold under the RL Flomaster name. I had it for 2 1/2 seasons and broke it at where the trigger and hose connect. Based on cost to replace, I just bought the SP2. I love it! Great pressure, super comfortable, short pump stroke and am confident it will last a long time. I spray chlorine products and always run a gallon or two of H2O through it after every use.

I went to the dealer's website and followed the instructions, oiled everything and had to get really ruff with the pump handle (just like they told me) to get the pump to break free. It finaly did and started working for about 3 hours, then it quit again. I worked another hour trying to get it going again, no luck. I drove 15 miles to the hardware store and bought a Stihl, it works great, much better than the SP and almost half the price! The SP Dealer is clearly aware of this problem, they say it is common for this to happen. The way I feel is if you are spending this kind of money the product should work. I am going to try and send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sprayer","review":"I have had this for several years now and it still works great.

This album is not like any other country Christmas album...twang, fiddles, and steel guitars should not be expected here. You do get, however, an instrumental(Noel Prelude), a medley(Carol Of The Bells/O Come, O Come, Emmanuel/Silent Night/Joy To The World), a poem/explanation(Christmas Thoughts), and even a little doom and gloom(It's Just Not Christmas). Silver Bells is the best version yet, and We're Here To Love comes from the album Keyed Up and can be found on youtube, along with a few others. But the absolute highlight(besides the medley)is O Holy Night, which seems far from country; it has very little to no country element, and is very orchestratic!

His flow is almost really annoying to me and I cannot stand his lyrics and religous views and how he views the United States. He basically lives here but hates our country. Okay then leave.

A great quote for this review. I've been a fan of Wu & affiliates since the 90's. This isn't an album I would ever reccomend to anyone. It's poorly mixed and Cilvaringz isn't a very talented artist. Also if you are American a song called \\"Death to America\\" might offend. Don't get me wrong I'm open to opinions but I love my country. Artist I would reccomend are Bronze Nazareth, Hell Razah, Sunz of Man present... Hell Razah & 9th Disciple & Killah Priest \\"The Offering\\".

But I will note this to the director, if you were trying to avoid it being a kiddie flick, you should have come up with a better title, maybe it should have been called The Guy Who Isn't There, or The Hollow Guy.

I like the music of DMX and Nas, and that's what they should stick to. I can appreciate them trying to branch out and do other things, but neither of them has the requisite talent or presence to act. Every tired cliche is dragged out and splattered across the screen, set to music. The highlight here is Malik Hassan Sayeed's cinematography, which looks great as usual. It looks even better with a great director behind it (see \\"He Got Game,\\" \\"Clockers\\"). And to the idiot who said he wishes Pac were alive to play the role DMX has--Pac would never do anything this bad, buddy. Pac did some bad movies, true, but at least they were coherent."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Film is Better Than I Expected","review":"While some acting is bad, some is exciting in this movie directed by Hype Williams. DMX is on fire for this being his first movie and while Nas is obviously meant to be a rapper, he also does a pretty good job. The supporting cast is really good although T-Boz sounded a little fake in some scenes. The Jamaican druglord is probably the best character in this film with the exception of DMX, because he's so dangerous and he smarts off even when he's taking on an entire hit squad by himself.--Main point= Belly is a film for fans of urban/gangster flicks and this one definitely is one of the better ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Hip Hop Story","review":"A classic true hip hop story.DMX can play this role perfectly and Nas is a great supporting actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Unexpectedly Good Movie!","review":"To be honest when I first opened this one up I didn't really hope for much...but the opening scene (UV reaction and that song!) really pulled me in, I wasn't sure what to expect but as the movie progresses you get more and more mesmerized by it!I wont ruin anything about the movie except for the fact that alot of people will probably pass it by because of a hate for rap and/or hip hop, however this film really shines and shows some of the real ins and outs of loyalty, respect, and friendship!The Blu Ray transfer is a pretty nice step up from the DVD copy I also own, as expected colors are bright, and characters have excellent skin tones...will very little grain or motion blur.Sound is personally my favorite part of this movie, from the hard hitting hip hop soundtracks, the movie sounds and dialogue never suffer or become hard to hear!This movie is definitely worth a look, you have nothing to lose, don't miss out on a great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES i'VE EVER SEEN","review":"Belly was one of the worst movies i've seen in my life. Nas' acting was enough to make me want to turn this thing off after 5 minutes. Its a shame cause this movie looked like it had a lot of potential. I'll give Hype Williams credit as the way the movie was filmed was intriguing. It looked like a long music video. It couldn't save the movie, though. DMX comes off as unbelievable in his role as Tommy, who is supposed to be a soulless, evil as hell type of guy. I recognised his girl, Keisha in the movie from \\"A Bronx Tale\\", and she is mad FINE. Anyway, I would think that even the most die-hard DMX/Nas/Method Man fans are going to have trouble watching this movie. There isin't much of a plot, the acting is terrible and I fell asleep twice.

I don't know if it's supposed to be a black Scarface or what, but it's really bad.Rappers are not known for their Oscar-worthy work, and Nas and DMX are no exception. DMX has charisma, but he needs to work on remembering he's reciting lines, not rapping.I love T-boz, but she needs to stick to her day job.Taral Hicks is a good actress, but her talents are wasted here. I don't buy her as a bad girl.I know The Godfather was an inspiration for Hype, but his attempt to give the movie a dark tint backfired. He made it too dark. Everytime I see the movie, I mistakenly think I'm looking at a bootleg or something.Hype should start over in film by directing material written by someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty cheesy","review":"Big fan of Nas, but this moive's a bit over the top and have some good messages that suffer because of it.

He seemed a little too sluggish/apathetic toward his character and though that might be how he is in real life it really didnt do much for the movie.The scenes go from here to there without much explanation. You really got to watch it more than once. If you aren't braindead you can capture what is going on. But it does confuse a little bit your first time...Other than thoose two arguments this movie is exeptional. DMX was fantastic. I thought method man was great in it. Some of the characters are really cool because they are unordinary.The special edition part is pretty much retareded. It's really not that special.But belly is a good movie! My fav.s include \\"Juice\\", and \\"Bullet\\" and I recommend these movies if you like belly. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depictive of life in the Ghetto","review":"This movie was great due to the fact that it shows what life really is like in the so-called \\"Ghetto\\". It shows the endless crime and reality of the New York Streets. Even though its a fictional work, it depicts fact. Places like East New York Brooklyn, and the South Bronx are constant reminders of the Urban War in the streets--and this movie would be a good portrayel of the \\"hood life\\".

The actresses don't even pretend to have been picked for talent...just sexual impression. Every major climactic scene (and there are several) is stolen from some other popular film (Scarface, Malcolm X seem to be the most popular). The plot makes no sense. You can't hear the dialogue half the time. The rare times when DMX doesn't have a blunt in his mouth he's just grunting...I hate everything about this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Bad Acting","review":"The problem with Belly is not the story or the plot it's some of the actors. DMX is sick in this film because he's relating to himself and using it to act. Even Method Man made you feel him and believe his role but there were some weak links. Nas was Ok but he needed some more emotion to make you feel Sincere and T-Boz was the same way but she tried hard. The truth is Belly is almost a perfect movie but some of the actors weren't adding up to this great story. Belly actually teaches you that even when you hit the bottom you don't have to stay there. This isn't just another hood flick just to show off meaningless shootouts and drug deals this movie has a moral and shows you how a man who only knew one way of life chose a different direction when it came to the last few minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belly of the beast","review":"Belly is my favorite movie due to one scene: the scene when a group of men dressed in all black with automatics and beamers run into Lennox's {played by Louie Rankin} (the Jamaican druglord who is Tommy's connection) mansion and tries to kill him; drunk and high, he manages to kill them all with an assault rifle (chrome AK-47) by dodging the beamers and hiding behind walls, but it really gets good when he is lying on the floor killing the surrounding intruders but gets kill by a masked woman who jumps on his back and slices his throat \\"she must be a fan of SOULJA SLIM\\" that is the best scene I ever seen in a movie, although the copied SCARFACE's last scene"},{"rating":"2","title":"it could of been better if it was backed by a better flim co","review":"Belly ;the concept was great. however,the vison hype had was different from what artisan had. this movie prove that hype has the skill to direct a good movie. his visuals prove interesting,each frame look very good.

However there is one thing that I did not like, in some scenes it is much too dark and you can hardly make out who is who. Another thing i had a problem with is the characters names are much too confusing, I mean for people who are familiar with Tommy (dmx) aka bunds,aka bundy; sincere (nas) method man t-boz it is easier for us to recognize their character, but for others who have no idea who these people are might get confused with who is who.

While Belly had the sleek look of Williams' MTV fare, it lacked substance, as most videos do. Also, would someone PLEASE tell these wanna-be actors that just because you sell 1 million records, IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN ACT! The performances of Nas, T-Boz, DMX, and the others are just horrid. I was shocked that Taral Hicks was in the abysmal waste of time. Like many black actresses, here career has gone nowhere fast.

Although my friends love it, this film is as amateurish as they come. Hype Williams made this movie look like an extended version of one of his videos. The plot was all over the place, but the film style looked so good that I concluded that Hype used the \\"style over substance\\" approach. As for the stars, T-Boz should stick to making records because she is not an actress. However, Taral Hicks IS a good actress and singer; T-Boz should take some lessons from her.The only thing I liked about the movie was the ending because 1.) it signified that the movie was over and 2.) DMX's character and the minister play an emotional scene. But DMX and Nas aren't actors, either. Sure, they're actors when it comes to rapping, but that's another story.Hype, making videos and movies are two different things, so think about that before you make your next movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Suprised by this episode","review":"To start this I had read the reviews and this episode sounded like others in TNG and such but I found out it was quite different from any other episode i've seen so far.

I didn't start watching it untill its 5ft season, but i was able to see every episode on reruns before the series ended. The series had the most action out of any star trek series so far and the characters were easy to get to know. I would love to own the complete series on DVD, and i hope it is released soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time they put the series on DVD!!","review":"DS9 was probably the least popular out of all the Star Trek series out there. Most NextGens couldn't get into it, and it was too complex to fascinate the younger generation like the previous two series could. However, if you were one of the few who ACTUALLY gave it a chance, you were rewarded with one of the best TV series ever. It created a story ark so huge that it literally started with series opener and was not resolved until the series finale. The interaction between characters is what really gave the show its flavor though. If you can afford it, pick up at least the first season. If the show isn't your cup of tea, then you ca forget about the rest of the seasons. However, if you give it a chance, you could be drawn into the most fascinating Star Trek series of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical first season of a show","review":"As is true with most shows, the first season of DS9 (seen in hindsight) has the actors groping a bit for their ultimate personality and style seen in later seasons. Some of the interactions (between Odo and Quark for example) seem a bit over the top compared to the nuances seen in later seasons. Still, there is a fair amount of backstory covered in this season that makes the later seasons more enjoyable to watch. In my opinion, DS9 was the first Star Trek franchise to work more on a story arc than as individual episodes that could be watched in any order. The quality of the DVD transfer is not as good as later seasons; Likely they didn't preserve the source material like today's shows. The softness/dirtiness of the picture is about what a VHS tape would look like. Not terrible, but not measuring up to today's DVD standards either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bottom of the Star Trek Barrel","review":"Star Trek in name only.

I want to watch every episode in order. So you have to look carefully at the number of the episodes to notice that ones are missing, but what you might not realize unless you compare it to an episode listing elsewhere is that the season finale is missing for Season 1. Really, what's the point then...?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was in excellent condition and was O.K","review":"I am a deep lover of Star Trek. The first season wasn't bad but the seasons that follow it was better. It started getting interesting when Odo met his first changling and whenever they had the war. However that is not in the first season of which this is. This season is how they all met each other. Basically. And it is whenever they moved to Deep Space Nine. It is basically introducing the characters. There was some really good eposides but I am aware that there are better seasons to Deep Space Nine than the first one.Kristy Star Sisk"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game, Memorable for Season 1","review":"I saw Star Trek: Deep Space Nine every week, when they came out, commercials and all. This is one of those episodes that sticks out in my mind. It's very clever, very sci-fi, alien, and you have no idea what's going on till the end. The only complaint is that they didn't save this episode for later in the series. I would have loved to see Worf sing \\"Alamarain, count to four, Alamarain, then three more.\\" It also has nothing to do with the overall story arc. 4.0/5 stars. ~Keep On Trekkin"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll second what everyone else is saying","review":"I didn't watch DS9 too much when it was on TV, though I was/am a huge TNG fan.

The character development for Kira was fabulous and the actor who played the Cardassian did a wonderful job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love DS9, I cannot lie. All the others, I must deny. Voyager----uuuummmmmmmm \\"What character growth\\"?, TNG----didn't get to launch full steam into an 8th season to really pull together---made movies too fast and well, we've seen the results.But DS9 was complex from the get go, the play on teh Nazi Occupation, the heavy religious overtones. The static situation of a starbase vs. a ship. Captain Sisko being someone who was destined to be there. The crew alone coudl trash any other crew out there. WHat made them so great was that they didn't particularly all like each other when teh show began, there was friction. Friction that was explored and deepened as time went on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek Forever","review":"I love the Star Trek series. I hope that they come out with every single episode of Star Trek in all 5 series on DVD. They did a much better job of extras on DS9 than they did on TNG. One thing that I hope they would do is have a play all for each disk. That way, we could just put a disk in and watch all 4 hours. I know there weren't many people that were DS9 fans.

I highly recommend you checkout Season 3 first (introduction of the Dominion, USS Defiant, beginning of story arcs), but if you are a person who wants \\"absolute, immediate satisfaction\\" (i.e. \\"How many episodes do I have to sit through, before I finally get to see Captain Sisko and Worf?\\"), then I recommend you start-off with Season 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dramatis None","review":"Possibly, why this episode has no ratings is because, it wont play.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the first episode, and how Commander Sisko has to explain linear time to non-linear beings, who end up being, in the later seasons, his mother. Kira needs to learn how to persuade Cardassians to leave, though. They got mad her because they thought she had destroyed one of their ships. Instead of convincing them that they were right, and saying that she would do the same to them, too, she tried to convince them that there was a wormhole right where they had spent the past 50 years, which was the truth.~Trekkie~"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am enjoying it as much as the first time","review":"I enjoyed all the different versions of Startrek and it was nice to visit it again.

The clear cover enwraps the main case. Unlike TNG, where you had to unfold, unfold, unfold and drop something, the DS9 packaging opens like a book. You don't have to unfold anything.Also, TNG had that annoying insert with the cast picture which ALWAYS fell out when I opened the DVD box. Not in this case.The special features are fantastic, especially the Section 31 hidden files. Great touch.DS9 is the most creative and original of the modern Trek series. It seem the designers of this package caught it too.Great job. Can't wait for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality, Depth and Excitement.","review":"Having recently bought Seasons 1 and 2 of TNG, I am eagerly awaiting the release of Deep Space Nine on DVD. I agree with other reviewers who point out the strength of the cast and depth of the plot in DS9. In a way DS9 is starting again for the crew of the station, they have to rebuild much of the stations instruments and try to get to grips with a new set of relationships between Cardassia and Bajor. The senior staff are extreamly well picked, but it is the non starfleet characters who perhaps are more impressive. Garek, Gul Dukat, Quark, Odo and the Kye are all well played by solid actors and actresses.As the programme progresses we understand the crew more and are treated to the Dominion, War, Klingons, Romulans, Vorta, shape shifting and much more. Hurry up and release DS9."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Star Trek Science Fiction Story","review":"I liked this episode. Thumbs up and all that. Probably because I like Star Trek. It's a solid Science Fiction story with lots of depth (and some explosions).

He is the only real actor in the cast. If you like low budget horror movies that were churned out weekly for the local Saturday matinee, this would be one of them. A disembodied dead astronaut's hand goes on a killing spree and somehow(?) takes over this guy's (not Breck - some other actor I don't recognize) identity, whereby, it uses him to carry out it's dasterdly deeds. The movie isn't scary but Breck looks handsome and that was the reason I bought this.

It does have a keyboard but also plays individual songs, is a ball drop and teaches cause and effect. Its bright colored and lights up and isnt tooo loud. One HUGE point with me is, it comes with 4 balls. AND its built to STORE the balls when not in use. She has a FisherPrice ball drop toy that the balls are all over our house because there is nowhere to store them.Now granted, my daughter hasnt had this very long so we have not had time to get sick of the main song but so far she really loves it and is exploring all of the different things it does. I believe this toy has staying power. I just wish it was a little sturdier.

I called the 800 number and they will fix it if I send them $14 (plus the shipping cost I have to pay to ship it to them) - not worth it.

I just love it when a previously tarnished/bad guy turns it around to become the good guy. Even if you did not read the previous titles, I believe this story is a great read as a stand alone.

Jane Smiley skillfully relates her intimate knowledge of the business and it's eclectic owners, trainers, and hangers-on.

Probably horses don't think like these, but if not, no one will ever get closer to them. Besides the clear reading of horses, Jane Smiley reads humanoids with kindness and subtlety. I don't complain that the chapters follow each other in a discontinuous way, and that the scenes shift almost arbitrarily from one venue to another because this book is an overview of a whole milieu. This book tells the reader more about horse racing than a general reader might want to know, but every reader will be enriched by the Smiley's analysis of the characters, equine and otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Smiley's best--by a furlong","review":"I am not an unequivocal fan of Jane Smiley (I enjoyed Moo and Ordinary Love and Good Will, but did not like A Thousand Acres) and I have no interest at all in horses or horse racing.

This book was extensively researched, and a pleasant relief for those who actually are familiar with how the horse industry operates. At the same time, I'm sure it can be understood and enjoyed by those with just a simple interest in horses, rather than a working knowledge. Understandably, the seemingly endless parade of characters can be a little confusing, but it serves a point. In the circle of the horse industry, there is rarely a simple tale to be told of a horse, rider or owner. The dysfunctionally enmeshed lifestyle in which we lead puts us in a clique where everyone does thread to everyone else somehow, even when they don't know it. This work is not a light read, but well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horse H-E-Double Hockey Stick","review":"I was beside myself when Jane Smiley's latest book hit the shelves.

This one is a stinker for several reasons--1) Way too many characters most of whom frankly aren't very interesting. 2) Anthropomorphism; how does she know what the horses are thinking? 3) Too long 4) Dumb plot gimmicks like the woman who can communicate with horses by reading their thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only borrowed this book because it was about horse racing","review":"and I've been a racing fan for about 25 years now. If I could've edited this book, it would only be half as long. Way way too many scenes that did absolutely nothing to advance the plot--why were they there? Cheap thrills? In thinking about this book, and why did I keep on reading it, I'd have to say it was because of the equine characters--they're very interesting and you care about them. The human characters: so-so.

I can underline at least one if not two or three sentances outof every page that contains things that just are not right. She portrays the trainers as uneducated, foul-mouthed jerks who resent the fact that women were ever allowed on the backsides of racetracks, and who view the Owners as the enemy. This may be true of a very few trainers in the industry, but certainly not the majority, and certainly not the successfull ones. She offends me often with her vulgarities, and her \\"romantic interludes\\" are nothing short of pornography. I sent this book to my mother before reading it myself, in hopes of showing her a brighter side of racing and the thoroughbred industry....wow...what a mistake that was. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Horses, Humans & Other Animals","review":"Horse Heaven is insightful, funny and complex. It offers us fascinating equine, human (& canine) characters, & is insightful, funny and complex. It may be best when read aloud for it has, at times, a rambling, conversational tone. Through each character it presents different facets of living and working in the racing world. It has definitely changed how I relate to my animals (horses, dog & cat)-- I \\"listen\\" to them more carefully, enjoy everything about them that isn't human-like, and try to see the world through their eyes, minds & souls, while paying more attention to my own. It is all about connection and disconnectedness, motives pure and impure, striving of many kinds -- also not-striving, just being.

There are a couple of hundred characters (including the horses) most of which one could care less about or even get to know. This is a textbook on horse management masquerading as a novel. I found the first 200 pages or so to be mildly interesting, even a little funny, and then the whole business comes to a halt. It gets mired in you-know-what. Every page introduces a new horse and more arcane horse jargon that you can live without. After awhile you don't know if the author is talking about a human or a horse and what's more you don't give a hoof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough is enough","review":"This is possibly the most boring, uneventful, horrible book that I have had the misfortune to come across. The endless parade of new characters was mind-numbing and tedious. I didn't care about any of them because Smiley gave you no time to get to know anyone, she was too busy adding someone new.

Justa Bob, Mr. T and Eileen seem like part of my life now. (Especially that rascal terrier.) Ms. Smiley gave insight into the racing business and at the end I felt satisfied and held no grudge against any of the huge cast of characters. Justa Bob, Mr. T and Eileen should have stories of their own. Her venture into the stalls of the human minds was thought provoking. Well worth reading if you love horse racing and dogs.

I am on page 243 and I probably will not make it through the entire book. I don't enjoy reading it.

Endlessly tangential, wandering stories, endless characters, and pulled together with the most trite of endings-- the very fact that she required a list of characters in the front of the book to explain \\"who was what\\" says it all. Clearly Ms. Smiley is a major writer, but why didn't some editor have the guts to tell her that what she had turned in was a first draft?

Horse Heaven was Reader's Hell. The writer won a Pulitzer Prize? If it was for anything like this book, the folks handing out the Pulitzers need to be slapped.There were sentences so long and straying, they needed to be broken into separate paragraphs. Characters were so sketchy, it was impossible to care about them. My impression was that the writer collected lots of information about horse racing and tried to cram every incident she heard about, and every type of person involved with horse racing, into one book. The result: a preposterous mess. If it were a movie, it would be 4 hours long, and the critics would rip it to shreds.The main thing I got out of it was the realization I had underappreciated the Dick Francis novels I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL","review":"I have been playing this cd nonstop eversince I bought it.

Often when the examples are worked step-by-step they don't look like the finished product as shown in the book, especially when using text. Overall disappointing.

This is enough reason for me to use this clock only as a reliable timepiece and another as a wake-up system. The other point that bothers me is the projection of the time onto the wall or ceiling. The ceiling is too far away for me to see without my glasses, which I don't wear to bed.

The concept of Thor Being summoned up by the Mjollnir was pretty cool. I thought it was great because Thor was a Viking, and acted like a Viking would. Since I've seen the movie way-back when (and a month ago on Sci-Fi) I loved it. \\"Simple, just call forth the green Troll!\\" Umm...Lou Ferrigno is pimp too, but to reiterate--THOR! My Odin be with you all in the halls of Valhalla"},{"rating":"2","title":"And a big return it is!","review":"I watched this movie the first time it came on TV when I was back in high school. As a die-hard comics fan, I liked the Hulk. A lot of purists blew smoke about the poor rendition of the Mighty Thor, but hey, for the most part they got it right other than the costume. (And some Thor is better than no Thor.) Besides, it wasn't often in the series that Hulkie fought and fought with someone on his level. 5 stars because this was the best of the 3 movies after the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I like the Incredible Hulk Returns","review":"The Incredible Hulk Returns focused on Dr. David Banner continuing his search for a cure years after the original series had ended.

It comes with this great filter, but the filter will eventually get dirty, and then what? I'll have to buy another filter from the same company. We were looking for something that had no filters, and was truly an ionic air cleaner that you simply wipe clean. This purchase was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a GREAT Air Purifier!","review":"I smoke in one room only when I do it in the house to curtail the smokey smell overall, and I also use a smokeless ashtray. I had a smaller air purifier in the room before I bought the HB, and it wasn't all that effective.I definitely notice a difference in the air now with the new HB Air Tower! After I finish a smoke, the smell doesn't linger as long and doesn't seem to carry out of the room as much. The biggest plus is the automatic air sensor. For the most part the purifier runs at minimal level, but it goes in to high gear whenever it senses a change in air quality.I've used this for about 2 weeks now, and will update my review after my first cleaning.I would definitely buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I've had this for about a month. I was first upset because it doesnt run silently with a static grid like I thought 'Ionic' meant. Alright, no big deal, I usually sleep with a fan on for the white noise anyway.So, right away it tells me my air is clean when it isnt. My room has a lot of dust in the air, and it hurts to breathe when I wake up, and sometimes wakes me when I'm sleeping because my throat gets so dry. After a month of running it on high when I'm out and low when I'm in, my air looks just as dusty and it still hurts to breathe in here.To make matters worse, the seller I got it from only allows returns within a few days of getting it, so I'm stuck with this thing that only seems to make a lot of noise. Maybe in time I'll notice a difference, but so far its done nothing as far as I can tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto sensor not work properly, it\`s so Noise train","review":"There are three problem of the product.

We have 2 dogs and 2 kids running around this home, pet dandor and dust galore! You could normally see it in the air at times it was so much (through the sun rays coming in the windows) and now we don't see it nearly as much if hardly at all.

I ordered Medium while my older pants were large. And the pants I got were FAR larger than my Large pants. Both in length and width.I probably would have kept them though if it wasn't for the double-sided glossy mesh fabric. They are two-ply whereas my older pants only had one ply and a cotton-like feeling on the inside. This made them rather uncomfortable and not as flexible, plus they built up an insane amount of static."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, practical but a bit floating","review":"The pant is very comfortable, flexible, light and well adapted to the waist with a good quality fabric looking like it will last a while. The leg part is however \\"floating\\" and run long and large making it not super practical for running either outdoors or on a the treadmill. Especially true for a pant you can buy only in fixed sizes (I wear 32 length, these pants runs a bit longer for a small size) but it does super-well for me for casual wear around the house and exercises not involving running.

Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a newscaster whose life isn't the best, and he keeps complaining that God never gives him any breaks. Thus God (Morgan Freeman) shows up and endows Bruce with his powers, and Bruce uses these powers to his advantage and DISadvantage with hilarious and disastrous results.

After blowing his lid, Carrey loses his job. In despair, he does what mankind has been doing for centuries--blames God.After a day of moping, God (played quite convincingly by Morgan Freeman) grants Carrey His powers. Of course, \\"Bruce Almighty\\" wreaks havoc on his professional rival and scoops the big stories by \\"creating\\" disasters as he pleases.The role of God begins to overwhelm him when he answers \\"yes\\" to too many prayer requests and his girlfriend (the incredible Jennifer Anniston) begins to turn her back on him.In the end, Carrey learns the power of the free will of mankind and learns the beauty of surrender to the will of God.A great movie.

Thanks to Jim Carrey's performance, however, this film is so bad that it's truly offensive. I'm not talking about the admittedly well-intentioned message of the movie or the way that it's portrayed, I'm referring to Carrey's need to portray what I'm assuming is supposed to be a gruff-but-likeable everyman as a vein-popping, physically out-of-control Ace Ventura clone. I don't recall enjoying a single minute of this movie in the theatre, except when I started to imagine Bill Murray in the role (though I doubt even he could have done much with the material here).Carrey can be funny and even likeable onscreen, but he needs a director who can control him, not the other way around (which I suspect is the problem with this film from the get-go). Even his die-hard fans may want to avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"bonus features included mastercard commercial....","review":"I do not consider it to be a bonus feature to get to watch a mastercard commercial (yes, this is listed as a choice in bonus features).What is really irritating with this DVD is that you have 4 or so previews of other movies that are advertised as coming to DVD before you get to the point where the DVD will let you into the menu to start the movie.

Sure there are a couple (literally) of moments that made me chuckle, but none that made me really laugh hard. Previous Carrey movies such as Liar,Liar proved that Jim could still make hilarious films. Morgan Freeman works for me as God, but I cannot see Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston together . . .EVER.

Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a TV Reporter with alot of negative things going on his life.

Jennifer Aniston plays Carrey's girlfriend and she is a great actress for the role.I just wished this movie had been more \\"kid friendly\\". There are many adult situations really not suitable for kids. Including the fact that Bruce Nolan and his girlfriend are sleeping together without the benefit of marriage.

He is one of the only actors that actually makes me laugh. He is very believable in everthing he does and he does it well. However, sometimes it doesn't automatically mean that the movie pertaining to his role will be any good. ie- The awful Cable Guy, Liar Liar, and even Bruce Almighty. It wasn't as bad as the other 2, but it was not that good either. It was barely funny, there were only a couple of really decent sorta funny moments.The story was bland and got very repetetive, very quickly. Jennifer Aniston's character was annoying and did nothing for the film. Jim Carrey sure looked like he was having fun though. His character, while interesting enough, still couldn't really save the movie. Morgan Freeman does a fine job, as usual in his small but important role.If you are looking for effective , funny Jim Carrey comedies, skip this and check out Dumb and Dumber or The Mask. Or, one of Jim's best films out there- The Truman Show."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Theme Mismanaged","review":"We suffered through the first third - a manic, narcissistic romp with an actor who needs to be on some kind of downer. His overwrought style diminishes what might otherwise be a 3 or even 4 star movie. They had a good concept and manage to weave it back in and salvage the story about half way through. Fun if you have time to spare with nothing to do. We had more fun contemplating what they might have done with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good DVD ruined by advertisements","review":"\\"Bruce Almighty\\" is another fine effort by Jim Carrey. Anyone who enjoys his work will enjoy this movie. Unfortunately, the DVD edition starts with four minutes of movie trailers. Unlike other DVD's, this one locks out the controls on your player so that you HAVE to watch the trailers before accessing anything else on the disc. You cannot even stop the disc from playing once the trailers start, except by ejecting it. AND, this happens every time you load the disc.This is unacceptable, especially in a medium that normally allows the viewer such varied control over how a movie is presented on their screen. Because of this bone-headed decision by the DVD makers, I cannot recommend you purchase this disk. Indeed, I would encourage anyone else who has purchased this DVD to protest to Universal about this forced advertising. Anyone who pays full price for a new DVD should not have to sit through unwanted advertising to view their purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny... and more","review":"This is certainly not what you would expect from Jim Carrey. The comedy is of course there. But you can also relate to his character. I think at some point in everyone's life we have all felt as Bruce did. Not only will the movie tickle your funny bone, but it will touch your heart too. Who cares what the \\"critics\\" thought of this (or any) film!

This is not one you want to miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Marketing + Bad Movie = Success","review":"The reason I did not like the movie was because it was about selfish people. Example: he did not appreciate blood drives until he needed blood, or when they prayed to god for things they were lazy about. Also there were so many plot holes it was crazy. For example he didn't have the power to change freewill, yet he made dog go pee in the bathroom, and on Niagara Falls you could see how low budget that movie had. Compositing was so bad; you could totally see they weren't there. Like in one of the scenes sun was on the wrong side of the character as real lighting design hit his face from the opposite side. It's like there were two sun's in that movie. Also all jokes were way old and plot was so predictable. I mean I could go on for hours. I can't believe this movie made 250 million in the US alone. It just shows power of smart marketing. Those are very smart people from movie company.

This one is far different from Ace Ventura and The Mask.Jim Carrey plays a man named Bruce Nolan who is a TV reporter in Buffalo. Along the way, there are a few misshaps that lead him to meet GOD played by Morgan Freeman. GOD gives him his powers after Bruce makes a few bad comments about the way he is doing his job and tells him to see if he can do better.He starts off righting some wrongs in his own life and forgets about other's prayers. There are many misshaps and struggles along the way as he tries to figure out what he is supposed to do. With everything that is happening, there are many jokes and funny scenes that make you laugh throughout the whole movie. For me, only Ace Ventura and Liar Liar are as good as this movie. A must for any Jim Carrey fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Five stars, good movie","review":"Some of Carrey's movies have been pretty dumb but this one is really entertaining and fun to watch. I've seen it a couple of times and will probably see it again. It is more of a \\"Liar Liar\\" type movie than one of his wacky type roles, complete with morality plays and questions of life asked and sometimes answered. Freeman does his usual excellent job of acting and adds to the quality of the flick.I give this one a strong recommendation and think it's worth adding to the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Carrey is back at what he does best!!","review":"This movie brings Carrey back to what he does best, making people laugh.

It might even delve into preachy in parts, but it does have quite a few laughs. It seems that Carey is slowly trying to evolve (or devolve) into a serious actor. I am not sure it is believable just yet. Perhaps a cameo in Saving Private Ryan II is just the boost his career needs.Any movie that is set in Buffalo is a gem. Well exept that one with Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn, uhhh. Also, it is too bad that Carey's charachter did not run into anyone from MTV's sorority house, alas. Of course the most unbelievable part was when the Sabre's won the cup. Talk about suspending reality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most of the funny parts were already shown in the previews","review":"Don't get me wrong, I laughed throughout the entire movie.

It was bad enough on video-cassettes where you had to fast-forward 5-10 minutes of tape, but on DVD you are now forced to watch them (unless you wish to leave the room).

While it did have a scene or two that were a bit racy for young children, overall it was family friendly. While not intending to be a thought-provoking movie, it did provide opportunity for discussion about how our actions have a cause and effect on others and the world around us. Overall, it was funny and fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce AllBoring","review":"I give this movie 2 stars because it is not nearly as funny the rest of Jim Carrey's movies. I saw this expecting to laugh so much, but was only disappointed.I wasn't too happy about the whole concept of \\"playing God\\" in the movie in the first place, but I thought Jim Carrey's hilarous on screen persona would overcome that.

Excellent performances, especially Steve Carrell as a scene stealing anchorman, but why oh why does there need to be a friggin' VISA CARD AD under the \\"bonus\\" features on this DVD??

Same style from Ace Ventura, Mask, Dumb&Dumbmer, etc.If you have a lot of time to waste, watch this movie.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring","review":"This is yet another lame movie from Carey, who got progressively worse after his brief brillance in \\"The Mask\\". Assuming you don't find the script downright sacrilegeous, you will still be left indifferent at its utter lack of imagination and the forgetable acting by Carey, Aniston (predictably so) and even Morgan Freeman as an unconvincing God (althoughg even the real God usually has a hard time convincing us). The two or three \\"good\\" gags you've already seen in the trailer.Strike three for Bruce Almighty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever...","review":"Bruce Almighty is hands down the worst movie ever made. Thinking of all the z grade and direct to video movies out, bruce still easily wins the title. The idea for the movie isnt that bad, you know ordinary guy gets the power of god... with jim carey this would seem pretty entertaining, let me tell you its not...at all. Terribly underwritten, Almighty failed to deliver me with one laugh. Its corny and becomes annoying after about the first 15 minutes when you realize that you have wasted your time and money. Bruce is just a blah movie, its too serious and romantic to enjoy Carey's Ace Ventura like silliness, but its not serious enough to warrent a dramatic Carey performance(which are underrated) Bruce had potential to be a entertaining movie, but is just too annoyingly bland to find any merit in"},{"rating":"1","title":"An EVIL movie","review":"Let me get this straight, Morgan Freeman is God in this movie. Morgan Freeman was on Electric Company on PBS. PBS is the same station that produces Sesame Street. Sesame Street has the devil himself \\"Elmo\\".

Another fine film full of belly laughs and romance to boot!!Carrey plays a failing news reporter who dream of becoming an anchor for \\"Eye-witness News\\" is going sour. Everything in his lifee seems to be taking a turn for the worse until he receives a visit from - God!!! (played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman)Carrey seems to think he can do God's job better than God himself - so God puts him to the test - and grants him his powers.This is where the real fun begins - Carrey let loose on the streets with the powers of God - taking advantage of them by using them against the people that have made his life a misery.Anyone who is a fan of Carrey's comic talents will love this film. Jennifer Anniston is adorable in the part of his girlfriend. Recommended to anyone who loves great comedy - and happy endings!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste","review":"What a waste of a good idea and a funny guy. Jim Carrey with almost Godlike powers, but he does nothing interesting with it. It's like going to Disneyworld and only hanging out at the snack bar the whole time. It's hard to believe anyone in the industry really has so little imagination. Even the old Chevy Chase stinker Modern Problems had more imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced Previews","review":"I do not recommend this or any other DVD distributed by Universal. Universal Studios has a policy of forcing viewers to watch previews BEFORE reaching the main DVD menu. Viewers are unable to hit STOP, MENU, TITLE, etc. This is not a consumer-friendly feature. Universal could easily allow viewers to skip the previews, or watch the previews through a menu option. Instead owners are forced to watch previews and commercials before any ability to play or use other features of the DVD. Too bad, because I liked Bruce Almighty -- but the DVD is worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godly Funny","review":"Bruce Almighty is a great movie. It about a newsreporter, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), that has a bad day a work(gets fired) and thinks that God is punishing him. So God (Morgan Freedman) meets him at a warehouse and tell Bruce that he can have all his powers. Then Bruce has fun with the God powers gets his job back, but sometimes its hard to be God. You'll have to watch the rest of the movie to find the rest out. :)Their are some great parts in the movie like when he gets a monkey to crawl out of a guys butt, when he gets prayers, it saids \\"You got prayers\\" instead of \\"you got mail\\".Overall the story was pretty good and funny. If you want to have some good laughs and giggles, watch this and some scenes are not appropriate with children. hehe.

So God issues a challenge to Bruce: Take my job and see if you can do better. Bruce starts out helping himself while ignoring others, and his quick fix causes chaos in the area of Buffalo, New York where he lives and influences with his God-given powers. The ending is cliched, and there is a major plot hole- Bruce's girlfriend seems oblivious to the fact that some things aren't quite right.

I thought, before I saw it, the Church would have baned it. But I was wrong. This movie was showing you that \\"we may think that we know what we want, but only God knows what we want\\" and that is definitely true. Although God(Carrey) did some things I don't think God would have even thought of doing. I didn't like that. And that's basically the plot of the movie. So he finds out how God has to think and work at his job, and that is very hard. So at the end it was funny, enjoyable, and romantic. Just keep this in mind: \\"Everything, I mean EVERYTHING, happens for a reason.\\" (You'll find that out throughout the movie.)So there is no reason for the church to band it. At least, all of it.Recomended for kids: 11 and up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie I have ever seen!","review":"I think this movies deserves 10 stars and all thumbs up.

Can't wait until it comes out on DVD for my own personal collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUBBER FACE CARREY","review":"This movie is alright I guess, I guess Im used to Carrey adlibbing and making faces all the time instead of acting. He gains some of GODS power and of course uses it foolishly at first. Then he gets the true meaning of life and becomes a good guy. The transfer on my copy seemed a tad soft and blurry sometimes, but the dts soundtrack I used was great. Not too many extras if your interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I wanted to buy this movie very much because I love Jim Carrey. The man cracks me up. I'm glad that I didn't purchase this movie though, because it was not what I expected. I'm very glad that my nephew's friend let us borrow his. The only scenes that were funny was when Jim first got his powers and he started singing \\"I got the power\\" by the '90's group Snap. And when he made the other news reporter talk gibberish. I thought that was hilarious. Other than that, it was not all that fantastic. It did however, have a good moral to the story. So please people, do not go out and waste your money on this one. Borrow it from someone like I did, and judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Over Hyped","review":"Everyone raved about this film, I got around to seeing it finally and am wondering what is the big deal...The special effects are fake looking, too much obvious blue screen usage. The newsman Jim Carrey was competing against for anchorman gave the best performance when he freaked out in front of the camera. Jennifer Anniston also gave a good performance, especially when she was asking God to help her get over Jim Carrey, and that she didn't want to hurt anymore...I can relate to that prayer..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossing into Kentucky","review":"My dad was born in 1921 in the farmlands of Edgar County, Illinois, and the Crossing by Winston Churchill (not the British leader) was his favorite book as a young boy. It is a tale of US western expansion, especially the crossing over the mountains into Kentucky, and much of the story is told through the eyes of a rather wide-eyed young man. I would recommend this book to parents who want to develop a love of history in their children and who want to spend time reading books together -- the rhythm of the author's writing is especially wonderful when read out loud.

Brendan Buchanan has so many different aliases it was difficult to decide who he was at any one time in the story. Ed Asner does the reading, and I wasn't thrilled with his voice, it sounded very throaty and clogged. Our protagonist's aliases are discovered at a cafe in Cancun Mexico, and at that point he remains in mortal danger for the rest of the story, never sure who to trust, even the members of the operations unit he works for. Despite lots of action and plot twists, what I think the story really was about goes deeper: Brendan Buchanan must unmask his own layers upon layers of aliases to discover who he really is, and in doing so, he falls in love, and must admit to himself he is, after all, just one person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why a love affair?","review":"The book, which is really a good old page-turner, has a lot of action.

You don't have to explain me that you're using a damper on your gun to avoid bystanders hearing your shots. On top of it all Buchanan sleeps with a woman. This fact is totally useless for the plot.

I would agree, but add the distinct scent of alcohol and perhaps a little of whatever comes in \\"Raid\\" bugspray.Now with that said, I absolutely love \\"Essential\\" (and so do several ladies I know, one of whom gave it to me.) Essential is fresh and clean, a nice summer scent.Lacoste \\"Elegant\\" is also nice, but has that sort of powdery scent that may not be attractive to the younger crowd.

The factory assembler had pinched the tube when installing the tire and didn't bother to fix it. How did it pass final QA? Otherwise, it looked really good. Too bad it can't be ridden until I can find a replacement tube. Daughter is none too happy this Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"So happy","review":"My daughter loves her new Betty... rides it all the time.

The light on the front isnt real, but its ok for a cool decoration! my friends are always asking me if they could ride it :P its smooth riding, fast, and it comes with stickers to decorate it! i love it sooo much!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"It was a gift for my daughters birthday, the only thing she asked for, and it was a large disappointment. Right out of the box the tube for the rear tire had a large gash in it making it unrideable. This is inexcusable at this price point in my opinion and never should have made it past quality control inspection. The best part is you need to contact Razor and cannot return this to a store if there is a problem, you may want to keep that in mind when purchasing this. I don't think I should spend $250 on something and have to change out the tire before I even ride it, which by the way is a process. You have to remove the brake, chain, etc... Not to mention you have to wait to get a hold of them, they are only open M-F until 5pm PST, just to get a new tire. This was completely avoidable and speaks volumes as to the quality of product they manufacture. I would not recommend this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK!!!","review":"Well I purchased the pink scooter for my 8 year old daughter for her birthday. We charged it, she rode it once....then after being charged again (overnight) it died after 10 mins...charged again(overnight) it lasted 5 mins. So I returned it for another. Low and behold the same thing happened so I just got our money back. By the way she only weighs 60 lbs. Crazy how short the battery lasted.

Called several times got a million different excuses but never a battery. I am not sure how a company can get away with this. So I have to give them the lowest possible rating. Not to mention how sad it made my nine year old. We have just returned the scooter to Amazon and I hope they give us credit.

The battery does not work more than 10 minutes. The scooter cannot go up small inclines. My daughter fail off the scooter because the battery died out.

It takes some practice getting used to controlling the speed, so you really need keep an eye on the child while first riding.

After 10 months the $50 battery had to be replaced, the battery is not covered under warranty. The battery had been overcharged. After speaking with the warranty people and reviewing the paperwork that came with the scooter, we saw that the instructions said to unplug after charging for 8 hours. Obviously, if we had read the instructions the battery wouldn't have been ruined. However, for an item this expensive I think it is unacceptable that it doesn't have an auto shutoff feature when it becomes fully charged. We have purchased two less expensive battery operated vehicles that have lasted for over 3 years and we don't unplug them after 8 hours. Don't waste your money unless you can remember to unplug it everytime it needs charging (which is pretty much everytime your kid rides it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"The kids love this scooter.

However, after three weeks and we still hadn't received the battery, we called Customer Service back. They had no record of our order.

We wasn't too sure if this was worth the money so we prolonged the purchase for several years. Well, mostly because we thought she was too young and now at 9, she's at a perfect age for this scooter. We charged it the night before and it was fully ready by time Christmas morning came. She immediately wanted to take it outside and for some reason, today's weather was on the mild side. She rode and rode and rode and yelled and smiled and yelled and smiled. The only problem or I guess \\"wish\\" I have is I wish it was taller since she's pretty tall for her age.

She is the envy of all her peers and now they all want one too. The only thing I didn't like was that there are no side/rear view mirrors on this model, and I think head lights or reflectors would be great for additional safety precautions. But hers has neither. It goes a bit fast for my liking, (10-15 mph) And we live in the suburbs of Long Island where there are no sidewalks, so she has to ride in the street. I only allow her to ride it up & down the block for now, until I feel she is expirenced and comfortable enough with the speed to take it to her friends house 4 blocks away.

First they told me 7-10 days and I would have to pay for the tire. Even though it has never left my basement. I finally got a supervisor and he told me that he would send it out and I would recieve it in 3 days. 5 days later still no tire and the company is closed for the holiday.

Customer service offered 2 new batteries since I called within the 90 day warranty period (mind you, one was purchased about 2 months before Christmas). Customer service said if I accepted the new batteries, I couldn't return the item.We took them back to Walmart.

I feel it was too expensive for the amount of enjoyment she had from the scooter. We also purchased a Razon dirt bike for our grandson which worked for all of one day. Razor did replace the broken part but this excited child had to wait for 10 days before being able to ride his dirt bike again.

OK, the actors are all extremely good. Alas, taken together, I just felt like I was wasting my time watching this, like it was too silly to believe.

Sure, there are a couple of quirky moments here, yet the plot is substandart, the directing is weak, the characters are not likable in the least and the acting shows signs of competence still isn\`t all that great either.

John Cleese's script gives the bulk of the laughs to Americans Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis. The charachters played by Cleese and Palin mainly play as straight men for the wild antics of the 2 Americans. Cleese gets in some great lines here and there also such as the quote above that I'm using as the title for the review.Kline won the Academy award for Best Supporting Actor for this role of Otto and deservedly so as he is just wonderful in all his scenes. Curtis is equally strong as Wanda and one of her best parts right up there with Ophelia in \\"Trading Places\\" and the 2 Brits play their parts well also.Little tidbit - the name of Cleese's character is Archie Leach which was the real name of Cary Grant, who was certainly no stranger to great comedy himself.

Newer releases may be better quality.--------------This film is definitely on my top ten list of funniest movies of all time, with \\"Some Like it Hot,\\" \\"National Lampoons Christmas Vacation\\" and the Monty Python masterpieces...But this DVD is atrocious. The soundtrack is all in the center channel... haven't heard anything worse since I gave up watching a TV with a 3 inch speaker. The theme song is burbled and warbly. There is no separation -- even to the front speakers. The dialog is flat as a flitter.The picture quality is a hair better than off the air, rabbit ear antennae reception. At times the picture is choppy and halting -- as if you were watching it on a rental video that has been viewed too many times.The only extra is the film's trailer.Wait for a re-release before buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Call This Movie Stupid","review":"Michael Palin is the anti-PC, stuttering, animal rights activist, thief, and doggie hitman.Jamie Lee Curtis is sexy (of course), devious, loveable, and a manipulation mastermind.John Cleese is, well, John Cleese.Kevin Kline won an Oscar for his work as a philosophy-reading/mangling, live-fish-eating, ex-CIA thug named Otto.There's a plot involving stolen diamonds and plane tickets to Rio, but, really -- who cares?

If you have seen the movie, you know about the hysterical complex chain-of-events that enable Otto, to knock Archie Leach unconscious in his own home after arriving to apologize to him.I thought Michael Palin's character, Ken, wasn't that terribly funny through most of the picture. But even he has a great comic payoff when John Cleese bursts in on Ken, demanding vital information, and all Ken can do is stutter while Cleese waits with uncomfortable patience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest movie of 1988","review":"I laughed until I almost fell out my seat.

Jamie Lee Curtis is the only entertaining actor in this very mediocre movie. It's just too ridiculous to keep your attention from the very beginning in my opinion. It has a very poor plot and really centers around Jamie Lee Curtis' character using her body to get her way and men who drop 50 IQ points around her.

Last night I finally opened the package for the first time and tried to watch it and the disc wouldn't even play. Started stuttering in the opening scene and never got better. After 5 minutes of the movie stuttering and jumping around I finally turned it off. Very aggravating.Thinking it might be the DVD player I got out my old DVD player that I'd recently replaced with a blu ray player and tried to play it on that one as well with the same result.Bottom line, the disk is defective/poor quality.

This is because it isn't really \\"Pythonesque\\" in its humor, but Python fans will enjoy seeing John Cleese and Micheal Palin in different roles. I love this movie because the plot twists and turns; you never know who's going to end up with Wanda or the fortune until the very, very end. It's so well acted, too. Kevin Kline deserved the Oscar he won for it! You'd never guess Palin didn't have a stutter in real life, he acts so well.

So, the next day, I coughed up another $4.00(!) just to see it again (remember when going to the movies didn't cost a friggin fortune?). Having this dvd permits me to laugh whenever I'm down or grumpy. Cleese, Curtis, Kline and Palin (with the world's funniest hair-do ever) just worked so well together. The direction was well-paced considering the several subplots. And the transfer from video to dvd is crisp and clear. I know everyone else (with any sense of humor) reviewing this movie is lavishing the same praise but I don't mind repeating them. This is a band wagon worth jumping on."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Riot","review":"This is an hilarious motion picture. The cast is marvelous. Jamie Lee Curtis is outstanding, as is Kevin Kline.

The electronica is well crafted and nicely detailed. The songs are all good, some will most certainly become Todd classics although only time can tell which ones those will be.My favorite songs (so far) are 'wondering', 'god said', 'stood up'.

How someone in 2004 would make a record like this simply bewilders me. Ironically, the production is terrible. It is hard to tell if any real instruments were used. All sounds emanate from like... a cheap casio keyboard. It sounds like a non-commercialized, poorly produced \\"Thompson Twins\\" record... but without the hooks! I saw Todd in West Palm Beach and the concert also was bad because all he did was play extended versions of these very self-indulgent songs. This music is indicative of the bad Todd music from the past rather than the Something/Anything, Mink Hollow, Wizard a true star Todd. Remember when Todd whould do a really weird 30 minute song on his albums from the 1970's? Liars is like that but without any of the good songs. I challenge the positive reviewers.

Flannagan) who witnessed the failure of society to do something about wayward youth while working as a jail chaplain, and heard the call from G-d to become part of the solution, instead of sitting on the sidelines and complaining about the problem.For some, this film may seem mawkishly sentimental and altruistic,but its simple message rings loud and clear today and must be heard by all---parents, educators, mental health professonals, policy makers; There is no such thing as a bad boy (or girl).In spite of being in black and white, and in spite of involving a religous figure, this film's message has wide appeal and has stood the test of time.The message still applies today."},{"rating":"2","title":"You GOTTA by this for the subtext!

The premise is interesting, but as another reviewer noted, too much explanation. The main character is unrealistic and dull -- too perfect, too wise for her years, and uninteresting to watch, reading more as a wish-fulfillment character than a real protagonist.While I didn't find Ms Canavan's first trilogy the greatest thing since sliced bread, it was more engaging on the whole -- the main character had real obstacles, and not all motives were displayed from the first appearance of each character, so there was something to compell further reading. Not so here."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great start to a trilogy","review":"Based on my experience with Trudi Canavan, I immediately expected for the book to be great. What I was surprised at was that it was almost a different type of writing style from the Black Magician Trilogy. Often writers fall into the habit of maintaining a similar writing style throughout their books, but the similarities ended in that it was just another good book. The book itself is written well, and you find yourself sympathizing with various characters, or despising others, and it's in a way that makes you think it's what Canavan intended you to feel towards the character while she developed them. I was caught unawares when the book ended, and expected there to be more. I can hardly wait for May when the second book comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept reading, hoping it would get better...","review":"Such a disappointment after the BMT.

Absolutely shallow characters and overtly childish reasoning and narration completely spoils this book. This book is certainly not for you if you are an avid fantasy reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading the Black Magician trilogy I had high hopes of Trudi Canavan's new series.While her first series was interesting and well paced - this series I found to be completely different. The writing style is very different and I found myself getting bored with all the descriptive text which at times was very unnecessary. The leading character is very dull and I can't seem to make a connection of caring what happened to her as I did with Sonea.This book is overall a hugh disappointment and if you loved the Black Magician Trilogy then I would suggest you think about hiring this prior to buying - just so as you don't feel like you've wasted money.My opinion - stick to the Black Magician Trilogy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better.","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author, and I really liked most parts. Some parts were a bit plodding and stupid (IE, why would a character like Auraya do what she did in that particular situation?), but overall, the result was a good book.

I will be looking for more books by this author, either second hand or from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another first-rate book from Canavan","review":"This is an interesting clash-of-cultures novel, with almost all of the POV characters being from one of two sides (the White, who follow a set of five gods who they believe are the only survivors of a war among gods a few centuries past, and the Dreamweavers, who think all gods are nasty sorts who want to keep humankind in subjugation), but with the third side, the Pentadrians, gradually emerging from an apparent mist of evil to become a set of followers of new gods who may or may not actually exist, but who are probably not any worse than the ones worshiped by the White. Certainly there are enough moral ambiguities drifting around at the end of the book that I want to read the rest of the trilogy to see whether there's any real good-vs-evil conflict, or if there are just different opinions as to which gods are worth following (if any)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Priestess of the White","review":"The White, a group of five immortal magician/priestesses seek only the good, to bring together an alliance among all the human and non human beings they serve. Naturally, this does not please the evil beings in the world, and they want to overthrow the White. The dark ones are lead by a mysterious man wholly committed to his vile purposes. Standing against this is Auraya, a courageous young woman who once saved her village and thus earned a place in the White. She does not believe herself to be a leader, but finds herself called upon so to be. As violence erupts around her, Auraya finds unusual allies and hidden strengths in herself to use in this war.** This sweeping fantasy is marred by many things. Point of view shifts take place constantly, making focus difficult; and the entire thing feels rather padded and top heavy. Epic fantasy is a tough genre to do well.

When I use this product frequently (like every-other day or so,) it does a fine job. But if I haven't cleaned the tub in over a week, it doesn't quite cut through the soap scum. I end up using the scrubbing bubbles, and having to have the vent on in the bathroom to get rid of the fumes before I dare to take my little girl in the room.I would say that this product is good for light cleaning, or a single person, but it isn't up to the task of heavier jobs, or multiple-person families."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formatting is waaaay off","review":"The information in this book is awesome so do yourself a favor and buy the hard copy.

In the end though, this is the book you want to start with. It wont' give you everything, but it'll get you going in the right direction and you'll be able to patch up your knowledge in the areas that matter to you with other sources.Much of the beer brewing literature is technical and has a decidedly pessimistic tone (as in, if you do this, it's wrong; if you do that, it'll fail; you must do X and Y). Beer is not my first culinary adventure or my first into the world of things that require culturing microbes. If the procedures to make the stuff were so incredibly rigid, we never would have discovered it in the first place. So what I like about Papazian's book is his carefree attitude: just try something, and if it's not perfect, it'll be better the next time.That's basically what you need when you start brewing, and Papazian's book stays decidedly on target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great !","review":"Old , out of date , very hard to read.

I'm not sure, but it is very close to be it. But, can't top the Dio years. But that is logical, cause NOBODY CAN TOP DIO! But about the album. Good hard rock album. My favorite songs are: 'Wolf to the Moon', 'Ariel', 'Black Masquerade', 'Hall of the Mountain King' and 'Still I'm Sad'. When I saw that 'Still I'm sad' was on the album, I thought that it could never be better then Dio's live version. But, its very good. I like it as much as the live version, its just different, but that is a good thing. Well, I don't have anything to say more. I recommend that you buy this cd, and enjoy it. Very good music, surely 4 stars worted! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Slips a Notch on \\"Stranger\\"","review":"Ritchie Blackmore's guitar playing is consistently top-notch on this album; unfortunately, little else about the album is. Where did Blackmore find these guys? The lyrics are childish, the vocals amatuerish, the drumming high-schoolish (I cringed when I heard the overly busy drumming in \\"Still I'm Sad\\" which ruins a potentially decent song). The opening cut, \\"Wolf to the Moon\\", ranks right up there with the best Rainbow songs ever. The rest of the album has some moments, due to Blackmore's playing, but is pretty much forgettable. It sounds like a highly polished professional guitar player playing with a high school band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of a great gig","review":"This is a strange assortment of the artists that were on the Stiff records label in 1977.

I must admit that the main and sole theme of Lamont Johnson's A GUNFIGHT is very good. Two aging gunfighters decide to make some money by organizing a public shootout in a bullring on the other side of the Mexican border.The problem is that you can't present a 90 minutes movie with only one idea. OK, there is another interesting scene in the film: the arrival of a young gunman in town, played by Keith Carradine, who wants to kill one of the old pistoleros. But if you like shootouts, the definitive movie about these duels is of course Samuel Raimi'sThe Quick and the Dead. In conclusion, A GUNFIGHT is a curiosity whose screenplay should have been given then to an Italian director. It typically develops the kind of theme one can find in the spaghetti westerns of that period.A DVD zone my Cash back, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth the effort","review":"To be fair, the product does not claim to be an air conditioner. However, it does claim to cool 12 degrees cooler, which I didn't find at all. I live in a dry Colorado climate, and still it is barely cooler than a fan. You have to fill it with tons of ice to even get that, and it requires refilling with water and ice often. If you don't clean it at least once a week, it starts smelling really bad.All this effort of refilling and cleaning is not worth the 3 to 5 degrees cooler you get. For that, I'd rather just plug in a fan and not have to worry about it every day. Save your money and buy a portable air conditioner. It's worth the extra investment, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evaporative Air Cooler Fan","review":"This portable evaporative cooler fan is easy to use.

There was a timer to turn off the machine with pre-set time from 0.5 to 7.5 hour that was quite useful. We adjusted the fins of the machine so that the air blew at the level of our bed and swung around. One thing we did was to lower the air speed to medium as to reduce the noise level. In fact the noise level at high speed was much lower than those window intake fans however, we need a more quiet environment during sleep. We turned on the ionizer. We could feel there was a little different smell. It was OK with me but my wife did not like the smell so we turned it off.

It works pretty well when you first get it (well, except my first one which was DOA) but over a few weeks to a month, the nylon cloth inside that's supposed to wick water down becomes totally unusable and covered in bacteria/mold/salt as your water dries on it. Eventually it becomes so crusty and gross that it's not cleanable. I tried cleaning it for two heavy duty cycles, by itself, in a brand new washing machine, and it still didn't absorb any water. Since then I've gotten it to work pretty well using an old cotton t shirt.Still this thing isn't worth the trouble, and it really is more like a super fan instead of a substitute for an A/C.

It broke a ten year drought between albums, though still picking up pretty much from where they'd left off with \\"Perspective\\", one of their most underrated albums.The second half of this album is not as strong as the first, but the first seven tracks are all as good as anything they'd ever done before, so that is entirely forgiveable. There's not much wrong with any of the other songs either. Dewey Bunnell shines throughout, his \\"Sleeper Train\\" and \\"Whole Wide World\\" recalling the glory days of \\"Ventura Highway\\". He collaborates with Beckley on my two very favourite tracks though, namely \\"Young Moon\\" and the glorious \\"Garden Of Peace\\".Sadly this album failed to find its audience, but if you missed it when it came out it's not too late.

The only question here: The unnecessary and unimaginative remakes of the two oldies but at least they are performed very well.<>The next chapter in latter day America history is a sad one however.

This thing kept draining the batteries while turned off in storage. Now, my Neiko caliper is dead, something is blown inside the circuitry after only a few uses. This same junky caliper is sold under several different brand logos. I keep learning my lesson over and over again to avoid tools Made in China. Now I'm buying Japanese made Mitutoyo 500-196-20 as a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Value","review":"I am mostly satisfied with this device. It seems to be easily accurate enough to serve my needs, and it is easy to use.The only reservation I have is that the cover for the battery compartment slides off too easily, often while I'm trying to make a meaurement. And the spare battery they send you doesn't stay put in the little indentation in the foam in the case, so every time you open the case the battery is floating around somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caliper A","review":"As I spent over $300 on the first digital caliper I purchased, with the price of this unit being less than the shipping, this is very functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This caliper is a great value for the price, It arrived quickly and came with an extra battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a converter now.","review":"Basically you get what you paid for.

With trying both batteries included, the readings are so innacurate it is not even funny, the wheel is not smooth, and the lock screw affects the position of the jaws when tightened.

First time in all my years with Amazon that I need to return something to them, process was painless though: kudos to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"or no stars.. but I was hopeful","review":"I really tried to like this new micrometer. Looks good, decent packaging but when it comes down to it - what good is a micrometer if it doesn't measure accurately? At first, I got the measurement I expected from a known item. Let's say for the sake of example it is 1.70 inches. Every time subsequent to the measure I'd get a +.2 - even after resetting to zero and turning on, then off and resetting - whatever it took - but to no avail - 1.9 - every time. I could always add the difference - but what's the sense right? Sorry Neiko - get it right or stay out of the measurement business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice caliper","review":"It is heavy built with stainless steel. It comes with a case and batteries. Easy to use an zero right where you want it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another 5 star review for this little jewel","review":"For the price, this digital caliper simply cannot be beaten. It's handy, accurate, and well-made. Admittedly, it's a small caliper (6\\" maximum), and that means it's only useful for small jobs, but isn't that the whole idea of using a caliper to begin with? It comes with a sturdy hard shell case, two batteries, and an instruction sheet (not that you'll need it). I use this more than any other caliper I own. The SAE to metric in one-touch feature is more useful than I thought it would be, and the display is easy to read, even in conditions that are less than ideal. It doesn't seem to be overly sensitive (if at all) to dusty workshop environments, either. I've owned it for over a year and am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the money - you can't go wrong","review":"I still don't know how they make these calipers for 15 bucks. I ordered this because I needed a metric caliper for a job I'm doing on a motorcycle. I did some quick tests last night on some metric shims of known thicknesses. Since these calipers only go out to two decimal places on metric mode it's hard to tell exactly how far off they are. My 2mm shim measured 1.99 mm on the calipers. A 2.5 mm shim was 2.49 and the 3mm was 2.99 so it's \\"off\\" but it's off the same no matter what you're measuring. So with my calipers I know to add 0.01 mm to whatever I'm measuring. For 15 dollars you can't beat this!! If you break it so what, go buy another one. Now as far as longevity, I'm not sure but for occasional use I don't see it being a problem. The case is nice too, I'm very impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy for the money","review":"For the money, the caliper is a decent buy.Resolution is down to 1/1000\\" with a \\"5\\" that shows up in the bottom right of the screenwhen you're \\"in between\\" thousandths.Understanding this, I'd recommend this to a friend requiring an inexpensive, medium accuracy gage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great calipers for the cost.","review":"Sturdy metal calipers, just what I was hoping for. Came in a black hard-case w/ extra battery and small desiccant bag. LCD screen is encased in black plastic, though you may get blue. (observed both in product images) Again, better product than was anticipated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital calipers","review":"Although inexpensive this set of calipers has the look, feel and performance of much more expensive instruments. I have purchased inexpensive digital calipers in the past and they just didn't have the right feel. Even worse, with one set, it was forever skipping and slipping so you were forced to make a lot of readings to get one that was close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it suppose to do.","review":"Just got done reloading 100 rounds of .308 and this calibrated and measured perfectly to length and width. Highly recommend it. the only con I could mention is at the bottom it has a guide rod that is pretty pointy and jabbed my self with it a couple of times, no big deal not a worth a deduction imo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 weeks","review":"Worked great for about 2 weeks then the LCD went bad. It's unable to take a measurement because the display shows random values, does not zero and doesn't turn off. The only way to turn it off is by removing the battery but since it's broke I don't care. It's not worth the time or money to return for a replacement. Go buy one from Lowes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, glithcy, dead! On a budget? Stick with analog!","review":"I didn't want to spend a lot on calipers and bought these based on the good reviews. They worked fine right out of the box, but then the battery died after the first few uses (despite the auto shut-off). The second battery included was dead before I even used it (not surprising). After trying several different batteries, the thing never worked again. Getting them fixed will cost as much as I paid for them.My advice? If you don't want to spend a lot for reliable calipers, buy analog dial calipers and skip these cheap, glitchy electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you money","review":"I had high hopes for this tool, but it is disappointing me every time I use it. I don't know if it is just the one I have or all of them, but mine only seems to give semi correct measurements if the temperature is greater then 60 degrees. I've changed the battery's, taken it apart to clean it, with no change in performance. It will start working eventually, and only reliably for measurements under 2 inches,after that it goes nuts. From what I can tell almost all of these digital calipers are made by the same company in China, so other than spending the extra cash for a good Japanese set, I would just get a descent mechanical one, which is what I plan on doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"smashed on arrival","review":"This item was smashed and it seems that it was smashed before it was put in the envelope because there are missing parts that should have been in the envelope if it was smashed in shipping.

Worked fine at first, right after purchase. Then I didn't touch it for 3-4 months and when I went to use it again, the battery was apparently dead - half of the digits did not illuminate. Kind of strange, as I expect my electronic items to maintain battery charge for a few months if I am not using it. I thought \\"fine, at least these guys provided a spare battery\\", replaced it, and tried again. Now the display was bright, but the electronic measurement was WAY off. Sometimes it would measure too little, sometimes it would end up at 500mm when I moved it maybe 25mm. That's not how it is supposed to work. I am not going to bother with replacement/warranty as this is a fairly cheap item, and it will work fine as a caliper, just not in the digital way. But I am quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead","review":"I've had this caliper just over a month and now its dead. I swap out the battery which still didn't resolve the problem.

The on/off button does not operate and thus needing the battery removed to turn it off without draining the battery.The inch/mm scale selection switch nor the zero'ng switch did not work either. A stick-on label on the back with conversion table was glued on crooked.There is NOTHING about this item of quality. It's junk.

First, it's an english translation from French, and gives the reader another (very French) point of view. Second, it gives descriptions and nice pictures of many breeds most in the US have never seen.Just a warning, before you fall in love with some rare breed after reading about it once, keep in mind they will be expensive, and the popular breeds are popular for a reason. I have seen many of the European breeds in action, and some of the descrpitions in this book must only describe the best of the breed, on it's best day. Many are very generous, particularly if the breed originated in France.It's a nice reference and I get it off the shelf frequently when I have my dog friends over; my neices and nephews enjoy reading \\"that book with all the dogs\\" as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPC Part in an ACDelco Box","review":"I was a little hesitant to order this since I wasn't able to find any reviews online for the ACDelco part.

Nora Roberts, under her JD Robb pen-name, writes a series that continues to grab me as it pulls me deeper and deeper into this wonderful couple's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of turns and twists","review":"This book is not as good as the other JD Robb's books.

Lack of turns, twists, and spices. it's too bad, I love JD Robb's previous works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seduction In Death","review":"I loved this story, as is the case with all J.D. Robb In Death books. Susan Erikson is wonderful; the different voices she uses for each character is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Keeps Getting Better","review":"Please read the first 12 in this series before reading on.This read really relies on characters well established in the previous books. Buy them, read them, they just keep getting better and better. The core characters are vital to the interaction of the main characters, Eve, Roarke and Peabody. You do yourself an injustice going into this 13th book not knowing the full dimension of its reoccuring characters. The interaction, the play on words is so well established book after book. If this series ever ends, I for one, will be VERY depressed. Can't wait for #14. Thanks Nora."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Eve Dallas mystery...","review":"NYPSD Liutenant Eve Dallas, her billionaire husband Roarke, and her 'Scooby Doo' gang return again. Through a poetry chat, young women are being wined, dined, raped, and murdered. The women were all young, single, and in need of a modern-day 'Romeo'. But what makes this crime different is that there appears to be two killers, working together and taking turns keeping 'score'. Eve herself goes undercover as bait to 'seduce' the poet and catch the murderer. Through the book, Eve's usual gang appears and aids her on this new case. Peabody and McNab make up (in a wild way), while Mavis and Trina help *redecorate* Eve. Once again, Robb (aka Roberts) creates a delightful mix of romance, mystery, and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"this boat is very fun to operate some details break off easily but nothing effects its preformence i recommend this to any one who likes boats"},{"rating":"1","title":"Three-legged dog","review":"This hammer is great!It is well-balanced and hits hard.The side-strike feature and the magnetic nail holder work very well.Handle replacement(if you ever need it!)will be easy.The head shape is very good also.Excellent side nail puller.Why,if I love it so much,did I only rate it 3 stars?The claws on this hammer are,at best,[unacceptable]!If you would like to hollow out a log canoe this is your tool.I have beat ... many a board when trying to pull walls around.The indented waffles are passable.If this hammer had Estwing type claws it would be the best framing hammer ever.I had to downgrade my rating because the handle broke in less than 2 weeks!I will buy a new handle and try it again.Right now I'd spend half the money and buy a Stanley Fat Max!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOW MADE IN CHINA!!","review":"NEED I SAY MORE! come on guys how hard is it to make this here.

I love this hammer so much that I even called Douglas to tell them in person that their 23 oz framer is great, but the claw is the worst I've ever used for almost everything. It's too fat. If the hammer had an Estwing claw, I'd bronze it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Bought this for the NYPD Blue theme after listening to several MP3 versions that didn't sound the same. Unfortunately, the theme on the disk also doesn't sound exactly like the one at the start of the show. It is close, so kept listening hopefully. Then to my dismay, started hearing vocals that aren't heard on the TV version. Don't know if the TV version is abbreviated or if the vocals were added for the CD, but they really detract from the main theme [IMO]. Since this specific track was the reason I bought the disk, it is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lure into satanicism","review":"My Review may differ from others, but this is not innocent entertainment. Philip is feeding kids lies about satan and God. He is teaching Kids to rebel against their parents and authority. He is lecturing them in principles of satanicism.Phillip is blinding them to conform to the way of the world. This is horrific! These novels may start as simple story, but they then he sows into them witchcraft and wickedness. Please do not read these books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is evil","review":"Please read this book before letting your children read it and then you decide whether it is acceptable for children to learn how to summon demons and keep a door open to those in the underworld. If you can only read the last chapter, it pretty much tells Mr. Pullman's goal in this trilogy. He wants our impressionable children to know that witchcraftery is good, and that they should also keep their powers a secret from others. He also states on the last page that Heaven is not a place to live for but that they can finally just live for today (the here and now). I only rated it one star because I had to, to submit a rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demon-possessed kids anyone?","review":"Mr Pullman has created a truly insideous work that glorifies Satanism and undermines the source of purity in our world. Unfortunately this book has captured the imagination of many young people who are oblivious to the concepts of worldview and the schemes of a corrupt author.Parents should strongly investigate this series, considering the author himself says that Satan is actually an advocate of wisdom and freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized thought","review":"My main problem with this book is that it left too many things unexplained... like if God was dying, then what was there before God? The ideas that were put forth in the first two books led me to think that the author would have some magnificent explanation and ending. I was severely disappointed. The book was not cleverly written; the author seemed to be able to form the beginnings of a story but could not take us to a satisfactory conclusion. It was an irregularly woven tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows.","review":"I used to think there were some major flaws in this book, but I have found that most of them are actually meant to be symbolic or examples of character driving plot.His Dark Materials as a set are easily among my favorite books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"What a fabulous book! Definitely my favorite of the trilogy. So well written and intricate. The ending was bittersweet, but made a lot of sense. It left you hoping for a 4th book or an epilogue of the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreakingly Lovely","review":"I was enraptured, I practically drove around just for an excuse to keep listening. The theme of Lyra & Will's love is so beautiful, and so heartbreaking. And I was deeply touched by Pullman's portrayal of death -- it happened that I was listening to this as my dad was dying, so I'm sure that lent poignancy to my experience.By the end of the story I was crying, even sobbing - could make for dangerous driving!My kids & wife & I listened to the first 2 books together and I continued to this one myself. I'd read the books, but found the audiobooks to be far more compelling -- the story came alive, and the detail of the writing was so vivid (I guess I did a lot of \\"skimming\\" when i read the printed book). Amazing cast, excellent acting, and the production is so well done - usually I find audiobooks with a \\"cast\\" to be slow, this flowed.I wish there was more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"almost equal to Harry Potter","review":"I loved this book because of how the writing flows.Philip Pullman writes this book so you can' t stop reading it. I was more anxious to finish the book than I was with Harry Potter and the goblet of fire.This book is very complicated so people give up on it , but if you understand it becomes a very good and interesting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"the genious who we call Philip Pullman & the amber spyglass","review":"this is the best book i have ever read.literally.Pullman is the best writer i think ever lived. his writing is so descriptive and so well thougt.also he explaines things like when u first fall in love,the feel of starlight on your skin, etc.i felt it was happening to me.also his characters are not perfect. in the beginning lyra was kind of a bully whereas madeline l'engle's characters are perfect in every way(exept meg)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling and Tolkein good, Pullman better","review":"A great book, but be sure to read the first and second books beforehand. The political stuff, like religous hypocrasy, will fly over kids' heads but the book is still good for everyone. This book isn't as cosy as Harry Potter and is more believable, but Coulter's unexplained personality change throws part of the story. The same goes for Asriel's \\"revolution\\" - a dissapointing anticlimax.Overall, great story, valid points, too many holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular ending to a great Trilogy","review":"The Amber Spyglass is the spectacular conclusion to the Dark Materials trilogy with awesome sub-plots weaving together to make the perfect main story.After teaming up with the Bear king Iorek Byrinson, Will manages to rescue Lyra from Mrs. Coulter and repair the Subtle Knife. Now Will and Lyra with the help of two Gallvispain spies must journey into the world of the dead to find Lyra's friend Roger and free the dead's souls.I liked The Amber Spyglass for the feeling that you're a character that's right there in the story -- feeling the painful pull at your heart as you enter the world of the dead. Another great attribute of this book is the deversity of the characters.The only word I can think of that comes even remotely close to describing this book is spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I enjoyed both the first and second books. By comparison, the \\"Amber Spyglass\\" is inferior - almost amateurish in its storytelling. There are several story lines that are not resolved satisfactorily. The conclusion is hardly as epic as the earlier story hyped it up to be. The connections to Eve and rebirth are tenuous at best. One can sort of see what Pullman was attempting, but it just did not work out. It's almost as if a different author wrote this book.If this had been the first book, I would have given up reading the rest of the trilogy on the spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amber Spyglass: His Dark Materials - Book III","review":"I found Pullman's \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" completely entertaining and in many points quite provocative. This trilogy is well worth the read and several re-reads to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but missing something","review":"I really enjoyed the first two books, and liked part of the third, but I was disappointed that The Amber Spyglass fails to fill the symmetry set up by the other books. They create the clear expectation that the amber spyglass and its bearer will join the other sacred objects and bearers in an equal balance of power to bring an end to the evils going on in the world. But the spyglass enters the book late, and does not seem to have any effect whatsoever on the plot. Dr. Malone, rather than filling the final space in the structure of power, does almost nothing of any significance. Her actions, it seems, have very little effect in the end. I think that this book got off to a good start, but did not go as far as it should have. I really liked the final role of Coulter and Asriel, and the fact that the final death of The Authority had no effect whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carelessly slapped together and unsatisfying....","review":"I think Pullman could have done a much better job in this series. The first book was so interesting and engaging, with great characters, especially a strong female lead. But book 2 and especially the new book 3, the Amber Spyglass, did not live up to what was begun in the Golden Compass. Characters change from good to evil without decent explanations, and important plot developments from book one are tritely dismissed with a phrase such as \\"I lied,\\" because Pullman cannot come up with a good explanation. On a separate note, Pullman takes what could be an interesting exploration of different religious beliefs and simplifies it into shallow anti-catholic ravings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devastatingly disappointing","review":"The first two books take you on an amazing, wonderful rollercoaster ride, only to have the third book hurl you into a whole other direction that is diappointing and confusing. I was so upset to fall in love with Lyra and Will to end up with a bunch of anti-God speeches and a sad ending. The anti-christian message in this book becomes apparent by the end of book two and just gets hammered in throughout book 3. At websites devoted to His Dark Materials there are quotes about Pullman using these books to counteract the Chronicles of Narnia and God. As a parent, I would be disturbed to have my young children (target audience) read how Man/Woman is the saviour of us all. There is no way a parent would know that this is what the books are really about. They are so beautifully written; the third book just broke my heart. If children read this, parents should read it with them. Lots to discuss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"It seems like there is no middle ground. People either loved or hated this book. I am in the latter camp. If only Mr. Pullman had stopped at Book II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betrays our trust in a talented writer's story","review":"Yuck. This was a very disappointing book. Pullman is a great writer with considerable talent, which makes this book all the more of a let down. I loved the first two and hoped the conclusion wouldn't degenerate into christian-bashing, but in the end it is mostly for atheists raising atheist children. Its shaky conceptual foundations are best described as a haphazard mix of greek mythology and plain-vanilla secular humanism. There are many, many logic gaps. The worst thing about this book is that it is for children. Adults can dismiss the nonsensical philosphical junk, but kids are more impressionable. After writing two stellar novels for children and garnering rave reviews, Pullman betrays the trust of all faith-based families with this third volume. I'm not a raving right-wing conservative, but this book offended me, and it could have a damaging effect on the faith of impressionable children.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a stupid book!","review":"** The book is so confusing. And what the heck is the point of the mulefa things? If this book isn't even about the Amber Spyglass, why even call it that? Mary Malone's adventures are STUPID and what are they suppose to mean to the story????!!! What's the point of the World of the Dead? I have to give credit for Lyra and Will's adventures; they were probably the most exciting plotlines in the story. I liked the Golden Compass and the Subtle Knife better. And why, Pullman, WHY, did you make God the enemy? Are you even aware that millions of people believe in Christianity? Halfway through the book, I closed it, and never opened it again! 2 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amber Spyglass","review":"What a great book. This book bumps The Golden Compass and the Subtle Knife up a knotch. It could have been a bomb out, but it wasn't, it made the trilogy so good that Pullman will go down with the greats. As for comparisons to other fantasy novels, I have just one thing to say; Harry who?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The plot is complex and evolving","review":"Familiarity with the prior novels in 'His Dark Materials' is essential for an easy understanding of Book 3 of the series. The Amber Spyglass continues the adventures of Lyra and Will, who journey to a dark world while an amber spyglass involves the world in war and chaos. The plot is complex and evolving but counts on a background developed in the prior books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, poignant","review":"Easily one of the best books I've ever read. Pullman puts just about every other author to shame. Just be prepared for the end, I'll say no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Writers Have an Agenda","review":"Phillip Pullman's trilogy is brilliant. Yes, it has a moral agenda, but so did the Chronicles of Narnia and so did The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. What people are objecting to is the fact that they don't agree with the agenda - and are critisizing the books as if other writers of moral children's fantasy didn't have an agenda - mainly to push the Christian agenda.Pullman is a religious type (all of the athiests I have ever known proselytize as fervently as the most avid evangelical)and he presents his view in a wonderful trilogy. The Christian church does have a lot to explain and atone for and more focus on the world as it is rather than the world to come would do humanity a lot of good.The world that Pullman creates is as magical a world as has ever been put to paper - on par with the classics. Read these and read them to your children - along with the Christian classics and discuss all of it with your children. Both they and you will gain."},{"rating":"2","title":"What controversy?","review":"Philp Pullman is the absolute master of his art. In The Amber Spyglass, smooth, effortless prose leads us to Lyra and Will's rendevous with fate You should read The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife for the first two books in his 'Dark Materials' trilogy. Also highly recommended, the Sally Lockhart trilogy by the same author.I won't waste my time repeating what other reviewers have said about Pullman's amazing gift of storytelling and his ability to weave plots and choose words that elicit the response he wants from his readers....In the Dark Arts trilogy, Pullman has broken new ground, both in genre and in writing skills. Why not review the book for that unquestionable talent? The Amber Spyglass has never prostituted itself as a lesson in morals. It is just a ... good story, told by a master of his art. ...Leave Pullman be. He is giving pleasure to millions and his books are collecting well-earned credits for their sheer brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending","review":"There's no real way to put this other than to say that this book was a jumbled mess. It was such a promising series at the beginning with such strongly and wonderfully drawn characters but, in the end, it seemed like Pullman had no idea what to do with them. The plot of this book was rather nonsensical--and, at times, nonexistent--and while I have some serious critiques of my own about the church, the book seemed to be nothing more than a vehicle for Pullman to air his views about the evils of Catholicism. It's a shame as this could have been a truly astonishing series. In spite of the strength of the first two books, in the end it's not really a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"how could he end it like that?","review":"This is truely a great book! I read the previous two books in the trilogy about a year before reading this one. In the third book of \\"his dark materials\\" he thankfully keeps the story going on the same track that he started it in, the only problem i could see with the book is the ending. I cant get over how he ended the book (...). It was very sad how he ended the book, and I truely hope he does something about it. As for people saying that it is satanic? lol, that is very funny, it is very far from being satanic, and to any christian that says it is demonic in anyway, isnt it true that god wants us to think in new ways and explore ourselves? if not, then we would all be catholic!!!(no offense intended)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My thoughts for The Amber Spyglass","review":"In The Amber Spyglass, freeing the dead from the land of the dead, and seeing old friends in a strange world with strange creatures, is Lyra and Will's live. The beggining of the book starts out very good, with Will searching for his friend. But in the end the story gets unclear, like why making the Amber Spyglass helps. This book is a good ending of the other books in the series because Will finds his daemon and getsit named by the witch, Serafina. This book could have been better if they introduced his daemon earlier in the book. The book ends badly because they can't stay in a different world for too long or they get sick, the could have been better without that, but otherwise this book was a good ending of the other two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"I thought it was a good book with deep concepts if one chose to search deeply. If not, it could make for a good young adult's book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown","review":"I'm sorry. I know it;s popular to praise Phillip Pullman as if he were the new writing god, but please. The Golden Compass was great. The Subtle Knife devolved into that awful Oxford literary crap, with stupid biblical allegory. This is a complex but overblown book. I am glad the trilogy is over, and pray that he doesn't add to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant atheistic hokum","review":"This novel is a mess. What began as an intriguing series collapses into dead ends, unresolved issues, stereotypical baddies, and worst of all, pseudo-theological atheistic drivel. My advice? Read the first and second novels in the series - 'The Subtle Knife' at least has some kind of structure and pace, but if you want to read this kind of literature you are much better off with CS Lewis, who at the very least is undeniably coherent. Which Pullman isn't. Utter tosh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant imagination","review":"His Dark Materials series is brilliant! i finished the first two books worried. Worried that the third book would end like they did. Because these books just stopped, without tying everything togeter like i wanted. but Amber Spyglass does a magnificent job of making sure every little curiousity that was introduced in hte first books is resolved. this book, like the others, keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way. Pullman introduces characters i could never have imagined. he pulls you into the heart of the story and then resolves all the problems that pop up. i would suggest this series to anyone who has the time to read them. Lyra's tale challenges the imagination and makes you think twice before dismissing the awesome power children have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite ending to a great trilogy","review":"This book has a wonderful, many-layered plot in which the reader gets drawn into the depths of the story. Pullman has a certain way of causing the most strict followers of the church to become wary. Not only does it keep the reader on their toes the entire length of the book but keeps them contemplating days after they read the heartbreaking conclusion. The complexity is beautiful and the way the author challenges the Authority with that quiet fire is amazing... this book must be read to be appriceated. Definetely for older and more mature children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Writing but not quite the Magic Touch of the other two","review":"Phillip Pullman's 3rd His Dark Materials Book is beautifully written and the more you read Pullman the more you realise what a genius he must be. The story line is a slight disapointment after Northern Lights and The Subtle Knife both of which sucked you into the dark, strange world of Phillip Pullman's mind. In this book Pullman displays his knowledge and descriptive power but can't quite capture the magic. Still, it's not that bad a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I simply loved this book! I couldn't put it down for the life of me! I found it to be even better than the first two in the series, and that's saying something. The Amber Spyglass is full of breath-taking action, intriguing new characters, mystery, surprises, suspense, and above all, intense emotion. The thing literally moved me to tears! I really felt for almost all of the characters, even the secondary ones (and even Mrs. Coulter, whom I couldn't decide whether to despise or admire). I also loved the morals in this book and the way it led me to think about what is wrong in our world. I just can't get over how amazing and powerful Pullman's writing is! If only everybody would read this book, the world would be a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not disappointing, but too sprawling","review":"I, also, anxiously awaited this book's publication, and stayed up all night to finish it. Although I enjoyed reading it, it didn't have the tight and seamless plotting that I enjoyed in the first two books. There were scenes that seemed too lengthy or even unnecessary. This was especially true of the epic laborious journeys that characters kept making to reach each other, purportedly to share crucial information; they usually had little new to tell. The ending, also, seemed to drag on too long; while I must admit I hated for it to end, it would have been more powerful with tighter editing. Despite these complaints, I found the writing beautiful, the plot moving, and the ending ultimately satisfying. Not as good as the first, but a worthy conclusion. (P.S. By the way, British writers *can't* win the Newbery.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs out of Gas-Hidden Theme","review":"I enjoyed the first 2 books in the trilogy however \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" seemed to wander on and on. In the end the author uses the book to promote his personal views of God and Christianity. I was dissappointed in this because I didn't expect to find anti-Catholic, atheistic views at the end of a children's book. I expected something more along the lines of CS Lewis Narnia. Upon further investigation I found that Pullman detests the Naria series and seems to be the antithesis of CS Lewis. Pullman should have stuck to the fantasy aspect of his series and left his personal viewpoints at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!","review":"I used to make fun of David Eddings online because of the the deus-ex-machina way he treats his characters' abilities to get out of trouble. This series makes David Eddings look like Shakespeare.This whole series is a collection of the most horribly out-of-character moments, out-of-nowhere resolutions, unexplained characters' abilities and knowledge of things, and the worst randomly created plot points in the history of writing.I can't believe that the author Terry Brooks recommended these books to me. Curse you Terry Brooks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A challenging young adult novel","review":"I enjoyed this series. The characters where rich, the Paradise Lost plot parallels were challenging even for an adult (though maybe I was trying to read too much into it), and the ending was great! Lyra, who many feel became Will's sidekick in book 2, is back at the forefront of action (as it should be!). This novel is full of adventure, twists, and surprizes. The ending is heart wrenching and left me quite sad that I was leaving Lyra and Will."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to read","review":"I found this book exicting to read. I believe that some of the points could have been expanded on. It is an extremly thought provoking book, and I would recommened it to anyone who doesn't mind a book involving religion.

I had recently read the other two in the series as a recomendation from my Language Arts teacher, and there are no words that could ever describe this book. Now, I am a magnificent reader well beyond my years (not to brag or anything(, but I can say I have never read any book quite like this. The book brings back some old mysteries, like Dust from the other books, so if you have not read the others than this one might confuse you. The closest thing to this book would probably be Harry Potter, so If you've read those, GET THIS BOOK NOW!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I was so disappointed in the Amber Spyglass. Poor plot and character development, plus I hated the \\"God is Dead\\" theme. I loved the first two novels, and actually bought a the third in hardback cause I couldn't wait for a paperback. I am adult, and have read hundreds of science fiction and fantasy novels, but I would never encourage a young person to read this novel. The anti-Catholic and anti-Christian philosophy was very offensive. I am so disappointed by the conclusion of the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age slop","review":"Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy presents God as an evil puritan who hates sex, and presents Satan as good guy who brings knowledge. I'd laugh if it weren't for the fact that this [junk's] already old; the Satanic Bible was published more than 40 years ago, and Pullman does nothing to advance the Satanist vision. His writing reads like a humorless episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.I read an interview with Pullman in a British paper. He thinks that the US is ruled by \\"fundamentalists\\" and that it's illegal to teach evolution here. What a dope."},{"rating":"1","title":"ICK!","review":"First book in the series...very good. Interesting ideas. Second book....well, it wasn't as good as the first. This one....absolutely [stunk]! I'm sorry but I was expecting better!

It combined action with emotion to create a really addictive storyline; I couldn't put it down.However, Northern Lights(book 1) is still my favorite out of the 3 as I loved the way it introduced all the characters and i think the plot is excellant. My only complaint with the Amber Spyglass is the ending, I wanted to know more about what was going to happen to Will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, trashy ending","review":"I started out with anticipation. The first two books were great. By the time this one ended I was very disappointed. I don't mind Pullman's anti-christian polemic so much, lame and contradictory as that is. The thing that annoyed me most is the portrayal of pre-teen infatuation and sexual discovery as the savior of the universe. Very silly and irresponsible. Let's tell kids that puppy love is the glue that holds everything together. I wouldn't put it on any recommended parents' list."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most incredible book on the planet!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book, mr pullmans writing reaches the level of JRR Tolkien and outstrips by far many other fantasy writers.

I have followed this series from the very beginning, when The Golden Compass was released. I actually had the chance to meet him before The Amber Spyglass came out. I would recomend this series to everybody, because even if fantasy is not your preferred choice of genres, everyone can relatate to the emotional stife that the characters have to go though. The selfless sacrifices characters make for the common goal are incredible to anyone from the current selfish mindset of our culture. Following Lyra and Will through their emergence of concsiousness is a experience where one can relate and examine one's own development. I would also recomend reading the books in order, it will be a much more satisfying experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A painful third installement","review":"Much as I enjoyed the first 2 of His dark material, I found the third one overly long, overly complex with parts too similar, in my view, to \\"Out of the silent planet\\".

Disappointing and too ambitious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Magic Spell","review":"The Amber Spyglass puts a spell on you and makes you want to read more. This fantasy turns into reality and you feel like you are on the adventures that Lyra goes on. You feel the empathy for the daemons and the protective ways they work their magic. This novel shows the magical entracing side of the magic combined with fantasy. This novel is long in length but after you are done with one you will want to keep reading. Some incidents keep you at the edge of your seat wanting more and yearning for the great lessons that Lyra must learn in order to obtain this magical object. Lyra is a great and simple characters who has many characteristics that many people now have and is a great success to be described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing - Best book I've ever read","review":"This series just gets better and better. The Amber Spyglass was an excellent ending to my favorite trilogy.I believe that some people see this book as being religiously negative, but it's a Fiction story! The Amber Spyglass is simply letting you into a world of with a completely new religion.I thought that Lyra's transformation into a productive person was evident in this book, and Will also transformed his character. I began hating Lyra in the first book but grew to love her and was in tears by the end.This is an emotional, deep story perfect for all fantasy readers. I strongly recommend this story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Very disappointing ending to a good series. I really enjoyed the first two books. However, I found myself being bored with the third book and basically forcing myself to get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The final book - but not the best of the three","review":"Pullman's trilogy has made it's hold in our society. If you have read the first two books then it is pretty much a conclusion that it is time to pick up his third. The Amber Spyglass is my least favorite of the trilogy. It is a bit anticlimatic. It seems that Pullman pulled the focus away from his charactors to put it on some agenda. After all the buildup the ending was just to abrupt to leave me trully satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This was the most amazing book I have ever read. It was emotional, touching and wonderfully descriptive. As sad as I was after the book because the wonderful trilogy was over, I find myself still thinking about it at night. Never in my life have a read such a great mystery book tying in the bible and Adam and Eve along with fantasy and romance. I have also never stayed up until 4:30 in the morning still reading a book because I couldn't put it down! I would recomend this book to anyone wanting a new view of life. I can't wait until another Pullman book comes!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"I started the trilogy with misgivings: the friend who recommended it said that it was \\"better than narnia\\", something i was very reluctant to believe. The first two books, however wonderful and breathtaking and exciting they were, failed to live up to the 'greater-than-narnia' fame. After finishing the Amber Spyglass, however, i have become a convert. This book really IS better than narnia! I don't want to give away too much of the plot, so i'll just say that i wasn't able to put this book down for more than 10 minutes. I sat up long into the night trying to finish it and, at the same time, dreading the time when there will be no more book to read. That last page, for me, was something to long for and to dread at the same time. I've heard the Amber Spyglass descibed as 'too dark, lacking a happy ending.' While i am one of the countless who wishes for happy endings (i spent the last few chapters of the book bawling), the book was the better for it-the emotion was breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really strange but good ending","review":"Phillip Pullman has done it again and has created a masterpiece but even masterpieces have flaws. Lyra and will venture into the deep unknown dead to search for Roger and Will's father. I think Pullman should write a fourth book explaining the end of it all. I am really shocked as to what happened to Pantalimon and Kirjiva. And I also don't know who the female angel is, her name is too hard to spell. She is good thought to have been with the two daemons. The Golden Compass was the better of the three because it wasn't as rushed as The Amber Spyglass but because it was so good, five and a half stars should be deserved for the Amber Spyglass. I really enjoyed reading the triology though i wish that Phillip Pullman would explain the future of Lyra and the Republic of Heaven because I'm always dreaming of what happens to Lyra and Will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha?","review":"Mrs. Coulter was such a wonderful character in the first two books, because as a reader you truly hate her, and can't wait to find out what happens to her. Then in the third book she has a personality shift ... is it real? Another lie? And then Pullman doesn't let us see her demise, we merely hear about it second-hand, as if it were of little importance. Wha' happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"I loved The Golden Compass and loved The Subtle Knife even more. I reserved a copy of this book before it was released and bought it in hardcover. And I couldn't give a hoot about the anti-Christian message.But Philip Pullman sure got himself in a tangle in this one. The ending was contrived, confusing, and needlessly tragic -- as if he felt that he needed a tragic ending, so he contorted his world until it became inevitable. And there were so many philosophical and religious allegories that it seemed the author lost track of them almost as much as I did. Because I'm totally susceptible to having my strings pulled, I sobbed for hours when I finished it, but when I dried my tears I was MAD, MAD, MAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"He should have stopped after two...","review":"It's really a shame that Philip Pullman had to throw in all sorts of bizarre pseudo-religious mumbo jumbo into this book (The new Adam and Eve, the new serpant, assassin priests, etc.). I mean REALLY! The plots of the first two books in the series were extremely well written and engaging. However, this book (what should have been the climax of the two prior ones leading up to it) instead took a wild swerve and became nothing more than a vehicle for Mr. Pullman to vent some wacked out religious views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I'm not the only one who was completly lost with the final book.","review":"I can't believe the ending of what was truly a great series of books. I'm totally blown away with how this series ends.... What the **** happened???? What happened to the revolution? What happened to everybody who had flocked to Lord Asriel's banner? What was the decision that Lyra was supposed to make? What happened, what happened???? I could go on all night, I'm glad I wasn't the only one left in a lurch. Philip Pullman, you should be ashamed to ruin what should have been a been a historic series in line with LOR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter fans would cower in lack of intellect...","review":"if they attempted to understand the depth of His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman. This series is sensational and inventive fantasy, which joyfully digresses from the monotone similarities in most fantasy novels. The imaginative journey to the Land of the Dead, Angels (good and bad), and an eerie siding of good and evil between the Kingdom of Heaven and the Republic of Heaven makes this a stunning and fast-moving conclusion to a stunning fantasy series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super sad ending","review":"First of all if you havent already read this book dont read my review i may give the ending away! This is the best series of books i have ever read. You must read the first two books before the Amber Spyglass. This was a great book full of adventure, and fantasy. The entire book kept me reading it constantly. The first two were the exact same way! The only sad thing was the fact that @ the end Lyra and Will fall in love but can never see each other again. THis is the most exciting book i have ever read yet the saddest. I would still recomend this to people who wouldnt be offended by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Uplifting but rather lacking in hope","review":"I'm sorry but to all of those who say that one is close-minded to say this book is evil have never believed in anything good. I love harry potter and laugh at those who scorn it for evil because Harry Potter is on the good side whereas Lyra never knows which side she is on. Yes, that may be human but this dehumanizes hope for a higher power (God, Buddha, Christ, Nature, Whoever) that guides us in goodness. I especially disagree that because things are done in God's or the Authorities Name that they be God's wishes. Almost every war is over religion and yet that doesn't mean God is leading either side. We are humans and do what we want to be right and Pullman is saying that we do what the Authority wants which isn't always the case. I started out loving Lyra and Will and now i feel cheated that they lead me to fight what is the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zealous atheism","review":"I enjoyed The Golden Compass greatly. However, at the Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass go far beyond books appropriate for the target audience. The story is less a fantasy, and much more an indoctrination into atheism. Obviously the author is free to write as he chooses. However, I certainly would not recommend this for young readers or for most anyone, for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good","review":"A wonderfully written book that brought to a close a great series. I must say, unfortunately, I was ever-so-slightly displeased with the ending. What felt like a huge, series-long build up was, on most points, a faint disappointment. Still, I am reminded it was a series meant for children/young teens, and the contents are certainly beautiful and well-written and convey a wondrous story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disturbing book.","review":"It's a disturbing series of books, very well written but more is the pity.

He uses his talents to enter himself into a most precarious position by pitting himself against the God of the universe and his own wish to sell books.

It has a great story line which was definetely very well thought out. The fantasy worlds are realistically possible and have no major faults. I would definately love to live in one of them. It is also very detailed and every one of the 518 pages are intriguing and interesting. The author also makes it so that if you did not read the whole book you would not get all of the story. Out of all of the His Dark Materials Triad (The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife) I think this is the best because this is the one that actually almost ends and the one where things start coming together. This book also shows quite a few aspect of human nature. Unfortunately, the author is still a little on the side that says human beings are not that selfish. Still, that makes the story all the better. If you don't read this book you are really missing out on something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and uneven","review":"I enjoyed the first two books, well written, fun and wonderful stories. However, it's clear Mr. Pullman could not decide if he wanted to write a treatise on the Catholic Church or if he wanted to write a great fantasy. It seems he tried to do both, and failed. If one was to spend so many pages creating a power point about how evil and weak 'god' was, at least do it well. Unfortunately, in the end neither the story nor his atheist rant were left unscathed. Too bad, such a great start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total letdown after first two books","review":"I really enjoyed the first two books of this series; they had strong central characters combined with interesting stories.In trying to tie together the overall story, however, the author failed abysmally and created a disjointed, pointless jumble of words.Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but sad ending.","review":"This book builds up to a great but sad ending.

What a shame that he allowed the bitterness and anger of his ego to overshadow what could have been one of the most brilliant stories ever written. James Joyce, through the character of Stephen Dedalus in Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, spoke of art as being either pornographic (eliciting desire or fear), didactic (teaching a lesson) or fine (creating aesthetic arrest). Sad to say, The Amber Spyglass is nothing but pornographic didacticism. Those looking for confimation of their nihilistic and narcissistic approach to life will find much to revel in, but those who have experienced the ineffable joy of God's love will find nothing here except an ego in spiritual arrest."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Dark Materials Boxed Set: Part Three of Three","review":"In the final and lengthier conclusion to the trilogy, the full realization of this story is brought to light to such an extent that everything now becomes symbolic in some way, literature quotes begin each chapter, and the depth and complexity of the novel passes far beyond any childhood or young adult fantasy, presenting a complicated plot and moral for even adults to handle. It is in this final book that the strengths and beliefs of our heroes will be tested to their extent, while our own beliefs will be in danger, when the basis for all religion and faith in all worlds is brought into question and threatened.Originally published on May 12th, 2003 Alex C.

However, I think they were also very misleading. My family and I first thought that Pullman was writing from a Christian point of view. We knew he was buidling up to a final war between God and the \\"fallen\\" angels who rebelled against God at the beginning of the world. However, we were unprepared for, and shocked and dismayed to read, his portrayal of God and His angels in this third book. Pullman is nothing more than a God-hater. This is evident in his descriptions of God and His angels as either powerless and cowardly, or powerful but evil. This book was a terrible waste of time, and our time could have been far better spent reading anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing after the excellent preceding books.","review":"After reading the two preceding books of the trilogy this book belongs to, I was really excited to read the third, but after just a few pages I was already extremely disappointed with the way the story was going. Apparently the author took this opportunity to rather rashly express his religious ideas, and I found them quite offensive. The book takes an astonishingly evil turn, as demons and devils are made the heros and God himself is, in a rather offensive and disturbing way, made the villian. I must say I was very disappointed with this book. The story that was created in the first two books was very well done and amazing, they were my favorite books. A lot could have been done with this story; it's too bad it had to turn out this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Horrible, and Disappointing","review":"When I read this book, I had high expectations. The first two in the trilogy were well-written and intresting. However, this one is weighted down by so much propaganda and what seems hate for Christianity, Spyglass doesn't get off the ground.I had a hard time getting through the chapters and it seemed that Pullman had lost his talent. Also, since this is in the libarary's children's section, I wasn't expecting something like gay angels. I know that people aren't quite so innocent today as they were a long time ago, but come on, it's rather gross. Pullman also paints Christians and God as evil and twists around the story of genesis.But even if I were to pass over all the controversy, I'd still say that it seemed as tedious as Moby Dick. And that's quite hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing end to a good trilogy","review":"I loved the Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, but was very disappointed in The Amber Spyglass. Those original characters with believable motivations suddenly turn into trite cliches. Then the book deteriorates into a transparent anti-christian polemic. The loose ends abound. This is particularly inappropriate for the young adult readership it is aimed at. The world is saved in part because the two young people discover love(sex). wow, what a revelation!! Lest you think I am a fanatic, I love Harry Potter and have highly recommended the first two books of this series to students. What a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a little disappointing","review":"This book was almost as good as The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, but I was disappointed by a number of things. For one thing, the villain, Mrs. Coulter, who practically gave me nightmares in the first two books, didn't seem villainous in the least! And Pantalaimon and Lyra didn't really seem at all close after they had been seperated. I had enjoyed reading about how they were connected to each other. And most of all, I hated the ending. It made it seem as though nothing had happened at all, plus it was so sad for both Lyra and Will. But this is still a very good book. It had a good plot with twists and turns that put me on the edge of my seat with suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the three!!!!!!!!","review":"THe Amber Spyglass was far better than my expectations.

It is well written and has a good, but sad, ending"},{"rating":"1","title":"soppy and nonsensical","review":"I'm sorry to say that Pullman's main achievement in this last book is to create yet another soppy paean to adolescence. I was really disappointed in the weakness of the plot and characters. Through most of the book, Pullman is crudely trying to jerk the reader's emotions around... Oh, the sadness! Oh, the joy! Oh, the tragedy! It's all surprisingly amateur, simplistic, and it doesn't work. At least not for an adult reader. But I couldn't like this kind of sci-fi hackery even when I was an adolescent myself. Oh Asimov, Tolkien, where are thou???"},{"rating":"1","title":"A painful third installement","review":"Much as I enjoyed the first 2 of His dark material, I found the third one overly long, overly complex with parts too similar, in my view, to \\"Out of the silent planet\\". I totally lost interest in Mary Malone's doings and there were just too many parallel stories and plots, I became impatient with it all. Lyra's motivation to find Roger simply doesn't stand up in the face of what she has to go through (because she DREAMED about him?) and it becomes implausible and unbelievable. Overall disappointing and too ambitious.I'm surprised at the outcry by the Christian readers though. What about freedom of speech?? Isn't someone ALLOWED to write against Christianity? You don't have to agree but please let writers write what they will. I don't believe Pullman's books will corrupt anybody!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"I read the other somewhat negative reviews and I feel I must agree. It seems like the third book was written by someone else. The first two were compelling reads, but this one is a mishmash of disjointed plotlines. Read it only to complete the series. Also, to me it is not a series for young adults. I am a fan of the fantasy genre, and it reads like an adult adventure, albeit with a child as a protagonist.It will be interesting to see if the upcoming movie of the Golden Compass starring Nicole Kidman will fully address the author's religious views."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"perhaps there was too much expectation after the first two great books but my feeling is that there were too many loose ends that weren't tied up.The very complex issue of religion was always going to be hard and I feel it was handled badly. For the impressionable young readership I think it is damaging. i was ill at ease throughout the book with where this subject was going.Loose ends? After all the fuss over daemons Lyra and Will gave up there daemons rather too easily. Mrs sudden and complete change of character. Loved her in the first two and annoyed that I was indifferent to her in the last. Will touching Lyras daemon? Never happened in history just seemed a bit lame.It really seemed to me like the author had written the book and then gone back through formulaically and inserted intriguing snippets that he could then close off towards the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!","review":"I was surprised to find that this is considered a children's story, and is actually sold in the children's section of bookstores. But I think that's just because the protagonist happens to be a child. This is the third and final book in the His Dark Materials series, and it's an engrossing tale. I would recommend it to any science fiction/fantasy aficionado. I bought the CD's, and they make any long drive seem brief."},{"rating":"2","title":"A shattering tale; best in its genre!","review":"A breathtaking book with unexpected twists and turn. Philip Pullman has outdone himself this time and it is the best book of the series. It is even more astonishing and extraordinary than the first two.

Some of the most interesting characters completely changed personalities with no apparent motivation or explanation. It was as if he couldn't figure out how to resolve all the various ideas, so he just took the easiest possible way out and quit writing. Perhaps he was getting pressure from his publisher to hurry it up.If he couldn't figure out a reasonable denoument, I would much rather he have continued the story into a fourth volume than wrap it up the way he did.I doubt I'll be buying any more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book drowns in Pullman's notions about religion","review":"Throughout the Dark Materials trilogy you can see Pullman gradually moving away from great character development and plot, to a virtual manifesto for Atheism. This in itself can't be faulted too much, except these books are generally \\"marketed\\" toward a young audience, however the books characters, events and overall story are sacrificed on the altar of his personal anti-religious agenda.As others have stated, there are many plot devices and character traits that are simply abandoned: one wonders why they were in the book in the first place (one example: the species the mulafa are warring with).If you are a \\"free-thinking\\" new-age left-winger, this book is perfect for you. If you are a typical, mainstream, religion-respecting person who enjoys good storytelling, you can do better elsewhwere, and I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diminishing returns","review":"I read the HDM Trilogy in one go and enjoyed it. Sadly however, the quality and inventiveness decreases from book to book, whilst the preachiness increases. I found much of the material in The Amber Spyglass to be boring, contrived or unconvincing. For example, the Mulefa are rather silly and trite. They don't really add much to the story and Mary is a little pointless as a charcter, despite supposedly have a big role to play. The visit to the land of the dead is overlong and the relationship between Lyra and Will just doesn't seem real. These are 12-13 year olds after all. In the end, Pullman is a good storyteller, bu no Milton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Sad","review":"The third installment in Pullman's most recent trilogy does not dissappoint. I read it like a starved animal, loving every minute of it. Until I came to the end. Let me point this out right here and now: if you are very sentimental, or easily distressed by sad endings - Do Not Read This Book. I am fairly sentimental and this book almost had me crying at the end, and I still get depressed whenever I think about it. I'm not saying that it was a bad book - I enjoyed it immensely. But I don't think I'm gona be able to read it again. It's just too sad. I'd also like to point out that this book is not that areligious. Sure, its about a man trying to kill God, but it's an EVIL God. I am a christain and was able to enjoy it. So to sum up, this is an excellent book, definetely worth reading. Just be prepared for a very sad ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boringer.","review":"Now I know Pullman had no idea what he was doing when he started this trilogy. This book runs on fumes, and it's made even worse when the author introduces ideas only to discard them lazily. Like the guy who goes after our main characters. Father Gomez, I think his name is. The book keeps returning to him like he's important to the story, but he winds up not being important at all.And then there's Iorek Byrnison, the bear. He shows up for a while, then disappears. I mean, come on. And don't get me started on the ending. I just don't get the significance of the angels and the ghosts and the daemons and the witches and the mulefa. They're all here, but they don't gel in this mess of a book.Oh, yeah, and I still didn't give a crap about the characters. It's hard to relate to them when they talk like old people. Show me a kid who talks like Lyra and Will and I'll show you a monkey who craps gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down for a trilogy that started with promise","review":"Philip Pullman completes his \\"Dark Materials\\" series, and, sadly, there are few surprises. This last book ends as a preachy muddle, and most of the promised climaxes turn out to be anti-climaxes (the foreshadowed betrayal, the end of the Authority, etc.) As radical as Pullman fancies himself, this work also seems to keep trying to reconcile its anti-Christian impulses with Christian morality (dying to self for others, the value of truth, the gifts of the body and physicality). Pullman fashions a straw man of Christianity that actually much more resembles various Christian heresies such as Manichaeism or gnosticism, all the while espousing some of their tenets. For someone who has vocally criticised C. S. Lewis for a tendency to sermonize, Pullman surprising falls to the same temptation, blunting his craftsmanship in this final book of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I enjoyed this book. The continuing story of Lyra and Will was inspiring. The book started off slow, but it began to pick up speed about 100 pages in. I know thats alot, but if you read the first two, you have to know what happens. Trust me, its worth it. The tale is beautifully woven and completes the journey wonderfully. The end was sad, but also happy. You'll just have to read it to find out. I commend Pullman for his superb trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wonderful ending to an amazing trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman pulls off yet another amazing book without stalling the excitement. The third book in his series, His Dark Materials, once again leaves you craving for more. In this sci-fi fantasy book, Philip tangles religion into science, while making it understandable. Will and Lyra are made into people like you and me, while still being heros that can see into the future and cut holes into different worlds. They act casual when angels talk to them and get excited when they see Dust. This is not a typo, Dust are particles that fall from the stars and help life flow. Pullman changes the meaning of book, with this series. He changes this series into your life starting with the first sentence of The Golden Compass, and ending with the last sentence of The Amber Spyglass. The book is on your mind every second of time period your reading it. If you think it's lame at first, DO NOT stop reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent (w/ Orson Scott Card influences)","review":"This is the first of Pullman's book that I read in print rather than on tape, and I'd recommend the former for the most engrossing experience. The full cast recordings are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a book","review":"This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. It is so realistic, I sometimes feel it has really happened, and I want to be part of it. It is so original and new, I have read few books that I have been addicted to like this one. A book you never want to end. The story of Will and Lyra is touching and deep. Pullman writes in a way of his own and expresses everything perfectly. A good end to an amazing trilogy. Definately worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing","review":"This is a book that has some truly wonderful moments, but to end this wonderful trilogy like this, is a tragedy. I would never recommend this series again, simply because the ending is so awful. The last third of the book almost made me cry because it dropped the ball on so many levels. If you've read the first two, stop there, it will just disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"Wow, what happened? After a great start with The Golden Compass,and The Subtle Knife, the trilogy collapses With The Amber Spyglass. I found the book to lack the pacing and feel of the other books in this series. Any chapter that had Mary Malone and the mulefa in it was extremely boring and uninteresting. Every time there's a difficult point in the plot, Mr. Pullman has a character from the past magically appear and solve the problem. The final chapter of this trilogy was disjointed and flat. Overall I wouldn't recommend this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Shabby. I was disappointed.","review":"This book left me very disappointed. It dragged on and on. Phillip Pullman had so much potential, but he threw it all down the drain. Personally, I feel that Will ruined the story. Lyra was a solid enough character, and many of my friends, both boys and girls, thought that Pantalaimon was enough of a male influence to suffice. I was particularily disappointed when they abandoned Pantalaimon. He was my favorite character, and I was ready to stop reading once he was gone. Also, it was very rude of Will to just jump on Lyra and start kissing her. Now that was disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame ending for a great beginning","review":"The first two books were well-drawn out, character-focused and exciting. This book was none of those things. It was a confusing mess with an anti-climactic ending. In terms of reading this as an adventure story, the main bad guy gets destroyed really easily and really fast. And the tempation we're all waiting with bated breath to see Lyra face ends up being not really a temptation at all, just a quickly thrown together ending to finish the trilogy. Sorry Philip Pullman, looks like you couldn't wait to get the check for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Each book gets worse and worse","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the Golden Compass, the Subtle knife was ok, but the amber spyglass, well, that was a letdown.I am a huge reader, i love books, and i read them all the time.If a book is really boring, i am determined to finish it no matter what.But this was the only book that i have ever stopped reading mid-text, and just put it back in the library.i encourage all readers to give it a try, but i think you will find that each book gets a bit worse than the last.Pullman gradually digresses and his obvious distaste for religion is evident.I know most will say this review is not helpful at all, but it's just my honest opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book left me unsatisfied. First of all, it doesn't seem finished and the ending came somewhere out of left field. I had to push myself to read it because it was so slow in some spots. The land of the dead? Come on - did Philip Pullman just pull this stuff out of a hat? It just doesn't make any sense to me. Besides that, the theme went from adventureous to being a love story. There's no way I'd have a 10 year old read The Amber Spyglass - as I would for the first two books. At this point, I'm glad I read the book because now I know what happened - whether or not I like it.

This book, although it includes some exciting parts, has nothing to do with the plots of the other two books. In second book it says that Lyra will be tempted by Dr. Mary Malone. In the last book, which I excitedly awaited only to my dissappointment, there was absolutely nothing about this. I think Phillip Pullman, of whom I am a huge fan, should rewrite this story that doesn't stick to the plot of the other two books. I suggest to all readers who have or will read the first two books that they use their imaginations for the third book. This book was as if the author scribbled in down in an hour. Nothing fit! It litterally ruined the whole series. Don't even bother waisting the time or the money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pullman is a Genius","review":"This trilogy was one of the best (quite possibly THE best) I've ever read. The Amber Spyglass was a wonderfully-written last book to the His Dark Materials.Pullman appears to have a strong distaste for the Church--not without good reason, of course. I must say that the message I got from The Amber Spyglass was to love without limits, to question everything, and to quit preaching about the afterlife rather than helping others in the HERE AND NOW.The story was unforgettable. The ending of this book (although slightly disappointing) made me cry..I absolutely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"atheistic fantasy","review":"Pullman is a skilled novelist, but from the beginning a reader should know that this book is blatantly atheistic. In and of itself that is not wrong. Pullman may write about whatever he chooses. But I have a hard time that this was marketed as juvenile fantasy and nowhere on the cover did it mention they would kill God, who was never really God anyway but just one of the older angels. The \\"tempter\\" (his word) Mary guides the children Lyra and Will into intimacy when she tells them her own stories of sexual discovery. Their intimacy changes the world since they are the new Adam and Eve. Mary then flatly announces that Christianity is a big mistake that went on too long. Had the cover been honest about what the series was really about from the beginning, I would not have read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful","review":"I thought the golden compass was decent, the subtle knife was somewhat decent.

They discontinued their two best wax hair removal kits: sugar wax and express wax hair removal (white chocolate scented). Those wax kits were efficient and easy to remove.

It does remove most of the hair, but it is impossible to get off of your skin! The supplied oil helps some, but it's still a pain.

For those concerned, my daughter has a condition that caused her to grow very thick pubic hair when she was 3. She cannot shave this area do to EXTREME ingrown hairs and irritation.

I thought I would try the wax and found it to be VERY effective for removing hair but almost impossible to cleanup. It stuck to everything it touched (sink, counter) and I couldn't find anything to remove it. When I put the cloth strips I used and the wash cloths in the washer, the wax got all over the washer and on every other piece of clothing in there. I called the company to try to find some help and they had no clue and did not seem to care. I don't remember any warning that this was a problem on the instructions. I felt it was my civic duty to warn others. Hope this helps"},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and Ineffective","review":"I'm new to waxing and bought this for my legs and bikini area. Regardless of how thick or thin I spread on the wax, it did a poor job and the paper strips did not remove all the wax from my skin. It was not as painful as I expected for a wax product, but left behind a sticky purple residue that would not come off with the oil included in the kit or soap and water. I followed the directions carefully and was left with a huge mess and little hair removal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Mess and Non-effective product!!","review":"I have been using home-waxing kits for a few years now. I've tried a few products and settled with Nair sugar-based wax - it's effective and really easy to clean.

It will not come off towels and washcloths. Must be scraped off of counters right away to avoid staining cultured marble.

My legs are bright red and screaming in pain. The wax got EVERYWHERE and you can't wash it off with anything except their \\"special oil\\". It didn't even take the hair off my legs! And now I'm left with skin so irritated I can't even shave (in the middle of summer) because half of the skin on my legs is gone :("},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT buy this product!!!","review":"I bought this waxing system because I liked that it used cloth strips, and came with a pretty good sized jar of wax. But after using it, it's clear why the product only costs $9. It is the WORST thing I have ever used!! It took a full 3 minutes for the wax to heat up to a usable consistency, instead of the recommended 30 seconds. Even after it's heated up, the wax is so STICKY it's impossible to use without getting it all over everything. The only thing that will take off excess wax is the azulene oil that is included in the kit, and they only provide you with a very small bottle of it. I applied the wax exactly how the directions stated, and it still didn't even remove all the hair. It didn't even remove half of it. Then I was left with sticky bits of wax stuck to my skin that are nearly impossible to remove. I would highly discourage anyone who wants to buy this product, it's such a hassle and the results aren't worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A painful mess","review":"This wax is a painful sticky mess that rips off skin. I thought my technique was off, so I bought some hot wax because I could not stand having one waxed armpit because this wax ripped the skin off and it was too painful to continue. Needless to say the hot wax (strip free) was AMAZING! I have one raw red armpit (from this product) and one baby smooth irritation free armpit (from the hot wax). Buy strip free hot wax!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this product 0 stars if I could!","review":"I've been using wax hair removal products for years. I've used Nads and other cold wax products similar to that. I've used a few hot wax products as well, and I have to say that this one is by far the worst one ever!I have found that most of the hot waxes are made to rinse off with soap and warm water. So, if you get any on your counter top or floor its no big deal. But, this product only comes off with the oil that comes in the box. Even then, you still have to scrape and scrub to get all the wax off. And, depending on where its spilled you may be left with a stain.The bottom line is, this product is way more trouble than its worth, especially since its about the same price as the other hot waxes out there, and it seems to have the same results. If you want a hot wax don't buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky, terrible mess.","review":"I bought this after using Sally Hansen's Warm Wax (with Peach Extracts) product thinking that it would be similar... it's NOT. This stuff is like using purple tar to wax with and takes a dozen or more cotton wipes soaked in cooking oil to remove. It tore my skin and took over 10 minutes to take off (having to rub my poor skin over and over with the wipes to do it). It stick to the floor, it sticks to the tub, it sticks to the bottle, it sticks to everything. Do NOT buy this product. Effective, yes, but not worth the pain and mess!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Even for the experienced waxer!","review":"I couldn't find my usual SurgiWax Brazilian hard wax so I settled for this Sally Hansen product. I always do my own waxing and have never had any issues until I tried this product. It sticks more to your skin than your hair. So much that I think I actually ripped some skin off my inner thigh. It's very messy even for me that I wax myself regularly. I do not recommend this product at all. The texture is super sticky. TOO sticky if you ask me. Do not buy unless you want unsightly bikini scarring. I hope they fade. I personally recommend SurgiWax hard wax. I should have been more patient instead of buying the Sally Hansen."},{"rating":"1","title":"So - So","review":"This item is less painful than other products I've used. I think because the wax really does grip the hair and not the skin. The problem is it is VERY VERY VERY STICKY. Wow. What a huge sticky mess this caused in my bathroom. I've never had such a poor experience trying to clean up after waxing. I would reccomend the Nair brazilian formula wax over this that comes in the roll on, that rinses off easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not strong enought","review":"I wanted to try this variety of the sally Hansen wax this time. Sadly, I had a lot of problems with it, and I was only using it on my armpits and still couldn't get it to work. It's a shame really; I recommend the regular Sally Hansen wax instead. That one works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy once you get the hang of it","review":"Ok first of all, it's WAX, people. Of course wax is going to be messy. When getting wax out of the jar, pull the stick out and twirl it around a few times before applying. Problem solved. Anyway, I used a little baby powder and that made the bikini line easier to deal with. I also cut the strips into 4's. Now throw a towel on the bathroom floor, nuke the stuff for 40 seconds (at least that's what worked for me), and get to waxin'. This stuff smells awesome and it doesn't hurt that it looked pretty, too. Just read the directions first and you're golden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This wax was awful. The wax residue was so difficult to get off; they provide an extra bottle of some strange smelling liquid to help remove the wax afterwards, but it doesn't work well at all and I had sticky patches left all over my legs that I really had to rub at to get off. Good thing it was only my legs; supposedly this thing works for bikini, too - that would hurt. Don't buy this. There are much better wax kits (like Nair) that are so much easier and less painful to remove with just some water."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS PRODUCT IS GARBAGE","review":"I bought this product because I was tired of shaving not having long enough effects. This product doesn't even remove hair. I attempted to use it on my legs and after following every instruction to the letter all it did was make my skin red and stinging. Also, the mess is insane. It took several minutes of scrubbing to even get wax off my hands and I still haven't been able to get it off the area I attempted to wax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good selection but not really the best they have to offer","review":"This is a good collection of songs by saga but it could have a better selection put on here.

It was spellbinding, calling for constant attention in my waking hours and invading my dreams at night. The writing invokes intimations of our childhood -- the things we hold close, the family we take for granted all takes on a new significant meaning. The authors idyllic childhood life is displaced with feelings of helplessness, frustration and despair. The inability to change the course of the his life, and the profound sense of loss he feels is one we can all relate to, a kind of existentialist nightmare. But his ability to retain his connection with what is human and good remains a beacon of life that transcends the darkness and transforms this story into one of great emotional beauty.

This is the best Christmas album for new-age traditional songs set to electronic drums and melodies. I bought it a third time because it is worth it three times over. Silent night is mesmerizing! This album has a renaissance feel to it, the instruments are capitivating, and you'll be entranced. Just buy it for yourself, you'll be tempted to borrow it and never return it...that's how good it is. Try silent night on a mellow afternoon at sunset to see if this album is for you.

Maybe I was influenced by my baby boomer parents who played it religiously every year when we decorated for Christmas, but I loved it even as a kid.

Well, regardless of what anyone else thinks, Manheim Steamroller will always be a tradition in my home (I am now 25 and have 2 children of my own) and so far no one has complained!

Bing Crosby or Andy Williams can't get me in the mood for Christmas quite like Mannheim Steamroller.

Souped up versions of traditional tunes with no vocals may not grab you, but I thought it was novel approach to the tried and true. Chip Davis's collection is a good mixture of mainly English traditionals, all with his original spin. This technique gets old after awhile (see later CD's) but when this came out it was fresh and new. A nice change from the basic sing along versions that had become so familiar over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS","review":"With a contemporary yet affectionate spin, Chip Davis creates a Christmas album that you will enjoy for the rest of your life. By including the Renaissance instrumentation in such classics as The Coventry Carol, etc., and combining and mixing this authentic approach with the delightful pop-infused, and deftly arranged, confections such as Deck The Halls, this album has something, literally, for everyone. While mostly everyone who has loved this album since the 80s when it first appeared has spoken in hushed whispers of joy over Stille Nacht, I have to take offense with the mingling of sacred and Santa in the final seconds -- otherwise, it is perfection. It is Davis' and the Steamroller's ability to \\"re-chord\\" a song's essential structure in new and exciting ways that I find so intoxicating -- it is literally as if he breathes new life into the classic songs he has chosen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorite Christmas Albums","review":"This CD really puts me in the mood for Christmas. \\"Deck the Halls\\" and \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" are invigorating synthesizer arrangements that tweak the original compositions just enough to be delightful. Coventry Carol is a beautiful example of medieval English music and Stille Nacht is a PERFECT rendition. I play it right before bed every Christmas Eve. It really evokes the emotion and sentiment of Christmas for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate in family Christmas music!","review":"My family has had this recording since it first came out, and we have no other album we play more often. It is the most wonderful collection of revamped carols I have ever encountered. It truly capture the spirit of each song. The rendition of \\"Silent Night\\", which concludes the recording, never fails to bring tears to my eyes. If anyone is looking for some great Christmas music for any reason, I would very highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE this CD.","review":"Contains awesome remakes of some lesser known Christmas songs. I don't particularly care for other Mannheim Steamroller music, but there is something about this one... My favorite song is \\"We Three Kings.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas album ever","review":"This is the only Christmas I can listen to for weeks on end without getting heartily sick of it. Because there are no singers, I never get worn out on the same, old voice.

I have seen Chip Davis in concert for a Christmas show, and it just blew me away. There is such an incredible amount of talent in the six people that play the instruments to re-create the sounds of holiday classics. If you're a traditionalist, and like Christmas songs as they are, this album wouldn't be for you. But if you like jazzed up songs that infuse emotion and energy with every beat, you will have this CD in your collection forever! It's just not Christmas without Mannheim Steamroller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Magazine","review":"I look forward to receiving each issue.

It is my favorite after the 8th and the 4th. The reason is that this 2nd is consistently good throughout, there are no moments where you think a section could have been composed (or performed) better. In fact, if anything, this 2nd is a bit understated, with hidden gems of passages in each movement. Bravo! Buy it; you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruckner: Symphony No. 2 (1872 ver., ed. Carragan)","review":"Bruckner: Symphony No. 2 (1872 ver., ed.

Highly recommended. 5/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced replacement parts and additional purchasing fees","review":"Don't buy this sprayer unless you must have the 150 lb. feature!I have owned a SP sprayer for two years. I have used it to spray roundup. It clogged and I took it apart to repair it. When I put it back together it would not build up pressure and did not work. I purchased new replacement parts. The recommended Kit 12 is very expensive. $28.89 for two \\"O\\" rings and two \\"rubber?\\" washers.

They look fine, however, I think the part of the hook that you hang things on needs to be longer. A pair if pajamas is fine, since the fabric is thinner, but if I try to hang a robe on it that is made of polar fleece, or a thick towel, it falls off onto the floor. I kept them because I didn't realize this until after they were installed and my robe kept falling to the floor. I would not recommend this hook; look for something else. This needs to be redesigned; either longer hooks or with more of an upward curve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Song","review":"Reading the reviews on this particular release by AA I decided I would pass. However, I got a recommendation from Amazon on a MP3 download of one of the songs on the CD, \\"Only in my Dreams\\". I listened to the 30 second snippet and liked what I heard so I downloaded it. To me, it is one of their best songs ever!! Trust me, it will be the best 99-cents you ever spent. Nearly six minutes long, it will take you on a journey. This from someone who likes all kinds of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst AA Yet","review":"I have to agree with several other reviewers who find that Acoustic Alchemy's best work is now well in the past. I have all their albums, but doubt I'll buy any more since the trend is clearly in the wrong direction. The more musical styles and new instruments and glitzy production they pile on, the less interesting the music has become. This CD has nothing memorable, not a single melody that sticks with you, not a single tune that makes you want to play it again. The early albums still sound fresh and exciting, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank god I didn't pay for this!","review":"I saw this at the library the other day, and since I had heard of them, but had never actually heard them, I thought I'd give it a listen.

Otherwise, there are five million jazz discs out there that are much better than this dreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good product.","review":"Regardless of its' size the suction is Extremely powerful.

Our earlier one was on a holder/charger. When I received the Black n Decker dustbuster, I still had my doubts, but gave it a try. It has not needed a re-charge since, although I know it will one day. It works perfectly, has plenty of power. The only thing I miss is the crevice tool. And I do miss it!Calclerk"},{"rating":"1","title":"dustbuster is busted","review":"I have always kept a dustbuster in my kitchen for quick clean ups. They are always charged. Not with this new 18 volt model. Not only does is not have much suction power, you can't keep the battery plugged in so it is always charged and ready to go. If you don't use it for 4-5 days, the charge depletes! So then you have to recharge it for 14-16 hours. Not convenient at all. So I returned the dustbuster. I then ordered a Eureka that works great and can be left plugged in, permanently. The model number is H96. It is not as large as it looks in the photos and is a great buy; not to mention it costs less than the inefficient new dustbusters. The new dustbuster models are now just cheap knock offs of the original great machines. Black and Decker in their attempt to make a higher profit by cheapening a previously great product, destroyed a really good thing.I strongly recommend the Eureka below:Eureka Quick Up Cordless 2 in 1, 96Hproduct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suction, Difficult to empty.","review":"I ordered this item because of other reviews I had read from Amazon. Overall, I really like the way it works. I am a little disappointed that it is a bit difficult to empty the dust cup. You have to actually take things apart and remove the dust cup manually in order to get it ready for the next use. Other than that, I can recommend it. I like the removable, chargable, interchangeable battery. It is easy to manage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.","review":"The dust buster replaces another one which I loved because it is so powerful. It works very well.

Was hoping it would self charge in a cradle. It is also quite heavy.

But after a week or so the filter was clogged and isn't very easy to clean, and it lost most of its suction power. The filter has little plastic holes that get clogged, and then the air flow goes to pot. After cleaning it, I am still not getting the amount of suction I need, so I am taking it back. The only good thing I have to say about this unit is the power supply is compatible with any 18V battery that goes on other black and decker appliances. While I would not repurchase this item, I do have other appliances that use the same battery and I am happy with them. I think they need to redesign it for better suction, even with a dirty filter. I was only using it for sucking up messes in the car, for the carpeted surfaces. I think they can come up with something better than this that has more suction. Back to the drawing board on this one, Black and Decker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"Overpriced for it's weak suction.

Hope this short video helps you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The opposite of sucks","review":"I bought this at the store today and used one of my fully charged 18 Volt Black and Decker batteries I already had. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because the battery is swappable with my other 18 Volt Black and Decker units. Unlike the weed-eater and other things, however, this lacks the power you would expect from an 18 volt power supply! I've had cheap crappy uprights with less power that actually had more suction. This manages to get a couple pieces of fluff, and some stray kitty litter, but only after several passes or creating a seal with the floor directly over the particles to be picked up. It'd be about as easy to just bend down and pick the offending particle up. This will be going back at the next opportunity. I expect a heck of a lot more power from a heavy hand-held that costs sixty bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No longevity, ni-cad battery won't last.","review":"I was looking for a powerful dustbuster and this vac filled my needs when I got it. The problem is the battery eventually will not hold a charge and it seems that every-time I go and get it to clean a small spill, the battery is almost dead and the power is dismal. Too expensive for what you get and should have been a lithium ion, not ni-cad. Really not a recommended buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hand held Ever Owned","review":"I bought mine two years ago and it still works perfect.

My parish is giving these Bibles out to every family that has a baptism. Your parish should do the same!The weaknesses: The NAB, while a good translation, is not as good as the Revised Standard Version-Catholic Edition (RSV-CE). The RSV-CE, one of the 4 Catholic approved Bibles (not that you can't read other versions), is for the serious Bible student. The NAB has some very light (tolerable) gender inclusive language. See the EWTN web site under FAQs - Scripture for a good explanation. Also, the book introductions are not always sound. Read those with caution.

Most of the primary scientific ideas introduced to move the plot along are preposterous.The author is incapable of consistent characterization. I've met Barbie dolls with deeper personalities. The story overflows with minutiae in an attempt to create a feasible world, but most are irrelevant, and none give rise to a McGuffin. His use of real-life political figures and television news broadcasters does nothing to give a sense of greater reality to the plot, merely seeming gratuitous.This book is subtitled, \\"The Terrifying New Disaster Novel,\\" which is correct on all counts, so it qualifies it for one star, simply for truth in advertising.The only editing that would have sufficed to improve this misguided attempt at literature would have been the judicious application of a can of lighter fluid."},{"rating":"2","title":"personal history","review":"This book is among the best I have read for Illinois history.

It offers some interesting intrigue but little in the way of proof as Courtney Brown claims. The book begins on a promising note that that the methods used are scientific and replicable and offer undisputable proof of UFO involvement on Earth. Doctor (I hestitate) Brown then leaps far away from this by using a controversial method to prove another controversial subject. A scientific no-no. The book offers beautiful points of thought and meditation, but it is a polluting piece of scientific work which should only be approached by people of a balanced nature and prior knowledge of the subject. Jumping in head-first is a very bad idea. Fun but foolish. And, hey, Brown, if this SRV stuff works so well, shouldn't you keep your time and resources to playing the lotto?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Book!","review":"I just finished reading this book. Dr. Brown is an ex-NSA Remote Viewer. He was engaged on a project to study the \\"so called\\" Gray Aliens. This was conducted over a 2 - 3 year period.

The prose retains his characteristic hard-core scientific accuracy, poetic descriptions, and sly wit, but this work is also more suspenseful than most of his work. \\"Space wars\\" are an extremely common science fiction theme but extremely rare in Clarke. Earthlight, however, focuses on it and even has a full-fledged war scene.However, it is thankfully not a typically corny SF disaster but told in strikingly believable detail complete with scientific accuracy and poetic prose. This book will keep you reading. Clarke fans will definitely want it, but neophytes should get 2001, 2010, Rendezvous with Rama, or Childhood's End first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent short work","review":"This short work about the events leading up to an interplanetary battle is still one of Clarke's best. The battle scene at the very end of the book between The Acheron spaceship and the moon base, which has developed a strange, molten-metal beam weapon which works in a vacuum, incorporates a very usual idea and I thought was very well done.Clarke's discussion of the political issues between Earth and her colonies, The Confederation, that eventually lead to the climactic battle scene, are also well done. If you liked this book, you might also try Robert Heinlein's books, \\"Between Planets,\\" and \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,\\" which also deal with the issue of the Moon or other planets attempting to rid themselves of the colonial hegemony of mother Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good AC Clark","review":"I didn't like this one as much as I did \\"Tales from the White Hart\\", but it's still one of those books you just can't put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A straightforward story by Clarke","review":"I have always loved Clarke's works. It began with 'Expedition to Earth' and there is still a lot to read. I must say I preferred 'Childhood's End' to this book, but this one wasn't dull either. It was fairly straightforward, a book about conflict between Earth and the Federation over resource allocations. The whole story is the usual scientifically-accurate and descriptive science fiction, without any needless drama or extreme grandeur, or wierd aliens. As always, Clarke's books have a certain human quality to them, and are never overtly extravagant. This book is not a must read, but any fan of Clarke's would want to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Restrained, thoughtful drama about moon exploration","review":"I might be one of the few who still remember it - a little!

It has no continuity or orderly progression of any steps to take if deciding to grow perennials for pleasure -- let along for developing a business. It states generalities while giving no insight into the conclusions presented. The book's layout and lack of visual references (i.e. graphs, pictures, charts, tables) makes it hard to follow and stay interested. The biggest dissappointment of all: The book is riddled with the authors advice to buy his starter seed kits for those looking to grow perennials. There are many good references on perennials - both technical and pratical - that would be well worth investing a little more money into their selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth a Dollar","review":"I was not happy with this product.

I read it three times before I even tried to make a batch. I would recommend thoroughly reading this book, but do not take all Ann's advise as law. For example: she says that your temperatures must be between 95 and 98 degrees or your batches will fail. Not true! And she says you should not make batches smaller than 6 pounds. Many people make 1 pound batches with no problems. For most people, this is just a hobby and what will they do with 6 pounds of soap, especially when you want to make a few different kinds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner book","review":"This is a wonderful book. I originally bought The Natural Soap Book, By Susan Cavatich, and it is very interesting and informative, but a bit overwhelming for someone who needs to start from the beginning. Her recipies are so large. This book has 4 basic recipies, just the right size to begin and experiment with. Her writing is amusing and fun to read. Her instructions are straight-forward and simple. I was lucky enough to pick up an old copy in a used book store. (Original price was 2.75) The recipies are for both tallow and vegetable based. I think this is the perfect little book for one to start with. Short, sweet, and to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing!!","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, and sat right down to read it as soon as it arrived.

The books main focus and ingredient used is TALLOW..YUK..While some have no problem with animal fat in their soap, I have a huge problem with it, it stinks for one thing and I would never use it.

There is a whole chapter on how to buy tallow from your butcher and then take it home and render it, strain out the gristle, etc. In the soap recipe that uses lard, it says the soap may have a bacony smell.

That being said, I love this book....it's the book that got artisan soaping started and she has some lovely recipes. Her recipes do make good soap.Unfortunately, the last edition of this book was published in 1975. Methods have changed, safety precautions have changed (she didn't wear gloves because a lye burn was easier to deal with than the limited movement....WRONG....wear the gloves). She also adds water to the lye...this is inviting a volcano....just don't do it.On the plus side, there are great ideas for \\"found\\" molds, great ideas for shaping and sculpting your soap, and an interesting (if verbose) history of soap.I would recommend it for its historical value and great soap recipes, but invest in a more modern volume for your first attempts.

Before the mystery is complete, a couple of more people will die in one of Agatha Christie's most interesting early novels. In addition to the larger than usual body count, the number of red herrings is tremondous, bordering at times on outrageous. The solution, though, is perfectly Christie. I had a good suspicion of who was responsible but never did figure out the how, although it all comes together so smoothly you will wonder why you missed the obvious. Poirot is in fine form. There is also a joy in reading of the lords and ladies mixing with actors and actresses (two sets which are favourites of Christie and with which she writes so engagingly). A fine mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PERFECT CRIME EXCEPT...","review":"...for the eye glasses forgotten in the possesions of the second victim.

I knew waaay before lame-brained Jan did that Derek and Andrea were siblings rather than betrothed. She never asked any questions at all and when she did she didn't wait for answers. Like who was Nick, why did Derek know so much about kids needing to learn to walk again and what to do for them. Poor little damsel just kept having problems and the hero would show up to rescue her. Go out riding in the desert without telling anyone, don't take water, doesn't know what time it is, evidently doesn't own a watch, expects her horse to patiently wait for her to wake up. Please!. Was this a first attempt at writing? Pass this one up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I Have Ever Read- In My Life","review":"I get that this was a short novella so things have to be sped up faster than they would in a full length book but this was just pathetic and completely unbelievable. The main character Jan is wimpy and an idiot. The supposed leading man, Derek, is sexist and treats her like dirt the entire novel. Somehow despite all of this she realizes she's in love with him after only 100 pages, 3 encounters with each other where neither of them show the other one anything that remotely resembles romance, interest, or even being nice to each other. I do not get it. It was a horrible read that I just kept shaking my head at. I finished the book only to satisfy the grim curiosity of if this book could get any worse, yes, yes it could.

Maybe Usher and Ashanti have discovered that people will buy songs based on one word. It's YEAH for Usher and BABY for Ashanti. Someone especially his best friend and mother should tell him he's not Michael Jackson, one is enough. I know it's a great compliment to someone to have admiration for them enough to do an impression, but Usher has taken it too far. We know he can \\"copy\\" dance, but what can he do on his own?

It has no point and it lacks substance. The beat is just awful. And the other ok songs are \\"Caught up\\" and \\"Bad girl\\" and thats it. This cd will be in the rash can soon.

How about a song that encourages young people to vote and take an interest in the world around them? How about a song about how life is still difficult for a successful black hip hop artist? How about a little poetry? Is this where hip hop is headed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very Average","review":"Of Usher's big name CDs (My Way, 8701, Confessions) this is by far the worst. All of Usher's albums have had some filler but this album is packed full of it masquerading as what he and the teeny boppers of the world are calling \\"real R&B\\". Some reviewers here have called Usher a genius and the new Marvin Gaye. Thats one of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard. Look at the songwriting and production credits for this album, there are a number of songs where Usher didn't write a word (including \\"Yeah\\") and most other songs he co-writes with about 3-10 other people. He also didn't produce a single track. Some genius. The only genius I give him credit for here is the fact that he's conned so many people into buying this album. If you want to listen to some real soul/R&B music by some of the real male R&B geniuses listen to some Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder or R. Kelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"I dont understand how this album was so successful because it was pretty bad!

I liked Usher when he first started out, and I liked his last 2 albums, but this one is pure garbage. Just a side note, I've been reading other reviews mentioning My Way and 8701, but people seem to forget his very first album, which is a self-titled album that was released back in 1994. I loved \\"Think of You\\" from that album, and when I think about that song and compare it to his stuff now, I really miss the old Usher days. I listened to Confessions in my friend's car and just skipped tracks. It's so awful that I even refused to download the album and waste computer space. I'm not hating, I DO have to give my props for huge sales of this album and it's great that he's at the peak of his success, but once you're at your peak, you can only go down and that will be inevitable for Usher."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get me wrong I love usher","review":"I loved usher when he put out his last 2 records and had good quality music on it but this album did nothing for me. Sure his vocal skills and his body have gotten better but his songwriting is weak and the music sounds like a bad parody of his previous music and it's sad how usher didn't get all the attention until he cheated on chilli, says a lot about how society puts up men who do that don't it? I would stay far away from this album. And as for his dancing I've seen it all before, he rips off michael jackson and you kids need to know that usher is NOT the king of dance or any of that stuff"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is his worst masterpiece at this time.

Finally a good R&B CD!!!!!!!!!","review":"On his 5th album usher finally flexes his muscles. I didint really like 8701 and this has really restored my faith in the #1B R&B; singer in the game.(fyi:#1 is R. & 1A is Ginuwine)It is soooo much to say about this cd im not going to say anything but i will tell you the best 4 tracks on confessions.Cofessions- Usher really digs deep into his life and confesses his soul in this track.Burn-The new single (first single according to usher)it really is helping you to let go of a slipping love.Superstar- in this track he flexes his vocals and they are sick!!!Yeah- what more can i say the club anthem of the year a lil' john produced track, will be single of the year. SO CRUNK!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I must Confess...this album is a mess!","review":"At first, curiousity got the best of me, after a friend of mine had told me about the \\"Confessions\\" track. I could not believe the severity of it, until I heard Usher tell the story. Never have I ever felt or hurt so deeply after listening to a CD! That track followed by the smooth, subtlety of his new vocal approach, tore me inside out. I felt like his confessions were mine and I was just Caught Up! Similar to the crisp, yet familiar sounding groove \\"Caught Up\\", which lightened my messy thoughts and reminded me of an old Micheal Jackson single it just makes me wanna dance.He never ceases to amaze me, especially with \\"Do it to me\\" which seems like an adage to the Artist formerly known as Prince. Usher has the ability to appeal to his audience no matter what the challenge, if you haven't picked up the album I insist you do because it will take you for a ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot record...","review":"Hot..Hot..Hot album, Usher has been putin' it down for us since the days of 1994! And he has continued to make hit records!!! All the way from the first to the last track on Confessions. The thing about it is that it's so real and you can \\"feel\\" what message he is trying to relay to you! Everyone knows that he always has one or two tracks that are a lil' freaky for the ladies out there...( on this one theres a bout three )Gotta give it to the man hands down..The album is HOT!!! Pick it up !"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't make perfect albums everytime","review":"let me start by saying that I love the track \\"yeah\\" it's got so much positive energy, I love how this song can just pump you up, even if you're bored. but once you get pass the song, the album itself doesn't take advantage of that energy, there's no other tracks like \\"yeah\\" on the cd, and the majority of the tracks are slow jams, there's no balance, like on his previews albums, he had ballads, dance tracks, and everything moved along very well, on this album, you get up and jam with \\"yeah\\" but then you have to take a sit and listen to the rest of the album, just slowly go by. I don't have a problem with slow jams, I love Jaheim, and a few other brothers that can really sing their hearts out, but when I think of usher, I think dance moves, i think funky beats, this album just doesn't have enough of that for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I confess, This is c--rap","review":"I didn't know they gave grammy nominations for dancing in video clips.

I was a fan of his when he first came out, when NO ONE knew him. I love My Way...LOVED 8701, his best piece of work to date...so naturally, I ran out, got Confessions. I WAS SOOOO DISAPPOINTED. I like Throwback and Caught Up but after that, it was just a waste of time and money. (And NO this CD is NOT better than Justified!!). I don't care how much it sold in the first week, I don't care if it goes diamond. I mean so did Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer!! This cd was PURE GARBAGE.

Did you see him at the MTV awards? His yacht was the biggest and fastest, and he wanted to let everyone know that. It's disgusting. This guy has so much, and now re-releases this album, which the \\"working poor\\" of America will run out like a bunch of sheep to buy. And what for? Four new songs? Why not release a commercial single for \\"My Boo?\\" Or an EP? Or a new album, with those four new songs, plus a few others floating around, and \\"Confessions Part 1,\\" and maybe some holiday tracks which I'm sure Usher could afford to record, and really make it worth the money? No, because people are greedy and stupid, and the evil jerks in charge of this already know how mindless Usher's fans are, and they'll spend their welfare checks on this re-release so Usher can get richer and richer. Give me a break people.

It isn't a hip-hoppish one like 8701. It's more than R&B. The only fast song is really the ever-popular \\"Yeah\\". My favorite song(s) are Confessions part 1 and 2. They are somewhat sad.

I listen to it just about everyday. It has a good, smooth r&b; feel to it. Every track has its own individual sound. I love it. But after spending about $16.00 on the original release, why on earth would I go out and buy the same album again just for three extra tracks. It really is pointless if you think about it. It's just a sneaky way for record labels to get more money...and it really urks me. This is why so many teenagers today download music--because of silly BS like this. Seriously. Why would I pay $16 for the same CD twice?But at the same time, if you haven't purchased the original release, I would recommend buying this one instead--because atleast it has a few extra tracks to groove to. But if you already have 1 copy, there's no use in buying this one.

I will list the tracks that are worth anything-Yeah (if you aren't sick of it by now, which I pretty much am), Burn, and Bad Girl (This is better than the hits) I would definitely suggest downloading/previewing tracks to see if this is your cup of tea. It sure isn't mine. I do like other material of Usher's, so I'm not biased in any way. This is my opinion based on the album material.

This 17-track album is consistently good from top to bottom. While the album itself isn't a classic, the strides that Usher has made from '8701' to 'Confessions' makes me sure that Usher's best has yet to come. Vocally, this is by far Usher's best cd. On top of that, this cd has some of the best vocal arrangements I have heard, no exxageration. What hurts the album are weak choruses that brand some of his songs monotonous. However, the right production team can solve that, and with Usher's current vocal mastery i'm convinced that Usher is halfway there.The stand out tracks are the Timberlake-sounding \\"Take your hand\\", the crunkalicious \\"Yeah\\", the trademark Usher \\"Burn\\", the pimpalicious \\"Bad Girl\\", the Musiq sounding \\"Caught Up\\" and \\"Red Light.\\"This is a very good album, much better than '8701.' So buy the album and enjoy Usher's vocal progress, its mindblowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"its good, solid","review":"i looove this cd and its not because usher is fine because i think hes ugly-he has a very good voice and these songs are great of course yeah and my boo are my favorite- but there are others on the album that are good. its a good date cd- and i think (other than #2) its a good cd to unwind to for some reason, and to the person who wrote that men wouldnt buy it, honey i know some hot college men who have the cd-oh but maybe it is because they are more mature-i wouldnt recommend ludacris-his singles are all hot, but his cd's as a whole are not- ;). get this cd if u dont already have it-its worth the $11 that i paid!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"This is an excellent CD, I really enjoy it.To the fan from Macon, Georgia, Michael Jackson may be going through some legal matters right now, but he's not out of the game.

R&B; is just too slow, and unexciting for me. The only song on this CD that I like, although trashy, is \\"Yeah!\\". It is faster, and is a great dance song. \\"Confessions\\" bothers me, as it does many kids, and I can barely make myself listen to it. The song is incredibly innapropriate, probably one of the trashiest I've ever heard. Although it talks about truth.Usher is a talented singer/dancer, and needs to give up the trash. Only talentless singers act like trash.

It took me awhile to buy this album because I was too busy saving up for some upcoming rap albums so it wasn't until about 5 months after its release when i finally purchased it. WOW! This is an awesome R&B album with many good tracks like \\"Yeah\\", \\"Confessions Pt. II\\", \\"Burn\\", \\"Throwback\\", \\"Caught Up\\" and \\"Superstar\\", Usher's fourth album is awesome.

I was very dissapointed when I recieved it. Several of the songs are missing, including the lead single from the project \\"Yeah\\" (Usher has mentioned in a few interviews that it originally was not intended to be on the album, it initially was a mixtape buzz track). I guess after it's success, the label greenlighted him with more studio time and the result were the tracks that we have on the US version.Here is the tracklist for any curious buyers:1) Intro2) Throwback3) Confessions (Interlude)4) Burn5) Caught Up6) Superstar (Interlude)7) Superstar8) Truth Hurts9) Simple Things10) That's What Its Made For11) Can U Handle It?12) Do It To Me13) Follow Me"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite!!!!!","review":"This is my favorite Usher c.d.

I say against my will because the airhead that sits on the other side of my partition at work has her radio on all day long. The staion that she has it tuned to must play it about 4 or 5 times a day. Oh, and she sings along with it too. Joy. The only thing worse than hearing \\"My Boo\\" by Usher and Alicia is hearing \\"My Boo\\" by Saira. There is nothing about this song that makes sense. From the inane title, (what is a \\"Boo\\" anyway?) to the reason why it has become such a huge hit. They lyrics are insipid and the melody sounds like it was written by a first grader. I could go on and on but really, why would I waste my time? If this poor excuse for a song wins ANY Grammy award, (which I know it will) I think I just may have to go postal on my co-worker. Because it's people like her that made it the hit that it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"He should have seen a priest!","review":"What is all the hype about?

BUT, he is very arragont and up himself which puts me off thinkin he's a cool bloke.NEXT ALBUM please..................!OVERALL- 4/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Making the customer pay twice","review":"I don't have anything against the music, what I do take issue with is an artist releasing a CD then all of a sudden a few months later releasing the same CD with new tracks!!! Why not give the people what they want the first time instead of sticking them up and having them buy the CD twice!!! Both Usher and Arista should feel heavy duty shame by their greedy moneygrabbing ways!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a sneaky way to get more money","review":"I agree w/ another reviewer. I am an Usher fan especially since he's down w/ my boy Michael Jackson. The problem is I bought the first release of this album and now he re-released it w/ 4 extra songs? Thanks a lot Usher, way to screw your loyal fans! My opinion of him has changed because of this move. I'm not gonna waste more money on your updated Confessions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confessions By Usher","review":"Usher is THE! most overrated Singer in this entire industry, none of his songs are good, the only reason he gets all this publicity is because he is so called \\"Sexy\\" and he makes all these moms buy there 12 year old daughters an Usher CD..I bet you that 85% of the people that make up ushers fan base and cd sells are 10-18 year olds, and female....you wont see a 15 year old dude buying an usher cd, he would want like Ludacris or something, this guy is seriously overrated, and if you thing him saying Ooh uhh in high voices is singing then your sadly mistaken buddy, the only reason I like my boo is because of Alicia Keys, now that is some real talent right there, Alicia Keys should have sold way more albums than usher, I am not Hating on Usher, but I really thing he shouldn't get all the publicity he is getting, because he is not all that great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"I am pissed I paid money for this garbage. The songs are typical and boring. I bought the cd for the released songs \\"Yeah\\" and \\"Caught Up\\", I wish I would have downloaded them. The insert of the cd is just assinine, no lyrics....just pictures of Usher's abs, jewerly and clothing. Excuse me, but Usher, you are not the only man on this planet with a six pack! Also, the \\"confessions\\" thoughout the insert sound like something you would find in a fortune cookie!Please buy something else!!!

This guy sings annoying, slow paced R&B love songs that all sound the same, but with \\"Yeah\\" he decided to experiment a bit. Not only did he created the most overrated, overplayed, and annoying song of the year thus far, but he collaborated with the most generic rappers out there right now, Ludacris and Lil Jon. It only gets worse with Burn, hope you don't slit your wrists while listening to this song, because its boring, VERY boring. Don't buy this, buy some Blink-182."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst Albums You Could Imagine","review":"I hate music comming out now because all it talks about is sex, money, and a girl's body.

Take my advice and never by this ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD","review":"Usher has a good voice, I listened to every song on this album, and enjoyed 100% of them.

This is not one of the greatest albums of all time...or never will be. People are acting like this is some kind of remarkable historic piece, when it really is a jumbled, rushed, uninspired collection of dull, repetitive and redundant songs!Lord, I don't know where the world will be tomorrow. Maybe if it is heading in this wrong direction, the Cheetah Girls will be hip! Please!Sure, maybe there are some catchy songs...but you don't have to buy filler! Buy the singles for all its worth.Let me note that this is a desperate act for symptathy...he wants us to fell sorry for him cheating on a girl; well dont' feel sorry for him! The woman is going through the pain, and whether the whole cheating incident occured...the whole idea of this album is foolish and sickening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usher is the man","review":"This CD Is Da Bomb.Usher most definitely needshis props on this CD. It is better than Justin's.All the ballets and the uptempos are HOT.The are no bad songs on this CD.He sings about his life experiences.I give it 4 stars. Rated A-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated","review":"Usher is a ok artist dont get me wrong, I think this album is ok but it seriously gets too much praise then it deserves. There are many many more artists who actually work harder and sing better then artists such as usher and get nothing. He basically uses his looks to sell records."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING SPECIAL","review":"this cd was nothing special at all, how it sold as it did i donot know but i bet more than half the buyers thagut it sucked. Personally there 3 good songs on there 1 played out (yeah) alreday anothjer one on its way to being played out (confesions) and then cuaght up after that its all the same boreing nonsense. PLus we got burn, anyone who cant sing that song in thgeir sleep must not have a radio, its all we hear , tired of ushers crap. USHER you could do alot better, cuase thats what many expected alot better, i would never buy tis cd , so anyone intretsed in it askk a friend or sumthin dont waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"songs of love","review":"I think usher did a very good job with this cd because it lets us know that he is growing up and we are seeing a whole new side of him and i feel that he has grown up to be a real loving and kind person to like and to listen to on the radio or on tape or cd. So i feel if usher gets more older he will have a good rate in the mosts cd's sold in the u.s. but my favorit song off of the cd is confessions because it has a whole lot of people think of there girlfriend or there boyfriends and thay are glad that they have them in there lives. so usher what i say to you is keep up the good work and dont let anyone bring you down in noway at all,but if they try you just look at them and say i am just being me and nobody else but just me, so keep up the good work and keep making the good and loving song for the ladys and the dance music for the males and we will keep playing your music in are car, vans,houses and Etc. I hope you like what i had to say about your cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usher Does it Again!","review":"8701 was the bomb and confessions is just as good. i especially like \\"Burning\\". Usher has proven his versatility by having hits with rappers like Luda and he can slow it down to a grind. he makes many confessions my only question is are they true?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This album is like 8701 all over again. If you want a great r&b album this album isn't it. Janet Jackson's new cd Damita Jo that comes out next week puts this cd to shame. It is much better, spend your money on that. I'm dissapointed i bought this record. I can't wait for Janet's cd next week becausei heard it and it's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than AMAZING!","review":"From the moment you press play on ur stereo, you're absolutely captured! You start to wonder, thoughts of what this album has in store for you race around your mind at 50mph! You're anxious, yet exhilirated, you're in awe (this is only if you're a commited Usher fan haha)... everything! This album is a MUST HAVE! Tracks like, Confessions, Can U Handle It and Burn give you a sweet flavor of true R&B. Usher has matured, his vocals are amazing, and what else can I say?! He's made a beautiful step forward. Stay sincere to your music and keep your fans on the edge of their seats! My hat off to you Usher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Usher is the new King of RnB","review":"Usher is now officially the new king. His album goes hard...And to all the haters out there please stop hating because he is talented...You know you tight when you can get clubs going and girls going at the same time... This album and Kanye West album is the top album of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um,Mark Davis","review":"Um,NOBODY is selling like they used too, if ya haven't noticed already!! Usher is at the peak of his career & I bet he won't be selling like he is now w/ future albums. It happens to ALL artists..so don't make Janet sound like she is flopping when she hasn't came out with a flop album since Control.By the way, you mentioned that the interludes are tired..what a loser.Who in the hell pays attention to interludes,what does that have to do with the content of the album?? Usher's album was built all on HYPE b/c of his single \\"Yeah\\" and b/c Usher's album has been number 1 for 4 weeks now does not make his album the best cd on that chart. I love Usher & Janet but Janet's cd is good while Usher's is down-right...boring & last minute material. Album sux..you are better off burning a ocpy from your friend.Saves money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not feeling it....","review":"This is an okay CD, but not near as good as his last one. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonder what his next singles will be??","review":"This album is full of fillers, the only thing exciting is the damn booklet.If ya want a good album then pick up Janet Jackson \\"Damita Jo\\", you can listen from beginning to end on that album and she has plenty of potential singles than the one she chose."},{"rating":"1","title":"So who buys this stuff?","review":"I guess inner-city kids and young white teenage girls.Confession?? Didn't we have this sound with Boyz II Men . Maybe the little formula works!So buy it so you can brag that you have the album that swept all of the Grammy's and AMA awards.** BORING **"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought the orginal Confessions and loved it. Then I heard this one. I coulda died. This is excellent. If you are looking for an excellent cd to get you up in a good mood get this one. (btw im 14 not 13) My Boo was one of the main reasons I wanted this cd! But now I am glad I got it. I love Redlight, Seduction and Confessions Pt 2 remix. Also his interlude (Confessions) is awesome then it goes on to Confessions PT 2. and there is the old interlude from the regular Confessions and the song. Usher you have outdone yourself. And because of this I cant wait for Usher to make another album! This is truely a must have for Usher fans everywhere. So I give this album 5 stars.

But, USHER is gay. I have heard rumors for years that Usher may be bisexual or gay, but now I know that it's true. Throughout \\"Do It To Me\\", USHER doesn't say GIRL, LADY, etc... OR anything else that lets us know he is talking to/about a FEMALE. LISTEN to the song now! USHER is on the down-low and this song is a HINT that he likes men, but he was sneaky enough to make a song \\"good\\" enough to make people not care about who he is talking to. WOMEN fall for Usher's tricks, but anyone with eyes and ears should know that Usher is faking it! LISTEN to \\"Do It To Me\\" now!!

I also dream of a day when Usher will be forgotten. But I guess that will never happen. Usher is so annoying...I hate Yeah and am getting quite tired of it myself. And Usher is not a poet. Bob Dylan is a poet, but he doesn't like the word. Paul McCartney is a poet. John Lennon was a poet...Rest in peace, man. Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson are/were poets. James Brown, to a certain extent, is a poet. Usher is doomed to fade away. In fifty years, who do you think will be remembered? The Beatles, or Usher? I'll give you a hint--35 years after their breakup, and 25 years after Lennon's all-too-early demise, the Beatles still have a large teen following (myself included). So forget Usher. If you want to hear a good soul singer, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder all qualify. Usher simply doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"seen it all before been there done that","review":"what usher is doing right now is no different from what michael jackson has done already with the dancing, singing and clothing styles usher is doing. Usher has already been there done that too, I liked his music until he released this crappy album. He's talented but anything but original. I wish you little girls would stop acting like he's some sex god and realize that he's just a poser copying what's been done already before and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rap artist stealing other people's sounds , how typical!","review":"Usher,in his Confessions album used synthesizer riffs which were taken from my songs , without my permission and without paying for it.In his song called \\"Yeah\\" , keyboard riffs( they even kept it in the same key ) were taken from my song called \\" Girl from Istanbul \\" , which I had composed and posted on my websites before christmast 2003 , way before Usher's album was released.Also in his song \\"Burn\\" a short synthesizer burst used as a sound effect was taken from my song \\"Turqouise\\" , which is too much of a coincidence.Rap artists and producers are stealing other people's songs and sounds just to sell albums and make money and the general public are considering them great artists , which is a shame really.To have your unbiased opinion about this subject please visit my website at Music.download.com and search for artist BC Anatolia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious Usher?","review":"I like Usher but he is seriously over doing it. He is totally franchised now and why does his songs all have the same vocals? He is not that great of a singer..His dance moves are basicly the same as they always are.

Usher always had it going on, but he keeps raising the bar of excellence. Love, love, love the entire album. Usher's known for his ballads, so you know going into it, there'll be a nice selection of songs such as Burn, Throwback .Loving Burn, but Throwback, even though the beat sets a nice groove, the chorus is a little too predictable. Loving Take your Hand and Simple Things. But the one that won't escape my head and will probably be the next single is Bad Girl, this track isn't the \\"typical\\" Usher you'd expect, and that's why this catchy tune caught my attention.

This album did nothing for me. I'm only giving it 1 star because I actually like \\"Yeah\\" and \\"Throwback\\". Other than that it sucks big time. 8701 is my all time favorite. His songs were hotter because he had his \\"muse\\" Chilli, in his life. But now that girlfriend split, his music juice has too. Usher is very talented; a triple threat, but he's becoming too thug for my likings. If he hasn't done it yet, soon he'll be bashing women in his music like some of 'em rappers of today. (e.g. think MC Hammer. He started singing,We Gotta Pray to Pumps in a Bumps-or whatever) Or better yet, to work his image, he'll probably get all gangsta on us and be part of this west coast/east coast war.

Thats not a song. thats 3 of the most annoying notes repeated over and over again untill you could go insane. then, theres talking over it. thats not music. listen to bethoven or some of the clasic rock out there. its better than this stuff. so, if you are a person looking for creativity, look elsewhere, because with an album like this, you will just be getting the same old rap songs with a few notes that are catchy for awhile, but then grow more annoying and annoying and annoying. but i guess if you're into that kind of stuff, this might be your holy grail.

Go Usher!Anyway Confessions is a more mature sound of Usher. More R+B.I love the CD and when I listen to it I notice that hes alot more real on this album then his previous CDs. His vocals are alot better and he manages to reach some ptetty high notes on some songs...So this CD is definently a must have especially for Usher fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not better..But good enough","review":"Ok maybe not his best..At first i did not like this album at all...But after I actually sat and listened to it..I cant stop..It grows on you so I wouldnt say it was his best. His last album I loved from the door. So I give this album a four. It is one of my favorite albums for the year and I would reccommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Confessions\\" says it all","review":"There have been many attempts to create a sucessful formula for a classic R & B album, but Usher has placed himself in the likes of those greats like Marvin Gaye, Prince, and even the king of pop himself, Micheal Jackson. After being the first male R & B artist to sell a million records within it's initial release, he still reigns supreme on the charts. From beggining to end, \\"Confessions\\" will take you on a journey from a adolescent boy's mistakes to a more conscientious man's way of life. \\"Confessions\\", may be his best album yet. From tracks like the hit single \\"Yeah,\\" featuring Lil' Jon and Ludacris to \\"Can u handle it,\\" usher keeps you wanting more. If you've never been a fan, this album could very likely sway you his way.To those that are fans already you'll love to see how far he's come as an artist and as an individual.Peace up A-town down."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 MILLION SALES WITH A SO SO ALBUM!!!!","review":"this album confessions is not all that impressive. I expected much better material From an album that sold 4 million copies within a couple of months. I do give him credit for the song \\"Bad Girl\\" at least he thought outside the box with this one. It's a well put together original song & in my opinion the only other single on this album. \\"Simple Things\\" isn't bad but It's gets boring after awhile just like most of the songs on this album. Final thoughts: pick up the CD and judge for yours"},{"rating":"2","title":"Usher is bangin!!!!!!!!!","review":"The cd definately does it!! i love Yeah & Burn and i hope Caught Up will be a single too. Throwback [prod. by Just Blase] also rocks - potential single as well. umm i'd have to say 8701 was better in my opinion.. i heard Usher recorded with R. Kelly and the Neptunes for this album, and it's a shame dem tracks didn't make the cut...Go get it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD!","review":"I rather enjoyed for the most part the songs I've heard on Confessions. Besides Yeah and Burn I also think Confessions Pt 2, Caught Up, and The Truth Hurts are very good songs. I also like the fact that he has something to say, some substance. If you compare this album to MOST R&B albums or albums in general you have to admit it is a pretty solid album. My only criticism would be that the music and beats tend to sound the same making it seems like you are hearing the same song with a different title at times and that is the only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 star. If you like Confessions then I also recommend the new CD by Janet Jackson, Damita Jo! I did enjoy Confessions but I also think Damita Jo is actually better than Confessions and I have noticed that a lot of the reviewers are also recommending Damita Jo as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"another Average Album from Usher","review":"His voice is only slightly better than the last time out.the Material here is a dime a dozen save for a couple of cuts.He is all hype&little substance.He is More closer to Being a Poor Man's Bobby Brown than even daring being Considered another Michael Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is disapointing!","review":"After waiting for this album for almost 2 years I thought I would be getting a great Cd with great pieces of songs and I was very wrong,all the songs excepy \\"Burn\\" are horrid and ripped off other songs!If you want a great CD then dont get this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Usher-I Confess This Album Is Horrible","review":"why do people buy into this garbage,dont get me wrong i like usher but these last two albums seem fake.hes using the same formula all these other talentless cats r using,u know what i mean get a high priced producer,throw in some of the latest trends and you got yourself a hit.this album is a supreme disappointment,it has about 2 or 3 good songs but thats about it,the rest r just fill-ins.DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE"},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"I looked forward to this CD after 8701.Disappointment.Though Usher's voice is still as smooth and sweet as ice-cream, the material, particularly the ballads, are yawn-inducing bores. The only songs that shined were TAKE YOUR HAND and FOLLOW ME, the last two songs on the CD. It's a drag to buy and listen through a whole album to find two good songs. In addition, I found Usher, both the persona or that actual artist, quite unlikable. The song CONFESSIONS begin with his assertion of being a man and confessing that he cheated on his partner; I don't think a \\"real\\" man, a man of integrity, would have cheated in the first place! Too, Usher thanks God in his liner notes, claiming \\"My creativity, my drive and abilities are unmatched.\\" That lack of humility turned me off, big time.Obviously there are many others that disagree based on the sales of this, but I would highly recommend that someone preview it before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is hot","review":"i dont like r&b but this dude can sing i wont take anything away from him. this cd is fire and i recomend it whether u like r&b or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"da bomb!!","review":"ok i would just like to say that usher's album is not only good,but hella awesome,amazing,he's jus talkin bout his life lately ,he's inspired by his relationship with chilli dat ended a few months ago...and he talks realy good bout it in his songs...i admire him as an artist,and since i've seen him live in the TRUTH TOUR ,concert in Paris,i loveeeee himm!da way he moves on stage,da passion he shows in all his songs..it's absolutely incredible!and since then,i'm listenin to \\"Confessions\\" dailyyyyyy!!!great great album fa real!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, but not as good as 8701","review":"Upon first listen, it is evident that Usher has done some growing up since his last cd, 8701, with the incredibly personal and deep \\"Confessions.\\" However, his new found maturity in music doesn't neccesarily mean better music. Don't get me wrong, Confessions is an excellent album and better than 90 percent of the R&B out today with such stand out tracks as \\"Truth Hurts\\" (best track off the cd by far), \\"Thats what its made for,\\" \\"Confessions Pt. II,\\" and \\"Take your hand.\\" Burn and Yeah are so ridiculously played out by now that their roles on the CD have been reduced to \\"skip me\\" tracks.

There were only like 4 songs that were good or have the potential to be singles. These songs are Yeah, Burn, Throwback, and Caught Up. This album was in my opinion horrible. It was his worst album.

Usher should have collaborated more with Lil Jon and Ludacris. Although the song has been a mainstay at radio, it gets better with each listen. Radio is also jumping on board with the down tempo tracks, \\"Burn\\" and \\"Confessions\\". Both of these songs are languid ballads that have nothing new to offer. Speaking of nothing new, the track \\"Do It To Me\\" borrows the music from Prince's 'Purple Rain' song \\"Beautiful Ones\\", but there is no Prince writing credit on the song. Since Mariah Carey covered \\"Beautiful Ones\\" a fews years ago, Usher should have come up with something more original. The entire CD needs an influx of orginality. The reason that \\"Yeah\\" was an instant hit is because it was something new and different from Mr. Raymond.

Go elsewhere for a more mature book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indian culture + American culture = ?","review":"Lahiri presents a riveting outlook on American culture's affect on people from India in this collection of short stories. Most of the stories involve assimilation, which proves to be quite interesting, for in doing so, Lahiri provides accurate Indian information and is really able to show the importance of keeping one's heritage (or in some cases, the importance of adapting a new one). Mixed in with this theme are several others, such as relationships. Lahiri's stories contain a good bit of symbolism, too, which I really enjoyed. Overall, this book is a great read for those interested in other cultures, relationships, and digging for meaning within a work. None of the works are humorous, if that's what you are into. Most are pretty sad. Not all are 5 stars, but I couldn't give this collection anything less.

I would definitely recommend this book. I liked 'When Mr. Pirzada came to dine', 'Sexy', 'Mrs. Sen's', and 'The Third and final continent' the most. I didn't like 'Real durwan' at all as I couldn't see the point. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see Ms. Lahiri's knowledge of Bengal, Bengali culture, and little bitty Bengali things (e.g, refugees from East Bengal being nostalgic about their glorious past life before partition; making a hole in the middle of a pile of rice to put lentils; Bengalis' typical love of fresh fish etc.)It was a pleasure reading.

They pull the readers as well as the characters in the stories, make them stop and think again rather than just tell the intended meaninngs.Lahiri uses a few strategies in her stories such as a little child's point of view, notes on commodities that have some symbolic meanings, and detailed description of usually the small events happening every day.Therefore, the readers who like short stories will also love this book all tbe more, not just because it needs just one-sitting to read it, also because the feelings or revelation they get probably will be no longer \\"A temporary matter.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read this review, read the book","review":"I don't want to give five stars to Jhumpa Lahiri because I feel that if I do, there will be no place left for improvement (not that there is). \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" is probably one of the best short story collections I have ever read in my life. Unlike many of my other favorite authors (let's say Marquez), Lahiri is consistent in her quality of writing throughout the book. At a first glance her themes seem very commonplace, but her language is so eloquent, her sense of mood and detail so subtle, that everything simple turns into profound. The next day I had finished reading Lahiri's book, she won the Pulitzer Prize -- but again, who cares. The only thing that matters to me is that Lahiri has given me a new hope in modern literature. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Colorful Array of Tales","review":"I'm not usually one for short stories, but these nine tales revolving around East Indian Americans are so well written, they're not to be missed. The stories range in experience from a woman who has an affair with a married Indian man, a young couple who reveal their innermost secrets when the power in their building is shut off, and one of my favorites, of a young Indian man who comes to MIT to work and rents a room from an elderly woman. They're haunting, and sometimes surprising, but all are little gems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetry without Depth","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. I liked her narrative; her description of the setting is very detailed and maintains a poetic flow. You can practically visualize the scene. However, I felt the stories themselves could not stand up very well on their own. Mostly every story seemed to begin and end w/ the description of the setting. It was as if the stories themselves had no point; they were created to accomodate the setting. Most of her stories seemed to lack depth; but perhaps that was due to the way she portrayed her characters as being too superficial. I didnt like most of her characters, and I didnt find their actions justifiable. The author provided no depth to her characters. Just 2-dimensional figures. This was what disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I'd been eagerly awaiting this after having read Ms. Lahiri's stories in the New Yorker...and further, as an Indian-American, I am always interested in and frequently disappointed by the perspective offered by writers of the same background.

Read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At long last.","review":"Like other readers commenting here, I was also blown away by her stories in the New Yorker.

The running theme of India vs. America helped hold together my train of thought, but each story had something special to offer. A relatively easy, but fulfilling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't live up to the accolades","review":"The first story, \\"A Temporary Matter\\", captured my interest in a way that made me very enthusiastic about the whole collection. Unfortunately, the rest of the book fails to live up to that excellent beginning.While Lahiri's writing is clearly well-crafted, she seems to lack a sense of irony, and that lack all too often creates a rather precious tone to this collection. Too much of it has the feel of workshop stories-- writing created in an MFA program somewhere and aiming at the small press market--There *are* exceptionally good stories here, \\"Sexy\\" and \\"This Blessed House\\" both live up to the standards set by the first, but this is a writer whose voice needs to mature, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent; perhaps not Pulitzer though","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading Ms. Lahiri's collected stories, having never been exposed to any in their original magazine locations. The stories were captivating, and at times imparted cultural bits of knowledge I had not known. At other times, they simply displayed people with raw human emotions and needs; people whose fates I was interested to discover.I still have ambivalent feelings on whether or not this deserved the Pulitzer prize, because at times I do sense a sort of \\"predictability\\" in the writing style and Ms. Lahiri's way of finishing each story with a bit of a \\"punch\\". However, none of this detracted from the enjoyment and I surely would commend to anyone who asked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interpreter of Maladies","review":"Author is an excellent writer. Her descriptions of characters and places are succinct and easily accessible to the reader. I recommend this book to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The stories are well written and would likely be given an \\"A\\" in a college composition class but are not the least memorable or even particularly entertaining.I don't understand why this book has gotten so much attention.kate black"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulitzer Material?","review":"While I admit I am a short story novice, preferring novels, I have to say that I was very disappointed with Ms. Lahiri's freshman effort. The book wasn't bad, but i never felt the passion for the characters that I expected (save Mrs. Sen), and found the writing a bit simple. But a quick, decent read- and I expect great things to come from Lahiri."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but nothing great.","review":"I felt cheated after reading this collection of short stories. I fail to understand what all the hoopla is about. Lahiri's writing style is heavy handed, and the characters she creates are weirdly one dimensional. If you want to read something really gripping, try anything by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala or Bharati Mukherjee instead. Pass this over."},{"rating":"1","title":"The woman reading these CDs is atrocious","review":"I enjoyed the book when I read it but I deeply dislike this audio CD version, mainly because of the woman reading it. Specifically:- she destroys a lot of indian words. For e.g., she calls the Indian writer Tagore, \\"Tagor-e\\" & she misprounounced Benarasi saris (saris from the city of Benaras) as Bensari. This shows no preparation or passion for her job.- Her attempts at mimicking accents are woeful. She ended up sounding like someone from Africa when she tried to do an Indian accent. Further, she makes a British accent sound American!It is pretty obvious that the producers were cheapskates and got someone that didn't charge a lot. They should've gotten the author or an Indian born in the US to read this book.Save yourself some time. Go read the book yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is great, but CD awful!","review":"This review is for the CD (audio) version of Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri. I actually liked the writing and stories, but the reader, Matilda Novak, was terrible for this work. She may be excellent for other books that need a perky and cheerful white woman, but it was a mistake to choose her for this book. It really ruins an otherwise good piece of writing.What made it especially difficult for me was that I had just listened to Lahiri's more recent work, Unaccustomed Earth, read by Sarita Choudhury & Ajay Naidu. Not only is Unaccustomed Earth an excellent collection of stories, but Choudhury & Naidu become the characters in these stories and significantly enhance the book. They are a perfect fit for Lahiri's stories. I was really impressed and was looking forward to more of the same in Interpreter of Maladies. Big disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Collection of Stories","review":"I am not a reader who normally chooses from this particular genre. However, I was very pleased by this collection of short stories. I've just finished this book in about four hours. The characters make you long that there was a novel about each of them with which you could spend time. With the characterizations and attention to detail, this book should become beloved. Buy this book and relish it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully Refreshing....","review":"This book comes like a wonderful breather, portraying experiences that are so universal yet dealt with in a style that is so natural and lucid.The writer has a wonderful way with words which touches one and all by the sheer irony of the experiences that the characters go through. The characters transcend time and space to reveal the quintessential human nature in all it's various forms.The events could happen to anyone, anywhere. Probably, therein lies the universality of the stories. Reading the book you emerge deeply touched.We have here one of those rare breed of writers who has the promise to deliver more in the years to come.Highly recommended for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"So young, and yet so sensitive and talented.","review":"I was astonished that a woman as young as Ms. Lahiri was able to write so eloquently and sensitively about people of such different ages and experiences. I see some readers question whether this book should have won the Pulitzer prize. I have no comment on that. I chose to read it not because of the prize but because there has been some interesting writing coming out of India lately and becasue as an American I am always intrigued by the clash and interaction of cultures. I may not have enjoyed all the stories equally, but three of them - The Third and Final Continent, Mrs. Sens, and Mr Pirzada Comes to Dinner - moved me deeply, to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read.....","review":"Consumer Perspective: Great read! I enjoyed killing time seeing through her eyes and those of her characters.....Critic's Perspective (there's one in all of us): You can get lost in the details. Stories ended up following a pattern. Most stories always had a little twist in the end which sometimes made them predictable.My perspective: Wicked stuff by a foxy author."},{"rating":"1","title":"comatose","review":"My apologies to those that found this novel, a piece of art. Having roots in the sub-continent myself this book caught my attention almost immediatly. After finishing it in one stretch over the weekend I fail to find anything inspiring or particularily commendable about this book.In short, it is simply a series of monotonous accounts of various immigrants' dull and discontented lives in America that seem to drift aimlessly into a null........is the author telling us that immigrants in America though second generation are never at ease with their surroundings?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Defining disorder!!!","review":"Mr. Kapasi defines disorder as his full time job!!! What happened to Bibi Haldar and Boori Ma?... or reading this novel might make some Indians remember those days of transition from Indian to American culture as the final story - \\"The third and final continent\\" does. Jhumpa Lahiri's \\"Interperter of Maladies\\" won the Pulitzer prize for 2000 proving that to be an award winning literary work, it does not have to be confusing and complex. Two thumbs up for simplicity winning... Being of an Indian descent settled in the US, I found this collage of short stories sometimes nostalgic, sometimes a bit too familiar. The characters came to life in her stories. One feels the emotions that they are going through as the story builds up. The ending of many of her stories left much to the imagination of the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, depressing, depressing.","review":"Did I mention that this was relentlessly depressing? So little kindness, joy, or optimism to be found amongst all these characters. I would have given this one star, but for the author's ability to write well. I read all but the last story and couldn't continue. Sorry I spent the money; I could have just given myself paper-cuts for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful prose","review":"I was utterly awed by the mastery of language as the written art form, expressing a genuine imitation of Life. Each story is a unique gem, and put together to be savored in this anthology, one can't help but be swept away by the amazing power Lahiri displays over the telling of fictional tales that ring only true in our multifaceted humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"These stories are not just about the immigrant experience, but also about people in general, and how they relate to each other. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mending and Blending Cultural Mores.....","review":"The beautifully crafted tales in the INTERPRETER OF MALADIES by Jhumpa Lahiri are easily embraced and full of genuine empathy..The collection of richly elegant stories all deal with the lives of Indian emigrants in the New World as they cope with their culture's strict traditional beliefs.Ms. Lahiri's writing is a soft suggestive prose style that speaks to the reader stirringly.The descriptions are so clear that the reader's senses awaken to the sounds, smells, and bright colors of rich eastern intrigue and heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"I read this book for my Book Club.I absolutely love Lahiri's writing. Interpreter of Maladies is a series of short stories that are perfectly written.Writing a short story is extremely difficult and Lahiri is a master. In few pages, she neatly describes a scene, builds a story, describes unforgettable characters, and makes us feel the passion of the moment.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interpreter of Maladies","review":"\\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" is a wonderful collection of short stories about the Indian/American experience. I've read it and I have given it as a gift to someone whose literary taste I admire."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good, so good!","review":"This book is so good. It is a very delicate book about people getting in touch with different cultures, questioning their own roots and getting puzzled and sometimes even disoriented by all that. But the way the stories are written is really amazing. They are so envolving that one gets sad when the book ends. I was reading one sotry a day so that I could savour it slowly, like a good wine. Sometimes they are sad, sometimes they are really funny! I found myself reading out loud a couple of times! But the best is the last one, which in many senses summarises the whole book. \\"The third and last continent\\" is so touching, so deep that I have to say it is one of the best short stories I have ever read. It is difficult even to think about it without getting seriously emotional. It is a great book. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting stories","review":"This is truly some of the best writing I've come across in a long time. The stories--especially the last one--leave you thinking for days afterward. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stories written by recipe","review":"I too wanted to love this book, and assumed I would, given the praise it has been given. I thought the first story, A Temporary Matter was excellent, but all the rest were predictable. I could anticipate what was going to happen before it did, giving me the odd feeling that I had somehow read these stories before. People talk about \\"workshop stories\\" and I have never been able to put my finger on what it is. I still have trouble defining what the problem is with this kind of story (and I graduated from a workshop myself) but now I realize that I know it when I read it. Perfectly fine stories, nicely written, but ultimately dull and uninspired, as if written from a recipe: add one conflict to one exotic setting, one case of infidelity, abuse, or angst, sprinkle with spare, clever writing and stir."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big fuss about?","review":"I must say I am taken aback by all the attention this book has been getting. It is a very well written book, but to me its main flaw is precisely that: it is \\"well written.\\" These short stories seem to come out of a creative writing program designed to get you published in magazines like the New Yorker. They are well-constructed but bland. Ms. Lahiri's voice is preppy and impersonal. I recommend the last story, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice insight","review":"I enjoyed this collection of stories a lot. It did seem to have a constant theme of life in an arranged marriage running through it. It gives the reader a look into a culture that many people don't really know about. Though at times you'll wish that Lahiri addressed other issues, the book makes for an interesting and entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"There is so much life in this small collection of stories - each one a flawless portrait of motion, of sadness - that it recalls something that could only be held in the vacuum of the soul. Only a pen personal and brave could turn these feelings into words on a page. These enjoyable tales will stay with you - in the waking hours and in dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulitzer Prize winning book","review":"I've made it a habit of reading the Pulitzer Prize winners for Fiction; I find the Pulitzer is one of the most reliable recommendations for strong literature. This book of short stories (and winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 2000) is no exception. The first story in particular is heart-breaking and riveting; the other stories follow suit. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Short Stories","review":"I am so pleased with this book. Its in line of work of Amy Tan... Pretty much breath taking, you cannot leave it untill you reach the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious in its trite depictions of \\"Indianness\\"!","review":"A book that shows little or no skill with the wielding of words or language. All it has going for it is the banal approach to immigration and ideas of nationality. It quite put me to sleep!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"It is one of those books that gets a lot of attention and reading it you don't understand why. It didn't engage me, I didn't find it thought provoking, simple immigrant tales that left me cold --- and not because I am not interested in immigrant stories. If you like bland and boring and without a spark, but 'nice sentences', and if you are of Indian descent, this is your book; if nor, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Disappointed!","review":"After reading the positive reviews, I bought this book with too much enthusiam and I feel that was partially a reason for my disappointment. I had way more expectation from this author than what I had to settle with. These are a compilation of short stories that do not leave you satified. I was able to finish the book within a very short time and it left me looking for substance! Being a south-asian, I can relate to some of the stories described but then again there isn't anything to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the lover of short stories","review":"My only complaint with this book is that some of the stories were so good that I wanted them to continue. Each story was captivating and held my interest, and that is really saying something because I am not an avid reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection of short stories!","review":"This is a great collection of short stories. You never seem to realise that this is the author's first publication. The narration is simple, lucid and the story just flows naturally, and you keep turning up the pages and before you even know you have begun the next story. What is more striking is that the characters she potraits are people whom we meet all the time, neither like the fictional heros nor like the fictional villans. They are the typical people next door, and she shows that all of them have their own story. A great book. I will probably read it again, after all \\"A thing of beauty is a joy forever\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking when the stories end. You want more!","review":"A great read. Each story was surprising in its wisdom and poignant observations of the ordinary. This book took me into people's hearts that I had never thought of and made me feel for them. Every sentence had a purpose and was so well executed--no wonder it won a Pulitzer. A wonderful choice for anyone who wants to expand their knowledge of other cultures and/or enjoys beautifully written prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscent of Marquez...but w/ a twist!","review":"I read this book in about four hours --but it certainly deserved to be savored! Each story was precise and elegant, to the point that they seemed to be like hand-crafted pieces. Lahiri's excellent prose was thoroughly engaging but did not at all seem pretentious. Her style kind of reminded me of G.G.Marquez, but without the magical realism. Her style is all her own, but you can't help but get the feeling that the stories had a mythical, almost fable-like tinge to it. The stories addressed all points of life --from failed marriages, the life of immigrants, love, and more. The stories transcend ethnic and geographical boundaries and will draw the reader in. It's wholly entertaining that you'll find yourself finishing the book without even knowing it! Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a few good stories, entertaining","review":"This is an entertaining book, the author has a knack for satire and dry humor, and vivid descriptions of the characters, surroundings and situations. Well written. One star has been knocked off, since many stories seem to end abruptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"short stoires with big messages","review":"Jhumpa is a wonder writter, I have enjoyed the last weeks researching her life on becomeing a pulizer prize author. Interpreter of maladies is a wonder book to read, some stories are slow going but other are very heart felt. Jhumpa describes the differece in culture beautifully, each story opens a new door to a life of a new character. I recommend this book to any student that is doing a book report, summer reading or doing reading as a past time. I recomend that you read the last chapter\\" the third and final continent\\" very slowy. I enjoyd this this short story the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"The stories in this book accomplish what a short story should. The reader gets a slice of the character's life and problems. The stories are thoughtful and intresting. Most of the issues that are delt with in the book are that of unhappy relationships.I would also like to say to the reader who said that it didn't diserve the pulitzer if it was published after 9/11, that the book was published in 1999. Also it won the pulitzer for the year 2000, which was also before 9/11."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing stories","review":"These stories are engaging and fresh. The author has a clean style that I appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated simply because of its \\"Indianness\\"","review":"Overly simplistic, pointless and verging on Indian history 101. Read them and you come away saying \\"What ?\\" At best, they belong to the \\"women's magazines\\" of old, under their \\"Story of the Week\\" column. India is \\"in\\" for now. Such writers wouldn't get a second look if it weren't."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Won A What?","review":"This is the kind of writing that should win only rejection letters from editors. Blah blah blah. It's all \\"tell\\" not \\"show.\\" Anyone can tell a story -- the challenge is to attempt to dramatize it. This tendency -- as in Nathan Englander -- to merely tell the story is perhaps due to the reading public's desire (and hence publishers') for biographies. Whatever the cause of its being actually published, without its so-called exotic flavor, this book would to this date only be available on Ms Lahiri's hard drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"As short in thought as it is in length","review":"How this sub-par piece of work won a Pulitzer is beyond me. If an award was given for these dull short stories, I guess I should get my acceptance speech ready for next year's Pulitzers after I win one for this review. No personality in this bland collection and nothing much about it to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories that stick","review":"Lahiri creates a series of memorable characters who struggle with life, love, and identity on the borders of culture. I found myself relating to many of the characters and their dilemmas were all too real. The writing is tight and focused and helps bring the characters to life. I highly recommend this collection of beautiful short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earnest and poignant","review":"Jhumpa Lahiri's short stories largely revolve around the Bengali community in the United States - a subject she is presumably comfortable with, given that she is a Bengali-American herself.While the socio-cultural setting of the stories is somewhat restricted, the appeal of the stories themselves is universal, revealing poignant facets of ordinary human lives which most of us can identify with. The style is subdued and understated, very much in consonance with the unpretentious nature of the themes chosen.This is not a work typical of an Indian-English author. There is none of the literary demonstrativeness and stylistic exuberance of the Salman Rushdies and Arundhati Roys. Instead, there is a simplicity and sincerity of purpose which strikes a chord with the reader.An excellent first effort and a good launching pad for leaping towards the higher realms of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surreal peek into Indian Lives...A graceful book","review":"Ms. Jhumpa Lahiri is one of those authors with an eye for detail...her words flow from the pages and you drift into and are caught into her enchanting words filled with hope, dreams, bluntness, shock, reality, etc... These stories tell tales of Indian men and women alike living in America who deal with issues such as death, infedility,hopelessness, etc... A beautiful piece of prose which needs to be applauded!! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to explore the realms of reality and truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"[...]","review":"The book is priceless. Stories felt strangely familiar, especially the ones that related to events in own life. Not all stories in the book were equally moving though, probably because her writing will seem ordinary to a reader who has not lived or experienced her book. Love her writings style.. book is inexpensive and reads quick. Suggestion, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a gem","review":"My book group read this book last fall and it was the only book every one of us has loved. Lahiri's writing is a joy to read and her characters have stayed with me. So often I recall the sights and smells in Mrs. Sen's apartment or remember the couple and the old woman in the final story. This book is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pen of realiy and paper of reflection.","review":"Jhumpa Lahiri, writes a book with a pen of reality and paper of reflection. Giving the book a easy to read and pleasant feeling. Also it has a kind of a tang of the oddity of bengali culture. The book is cross cultural and may be difficult if one is not familiar with bengali lifestyles. Only thing is that in the story Interpreter of Maladies, no self respecting Rutgers University proffessor would live in New Brunswick (look where I am from) . Most of the stories have a twist to the ending, but definitely a good feeling of reality.
