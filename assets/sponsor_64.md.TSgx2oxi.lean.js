These songs were not for her, but it was forced down her throat anyway. Only the title track stands out, but as for the rest of the songs (in Stacy's words), they were Whitney Houston rejects. As Stacy was facing the competition with Whitney and soon to be superstar, Janet Jackson, the Collition records tried to make her into a pop artist, but her vocals were way too soulful for these pieces of crap that they were feeding her. Her previous albums were good to outstanding, but this was what closed the deal with Collition records before she re-jumpstarted her career with her move to Motown records in 1986.

If you want to see if Jimmy can get the ring, and give it to the Hag before she can dry up the pond, read the book to find out.Jimmy and I have some things in common, but not many. One thing in common is we both are brave. Another is that we're both kind.The proper audience for this book is ages 6-12 years old.

To get the ring he has to go to a palace and find it for himself.I can compare Jimmy to my brother because he never gives up and they both love their families dearly. I can also compare Gracie, a little green frog, to a clown or a wonderful pet because she is always there to make people happy or to get into trouble. Gracie is also my favorite character because she spiced up the book.The appropriate audience for this book is anywhere from preschool to 8th grade.Will Jimmy be able to save his pond and his father in a different body? Or will his human form stop him?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark's review","review":"Have you ever imagined what life would be like in a different body?

He also has to save his home from the evil hag and to try to find his daddy. While he was in the castle, he tried to get the ring from the prince. He also had to escape with his friend, Gracie, that is captured by the princess, Sally.I think this is an excellent book and people who like mystery and adventure books should read it.

The amount of care that went into making this look this good this is amazing. In fact, it probably looks better than when aired originally.As a production, the Magoo version of A Christmas Carol is very faithful to the original story, full of mood, and with great music and optimism. Animation and production buffs will enjoy the commentaryfeature of how a major cartoon special in that era of broadcasting came into being. This is a must have if you have a Christmas film collection. Suitable for children beginning ages 3-4, with something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've done it again, Magoo!","review":"For those of us growing up in the 1960s, Jim Backus & Mr. Magoo were staples. We all laughed hilariously as the near-sighted, bumbling, Mr. Magoo weaved his way through the day to day of living, and usually survived with very little going wrong for him. Such could not be said of those who path crossed his! What I liked about Mr. Magoo cartoons most was there was no major violence, no one ever died, and the characters and events were happy. Children were always smiling and anticipating Mr. Magoo's next mis-step. Magoo's Christmas Carol is just such a tale. The story line follows the original story written by Charles Dickens, but the writers have adjusted it to the world of Quincy Magoo. The tale is highlighted with specially-written music and songs to embellish the story. Christmas is even more cherished with the options of watching good-hearted Mr. Magoo celebrate the holiday. Every home should have the privilege of watching Mr. Magoo at Christmas time.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun !","review":"This is a fun version of A Christmas Carol. Some of the music is really funny - adds a different dimension to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old Holiday Classic","review":"Mr. Magoo is an old classic. Who doesn't remember watching his original cartoons with his bad eyesight and odd vocal cadence. I can't say that I remember watching this cartoon much though so it was somewhat new to me when watching it 50 years after it's release. The translation to Blu-Ray is good but I did have trouble with the audio. My kids and I all had trouble picking up words, especially spoken by Mr. Magoo. I know that is often his usual way of speaking but it was frustrating. The musical breakouts were also fun but not my favorite thing. I guess it's a personal preference.The bonus stuff was good and always adds value to the experience.It's nice having on Blu-Ray but I'm not sure if it really makes a difference watching this on Blu-Ray or DVD.Although (and I know this is not the popular opinion) this is not a holiday favorite of mine it has been packaged and presented very nicely.I was provided a sample copy for a fair and honest review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect For Kids","review":"Like so many other reviewers here, I grew up with this annual treat, and the DVD renews fond memories. But this particular TV special did something much more important for me in the long run--it got me interested in reading. I read the Dickens story as a result of watching it, and that led to a lifelong love of the written word. I'm a novelist now, and I owe it all to Mr. Magoo!PARENTS, TAKE NOTE: The story is terrific, the songs are delightful, and every kid loves Mr. Magoo. And it manages to get the positive love-thy-neighbor message across in 52 animated minutes, with every famous moment and famous line intact--a lot easier on smaller children than the many 2-hour movie versions with live actors. Try parking your kids in front of this. Maybe they will do what I did and reach for the book. And watch it with them--it really is beautiful, and you'll enjoy it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Version of the Dickens Classic","review":"I was hooked on Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol from its first broadcast on television in 1962. Even after it disappeared from television for a while, I could still remember all the songs, memorized back when I was seven and eight years old. The idea of making the Carol a play Magoo was appearing in on Broadway was a stroke of genius; the wraps with the \\"Back on Broadway\\" song are done for laughs and then the Carol portion is fairly serious with only a few sight gags. I love all the songs, and several of them can leave me in tears, and of course everyone remembers \\"razzleberry dressing\\"! The new DVD version is wonderful, crisp, clean, bright, and with good sound. Some commentary or even a small making-of special might have been nice, but in the end, I don't care: when I play the DVD, it's 1962 and I'm singing along to the songs all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted at all.","review":"I was extremely disappointed in what I ordered. I had wanted to see\\" Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol\\" and that's what it says I'm getting.

I played it over and over, checking all of the options, and that's all there is on this DVD. I really had wanted to show this to my students at school, and unfortunately, I wasn't able to.I have never ordered anything online, so this has been a real disappointment to me.

I think it would be a great buy for anyone. Gather the family together, sit down...take some time out from the shopping to enjoy this wondeful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever since I was a little girl...","review":"This movie has been a holiday tradition for my parents and I for as long as I can remember. Every year on Christmas Eve, we fill up on delectibles, while watching Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol and laughing our butts off! The three beggars' song is the GREATEST, and the part that always made me sad as a child was when Scrooge (Magoo) went back to his childhood... \\"A hand for each hand is grand in the world, why won't my fingers reach? Millions of grains of sand in the world, why such a lonely beach? Where is a voice to answer mine back? Where are two shoes that click to my clack? I'm all alone in the world...\\"This is by FAR the best version of the classic Christmas Story, short of MAYBE Albert Finney's Scrooge. Great to watch with kids, and trust me when I say they'll enjoy it well into adulthood. Make it your family's tradition starting NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickens to Magoo","review":"This adaptation of the Dickens classic takes many liberties with the origional, but is the best introduction to the classic ever made for youngsters. The music is by broadway's best. I love to watch it every year as I have for many decades. A winner of a holiday classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH","review":"I was so happy that by simply surfing amazon that I was able to find this old classic and one of my family's favorite Christmas cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Magoo, you've done it again!","review":"Mr. Magoo comes thorugh in a heart-warming rendition of Dickens' Christmas Carol. It's just as I remembered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol","review":"Oh! Mr. Magoo, you've done it again! What a wonderful, nostalgic, wholesome short movie. Back in the day when there was a great message to be learned, even from a cartoon. Great for children, grandchildren and grown-ups alike.The color in this DVD is much more vibrant than the VHS tape. Please add it to your collection of cartoon, Christmas movies, or Scrooge/Christmas Carol DVDs. You truly won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Mr. Magoo","review":"Just as delightful as I remembered from my childhood! For a younger crowd, the animation and music is well developed. The story is wonderfully told and pertinent in it's message. Definitely classic Mr. Magoo. It is now on my must see annual Christmas stories list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol","review":"Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol dvd is a return to my childhood for me. I always watched Mr. Magoo cartoons when I was growing up. He is such a character! The characters voices are those of very memorable actors of the era. This dvd will bring back memories for all of those people who cherish this cartoon figure. It is also a very nice addition to my collection of Christmas dvds. If you want to break up the Christmas \\"drama\\" with some animation this is definitely one of those animation dvds to own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to share memory with kids","review":"Good first experience with this classic. Easier for little ones than Alistair Sims (have that one too!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"audio is crappy","review":"I have the original DVD and the audio on that DVD is much better...the audio on the new DVD is awful.Two notables:1) the audio transition from the credits to the beginning \\"broadway\\" scene is bad...again, compar it to the original DVD and you'll see.2) They actually shortetend the opening credits by a couple of seconds...not a big deal but still, why do this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the movie as a child!","review":"However, the copies I received (which I was going to give to my brother for a Christmas present) had terrible audio.

When it was played on cable this last year, I was unaware of it until after the fact. Please release this charming classic again. It brings back so much of my childhood back to me. I even remember many of the songs. Please bring back the childhood to many viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"brings back the kid at heart & your sense of caring for all","review":"It has been a tradition in my house for well over 30 years. Every year at Christmas we watch this great classic and every year we all have that big lump in our throat at the end of the movie. The tape I have is very worn. I hope they release the movie again soon............"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 6 yr old loved it -- and she's never heard of Mr. Magoo","review":"If you are wondering whether kids who have never heard of Mr. Magoo would give a hoot about this program, I can tell you that my six-year-old daughter, who still doesn't know who Mr. Magoo is, loved it. And why not -- the story is well told and the songs are great. I was delighted to share a favorite of my childhood with her, and especially happy to see her enjoy a Christmas program that wasn't about the fat guy in a red suit."},{"rating":"2","title":"child hood memory","review":"This movie is timeless, and brought back fond childhood memories. I wish they would show it on TV each year, like they do with Charlie Browns Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete with razzleberry dressing...","review":"I've loved this show since I was a little girl and I'm overwhelmed to see it's available in blu-ray! The time-honored Dickens story has never been given such a warm and lyrical treatment as in this short but pithy tale with Mr. Magoo, our nearsighted and kind-hearted star of the show. The \\"ghosts\\" are perfectly matched to Scrooge's past, present and future. The songs are so catchy I'm sure even children will want to hear them over and over again. Christmas is never complete in our home without Magoo's Christmas Carol."},{"rating":"1","title":"New DVD Dissapointing","review":"Here's a wonderful old holiday favorite, with charming music and a fast paced story-line. Unfortunately, this new DVD from Goodtimes is poor. The color is faded, and the sound has noise in it. The extra bonus cartoon, \\"Magoo Meets McBoing\\" is missing the original opening, and new end credits and funky music have been added. There is no insert inside the DVD to provide any information. A real cheap release. I can only hope this is re-released at some date by someone other than Goodtimes. Still a great classic show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of my childhood","review":"This was one of my favorites when I was a child. Now me and my daughter enjoy it together. The story is done very well and the music is above average for a cartoon. The DVD picture and sound are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed.","review":"I guess I just remember Mr. Magoo differently and as an adult, didn't really enjoy this. Of course I bought it for my grandkids, but they didn't seem that enchanted by it, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas Carol Ever!...","review":"I think this is one of the best Christmas movies of all time!It tells the story very close to the original and the music is very good. I am so glad this came back out in dvd. I had an old copy on vhs that broke. It is the only tape I ever had break that I though enough of to take the case apart and splice back together.

I have loved this since my children were tiny and I was young!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have For The Old And Young Alike","review":"It's cute, it's funny, it's nostalgic and probably my favorite version of Dicken's story, for whatever reason, it's just a great piece of work.I've watched this numerous times since the early 70's as a child and I purchased it on DVD as soon as I saw it on the rack.I look forward to watching it with my children some day as well, and of course throwing it in on a cold December's day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Ripoff","review":"These are not protectors for two vises, as you would think from the description--they are two sheets which will protect ONE vise. And they are not rubber. They are made of UHMW plastic, which can be bought from Lee Valley Tools for about 11 bucks a sheet. Sjobergs wants 86 bucks for 2. I can make them myself for two vises for about 40 bucks.

The unit is not dirty, nor was it abused. I disassembled it and checked the reeds and they were clean. Some people swear by these, but 2 out of the 3 I bought were junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hohner equals HORRIBLE","review":"I've been playing Blues harp for over 30 years. Hohner's customer service is despicable. They redesigned these MS Harps (Blues Harp is one) so that you have metal cutting into your mouth. They could have designed it so that the metal plate that the reeds are mounted on are tucked WITHIN the comb so that your lips are in contact with plastic or wood instead of sharp edged metal. Only an idiot would not realize this in designing this highly touted MS system. Forget about Special 20's too, they go bad after just weeks. I'm switching to Lee Oscars. Don't even try to contact Hohner it is impossible. They display complete lack of commen sense in their design and zero concern for their customers. They continue on their steady decline in quality and service. But their marketing is clever. Take my advice, stay away from this company's third rate products."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got the blues","review":"I'm a beginner and hope to learn to bend and feel the true grit of the blues from this harp."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can this be the standard?","review":"I am amazed as how most music shops will sell you this harmonica when you ask as for one as a beginner. This was my first harmonica, and over the years I have discovered its multiple limitations compared to other models.Hohner's Special 20, for example, is in the same price range and it is much easier to bend, overblow (after adjusting the reeds), much tighter... it is a much better harmonica.I strongly suggest not buying a Hohner Blues Harp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sounding Blues Harp","review":"Definately the blusiest harp I've ever played and probably will ever play.Only complaint I have is that it wears out far too easily. If you play it like crazy and put a lot of spit in it, dont expect it to last too long.but at $20 a pop, and with the ability to blow the roof off a performance or open mic night, it's worth it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"using milk is easy, why is this a separate book?","review":"Making soap with milk as the liquid in the recipe, or as a portion of the liquid, is pretty easy if you've ventured forth and attempted to make soap. If you already own one of the basic books as from Bramson or Cavitch, you're 3/4 of the way there and this book is superfluous.Milk soaping is one of the biggest topics one finds addressed on the internet in the soap boards, it should also be noted. The author's methods never worked for me because they involve too many steps, but I suppose it comes down to learning a certain way and being set in one's ways whether something is useful technique or not.If you're making soap, you don't need this book at all. If you're looking to learn to make soap, get this book if you like complicated procedure. Otherwise, just get the Cavitch book(s) and take her superfatting ideas with a hefty grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"I use the basic recipe for my goat milk soaps. Granted, I have a BS in Chemistry, but it's not needed if you follow the directions. It does not have to be as complicated as the author makes it to be, but if you follow the directions to a \\"T\\", you'll make fantastic soaps. I did not give it 5 stars, because there are some things missing, like why do we add sugar? and she goes into great detail about how to render lard and tallow, but she never uses them in a recipe! Overall, I really love this book and have made most of the soaps in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"understandable, easy to read","review":"Though I haven't started to make soap, it seems that after reading this book, I CAN DO IT NOW. Best wishes from ISTANBUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not for beginners!!!!","review":"It seems that there was some extremely important information missing! She says that you can change the kinds of oils you use, but failed to provide any kind of lye calculation chart which is critical to making safe soap. She also doesn't explain why she uses some of the ingredients she uses. She says to add Borax to water if you don't have soft water, but why does she want you to add it to the milk? Sugar and glycerin. Are they mandatory??? And why the sugar? What does it do? I appreciated the information as far as keeping the milk cool, and the best way to work with it so it doesn't get scorched, but her recipies are too big to use, and she doesn't include either palm or coconut oil which is a basic staple of all soap. Is either oil not recommended for milk based soaps? There are just too many gaps!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The recipes were good but.......","review":"I liked Caseys recipes but..it was almost tiring just reading her instructions,like...start with this pan,then put the mixture in that pan...then stir both pans at the same time.I make and mix my soap in one pan,it's really not that difficult.I agree with another reviewer who said it does'nt have to be a team effort.The best soapmaking book I have ever bought is \\"The Everything Soapmaking Book\\" by Alicia Grosso. This book has all the information you will ever need to make really beautiful handmade soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your B.S. May Come Handy","review":"If you have a degree in chemistry and feel comfortable working in a laborary environment this is a good book for you. I have found making milk-based soaps easy and fun but not as a result of Makela's book, which makes it seem intimidating, time staking and well, down right confusing. If you crave simplicity pass on this soapmaking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good results, not too difficult","review":"My mother and I decided to try soap-making last year, but the first book we bought was very difficult to follow and the ingredients were hard to find. (Palm oil and coconut oil may be in most soap recipes, but they are not available at stores near us.) My mother found this book in a craft store. What a delight it is! Our first experiment with soap turned out very well. We have made two batches so far and both are excellent. (The hard part is waiting for it to cure!) All of the ingredients were easy to find and fairly inexpensive. There were some gaps in the information (such as hard glycerin does not melt well in the recipes), but it was very easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excessive pedaling!!!","review":"The reason I bought this DVD is that I'm currently working on op.111 and wanted to watch Mr. Kovacevich interpret the work.As an informative DVD this one does not qualify at all, extreme close-ups ruin the general flow of video. Sound is very good, listening rather than watching is great.As to the interpretations, they are spontaneous and enjoyable. My greatest problem with his playing is that he uses the pedal so much that the harmonies are no more distinguishable. So many times, excessive pedaling blurs the melody as well.Despite all my complaints I'd recommend it even if you're going to listen to it once. Mr. Kovacevich's take on these pieces are well worth a shot.Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best American Pianists","review":"Regrettably, I can't agree more with the other review.However, let me add that the recorded sound of this DVD is so excellent that one can't possibly miss any nuances of his playing. Stephen is for sure one of the greatest American pianists who is is still around. I have an impression that he was rather rash one stage when he was young. But right now, even though he might still take chances occasionally, it is much better poised or even poetic at times! His playing on the whole is more on the harmonic side though.

I am so glad I read this book before giving it to her. This book is primarily about a woman who has suffered sexual abuse from a family member and has been ostracized from her family due to her own acts of withdrawal and homosexuality. The death of her mother is an incidental theme in this book. I deeply regret my purchase of this book and will throw it away before giving it to another person to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Attempt","review":"I picked this book up expecting a good cry. What I got a laugh about was how pathetically Ms. Griffin has lived her life. Perhaps the reason she was so upset when her mother died was that they hadn't truly reconciled. Accept who and what you are as part of yourself. Stop blaming others for the way you turned out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Language Lessons","review":"Rarely do I finish a novel in one sitting, but Griffin's account of her mother's passing had me spellbound.

I had only heard of them through the different hardcore/emo websites that I frequently visit, they are worth all the praise! They are similar in style to poison the well and hopesfall. All the songs on this album are topnotch, every one delivers in every way! You will like this album if you like stuff like emocore and what not, it definately delivers though, and highly recommended. The only gripe I have is it's kind of short, but that shouldn't stop you, go pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Good!","review":"Artist in the Ambulance is a very heavy yet melodic not boring album. This guys from OC are one of the greatest punk rockers ive ever listened, this album got a lot of heavier stuff than the previous 2 albums. Teppei's metal riffs adds a little flavor to their songs. You'll love this album and enjoy it as much as I do. My main tracks in this album : (2- Under a Killing Moon4- Silhouette and 6- Paper Tigers)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Time's A Charm","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? I LOVE this album. Having been a Thrice fan from day one, I must say it's been quite exciting seeing them grow and evolve to their current position. This band, in my opinion, is going to change music as we hear it. Anyone bored with everyday pop, R&B, or anything else considered 'in' by most groups of people, check this album out. A perfect blend of heavy metal riffs, hardcore vocals, pop punk harmonies, and just downright CRAZY breakdowns, this is by far their best yet. I thought it would be hard to follow up 'The Illusion of Safety', and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. 'The Artist In The Ambulance' hasn't left my CD player since I first got hold of it. AMAZING job Thrice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definatly Not Punk Or Metal...","review":"This crap is definatly EMO, it sounds pretty much exactly the same as all the other crappy emo bands that are every where at the moment but will be forgotten in a few months, and even that's to long for this fad to go away.I'll give thrice this, they are among the better crop of emo bands, but this doesn't mean thier good. They still suck. Just because you scream in a song it doesn't mean your metal and having a quick beat doesn't make you punk rock.

They began as a garage band that a lot of people knew about. Now they are one of the hottest bands around.

I was shocked when I first bought it and would definetly recommend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"THRICE RIPS!","review":"Thrice blows me away with every release! Whoever gave this under 4 stars is obviously not a Thrice fan because they still have their trademark emo punk metal sound that makes them so above average.

Keep up the good work Thrice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TAITA--energetic, heavy, inspiring","review":"the new thrice cd the artist in the ambulence was one that i expected to be good, but no where near this good. this cd is truely amazing, every song has enormous energey fuled by hard hitting, fast paced beats on drums, and mind bending electirifing guitar riffs, all topped off with mroe of dustin kensrue's amazing lyrics and vocals. this has also inspired me so much as a musician. im in love with this new album, and i speak for not only myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, yet different","review":"As soon as I put The Artist in the Ambulance in my cd player I noticed a change or maturity in the sound of Thrice. This cd does contain many of Thrice's old writing styles like songs without a generic outline and the changes from hardcore to metal to emo, but overall the band's sound has changed. More basic song routines are in this album and I regret to say the songs are not as catchy as in The Illusion of Safety. Don't get me wrong this is a fabulous cd and truly displays Thrice's love of music and their extreme knowledge of it. This cd is incredible and I love it I just think that The Illusion of Safety is the best cd ever made and it is something that cannot be beaten."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard and powerful","review":"It's a path that the band is traveling down. Each album is becoming more and more dynamic. This was the first album that I bought, after hearing the band on a local college station. After getting into the band I picked up Identity Crisis, and just recently Vheissu. I still feel that Artist is probably my favorite. The title track is especially powerful and dynamic. The emotions show through and it's easy to see how this is not any kind of superficial song or CD. Highly recommend this CD and any others that you can get your hands on."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's hard not to like thrice","review":"all i gotta say is bravo to these guys man. they are amazing musicians. identity crisis and the illusion of safety were also amazing cd's but artist in the ambulance sticks out to me. they have matured a lot and the sound is just so much better. all of their cd's are masterpeices so dont get me wrong but this is by far their best one."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrice is NOT a sell out","review":"great CD. teppei keeps it real with his intense guitar riffs and riley shreds with super fast double bass fills. only people from ARKANSAS would think thrice is a sell out."},{"rating":"1","title":"am i missing something???","review":"umm why is everyone giving this cd 5 stars? basically, it sucks! its full of empty screaming and boring guitar riffs. all of these songs dont have any variety, not to mention they dont have any element that gets your attention at all. I really dont understand how people can give this 5 stars time after time. whenever try to give this cd another chance, it just seems like a long, boring, 40 minute song, because all of this music never changes style at ALL so if your want to be part of the crowd and buy this lame cd when you could be listening to MUCH better stuff, go ahead. well, at least the lyrics have a bit of meaning, but thrice destroys this by saying they dont think this way in their notes. hope this helps"},{"rating":"1","title":"a startlingly horrible new effort from thrice","review":"i guess startling is the wrong word.because when a band has been horrible for years and then they put out a new album, what can you expect really except more of the same?still, i am pretty shocked at their ability to consistently churn out such terrible music! wowee zowee!bands like this are really doing their part to pave the way for other hard working groups with no talent or originality who are earning a place on commercial radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sub par album from a sub par band","review":"Thrice is a very inconsistent band, and i recently attended one of there shows and was utterly disapionted, as far as the album goes its very weak and annoining after a while i though i could convince my self to like it but after i hear it more and more it just seems like its just a hyped up ablum just like theyre live shows, ticket prices, merchandise and fan base, dont waste ur time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!","review":"i absolutely LOVED this CD...amazing choruses and beats! i would definitely recommend this to anyone who is attracted to catchy, upbeat tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"overhyped","review":"I expected a lot more catchiness and cool tunes.

By the third album a band should know where it is going. This is not a bad recoding just sophmoric. This is my first listen to Thrice but, it doesn't mean that I hate it. It just isn't what I expected. It has its good moments and its slow ones. This is simple Nu Metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fricken Awesome!!!","review":"Even compared to Identity Crisis and The Illusion of Safety, this cd is amazing. They put a lot of work into this album and it shows. With great songs like Cold Cash and Colder Hearts, Sillouhette, Paper Tigers, The Melting Point of Wax and The Artist in the Ambulence, you can't go wrong with this cd. The Melting Point of Wax has some of the best lyrics I have ever heard, and the guitar is catchy too. My favorite song on the album is The Artis in the Ambulence, even though I normally like harder, screaming music. It has amazing lyrics and the guitar is crazy how good it is.

They play music thats close to metal, but is often grouped in with emo, and sing lyrics about philosophy and religion. They are simply smart.\\"The Artist In The Ambulance\\" is Thrice's major label debut, and is their best work yet. The cd starts with the hard ballad \\"Cold Cash and Colder Hearts\\" a song about the arrogance of the American public. The story the album tells is beautifully crafted, everysong bringing something different.Best songs-Cold Cash and Colder Hearts, Under A Killing Moon, Stare At The Sun, The Artist In The Ambulance, Don't Tell And We Won't Ask"},{"rating":"2","title":"oh boy oh boy","review":"it's sad to say that people point to this record and say that thrice are \\"selling out\\". a band that's always had intentions of becoming big can't sell out, especially when they sound better than anything they've ever done before.the production in this cd is clean, the lyrics are honest (they remind me a lot of the eloquent imagery usage of shai hulud and acts like you and i), the music IS catchy, and the effort obviously isn't some two-bit slop.people can't get over the fact that thrice is mainstream now and that other people might like them as well. this isn't a cd to feed the egos of wannabe elitist scenesters. it's a cd to please the likes of thrice fans and the music aficionado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Addictive","review":"Heavy, fast-paced, and complex on every level.

This Cd is no exception and should be on your buy list if you like thrice at all or other bands like finch, poison the well, and rise against....First impressions is their first and if you really like thrice, you can try to buy that Cd off ebay which was their first cd....Artist in the ambulence is alot like thrice's other CD's and maybe even more hardcore. Definately a CD worth buying, no disappointing songs, all are great. no need to skip songs. ~Hotskates forever~"},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is wow..","review":"Another masterpiece..what can I say? It's an excellent album. Teppei's back with his crazy lead riffs..Dustin with meaningful lyrics and cool rhythm notes..Riley and Eddie improved from their previous albums as well. I must mention the limited edition packaging. Comes as digipak form, with cards for each song, with their lyrics, and comments about that particular song by each member. Cool stuff. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This album a very good, due to the fact that this band and there style is more hardcore and tougher than the usual emo bands.

To my surprise it really didn't sound like that at all. Cold Cash and Colder Hearts, Stare at The Sun, and All That's Left are the only songs worth hearing. My advice would be to just go to some place like iTunes and just download those songs, because the CD is not worth buying. I am truly happy I got this CD as a gift, and didn't buy it. The more I listen to the CD the more I get annoyed, it is also extreamly short.

A complete change of style, and a regress in musical skill and inovation are what fill the new album.

Artist is a great album, I've listened to it five times straight through now, and can honestly say its easily the best album of 2003 so far. They dabble with a few new things while continuing their hardcore edge. Teppei's guitar work is awesome (very Iron Maiden style still). And Dustin's vocals are as powerful as ever. Key tracks for me are #1, #4, and #9, although they are all amazing.-I mentioned best of 2003, but want to retract that statement, being as The Mars Volta released the already classic \\"De-Loused\\" album, so sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrice = mind blowing music","review":"if you like rock, or have any taste for great music i highly recommend TAITA. every track on this cd delivers. the sound quality is magnificant, the music is phenomenon, and the lyrics are eloquent. if you can only buy one cd this year buy TAITA, and if you can only buy two cd's this year buy two copies of TAITA...it's less than 12 bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THRICE KICKS!","review":"As you start to listen to thrice, you become pulled into the intense lyrics, guitar riffs and the screaming, but what really struck me was the tittle track Artist in the Ambulance. wow. Compared to the rest of the album this song takes a different tone. its very EMO driven, where as the record tends to be more to the EMO-CORE side that thrice is usually on. I think that this cd is worth buying along with their other ones. and thrice justs kicks live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent cd","review":"This CD was all right. The best songs are the fast ones, like \\"Blood Clots and Black Holes\\" although the singing could've been more yelling than singing. The slow songs are kind of boring after a while, but \\"The Artist In The Ambulance\\" is all right. Overall good cd (but Illusion Of Safety is better)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallic Emo Kids Provide Riff Therapy","review":"Thrice melds Brobdingnagian riffs with melodic hooks, complex song structures, and socially aware lyrics: all elements combine to form a spitfire of a record. The record commences with a trifecta, each song flowing and segueing into another. The single \\"All That's Left\\" is justified but falls short of the dazzling title track, a pitch-perfect synthesis of pop and metal. Not to mention that the lyrics are rife with optimism and a fresh outlook, ideas not usually evoked in this genre. \\"Paper Tigers\\" is all throat tearing screams punctuated by stacatto guitar, a typical hardcore jaunt and the likely supect for weakest track. It could be said that some of the songs sound like duplicates. Nevermind that. Just concentrate on your thundering heart and sweaty palms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great to wake up to....","review":"See the problem with this album is the enormous praise that I had heard from all of my friends. My expectations rose, and for the first time in a while I was actually excited to go out and buy a record. I pop it in and *BAM* I dropped dead from laughter at how truly crappy this band is. First off, the instrumentals (guitars, bass, drums, the works) sound like they dropped metal objects into a blender for kicks and giggles. Then the vocals kicked in... The lead singer reminded me of good old Stephen Urkel from Family Matters. His voice might seem very pleasant for those few Urkel fans left out there. I didn't give this album one star for three solid reasons.#1 It was on sale...#2 They are better then Sum 41 (that's just about every body)#3 This album is so terrible I use it on my alarm clock, so I have to get up to turn it off.

Thrice is nothing like real rock, they are emo.(Well at least this recent album is the closest to the genre than the rest of them.) Maybe to some of you MTV viewers and mainstream surfers that a pre-pubescent teen whailing into the mic in the same monotony with the same 4 chords played over and over again is appealing, but to the rest of us, it's not.

I didn't think it was possible, but this band is even worse live than on cd. Poison the Well blew them away. They should ditch they singer and quit trying to sound like a horrible cross between two of the worst bands of all time, AFI and Green Day.

A way to get you to spend more money. They already released a boxed set with all nine movies in it, but it only contained one special edition (ST1) and the rest were regular releases. This time, they added two more special editions (ST's 2 & 3). For Petes sake guys, wait until they release a box set with ALL of them special edition, or just buy them each individually as each of the special editions come out. Yes, this is the cheapest way to get all the movies currently, but if you're a special edition freak like me, just wait a little longer. IV is coming out on Sp.

First of all, the length of the slots is so skimpy that you can't even toast rye bread.

It turns out that the inside metal top gets extremely hot during operation, and in using the lever to raise the toast to extract it one's fingers tend to contact the hot metal. This happens because the raising action of the lever tends to stick, hence one naturally braces a finger or two on the top of the appliance to gain additional purchase. This supporting finger then frequently contacts the metal top nearby. We've written to the manufacturer about our experiences, and are awaiting their reply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even toasting","review":"Attracive design It's my supposition:like most toasters designed to accept bagels, the width provided is secured by movement of one side of the frame holding the slice. This means that in accepting a standard slice of bread, the heating elements are further away from one face of the slice are the heating elements from the other. A standard slice of bread tends to be toasted more on one side than on the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOOKS AND WORKS GREAT","review":"Sometimes I read a review on Amazon and wonder if the writer has confused their product with the one listed. This is such a case. I had a perfectly good white Philips toaster, but changed the kitchen decor to black appliances. While I am usually very practical, I must confess that in this case, I was more concerned with appearance than performance. This was absolutely the best looking 2-slice toaster I found at any price, and it works exactly as it should. I have several other Cuisinart products in my kitchen, and I've always found them to be a combination of great cosmetic design and clever functional engineering. There isn't much upon which the function of a toaster can be improved. If it toasts evenly, accommodates various sizes of breads, and has a \\"cancel\\" button, I'm happy. With this product, I'm more than happy.

His wordsplay and his rhymes; I could flow better than that when I was 13. His voice; nauseating and high-pitches as if he was a girl. The beats; worse than the ones I can make in like 4 minutes.

Some of the songs sound similar to each other and are forgettable. I didn't care for this album overall.A good deal of the record is Bow Wow saying how amazing he is, how everyone wants to be like him, how he gets the girls, how good he dresses, and that gets annoying, unless you like listening to the narcisistic rants of rappers which make you feel like a fool for listening to such blatant self-promoting as they tell you they want to be a millionaire and how rich they are. Inspirational? Maybe for Bow Wow himself to pump himself up with or maybe 'Follow Me' will give mindless copycats an insight into how to be exactly like him by 'wearing two chains' and 'getting diamonds in yo pocket yo'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage cd unleashed.","review":"All I have to say is that this cd if you listen to it long enough begins to really bring your intelligence down heavily.This garbage like his previous garbage sounds all the same and the lyrics are all pointless chatter of having this having that.This kid needs to go back to school and stop making a fool of himself.People please vote for my review and lets collectively stop this cancer of garbage music from spreading."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's 16!","review":"I think this with this album he's shown a lot of growth.

On this album he talks about how long he has been in the game and rims.

I doubt, however, is this title is of the same quality as his classics like Affirmations and The Force. This book was published in 1993 and I suspect he might already have been proven wrong in some of his political predictions. Also, sometimes his thoughts meander and it becomes difficult to make out exactly what he wants to say. Nevertheless, there are brilliant passages and his dissident and unorthodox views of stuff like global warming are excellent. His analysis of government misrule, especially in the manipulation of money, is also very valid. His explanation of historical events based on the wave/particle duality is original and interesting. So yes, a thought-provoking book and a good read, but not his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly as I need it to.","review":"Needed an adapter for some surveillance cameras to hook to my DVR, these have worked perfectly.

Both books belong on the serious deer enthusiast's book shelf.Hall's book is a compilation of articles by some of the nation's leading deer experts. The chapters are both interesting and informative.

The song writer has more gravel to his voice than Tom Waits, the guitarist is sadly very bloated, and the manager is slouched on a sofa wearing khaki shorts complaining about how the band should have gotten into arena rock. (He's the worst of the three!)Just as I was enjoying \\"wig wam bam\\" when the video cuts off and back to the chat! No little Willy video at all!They also don't include more than 30 secs of the\\"love is like oxygen\\" video.

Not even an adult could have kept up with it.I was extremely disappointed in the quality, particularly after the fact of having paid so much for shipping. The company did not offer to make any amends on the shipping price, such as offering a return label, postage pre-paid.

John Clive gives his readers a deep and rich picture of Macaulay. I agree with another Amazon.com reviewer of this book that a volume II by Clive -- a volume that details Macaulay's life from his return from India to his death -- would have been a fantastic addition to the literature.My only real reservation about Clive's biography is his attempted psychoanalysis of Macaulay. I find Freudian explanations to be wholly fanciful. They don't work, in my view -- and this fact seems especially true in the case of Macaulay. Fortunately, Clive doesn't resort to psychoanalysis too much.Again, overall this is a truly excellent biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't ship.

Unfortunately, I now have received at least 6 messages, each apologizing that the shipment will be delayed another week. After speaking with an Amazon rep, she guaranteed that the item would ship by Oct 30, and followed this with an email assuring me of this. Of course, then on Oct 31, and Nov 4 I received messages of further delays.On top of this, I have been unable to cancel the order, as it is always being prepared for shipping.My worst experience with Amazon, so if you are thinking about ordering this, think again."},{"rating":"2","title":"She liked it...","review":"It worked exactly like they said it would.

If you are a predictable , easily amused, druggie, brainless, moron of society, you'll surely enjoy this. The only funny part of this dvd was the \\"bind date with a crack whore skit\\" which was a typical theme, yet at least had humor to it. And yucko the clown is totally over rated. I never laughed once at his insult attempts.His \\"insults\\" are anything a child could come up with. I found myself fast forwarding through the chinese skits and the obnoxious black bum idiocy and the screaming santa that drones on like a broken record. Since when is \\"screaming like a mongoloid\\" funny? Total snore material throughout.What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This would make a pricey coaster, but then you might have to explain what a \\"Yucko\\" is to your guests. Giving him a chance because of his annual appearances on the Stern Show, I tried this out. My fear is that in 10-20 years, youngsters will see this and ask \\"THIS was funny?\\", much like Dice Clay and Dane Cook (in a couple more years). Although to be honest, that's not fair to THEM. At least at one point they were selling out arenas. This guy couldn't sell out a movie theater. But hey, somehow he got sophomoric racist ignorant humor on cable TV and then DVD. It's more than I've done, but I never claimed to be funny.No wonder his (ex)wife got so drunk at their wedding that she threw up."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"i thought it would be like viva la bam or jackass. the cover looked funny and i thought i had recognized the clown guy from howard sterns show but i watched it and i was literally the most disgusting pathetic trash i had ever seen it wasnt even funny except for the national anthem. but otherwise just the fact that people like this live the country makes me sick. this was the most peverted i had ever seen in my entire life and im still having nightmares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avia - I See That Now...","review":"It may be a little premature to call this album a classic -- but it is excellent nonetheless. Avia's first EP, All My Jazz, was astounding, and his debut album confirms that promise. Corin Dingley and Andy Jenks from Alpha add their considerable talents to the proceedings. \\"Miles Golden Sands\\" is a house number, fluid and smooth. \\"Warm\\" is just that -- a lush, deep, throbbing number. Avia does slow just as well - \\"Why Should I Cry\\" wouldn't be out of place on any high-quality downtempo compilation. \\"Westernize\\" sounds like a leisurely film noir chase scene. An incredibly strong album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Adulation Never a Good Thing !","review":"I was such a huge Tiesto fan until I saw this DVD. I bought it on the basis of other reviews but I guess I haven't yet joined the cult of P so have missed the point of the DVD. Tiesto is a master at what he does there is no doubt about that however after this DVD I have lost some respect for him. I thought from the DVD I would learn a little more about the man eg influences, inspiration etc etc. instead all I got was a DVD that showed yet again that the DJ has become greater than the music (and I won't debate the merits or otherwise of that) and endless shots of (mostly Americans) going on about how brilliant he is. This DVD is self adulation / promotion at its worst, all I can say is shame on you Tiesto making suckers out of your fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular! Amazing!

But this is one of the most honest, and heartfelt, books on the civil rights movement I have ever read.I stronly recommend \\"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\\" to be read alongside this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but...","review":"These seem like decent enough safety pins. They are good for general use and about the same size as the top one pictured.The item description is a bit misleading and needs more clarity however. It states \\"Safety Pins #3 Bx/1440\\". The numbers are not explained. Listed item weight is 5 lbs so I thought the safety pins were being sold by weight. What you receive are 1,440 safety pins, size number 3. It doesn't even weigh 2 lbs. Also it makes no mention that these safety pins are made in China. I half expected that to be the case, but it should be mentioned just the same.

It has only marginal entertainment value, and even less educational value. Just know what you are buying, because I did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performance, but Difficult to Learn the Features.","review":"I am getting excellent results with this DVD recorder, but it takes a couple of weeks to learn all the features. The instruction book is relatively poor, the description of the features is vague, and the language is strange.The book doesn't tell you enough about which DVD formats you should use. I have read it several times and I still don't know the exact difference between DVD-R and DVD+R. Panasonic seems to push DVD-RAM, but this format is not compatible with mySamsung DVD player.The unit works fine, but it takes a very large amount of patience to understand how to operate it. I have a feeling that the competitive units from other companies are probably easier to operate.Contrary to other reviews, I never had any trouble at all with the built in TV Guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"TV Guide does not work with Comcast Cable","review":"This is the second Panasonic DVR that I have and both deliver high quality recordings. But, neither retrieves the TV Guide service. This means you must manually set each show to be recorded.

I suppose if I had a camera that needed a firewire input, I might have a small problem with it. But, I don't. It has great editing features (for cutting out those peskey commercials). I really didn't find it as hard to figure out as many people have. I only referred to the manual once (there is a setting for dubbing in high speed mode that has to be set before recording the show). The only thing that I had any trouble with was - as you can probably already guessed already, was the tv guide. Got a great tip though (worked for me anyway). I live in city \\"A\\". I put in city A's zip code and got absolutely nothing, even after two days. About 5 miles away is a small town we'll call town \\"B\\" (with the same cable company). I put in town B's zip and had my guide up and running in 12 hours. Anyway, don't hesitate to buy this unit. It really is even better than the review's state."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended if you plan to go with high definition","review":"I had this DVD recorder and it worked as expected until I upgraded to a high definition TV. Now the DVD recorder cannot be used as before. It's incompatible with the new Comcast HD cable box I had to get. So there's no way to do scheduled recordings with the TV guide user interface. There's nothing in the Panasonic literature that I could find that warned of this limitation. I spent several days trying to reconfigure the system after I made the change and each time it failed. There may be a way to manually schedule recording. When I tried to get through to panasonic technical support on the phone to discuss this got nothing but busy signal. So I'm going to have to ditch the EH50 and get a Comcast DVD recorder. Anyway, this unit works good if you're not using hi def."},{"rating":"1","title":"flakey dvd recorder","review":"Bought panasonic dmr-eh50 about 2 months ago. First 3 weeks it recorded programs I selected and at least the recorder worked. But then for apparently no reason, it stopped recording scheduled programs. It continued recording programs I manually selected but no automatic recording for scheduled programs I selected. Also,it has a serious reset problem. Sometimes every minute, sometimes every 2-3 minutes, it gets a blue screen for 2-4 seconds and then brings the program back. The TV guide feature was a big disappointment and is not fully featured. The entire thing needs redesign because sometimes I cannot navigate between scheduled programs and TV guide-- just a flakey, not ready for prime time product. Have had good luck in past with panasonic products but after this, I won't buy panasonic brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic DMR-EH50S DVD Recorder","review":"When Consumer Reports gave this unit a high rating, they knew what they were talking about. This unit has done everything I hoped for. Since I have Time-Warner cable, the TV Guide feature worked perfectly. I know some folks have had trouble with that feature not working, and I would have been disappointed if it had failed to work on my unit, but I knew going in there was a good chance my cable provider would come through for me.The various operations were fairly easy to learn. I had to consult the manual a few times but most of the functions on this recorder are pretty intuitive. I've enjoyed the heck out of this DVD recorder since I bought it. I think it's just downright cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion","review":"The unit does what it is supposed to. However, it is hard to read the white print. There is not enough contrast for clarity.I have some navigation complaints as it is not too user friendly.Nice clarity and reproduction.Lee"},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic Support Terrible","review":"I have three issues with this unit.1) The controls are not intuitive to use. For example when setting the title on a recorded movie and you want to erase a character you hit the pause key not the erase key. You can get used to it - but be prepared to have the manual next to you the first couple of weeks.2) The TV Guide feature hasn't worked. Panasonic is still working on it - but without resolution after 2 months.3) The Panasonic customer support is the absolute worst. I have called over a dozen times. You are typically on hold for 30-60 minutes, they don't seem to be able to help much, and don't deliver on what they promise. I have talked to support people, a product technician and a supervisor. Most are very nice - but the problem is still not resolved. Because of the bad support I will never purchase another Panasonic product and recommend you pass on this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is wonderful!","review":"It has worked without a problem since the day I got it. The biggest problem was figuring out the owners manual. I am so happy with this. It's like having tivo. The onscreen guides are very helpful for navigating. The unit was delivered to me two days after ordering from Amazon, and that was with the free shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun machine","review":"Very happy with the product so far. It is very easy to watch and record programs daily. The TV Guide feature can make it very easy to set up future recording requests, and doesn't cost like TIVO does, but sometimes it \\"goes away\\" and the listings aren't updated. Remote control is good, too.Also had fun making copies of family reunion tapes with the fast dubbing feature. One small problem: Because of the 17 inch width, we had a heck of a time fitting it in to our TV armoire.The hard drive recorder is so much superior to any tape or dvd. Especially fun to use the time slip - if you pause the show for a phone call, you can start watching again from where you leave off while the machine finishes the rest. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"independent seller on Amazon.com","review":"This seller, screaminindig@optonline.net is not, I repeat, not a trustworthy person for anyone to buy from. For your own safety, avoid him like the plague. He sent me product that he knew was not what I had ordered. And it appears to me that this was done on purpose, specifically to make extra money because he knew that Amazon.com is too big and too busy to notice. So, buyers looking at this website,are forewarned, this seller, screaminindig@optonline.net will not honor your original order if he feels that he can make any profit from sending you whatever he, unilaterally, decides to send you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to my quality standards","review":"I respectfully disagree with the other reviews on this product. I recorded a number of sports programs off the cable and found that I much preferred the quality of my old VHS recorder. On wide shots of the sports action, the recorded DVD version had many digital artifacts when players were moving on screen. This was very distracting. The TV Guide tracking function for recording programs is also glitchy to the point of distraction. I decided to return the product and wait for a better version to come out in a year or two. I would rather sign up for the cable TV company's digital recorder and pay the monthly fee while I am waiting for the product to improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hook up nightmare (in certain situations)","review":"I wanted to use this DVD recorder instead of the cable system DVR. Unfortuately, any cost savings from the recorder would have been wasted in time and money to hook up the system with my cable box and universal remote. I am sure this is a fine product but it does not stack up to the ease of the cable system DVR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Broken","review":"This product may be very good. It's hard to know because it arrived broken and, at Panasonic's direction, I dropped it off at their local service center. I just got it back after two weeks at the shop waiting for parts. After a quick check last night, it appears to be working. I should be able to comment in a few days on how well it works. For now, my fingers are crossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Clayderman wanna be who has 1 finger","review":"How many fingers does this guy have? 1 ? The song selection is very original. The selection ranges from Serrat's Penelope to Juan Gabriel's Amor Eterno.

Each nutrient is allocated two pages in which the author discusses; how it works, advice for supplementation and its therapeutic uses. As a bonus theres also an informative section on herbal supplements. The super high resolution photographs of the food are a pleasure to look at in themselves- so much so in fact that my three year old daughterattempted to take a biteful out of one of the pages! There do however appear to be awfully many pictures of raw meat here which as a vegetarian i found quite repulsive. Some American readers may find the chapter on Vitamin E a little confusing as the British author talks about it's supplementation in terms of milligrams (mg) and not our international units (IU).

I recently had a baby and am looking to get rid of the extra tummy. I'm currently fitting into size 29 jeans (don't have a measuring tape to measure exact tummy size) and this thing is huge so it's hard to get it really tight.It definitely helps me to start sweating in the tummy area quickly - even on stroller walks, I will get very sweaty. The bad news is, this product doesn't grip to the stomach once wet. It rides up so the entire walk/work out, I'm pulling it back down to the area where I want to decrease fat.I'm going to try other brands as it's just too frustrating and kind of embarrassing to be constantly pulling this product down when I'm walking around town or at the gym!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just another 9/11 tribute","review":"I find the previous reviewers attack on composer Richard Danielpour to be uninformed and insulting. This is a beautiful recording and a moving work that just happened to be premiered two months after the 9/11 attack. Does the reviewer seriously think that a piece entitled \\"An American Requiem\\" be premiered in Nov. of 2001 without any reference to what had just happened?The performances are excellent throughout. Mezzo Stephanie Blythe is especially magnificent. The mixing of the traditional Mass text with the American poetry is very effective. Poems about a mother grieving over her lost son and a captain lamenting his fallen comrades offer a more personal experience to a requiem mass.Give this recording a chance to stand on its own merits. It deserves to be heard and enjoyed for generations and not just be tied to one tragic event in our country's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoary opportunism","review":"Anyone who felt even the least bit of emotional stirring as a result of the 9/11 attacks would do well to avoid this recording. Danielpour cobbles together an incoherent mess of a piece whose references to different styles and idioms is insincere at best. In a rush to further his career, he reoriented this piece around the terrorist attacks while it was near completion not by changing much of the composition, but rather the dedication on the title page. Even without the 9/11 angle, this music is just plain cringe inducing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sad truth","review":"Read the book the first time I was a private with my boots in the sand and have read it a few times since.

It briefly underlines the process without any real detail, providing some advice but nothing concrete. Certainly, it could be argued that the process is relatively straightforward, but I would've preferred something more than a brief overview and a list of 'recipes.'I guess this book would be fine for you if all you're looking for is some very general information and some scent ideas.

Sirens was recorded at famed New Alliance Studio in Boston, MA (Cave In, ISIS). Since their inception, from Long Island, NY, in 1998, On The Might Of Princes are an absolutely amazing live band that has managed on this cd to seamlessly blend melody and technical proficiency with dramatic guitar progressions, incredibly dynamic drumming, introspective lyrics, and completely hypnotic, intoxicating from-fragile-to-screaming vocals. Their sound is chaotic, melodic, urgent, and beautiful all at once. I highly recommend this, it won't leave your cd player any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unlike nearly all other NRBQ releases, I found this collection of odds and ends to be uneven and disappointing. There are a handful of good tracks, but some are just things that the bandmembers apparently did for fun and left on the shelf -- for good reason. For example, there's a version of the old Motown hit \\"I Can't Help Myself\\" that's sung well, but the backing is a karaoke machine. A couple of other cuts are just short fragments. The bottom line is that this is primarily a release for the completists and fanatics; otherwise, nonessential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracing Your Civil War Ancestors","review":"Packed full of information if your serious about your Civil War Ancestors this is the book to get.

Instead we read only a tedious & obsessive account of church architecture, which renders the book's title extraordinarily misleading. It puzzles me how a writer with such immense human understanding can write a travel book with absolutely no mention of any encounter another human being; either native Frenchmen or her fellow traveller, Henry James. She wasn't to know this since cars were such new technology, but travel in cars cannot do otherwise than totally seal off the traveller from his environment. This was a huge and sadly missed opportunity to describe travel at the dawn of the motoring era: before traffic jams, before towns bordered by terrible bland industrial parks and out of town shopping malls, before ring roads, freeways, and ubiquitous Macdonalds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb gay holiday film","review":"Aida Turturro could have been nominated for an Oscar for this film.

I just got into it relatively recently, but I am hooked. In the sea of poorly thought out animated series catering to children with 17 second attention spans, Xiaolin showdown stands out. Consistency, logic, and a good dose of humor make this a must see.Word to the wise, though... there -are- silly moments, so those who want their cartoons dark, brooding, and humorless might want to look elsewhere for entertainment. If you don't mind a little bit of silly that does not get in the way of the story, however, you'll enjoy Xiaolin showdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment for my Child!","review":"This is a 2 disk set.

Raimondo I like the most because he is always the one making jokes. And Kimico is a girly-girl, but in battle, she is feirce. Don't think this cartoon is all humor, it is also logical.

Alex can morph into a liqued and stay like that but if she's in a more cold or in water she can stay a liqued longer. #3. Alex can zap things with her finger. Alex's best friend Ray thinks her powers are cool, And her sister Annie thinks Alex is a science project.

This album is a gem that reminds me of those radio songs - it reminds me of family gatherings, my grandparents and great aunts & uncles, weekends in the kitchen cooking. I got it free as a gift from a store I worked at, I had no idea it could command this much for a price! I think the store we sold it in, it was under $20.

So don't think \\"he probably listens to all gospel, poor guy, never heard the good stuff\\". This is a good CD even for those of you who don't believe in Christ.These guys are very talented in every category except maybe creativity.

This means of course that it is quintessential Franken: a rambling style; sneering and smirking pretending to be humor (humor that is foundationally infantile and unfunny); and ho-hum banalities that Franken has delusionally convinced himself constitute sophisticated political observation. And the ignorance! My favorite is when Franken refers to Kerry as an \\"observant Catholic.\\" Huh? Kerry is an abortion proponent; he is by definition NOT an observant Catholic.Granted, Franken isn't quite the psychopath Mahr is.

If however, you pay attention to politics, which you probably do if you read this book, what he tells you is nothing new....although I wasn't aware that the $11.1 trillion dollar social security deficit that Bush kept repeating at his staged town hall events was generated by calculating the cost of social security \\"until the year infinity\\" lol and by assuming that people live to the ripe old age of 150!!!

While his witty humor adds just the right amount of levity to an otherwise disheartening series of truisms - I was struck by the amount of research, detail and clarity he brings to each discussion. This is a well researched book that is on par with serious political authors like Howard Zinn, Noam Chompski, Arundhati Roy, Mark Crispin Miller and Jimmy Carter. In addition, Franken's familiarity with mainstream media and the many players within it provide an unusual glimpse into how the media spin game is played.

He has the ability to use common idiomatic expressions effectively in his sarcastic moments, and his self-deprecration goes just far enough to entertain and no further.

It's really quite unfortunate; Franken's points go over much better when he's put as much work into the joke as to the point of contention.Now, as to the idiots posting 1-star reviews, who HAVEN'T read the book and are instead reviewing Franken's politics..how about we leave that stupidity to the folks at \\"dailykos\\" and \\"moveon\\".

Well, perhaps Bush won a mandate to conduct Kerry's policies, you wonder. On the bottom of page 27 Franken quotes Cheney as having said some astonishing things.

It's a full dozen hours of unabridged talking, just Al Franken and you. Some of the quotes are done with Franken doing imitations of Cheney or President Bush or some random Scottsman. Sometimes he inserts real audio clips - the people he makes fun of do a much better job of making fun. It's a good book, a better audio read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, bad technology","review":"I enjoyed the book very much, but I made the mistake of putting it into my iPod...the disks are separated into 99 individual tracks and many are named something ridiculous...sooooooI would suggest listeing to this on the disk as is and not importing into iTunes or yout iPod. But the writing is great (Franken is always a treat) and the information is stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY READ THIS BOOK","review":"Like Lies, this book is both hilarious and insightful. I was surprised by the number of negative reviews that hit early this morning, the DAY THE BOOK WAS RELEASED. Got to love those fast readers. (The vast right wing conspiracy to lower the book's star rating I guess). Anyway, do yourself a favor and read this, or better yet get the audiobook. Franken's delivery is great. A Winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on","review":"If all you are going to do is comp[lain dont read the book. I like and agree with most thing Franken says, but you have to remember he started his career on SNL makeing fun of a fat, gay, depressing self help character."},{"rating":"1","title":"The people of Minnesota must be out of their mind","review":"How the heck does such an ignorant person become senator of a state?! This book is such a joke (no pun intended). It is not even worth the cost of paper to print this nonsense; hence why this book is selling for a PENNY. Al Franken is a waste of your time and a waste of a person in general. God bless you Minnesota"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must read for every citizen","review":"First - I have read the book. I would request all reviewers to state this before commenting so that you can put their observations in context. You don't have to agree with Al or his style to be moved by the volume of evidence in this book. Well written, thought provoking. Recent news events make you wonder about the administration? Reading this will open up more questions - and how did we get here. Think about this as the Christmas Gift for those that voted from fear. The real threat to our freedoms and future are already here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got my copy finally - I love it!","review":"And don't listen to the crazed rightwing nutjobs like this guy:---Speaking of pulling the plug, Al, looks like Air ANTI-America might be going off the air soon. Guess you'll have to move on that Goebbels show of yours someplace else. Trick or treat!---Guess what - Air America is doing great! They get MORE listeners all the time. Stop spreading the BIG LIE, crazy man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Franken Strikes Again!","review":"Although \\"The Truth\\" is not on the same level as Franken's biting and hilarious \\"Lies\\", the new edition still packs quite a punch. Al abandons taking on the conservative pundits and goes straight for the president and the current administration armed with nothing but facts and a smug confidence. Don't think that Al Franken is to the left as Sean Hannity is to the right, Al deliberately goes out of his way to be honest and tell the truth. I was listening to his show the other day and he went out of his way to point out that Bush has the biggest budget defecits in history, but \\"to be fair\\", he went on \\"that is not adjusted for inflation.\\" The man is a patriot and he is FUNNY! Check out The Truth, it's a solid read and essential for understanding today's political landscape."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Important Piece of Writing","review":"Al Franken is really an intelligent person. It's so obvious. I really enjoyed the book except for a portion in one of the first several chapters where he (admittedly) tells obscene lies about Sean Hannity (or someone of that ilk). I got his point but I just did not believe he needed to waste pages on that stuff.There are about 20 pages of \\"NOTES AND SOURCES\\" and that is impressive.I do hope that in whatever Mr. Franken's next book is, he just sticks to THE TRUTH and does not permit his comedian inner-self to get the better of him. The Truth -- for me at least -- lost some credibility when Franken 'veered off course' with that taste-of-his-own-medicine (lies) stuff.I am a TRUE ACOLYTE of Al Franken and I would read anything he published; I admire him completely.I RECOMMEND this book to anyone under age sixty. It is the original page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and hilarious as usual","review":"Al has never been better. During a time of great shame for almost all media outlets Mr.Franken has done for us what the main stream press should have been doing ever since Mr.Bush began beating his unchecked false war drums leading up to the attack on Iraq. Al never questions the heroism of America's brave ( though misled) troops. Instead he focuses on the lies and manipulations of this administration and it's hacks who concentrate not on justice but on hiding truth and attacking any one who criticizes bush and his corrupt cohorts. Al makes you laugh but even more important he exposes the bush administraion for the crimial filled cabal it is and yet he makes you laugh and gives you hope. I whole heartedly recommend this wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perversion and pollution of the english language","review":"What can you make of a book claiming to present \\"The Truth\\" that contains four or five falsehoods in the first page of text?

I will not buy anything that was promoted in that manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I get it!!","review":"If you have been wondering why the Democratic Party has been losing elections and power these last few years, the answer lies in this book and its brilliant video.Jokes about the war. Groin kicks to conservatives. Hatred to all who dare to disagree. This is the same vitriol that has led to repeated failure by the democrats to win elections. If anyone doubts that the left wing hates this country, this book is all you need.At least it makes a few left wing readers laugh, and makes a few dollars for Al Franken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franken lies about Bush","review":"Al Franken claims on several pages, for example on page 46, that President Bush said that \\"... Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear waepons program.\\" That is not what President Bush said. He stated quite unambiguously that Iraq was reconstituting its NUCULAR weapons program. That is a completely different matter having to do with exploding eggs in microwave ovens, thereby murdering the unborn.Go ahead and try to refure this using your pathetic attempts at logic, Franken, and see who believes you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Al Franken disguises propaganda as comedy without the comedy","review":"Al Franken is what McCarthy was warning America about in the 50s. He attempts, desperately, throughout his book to convince the reader that his words are full of honest to God truth while doing so in an untruthful, untasteful and really hateful way.Al Franken might have HAD a sense of humor but he lost it years ago when he became an angry liberal and this book only proves that fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"More crap from Franken","review":"I can see from most of the reviews here that the mindless moonbat patrol is in full swing! If you're a liberal you'll love this book if you're a republican you'll hate it, it's that simple! I don't subscribe to Franken's point of view nor do I subscribe to Bush's. This book is about as funny as root canal and it takes longer to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Air(head) America & Franken's ratings are in the toilet...","review":"Before you buy the book ...watch the promo video, for a preview of Franken's twisted, hate-filled mindset, not funny, ....actually quite sad.

I'm amazed that Al is still around. I guess he has a certain \\"left wing jerks\\" following. If you are a free thinker, don't waste your money. I can sum it up for you....he hates Bush, he hates our country, he hates.....well, you get the point. Be responsible and don't support people like Al, whether it be left or right. If we don't buy these hate books, they won't make money and the publisher will turn them away. Bottom line, Al isn't fair to the Bush administration. If you do read the book, do yourself a favor and don't take what he says as gospel. Al, we aren't as stupid as you seem to think we are.

It is violent, but not funny.Yuck yuck, so much for tolerance. Glad my daughter wasn't anywhere near my computer when I played it.If this is the best Franken can come up with to pitch his book, regardless of your political persuasion, \\"The Truth - With Jokes\\" will likely make a new classification in publishing borrowed from the straight-to-video market: straight-to-remainder-bin.If you can stomach your way through this unfunny book, you really are a Franken fan, and deserve a full 21 Granola Bar salute.But if you want \\"funny\\" with a liberal slant, there are plenty of better sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth is Al Franken is no longer funny","review":"More sick and twisted \\"humor\\" from Al Franken. \\"The Truth (with Jokes)\\" is skimpy on ground breaking truths and the jokes are, well, predictable.

No, he's not funny, I enjoy political humor from any side. Franken just comes off as angry and deluded and tries to mask it with what he thinks is funny.I guess this is what our culture craves, unfunny political satire wraped up in a pseudo intellectual brash of left accusations towards the right, alot of which is utterly rediculous. Strip away his semi quick wit and what we have is the left's version of Sean Hannity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for truth and honesty? Then look elsewhere!","review":"I can save you a lot of time and your $25 buck can better be spent elsewhere. This book is all about how John Kerry supposedly lost last year. Interesting that Franken presents a lot of bogus nonsenense but fails to discuss the carp that Kerry and the democrats tried to pull and were unsuccessful in stealing the 2004 election. Like that fake telephone message from Gen. Norman Schwatrzkrop who had suddenly changed his mind and was endorsing John Kerry!

I suspect the book sinks like a stone in about a month.However, Al's rage at losing his lollypop blinds him to the fact that this President is actually more liberal than even he could dream! What's one little war compared with deficits as far as the eye can see, questionable court appointments, incompetent bureaucracies, the lower socio being filled from the firehose of Mexican immigration (vote early & often), tax cuts being defeated, pork exceeding the maddest dreams of even FDR, and we're actually energizing the UN again...So, c'mon Al, with all that, what's a little war among us friends?

What a disappointment! First, the writing style and vocabulary is simplistic, definitely a very easy but \\"elementary school\\" read.

Unfortunately, it is uncharacteristically boring and unoriginal. There is surprisingly little humor, and without this Al is no different from any of the other progressive writers documenting Bush's faults. If you tend to read progressive literature or news items (including The Daily Show, Alternet, Media Matters for America) and can see past the mainstream media's conservative bias, there will be nothing new, surprising, or interesting in this book.

Franken spends most of the book just complaining about the fact that Bush won the election in 2004 and how he is going to destroy the country by ending medicare and social security and blah blah blah; None of it happened - except destroying the the economy before he left office.Bottom line, I felt like I was reading a book written by a whining 8 year old instead of the Al Franken I knew from Lies.Most of the book is out of date now, and unlike Lies, I would recommend you just don't read this; it's really terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, informative but slanted","review":"I enjoy Franken's books and especially this one. I think most of what Franken says is true and I also find the Bushies appauling. But the books is very slanted towards the left.

It essentially points out many of the various forms of corruption going on in government through the last year and half or so, throws in some satire, and gives some very nice heart-felt analysis.The only disappointing thing about the book is that there is little NEW material. About 85% of what is in this book has been discussed at length on Al's Air America Show and I was a little disappointed to see that Al's new book is nothing more than a re-hash of his radio show, something he endlessly criticizes Bill O'Reilly of doing.That being said, it is really nice seeing all the FACTS so nicely laid out here in tight book form and it was a rather enjoyable read, so I guess I'm a flip-flopper in my analysis, or maybe I'm just fair and balanced. ;-)steve."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Missing with Franken's TRUTH","review":"Like Cindy Sheehan's screed, you can't judge this book by the reviews and number of stars on amazon.com.

I can get some clothing that fits me in retail stores, but often I find many of the retail stores go up to 1 size too small for me, and I wind up having to go to a big and tall store (which sometimes has the opposite problem, because I am on the sizing border), and end up having to pay a premium price.Amazon sent me a coupon for $20 off a $100 order, and on top of that, their prices were much better than the retail stores that don't have my size.

But on each of the last two pair I purchased, the belt loops popped off at the slightest pull. And Levis have reduced the number of loops from 7 to 5. It's too bad. They always used great material that feels great after a break-in period. But at $30-$50 a pop, they're no longer worth it. The break-in period becomes a broke period.

Since the jeans were Levi's, the retailer offered to swap out the jeans for the CORRECT size. He said he would take care of returning the wrong-sized jeans to the Levi's company.

I've purchased and worn dozens and dozens of Levis 501s & 550s over last 40 years. When they were made in the USA you could identify the factory and know what cut and fit to expect. The stonewashed jeans only shrank over a long period of time. Then there was Mexico and Egypt. Both different. Now, the last pairs purchased from Amazon came from Haiti. This is not a commentary on the Haitian people. This is a commentary about jeans. The Haitian jeans [stone washed] are cut oddly and shrink with one washing [The same sizes from Egypt ran large]. The fabric may vary and be thinner than yesterdays' jeans, but the real issue is fit.

I've never had that happen on any other pair of jeans that I have owned.The fit is still great on Levi's jeans, but cutting costs by cutting thread count or fabric durability doesn't make any sense...remember all those Levi's adds touting how tough the jeans have been since they were original made for 49ers?

Reading some of the negative comments had me concerned that Levi's might be cheapening materials or manufacturing standards too much, but the jeans I received are still well within the parameters I care about that keep me buying Levi's.

His life was cut way too short. There's no telling what he could have done, but at least we have some very memorable recordings of Quebec, which includes this 1961 recording cut for Blue Note Records.\\"It Might As Well Be Spring\\" capture Quebec in fine form with Freddie Roach on organ, Milt Hinton on bass, and Al Harewood on drums. For those of you who don't like organ, especially in jazz music, should give this recording a spin, because what we have here is unobtrusive and lyrical, which is not like jazz organ. It's a healthy alternative to the style of organists like Jimmy Smith and Larry Young. Roach's approach was more subtle and it somehow makes this recording just sound right.This is a group that plays with a low burning fire under them and after awhile you'll start to smell what's really cooking: this beautifully played music.

I found the text to be somewhat rambling (almost like a folksy mind dump) and loosely structured. The examples and illustrations I was looking for weren't there. Maybe you had to hear the author speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Requires Acrobat Big Brother? digital sign-in","review":"Suggest you test your digital capability to download eBooks and open them by using Acrobat's \\"File\\\\Digital Editions\\\\Authorize Devices\\" before buying as Acrobat now requires a drm activation on each computer by computer and this apparently has to be transferred one to the other, and the worst part is that they apparently have major problems with their drm activation server such that I have been unable to get my \\"instant\\" pdf book for two days now.

The organization's leadership had superficially adopted a BSC approach, so my first job was to understand if the approach was appropriate for our organization. This book provided me my answer. This approach is absolutely the right way to head. The book also gave me the knowledge and understanding to design and implement the system. My favorite takeaway from the book is a set of questions that I can use to help get the information needed from key players. Sometimes the right questions are just as important as the right answers!

To my knowledge the third song \\"Men Will Be Men\\" has not been released anywhere else than on this rare single. Being a big fan of Vega, I have now succeeded in getting hold of the single and though \\"Men Will Be Men\\" is nice enough, it is not really very memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent British Crime Thriller Series","review":"Excellent Detective Mystery Series! If you are looking for mystery films more challenging than what you see in American TV mysteries, then this is what you've been looking for. Clever screenplay writing and storylines. Robson Greene is superb as the not quite sane but sharp profiling detective who races against time with his dedicated team to apprehend sinister killers. If you like the Wire in the Blood series, you'll love Robson Greene in this performance.I'm not sure why another reviewer felt subtitles are necessary to watch this film. None are necessary unless English is not the viewer's first language. I do agree with other reviewers that it is a very odd decision to release the 3rd season before the first 2 seasons. Note to the manufacturers: Come on....make the first two seasons available in dvd format!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Series, O.K. DVD","review":"\\"Touching Evil\\" was a brilliant English TV series, starring Robson Greene (best known from \\"Soldier, Soldier\\") as Dave Creegan, a divorsed, depressed and slightly psychic detective. American viewers got to see this wonderful programme on PBS's Mystery! segment, with an introduction by Diana Rigg.The DVD itself is a bit of a disappointment. The are 2 rather pathetic text documents on the history of weird fictional detectives and an autobiography of Diana Rigg. There are no subtitles, only closed captions which can only be accessed if your TV has that option. On the plus side, the Mystery! intros are included on the DVD, as is access to an online tour of the Mystery! set. There are also audio descriptions for the visually impaired.The series itself is the reason you should get this DVD, not because of the extra features. Hopefully the first two series will also be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey guys, think yourselves lucky!!","review":"I'm green with envy at anyone who can actually get their mitts on a VHS/DVD of this great show.

The TV show was interesting but \\"politically correct\\" in every detail. This book, however, is much more valuable as a guide to the true turmoil, violence, and upheaval that were the lot of the South in the years following the Civil War. I have read a great deal of Civil War history, but this is one of the few books that has brought me new knowledge in a dramatic, immediate and evenhanded way.

She loves Strawberry Shortcake and was so excited to get this set. However, once we opened it, we were very disappointed. As someone else mentioned, this set is about as good as a Happy Meal toy. The handlbars fell off the scooter immediately and I was afraid my 18 month old would choke on them. A few other pieces fell off also. Needless to say, this toy is already in the garbage after not even a days worth of play out of it.

While the extra dolls were exactly what I was looking for, the rest of the set was a complete disappointment. There are only two pieces in addition to the dolls and their hats, and they are nothing more than kids meals toys. She was SO disappointed when none of the pieces came apart for play that she almost cried. I ended up taking the scooter and the cake off the platforms so that she could play with them and threw the rest away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!

It's WWII, and this is one story of the women, a facet of war that often gets short shrift. The movie is in German with English subtitles, making it all the more interesting and making it impossible to multi-task. It's worth paying attention. Two of these women are going to fall madly in love with each other in spite of the incredible odds working against them. One is a Nazi housefrau, one the member of a Jewish underground network. They meet, however, as women, become friends and fall deeply in love with each other at a time and place that would seem the worst of all times and places for such a thing. For that, it is a love story that overcomes all obstacles until the end. An ending that will break your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful despite the subtitles","review":"What else can I say. Aimee and Jaguar was a wonderful love story. This is one of the best Lesbian Movies I've purchased so far. I was a little concerned about the subtitles, which left me lost a few times, but it ended up coming all together for me. I was so moved at the end. I had to share it with someone! I had my partner so intrigued that she had to watch it right away.

The Wanderers takes a differant turn in the beginning by having Jinnai Sabotage Makoto's machine thus sending the cast to El Hazard. In addition to the opening story change, they changed the personality of Iferita, and created a love interrest between Mikoto and the princess. The other major change is the deletion of the princesses sister who makes up some of the funniest moments of the OAV set. Also one major note, the Alternate world set takes place based on the Magnificent World set and not the Wanderers. This set is good to get only to see the alternate version of how it started, but is worth it, for its own merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Costume is cut in a strange way, i have a Yorkshire with little short legs and the costume is a 100% bad fit.

The character Lil' Dice is truly a psycho, the film shows him murdering at a very young age.

Surely, I will have idiots that will criticize me for not liking this OVERLY violent movie, is beyond me.The violence was too much. Shooting left and right, pretty much the entire movie.The sadistic way that the main character was laughing when he was going to shoot a crying, terrified child is sick to my stomach. How can people like seeing that crap?I don't need to see these type of scenes to see what goes in a favela.The story line was that a guy made out of the favela in these type of horrible conditions.

This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. Although I can't speak a word of Portuguese, the acting was so real that I could completely understand what was going on.I am glad to read that this movie sparked changes in Brazillian policy toward the poor. While being poor is not a crime, this movie shows how poverty can lead to crime and an endless cycle of continued violence.This is a great movie for wayward teenagers to watch, so that they can see with their own two eyes that crime does not pay - it only leads to a spiral of death and hopelessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I found this movie while looking through the IMDB top 250 movies. It was the first one on the list that I had not seen. I think it was somewhere in the 20's or 30's but it was definitely towards the top of the list. It had several hundred thousand votes.

I would recommend to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is a brilliant, unforgettable movie detailing the lives of two generations trapped in a crime-ridden slum.

It was the best film of 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"an electrifying view into the drug war in Rio de Janeiro","review":"Living in Rio de Janeiro I'm already used to the daily news on shoot outs in the favelas of Rio. But this elegantly told and brilliantly shot movie based on the book of a writer who actually lives in \\"Cidade de Deus\\" -one of the over 600 favelas of Rio de Janeiro - was a wake up call for the middle and upper class who live in the nicer areas of Rio. It opened the eyes for a social problem which a lot of people tried so hard to ignore over decades.

In this Brazilian movie, about the eponymous Rio De Janeiro slum of the 70s, the central character, who is the narrator too, fails to evoke the pathos in the viewer, which the movie should have. In fact, at the end of the goings on, one does not feel too strongly about the violence in the movie either. It could have been a very impactful movie had the drama been made more intense and powerful. Ram Gopal Verma-ish treatment of this script would have created a wonderful movie. There were many moments in the script which could have been nail biting had its (the script) treatment been more feature film like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Documentary is much better","review":"I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone - unless they were scouting for someone to direct the next James Bond or Arnold Schwarzenegger film. It's just a fast-paced gangster flick, using (one is tempted to say 'exploiting') as a background one of the most troubled slums in the world. People die every few moments, and it sports a relentless, pumped-up, John-Woo-style gun-and-trouble worship which you can find in dozens of action flicks these days. It's flashy as hell, and not real.The documentary on the DVD, however, is another story altogether. It's completely centered on the government terror that rains down on this city daily (something very marginal in the film) and is truly terrifying in a way that the andrenaline-MTV-soaked movie can't touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRAZILIAN BOYS N THE HOOD","review":"it's very obvious that the makers of this movie were influenced by american movies like MENACE 2 SOCIETY and PULP FICTION.there's all kind of arty mtv music video direction, narration, flashbacks, flash forwards, violence---and a plot about a ghetto kid turned...photographer!?!also lots of disco type music, that kinda makes the movie cornball after awhile, despite all the violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY AWSUM HARD-HITTING MOVIE","review":"REALLY, REALLY GOOD, GRITTY, REAL AND SAD MOVIE.

This material could have been packaged way better: develop a better story or some hook to focus the attention, get rid of the tired technique of jerky handheld camera POV (it has been played to death), and shorten the film (towards the end I just completely lost interest). The whole film was just tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie stinks","review":"i heard so many great things about this movie.

The movie feels to me like a pure comedy. It will make you laugh almost as much as the acclaimed masterpiece, Beauty Shop. Ugh, where do I start with whats wrong with this film? The actors are just plain terrible. Where the heck is Vince Vaughn when you need him?OK when it comes down to it if you are looking for a serious enjoyable film, this is NOT where to look.

Don't let the subtitles scare you! - you will greatly miss out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Gangster Picture","review":"Don't let the title, and the fact that this is a foreign language film, throw you off. This is not a religious picture, nor is it a \\"beautifully photographed triumph of the human spirit\\". This is a story about youth gangs in a Brazilian housing project, ironically named \\"The City of God.\\" In reality it's a brutal slum, with grinding poverty. The film follows the story of several kids who grow up in this slum, most of them starting early on a life of crime.This is a film in the tradition of \\"Goodfellas\\" and \\"Menace II Society\\", with traces of \\"Once Upon a Time in America.\\" Brilliantly scripted, acted, and edited, with believable, three-dimensional characters, this is a movie that will grip you from the first moments until the end.It should be noted that like any gangster picture there's plenty of violence, and its view of life is pretty grim. Don't rent or buy this movie if you think it's going to be a \\"charming foreign film.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I love latin foreign movies but this one's boring: drug dealers and shooting","review":"There are no surprises in this movie compared to the telenovelas.It's basically a movie about drug dealing punks who take over each generation or decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!","review":"This movie, to use a cliche, had me on the edge of my seat.

It will haunt your soul and you will want to turn your head. Is is exaggerated? From what I've heard and read, it isn't an overstatement. I wouldn't say it's one of those must see movies for anyone politically tuned in, but it's a slice of pie that reflects the war on drugs and, in this piece, the impact of adult decisions on children that are survivalists.

The slum is a lovely backdrop to the non-stop action. In a sense, nobody is completely guilty or innocent; the criminals have their code of honor, and the cops are on the take. Everyone must make a choice or a choice will be thrust upon you. The City of God could have been shot in any country's slum. It is also a coming-of-age tale about a young kid who loves photography. As a reviewer noted, the violence is not gratuitous--but it is a necessary evil to show how hopeless life can become. The editing is wonderful in this film as we jump through the lives and times of the characters(see Sryiana for a similar hyperlink technique where random characters and their stories are shown and linked to the action and theme of the film)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary World Cinema Classic!","review":"Contemporary World Cinema Classic!One of my favorites!

Despite this, I could not connect with Katie the way I could with Bridget Jones. As much as I tried to like Katie and actually care about the travesties in her life, I could not bring myself to feel sorry for her for the mistakes she makes; I felt she finally got what was coming to her.I'd be interested to read any possible further works by this author, since she has a formula that appears to be working for other authors. I would, however, not recommend this first effort by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read this...","review":"During lazy summer months, I indulge in a little light, upbeat reading about romance, shopping, friendships and life as a single gal. Most of the books in this genre are fairly well-written, entertaining, light and funny, sadly, this book IS NOT. To be blunt, it was horrible. The main character, Katie Castle, is the type of person you avoid in real life (nasty, jealous, two-faced, shallow, low in self-esteem, hateful to her friends and family...). No matter how hard the author tried, this character was never likeable and impossible to relate to (you don't want her to succeed...never a good sign). The only advice I can give is please don't waste your time reading this book...it isn't worth it.If you do want a fun, light-hearted novel, try anything by Naomi Walker or Clare Naylor's Dog Handling.Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Katie Castle reminds me a bit of Scarlett O'Hara: unlikeable if met in person, but fascinating and with an admirable set of balls. This book provides all of the satisfaction of a typical chick-lit book, but with none of the tedium. Vivid characters, light-hearted and witty language, vicarious triumph in a competetive industry, interesting detail about the fashion world, smart-ass comments about everything. Couldn't be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"So glad I borrowed from the library instead of spending money on this junk.

I'm also a Fashion Student and love anything involving the catwalk & designers, so when I saw this book I just had to have it! I guess now would be a good time to mention I bought this book about 5 years ago and have tried numerous times over the years to finish it! (TRY being the keyword) When I would take the time to read it my eyes would glaze over with boredom. The book went no where, the characters are dull, and it's just plan BORING!

Purchased mainly on the words of Sophie Kinsella's quote on the cover. I think after reading this tripe, I have lost a bit of respect for her as well.The main character really does feel that the world revolves around her and NO one could be as cute, smart, fashionable or successful. And if anyone IS any of the above, she had something to do with it.The only love in this book is hating Katie Castle. Getting everything she diserved would be a perfect ending, but no...one has to suffer through another 100 or so pages while her life returns to perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slave to Fashion by Rebecca Campbell","review":"Well written, but bitter and cynical I loathed the (self confessed) bulimic heroine, Katie, by the end.

All of the people in her life turn on her (deserved) and she is left without a job, friends or a place to live. Throughout the whole ordeal, she faces problems with great humor and candor. Kind of like a modern day fairy-tale with a great ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"um...","review":"ugh. not to sound so harsh. but her previous book kinda was boring too. it was long and draggy. i've decided to give this book a chance after seeing a comment made by Sophia Kinsell, the author of the famous Shopaholic series and found that this book seem to be a borrowed idea of shopaholic and it was really boring. not funny. anything. nadah."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no Option for Zero stars???","review":"This has to be the most boring book EVER.

She mentions of mixing herbs together that should not be mixed. NO warnings for herb drug reactions. She speaks of using Black Cohosh (causes liver damage), wild yam root which does nothing, and St. John's Wort all at once. St. John's wort MUST BE TAKEN WITH CAUTION. DO NOT TAKE IT WITH DRUGS!

Intertwined is the story of one person effected by the Los Angeles riots in 1992. Constantly shifting scenes, places and dates bring together a story that is at once unusual and intriging.

The music is sublime - cantata settings by one of the finest mid-Baroque composers - and the performances are of a luminosity that takes the breath away. I have taken the piece Jesu meines lebens leben and put it on repeat to listen to it over and over in a meditative way. It is here where the earthy Lutheran spirituality of Buxtehude comes into play. Even if one doesn't understand German, the steady pulse of the ground bass captures one, as does the text \\"Jesus I thank you a thousand time a thousand\\" (English and German quite close here).I am also familiar with the Ton Koopman collection on Erato, which uses soloists throughout. I find these performances slightly less inspirational than the present one but it too warrents repeated listening to really appreciate the depth of this wonderful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it Now","review":"Superb recording.

I highly recommend this and The Sequel To this boook."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay read, read well","review":"The best thing about the audio edition of this book is reader Marie Caliendo's pacing and vocal characterizations. Ms. Caliendo takes her time rendering this predictable, riches-to-rags-to-riches story. Her vocal characterizations lent interest to otherwise one-dimensional, underdeveloped participants.

The author is so obsessed with disproving the arguments of the anti-porn feminists (which are about 20 years old at this point) that he misses a grand opportunity to simply understand what men are doing with porn. Essentially, he has let his enemy frame the language and topic of debate and he never gives himself the opportunity to move beyond a discussion of whether or not porn equals subjugation of women.To be sure, subjugation of women is a valid topic when discussing porn, but it is far from the only topic. What about fantasies, what about masturbation, what about relationships and negotiating porn, what about shame, what about gay men, what about pleasure for god sakes? All these issue are forgotten in Loftus's intractable argument with anti-porn feminism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story of a latin American country and the impact of one man","review":"The book shows the conditions of Honduras C.A. in the early 20th century and how a man with his God changed people's lives and the primitive conditions within the country.

Every song on this disc is great but you would never know it given that this is one of the worst sounding CDs I have ever heard. EVER. Does Wounded Bird records know how to spell digital distortion let alone hear it? I don't think so. The original record is so great. What were they thinking?

The reason I give this 1985 classic only 1 star is because Wounded Bird Records did a VERY poor job in transferring and mixing it to CD. The sound is muffled and sounds like a homemade bootleg. It's not even remastered! The artwork (especially the back cover) is generic. The CD itself is PINK!As for the songs...they SMOKE! If you're into 80's Dokken and Ratt then you'll dig this CD. It's very hook-laden stuff. This band from Chicago was way ahead of it's time. Why doesn't Atlantic Records (the label that originally released this album in 1985) release it onto CD with proper attention to remastering the sound and exact detail in artwork?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble Bath Fantasy","review":"In the interview with the author at the end of the book, she relates that when she began writing The Church of the Dog, she did not intend to have it published.

I'll give it to you, the trailer made me think I was going to be actually watching a comedy. And Anthony Anderson is usually a bright spot in any film. Poor Anthony couldn't save this dog. I was dismayed when my husband and I rented this movie and discovered that the best and only jokes of the film were shown on the trailers. They were also shown fairly early in the film too. So we basically sat watching the movie in dead silence. I began daydreaming to entertain myself until my husband begged me to turn it off. Yep, it was that bad. We can only stand about 45-50 minutes of crap at at a time. Please save your money and buy food or gas or a better movie.

Just the title alone I wasn't really expecting this movie to be on a Friday or Barbershop 1 type level but I was expecting it to be a little more funny than it was. It had some cute moments and if not for Method Man playing the crazy cousin \\"No Good\\", John Amos (Good Times) playing his typical hilarious father figure role, and Paula Jai Parker (The original Friday) playing her usual ghetto fabulous roles, it probably would have easily have gotten 0 stars. However, the fact that the movie was actually clean, and the comedy very tame to the point where I could let my 9 year old watch it, I won't complain too bad. The fact that the message of the movie was to show grown men to take better care of their responsibility as parents was not lost on me as well which saved me from completely trashing the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Tame A Land","review":"This book had one of the best plots of any Louis L'Amour books you'll ever read.

Billy Gilman has too high a voice; he hits notes that make my Maltese turn in circles. Stevie Brock is too white; he sounds like a Vienna choir boy. And Jessica Simpson got bogged down in Schoenbergian serialism and, later, the Cagean notion of introducing chance elements and indeterminacy into her compositions.After the dust settles, there will be only Aaron Carter standing above the pack, rapping about dirt bikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good, can't wait","review":"I, like many other girls and guys alike, am a fan of Aaron Carter. He just sings good, fun, up beat, no cussing music. I can't wait for this CD, and from what I have heard, it sounds awsome. Aaron is growing up before our eyes, and in my opinion, the older he's gotten, the better artist he's become. My sister owns Aaron's Party and Oh Aaron, and loves and charishes them both. It's just good music that anyone can listen to. This looks like another classic 5-star album. Take a listen at \\"To All the Girls\\", \\"Another Earthquake\\", and \\"Summertime\\". The clips I've heard sound awsome, and I can't wait for this CD! (well, technicly my sister, but that means I'll get to listen to it too!*).

This album is funky, soulful, and riveting. Aaron sings with a grit beyond his years. This kid can sing better than Marvin Gaye and Al Green combined. He's a legend in the making! Songs like \\"To All The Girls\\", \\"My First Ride\\", \\"2 Good 2 B True\\", and \\"Sugar\\" talk about the pueriles of growing up in America today. They are very powerful. I nearly cried listening to \\"America AO\\", a stinging punk anthem about the state of America today. It's so deep, this is very powerful music.But what do you come to expect from Aaron Carter though? You didn't actually think he'd actually release a rushed set of childlike kiddie pop that has no substance beyond the Disney Channel or fifth graders?

Aside from the fact that he is only signed because his brother is a Backstreet Boy, and that entire fad wore off a while ago, Aaron is just plain boring and over produced.His songs mainly cater to the un-trained ears of 9 year old girls, who rely more on clothing and looks to hook their fan base, than actual music talent.And I'm getting of hearing songs where Aaron mentions Nick. People who are giving this album 5 stars need to admit to themselves that their obsession is nothing more than a teeny bopper feeling. Yes, Aaron has a few fun and feel-good songs, but this is NOT music.Aaron- do yourself a favor- STAY IN SCHOOL.

As is Rule's trade mark, the victims are not run aways or prostitutes, but rebels and free spirits, and every one is beautiful.The book often descends into this trade mark treacliness, but the detail and quality research put into this book more than makes up for it.

However, this latest book is filled with endless repetitive lives of what she calls \\"working girls\\" which may be her version of a politically correct description of hookers. For a period of over twenty years the Washington police department bungled the job of finding this maurauding killer even with descriptions of his truck, clothes, etc. Why does Rule continue to pander to the police about what wonderful jobs they are doing in all of her books.

Her insight into Bundy and her personal relationship with him were fascinating. Here, however, her relationship to Ridgeway is not interesting in the least. She didn't know the guy - he lived nearby (no surprise) and attended some of her speaking/book signings. No surprise there either. Thats about it. The descriptions of the victims were very confusing - I couldn't keep them straight in the lease since there were so many and she hoped from one to another. Although this evil man was murdering for so many years and so many women - this book could/should have been much shorter. There are better books - wish I hadn't bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this book, having read previous works by Ann Rule, including I-5 Killer and Stranger Beside Me. The sheer number of murders attributed to the GRK, together with his ability to elude police for years before he was finally caught, made his story one that intrigued me greatly. This book, though, leaves much to be desired. Most of the book is devoted to how each victim lived her life prior to dying at the hands of the killer. Very little of the book is given to fleshing out the life of the GRK, or getting into his mind as he sets out to kill. The book picks up a little at the end as the GRK is interrogated and begins to tell his story to the police. However, it is too little, too late, for by the last few pages, I felt mercifully glad to be finished, so that I could go on to another, different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much of an Ann Rule memoir","review":"Ann Rule is one of the most infuriating writers of any genre. When she puts her mind to it, she can certainly write true crime well, but this book suffers from a heavier dose of E.A.R.S. (Excessive Ann Rule Syndrome) than her other writings, and she always manages to inappropriately abruptly stop the flow of her narrative to put herself into whatever she is writing about.Also, her research at times is faulty, to say the least. I read the paperback version of this book -- which presumably would have given her time to correct errors from the hardback edition -- and she still, in the afterword, places the infamous Scott Peterson on death row \\"in Alcatraz\\", which has not been used as a prison since the early 1960s. Peterson is, of course, in San Quentin State Prison, but the reader is left to wonder: if Rule got this fact wrong, how many other inaccuracies are in this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twenty Years of Constant Searching","review":"You have to wonder what makes a serial killer tick. Perhaps this book by Ann Rule will help to explain a little. The case of the Green River killer began in 1982, when the first body was found. The case went on for twenty years until a new DNA matching technique was available and used to identify Gary Ridgway. He later confessed to killing 48 women, and is suspected of killing an addition twenty or more.This extraordinary book chronicles the search for the killer, but in doing so it brings great humanity to the murdered girls and their families. It also covers the years of frustration for the police working on the case. Finding body after body with no evidence to go on to link them to a killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ann Rules\\"","review":"I enjoy most of Ann Rule's books. This is one of my favorites.

SOme of them being easy targets as they were prositutes and others that weren't .

This book was just bad. Taking such an interesting topic and dragging it down with horrible metaphors and sophmoric writing. Does she expect her average reader to have a 3rd grade education? She insults her readers by using big words and then putting the definition in parathesis around it. She constanly repeats herself so much to the point where I thought I had lost my page and was re-reading. Dear Ann Rule you are the worst writer I have ever read. The novel got a bit better towards the end when she speed it up, but please retire for the good of literature. Do you know any other literary technique than similie? I mean dear god I'm a 18 year old high school student and I least know how to use syntax, diction, and irony to my advantage. Don't read this book.. please you will thank me later"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Victims Were Human, and Ann Illustrates This Well!","review":"There just seems to be a sense of urgency to write a book concerning not only a well known series of murders, but to write one which takes place not far from where you live. I'd be rich if I had a nickle for every time I would want to write about any of the number of cases in my own little burg, but it takes Ann Rule to write a book of such magnitude-she has lived in the area of Seattle where these murders took place!This is the book I had been waiting for-a book which takes these women and restores their humanity rather than reinforce their images as statistics. I thank Ann Rule for especially giving a voice to Opal Mills and Kimi-Kai Pitsor-girls, who just like all of the others, had so much to offer yet were snuffed out before they could take a foothold in the real world.A superb book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann Rule at her finest","review":"In another writer's hands, the tale of the Green River Killer could have been exploitive at the expense of his victims and the victims' families, or a story that grudgingly glorifies the killer. Instead Ann Rule honors the young women by helping the reader understand who these young women were; that they were human beings. Some (not all, it's important to note) chose prostitution but many turned to this lifestyle due to addictions or because of circumstances in childhood/early teens. Ann Rule is a sympathetic writer and it's fascinating to read her reactions to these crimes as they literally happened in her own backyard. And Ms. Rule makes the reader feel that they are part of the investigative team led by Sheriff Dave Reichert -- the true heroes of this story. Well done, Ms. Rule!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Green River Running Red","review":"Ann Rule continually repeats facts over and over. Goes through failed police attempts too many times which really drags the story out more than necessary. Its like Ann is constantly trying to refresh our memory of how long it took to solve the case. Although I finished the book it got boring half way throughGreen River, Running Red: The Real Story of the Green River Killer--America's Deadliest Serial Murderer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much info on the wrong topic","review":"I'm a big Ann Rule fan and this was not one of her best books. For her there was alot of research involved to be able to give such details about the victums. However, as a reader its too much to try to remember and put together. The lives of 48 different woman, it becomes a blurr and is boaring to read. The last part about them catching the killer after 20 years is ok, but still not that great for Ann. More focus s/be on Gary."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Crime but too interrupted","review":"The author has done better work. Although the topic is both horrific and fascinating, Ms. Rule keeps interrupting the story of the killer and killed with her own story....quite distracting. When she focuses on the crime, it is vintage Rule and worth it.....but her insertions of her story weaken the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her better books","review":"I did not think this book was well written. I skipped about 100 pages or more in the middle just to get to the end... even then I was skipping paragraphs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beating a dead horse","review":"I should know better but my wife is a fan of Ann Rules, so we got the book. It can be summed up in one word Boreing.Ann Rule spends too much time with extranous characters. She tells the victims life story, his or her signifivant other's life story and with over 50 victoms of the GRK she could and did expand page after page on material is not really relevent to why they were killed. After all GRK did not know his victims in that detailed level. So she is just filling pages.She is a good craftsman however and deserves brtter."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best book on the subject","review":"although this book is fairly comprehensive, it comes off as quite self-serving at times. rule never passes up an opportunity to make herself seem like an insider in the case, or to point out what a caring, sensitive, thoughtful person she is in the midst of so much tragedy and horror.if you're really interested in the story of the green river killer, i'd recommend starting with smith & guillen's \\"the search for the green river killer\\" for a detailed account of what happened, followed by mark prothero's (with carlton smith) \\"defending gary\\" for further insight into the killer's mind and crimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"I have read all of Ann Rule's books and this is just too disjointed. By the very nature of the crime, no. of victims, no. of years, and the changing of the many investigators, the common thread of character development that interweaves throughout the victims and investigation in most of her books, was not there. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit biased","review":"It seems the author has something against Baptists as he states in one chapter that an aquantince was a \\"former baptist\\" as though that had any relevance to the book at all.The author also states toward the begining of the book that he believes that if one has a contiuing physical problem i.e illness etc.. that does not go away after much prayer and fasting etc.. they are possesed by a demon. If this is true then paul, the writer of much of the new testament, was possesd as he had an eye problem.Finally, I felt the book in parts was more of a platform for advertising strang communications and the books he has published.Another theological misstep was the comment that Christ was going to build His church on peter. Jesus meant He would build the church upon Himself, not a mear man such as peter. Perhaps the author should have spent more time studying his greek and less time worrying about his physicalness."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"SENT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY BROTHER AND HIS WIFE WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED THEIR PREGNANCY.

However, EVERY SINGLE EPISODE involves some sort of chomping, slurping, annoying giggling, and of course the awful music. I don't know why she likes it so much, but I genuinely wish I had never put it on for her, because now I have to watch it when she does. I cringe every time he sees a carrot (or anything) to eat, or something to drink, because he has to slurp and smack his lips for a solid 30 seconds each time. It drives me crazy!! The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is because of my daughter. Oh, what we will put up with out of love for our children. :/In short, I do not recommend this show to anyone, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son LOVES it!","review":"This is my son's favorite video.

Got it quick, and Irwin taps work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice compilation record","review":"I purchased this cd mainly because the material on it is from records that are out of print and very hard to obtain. The songs by and large on this album have a smooth jazz feel to it. Very light and dreammy. Als' excellent guitar work are present in most of the songs. On some however, he takes a slight back seat approach and chooses to compliment the other musicians on the songs and blends his guitar sound in with the other surrounding instruments. All in all a pretty solid compilation cd. Hopefully the albums that these songs come from will soon surface via re-issue. But until then, this record will definatly do the trick. I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading Scottish","review":"The story was adequate, but the writing of Kel speaking Scottish was so distracting that it took a lot away from the book.

Obviously I took it away once I found him at the end of the rubber rainbow, but like I said, it was less than 5 minutes.Guess we're back to the black extreme kong ball (he gets through this too, but somehow the ball stays together), his big Nylabone (eventually these need to be tossed) and his ever favorite solid, dense plastic 14\\" Jolly ball (aka horse toy) - though this is NOT a house toy.Happy to hear this worked for some... but if you've truly got an aggressive chewer, this is not the toy for your dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy chewer worthy, but a heavy ball","review":"This is another ball on the short list (see my reviews) of toys my industrial chewer can't quickly destroy, but it's probably ours & her least favorite. My dog spends a lot of her free time indoors (to prevent my yard from being chewed/eaten), and when my girl plays with this ball, it is very loud on our floating floors because it's heavy. She prefers her other more flexible toys over this one. Still a keeper though, since it hasn't been destroyed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Ball","review":"The great thing about this ball is that it will roll for a very long distance, allowing my dog to chase after it which she seems to have a lot of fun doing. The bad thing is that it is pretty large and very heavy, meaning that sometimes my dog drops it before reaching me or doesn't even pick it up after chasing it. Also, this is definitely an outdoor ball, you should not use it indoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audioslave","review":"1st this dvd I believe is the same as the other DVD of a similar name. 2nd I am guessing this is the same DVD because it doesn't work in any DVD player.

There are still a few errors. Lesson 9 I was missing a ticker tape image and some people using Windows in lesson 13 have trouble with the \\"Black Bar\\" but using Icons instead of Icon frames solves this (View palette Display tab)(p481). All in all a very good book and certainly much better than nothing. Still after the huge outcry about the very flawed first edition it should have been perfect.

None of those three are great - largely due to poor editing, which lets many errors past - but all are servicable.Adobe GoLive CS Classroom in a Book is by far the worst of the series: seriously flawed from start to finish; riddled with errors and badly structured. Given the methodically documented negative feedback on the Adobe User Forum, one would have expected an energetic response from Peachpit. Sadly, they have yet to publish even a list of errata.I could not possibly recommend anyone buying this book - even though it is the only one on the market for GoLive CS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful but filled with errors.","review":"If you are new to website construction and are considering Adobe GoLive CS Classroom in a book (REVISED EDITION)as a reference guide...beware!How could a revised edition still have so many errors (especially as found in Chapter 9), shame on you Adobe Systems.So much of the web design industry has gone to Dreamweaver, that I wonder if Adobe has lost interest in maintaining an adaquate level of support for this product...and now we hear that Adobe has just purchased Macromedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Bugs than a Barn","review":"This is without a doubt the worst How-To book I have ever read. A 45 minute lesson will take you hours because you have to figure out work arounds for all the incorrect directions given.

Way to Go - GoLive!","review":"I am an average computer person with little html knowledge and minor web-building experience. I tried my hand at the more well known Dreamweaver program and was confused and dissappointed. I have found the GoLive program instantly approachable and its process easy to understand. I was very happy with Photoshop Classroom in a book as I am with Adobe GoLive CS Classroom in a book. The points discussed by other reviewers makes me wonder if they used the book to learn as I did or are more technical and picking out minor points I did not see. I had NO problems with these lessons - and they flowed nicely from one to the other. My first websites on my own are awesome. As I continue to learn I am blown away by the ease and fun of this program and am thankful for this teaching book. If I can do this well - anyone can too. Try it, You will Like it. Thanks again GoLive and the Adobe Team."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"After being so impressed with Illustrator CS Classroom in a Book, I forked over the money for this one and would like it back.

And while this single only has three tracks on it, they are songs that every Korn Kid has to have in their collection. The first track \\"Did My Time\\" is their current radio single. A little different for Korn at first listen, but in about 1 minute, you hear the slap bass, thundering drums and crunch guitars. Not too mention Jonathan's familar \\"growling\\"! Track two is a re-mix of \\"Did My Time\\", but one worthy of listening to as well. The true treasure is Korn's version of Metallica's \\"One\\". This is the version taken straight from MTV Icons:Metallica\\" special and is live and uncut. Definately worth the $$$ you'll pay for this single just for \\"One\\" alone. If you can wait till October for Korn's 6th studio release, then give it a shot.

He said that the reason the show hasn't been released is because it is virtually impossible (and/or prohibitively expensive) to get all of the record companies (representing all of the guest stars/singers) to sign releases that would allow the various songs to be used. DVD is a different medium/format than the original broadcast on cable and there is a different contract for royalties, residuals, etc. governing the use of the music.So...the RIAA sticks it to the common folk...again. I would imagine even if all of the guests agreed to allow their music to be used gratis, the RIAA would fight it tooth and nail."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PUT THIS SHOW ON DVD!","review":"Being British Chris Isaak fans, we would buy this in an instant if only they would put it on dvd or even video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give us Chris on DVD!","review":"I've been patient long enough. There are all kinds of DUMB TV series that have been released on DVD, much to my amazement. Who's buying the junk, anyway? But the outstanding \\"Chris Isaak Show\\" is nowhere to be found--yet.

I'd never bought a Chris Isaak CD before I watched the first season of the show, and he's still not anywhere near my favorite artist. But in the context of the show, the music is perfect. And I feel like the guys in the bands--and Yola!--are close friends.Hey Showtime, I subscribed just to watch this series. You'll never be HBO, but the \\"Chris Isaak Show\\" is an absolute winner.

The stars are natural and do not fit into the typical characters that abound on many shows that are currently airing. There is no good reason that I can see as to why this show is not on DVD. Is it a music license issue? How can newer shows with more music be released on DVD after one season? I hope the people who decide when to put his show on DVD do not wait too long. They may in fact risk losing fans of the show and or other shows that this company decides to release on DVD. It would be a shame to lose one of our best cable tv shows that exsists today.

I kept thinking \\"he's a bit of an airhead, what a dimwit\\". He often had a dopey expression on his face. Is it wrong that I liked the zombies more than the living? The story was simple enough and I liked the grotesque illustrations enough. I must admit the ending was abrupt and odd; it made little sense to me. I thought it was dumb. It could've been improved with a possible ending that had a tad of closure yet still open-ended for the story to-be-continued.

Many of the full page panels had me pausing in the story to appreciate the art.I've been aware of this title for quite some time, and have been a fan of the AMC series, which is why I give this volume (and, for that matter, Volume 2) only four stars.Shane did not play a very large role in the comic. Which was disappointing. His presence, in the series, allowed Rick to be a much purer hero early on. Shane was the protagonist, freeing Rick to be the hero we needed him to be early on. Without Shane Rick has to play both roles.So, great story, amazing art, and mostly fantastic character development.

In the book we don't have that annoying ass hick that everyone seems to love in the show. Thank heavens.The art in here is sold though not amazing. It fits the Image comic genre well. The zombies are satisfyingly grotesque. The characters are for the most part distinguishable and unique. Though with it being a black and white title I find that too many of the female charcters tend to blend into eachother and you find yourself going \\"wait who is she again?\\". But over all the art works and fits well with the writing.The writing and story are strong but like other people will mention, not shockingly original. Robert is coming far away from the likes of Battle Pope but he pulls it off. I wont spoil the story for you but never get attached to any one character.

And like a zombie, this lacked the spark of life that I think distinguishes such comics as The Sandman, Fables, Last Man, etc.Using zombies as a device should have been a no-brainer (pun intended), but to totally rely on this device without bringing more to the table gives one a huge sense of been there, done that.

It's got zombies, human survivors fighting amongst themselves as they come to grips with their new world, and... well, that's it.It jumps right into the action which is nice. However, the action and the characters aren't particularly new or interesting in any way. The dialogue can be brutally on-the-nose at points.

Things happened in this first book that didn't happen till later in the tv episodes.I also didn't like the ending. Without saying too much, Someone important dies at the end of this book.

It's supposed to be a long version of Romero's Dawn of the Dead. The zombies and the rules are the same, but the story takes its own twists and turns. This story takes a look at the human aspect of a zombie outbreak and how the people deal with the situations that arise. It's a great case study of human relationships under the strain of constant tragedy. My friends that have borrowed this or gotten it themselves, have become addicted to it. It's a great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition to the Genre","review":"Excellent story and artwork. The author really put some thought into the plotline.

I recommend this book and all the others in this series very highly.If you have read the descriptions of this book already you probably know that this isn't just some \\"horror\\" comic, but it is a character driven sociological dream come true.

This book started only a few months after that film came out, so I guess Robert Kirkman figured people who enjoy this genre would just forget about it.Kirkman's writing is presentational, convoluted, and overly worded. Big shock that he's a huge fan of commas. He has his characters speak about what they're going to do at length, then complete the action in no time; no doubt to leave more panels in the book for Kirkman's brillant (in his mind) dialogue.The pacing is poor. The characters are trite. This is nothing new. You've seen it before and done much better. How this writer sells books amazes me. Wake up, people. The real zombies are the ones who continually read this guy's stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombies don't have to equal misogyny . . .","review":"But in this comic, they do.

I'll spend my money elsewhere next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Walking Dead is DOA","review":"This collection of the first six issues of the lengthy \\"The Walking Dead\\" series (soon to be a television series) suffers from the same defects as the whole current crop of comic books and graphic novels. They are all graphics-heavy and narrative-light. This is a perfect example: as narrative, it is boring and pointless. Even the graphics lean toward the pedestrian. Why the authors in the preface had the notion that these pasty panels would actually frighten anyone is beyond me. The only frightening thing about this volume is that it is followed by many others in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally can catch up","review":"Man! Received the next day!

Stirling , and I think this crosses over into that. It's not just a scare you - gross you out kind of work. I ended up thinking more about the relationships and societal impacts than solely about a horde of undead. And that's what gives this series its power.I like the artistic style, the character development and the plotline. I'd say, grab this and see if you want to run with the series - I bet you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect book for the coffee table","review":"Known for the quality of the pictures that appeared in it, \\"Life\\" magazine was still a photojournalistic trailblazer. This book is a collection of some of the images that appeared in \\"Life\\" during the first fifty years. The spectrum of coverage is broad, everything from American dead in World War II to cannibals roasting a human body for their supper.This is a book that is perfect for placement on the coffee table to while away a few minutes while waiting for something to happen. No matter how many times you view the pictures, they still will hold your eyes and mental attention. You can open this book to a random page and find something of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly disappointed","review":"I bought the Philips 15\\" LCD TV Nov. 04 for $429 from Costco. It now has two black circles on the screen where the bulbs have self destructed. Not exactly 60,000 hour life expectancy of the bulb. When I called Philips, they said the warranty has expired, but if I were to return it to them, they would give me a factory reconditioned unit for mere $300. Considering I can buy a new one for about the same price, I declined their offer. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, at best----","review":"The picture is OK. The sound varies widely. If set so the spoken word is at the right level, the background music overpowers the voices. Commercials blast you out of the room. Using a set of computer speakers instead of the on board speakers helps reduce the variation. The remote control died after a couple of months. Spent $5 or so on a battery and that wasn't the problem. Bought a new universal remote and have not been able to access all of the menu controls so I can't experiment any further with the sound. Can't seem to access all menu functions from the buttons on the TV. It would be worth the extra hundred bucks to buy a better brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"I bought this little TV 1-1/2 years ago. I had no problems with it and was quite happy. . . Until I came home this evening and - voila! - no picture. Sound is fine but screen is black. It was around $400 which isn't a fortune, but I certainly expect more life than that. I'm sure that trying to get it repaired is not worth my time, money or aggravation. Believe me, I will never, ever buy a Philips product again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not awful, but not great, and not satisfying","review":"I bought this tv a year ago, and it works pretty well as a tv, but I cannot get it to work with my computer, which was one of the selling points. I have tried several cables and all possible menu setting combinations; it just won't work. As a tv, the picture and sound are quite good. The remote is not easy to use, and its battery life is especially short, plus it takes expensive little batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 2 years .....","review":"TV played great - had built in made in new kitchen for this one.

I will never buy a Philips product again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, horrible DVD","review":"The sound on this system is really fantastic for the price, but I've had the same experience as the other reviewer. The DVD skips constantly, and Phillips is absolutely no help in fixing the problem. Amazon has been great and has offered to give a 50% credit, but Phillips insists that I send (at my own expense) the machine to them and then wait 4+ weeks to have a 'possibly' refurbished unit. I'm quite disappointed with Phillips and its lack of customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy from Philips!!","review":"This system is quite sleek, easy to fit in a cluttered living room. Assembly takes about two minutes. The instructions are very clear. The sound is amazing, especially when you put on your favorite loud, bass-heavy film. Why then do I give it one star?It skips. Like nobody's business. At first, my wife and I thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched. But then we put in new disks. No difference. When exactly does it skip? Impossible to tell. Sometimes a little. Sometimes every frame! Sometimes it'll tell us that disks are bad. Then the next time we put them in they magically work -- until they skip.So I called Philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping, but they could not guarantee that they would fix it, and it would take up to a month before they'd ship it back.Save your money! Buy from someone else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great system for the price","review":"Just picked this up for $128 at Target over Christmas. This is our first sound system and great for someone who knows nothing about electronics. We haven't had any problems with skipping, humming or anything else. You can't beat the quality for the price and we are very satisfied. Highly recommended for anyone wanting decent sound without spending big bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"happy with the purchse for the price","review":"Nice sound, I will admitt for the price, I get big sound, with quality. Only thing is a humming, hissing sound when machine is idle. Ohtherwise, worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative and haunting...","review":"I picked up Carla's CD after hearing it at a local Barnes & Nobles store. This New Zealander is a great talent. The music could be described as downtempo haunted folk songs. The lyrics are subtle and meaningful and Carla's voice is superbly sensual. Think of Chris Isaak and the Cowboy Junkies blended together. The closing track, \\"Iodine Red\\" is worth the purchase price alone. I don't think I've heard anything so moving in a long time. It conjures up images of driving through the desert on a lonely stormy night. Totally evocative."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 yrs in the making = polished near-perfection!","review":"This debut album was three years in the making, and does it ever show in it's silky smooth recordings. Carla is a wonderful new artist whose vocal talents range the scale from soulful to edgy, without ever missing a beat. Songs like \\"Wanderlust\\", \\"Heaven Is A Word\\", and \\"Like Mercury\\" can be listened to over and over, while songs like \\"Make It Up\\", \\"Under\\" and \\"Iodine Red\\" SHOULD be listened to over and over in order to delve through its intricate vocal and melodic complexities. In short, buy this album and you will not be sorry. Carla is an artist to watch out for. My only complaint is that she did not include on here her cover of the Led Zeppelin song \\"Going To California\\" that I saw her perform live in Seattle. That was amazing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow, sensual, simply irresistable!","review":"This CD is amaaaaaazing to make love to; the beat and lyrics are absolutely fantastic!

The tubular steel is well made and I would expect it to hold up to a lot of use. The padding on the table and chair are also well made and seemed quite comfortable for playing. The dimensions of the table and chairs are fine for young children. The directions that come with the set warn about pinching your fingers when folding or unfolding so do be careful that an adult does the set up, it is not meant to be setup by children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad design.","review":"We bought this for after childbirth because I've found the plastic ones to be very uncomfortable. We brought it to the hospital to use, but found that it was very difficult to keep enough air in it between blowing it up and capping it off to make it cushioned enough. Also, ours came with a rip in the seam in the bottom of the \\"tub\\" part, so it didn't hold any water anyway.Another thing the plastic version has over this is the bag and tube that are used to refresh the water and keep the temperature warm to promote healing. If you want to refresh the water or make it warmer in this one, you have to get up, dump it all out and start over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The inflation valve doesn't stay securely shut, so mine has been in use without the air (it still will stay put on our avergae sized toilet though). It's less comfortable but will still do its job.

Mr. Kaletsky proved me wrong. He uses anecdotes and humor to give the reader clear descriptions of his topics.The book is more practical than academic. It is a tool that can be used rather than a title to leave on a shelf to impress an OSHA inspector.

Such is the case with 'Duck You Sucker' a film that would have benefited from some editing, any editing for that matter. I think the director included every bit of film shot and couldn't stand for any of it to hit the editing room floor. The inane flashbacks for one example just about drove me over the edge. Now as an adult, I watched this DVD with my son and after it was over his statement was \\"that's a couple of hours of my life I'll never get back,\\" I could not agree more. In the end if you saw this film in the theater as a kid and remember it fondly, keep your memory intact and do not watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Not a Spaghetti Western*Duck You Sucker Aka A fistful of Dynamite","review":"...Or Aka A bad movie,Once I saw the Mao Zedong \\"Revolution\\" Quote(beginning of the movie) it went downhill for me, Where Did Sergio Leone Go Wrong? what happen?

For example, in the scene where Rod Steiger and James Coburn met the first time. Rod spent a lot of time convincing James to join him in bank robberies. Rod talked a lot. His conversation and action are supposed to be humourous but they're not. This scene lasted about 12 minutes. It made me sleepy.

Coburn and Steiger constantly lose their accents, and Morricone's score is terrible, full of early 1970's hippie strings and birdlike songs.

I've wanted to see this for a few years now and am still not able to. I ain't happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark comedy about revolutionaries","review":"I would normally give this film five stars. However, this Spaghetti western substitutes a white, male actor to play the role of a Mexican bandit turned revolutionary.Admittedly, Rod Steiger is an excellent actor. But with so many talented Latino actors available to do the part of the Mexican bandit, one can only imagine how much better the film might have been. The story is engaging, and James Coburn's performance is memorable. The music by Enno Morricone adds to the film's appeal. SergioLeone's directing is clumsy in places, and juvenile in others. However, the film is a wonderful story about the bonding of two men from very different backgrounds,and they way one of them grows to a new potential and level of actualization. It is, therefore, a very entertaining film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duck You Sucka","review":"This movie has always been one of my favorites. The story content and presentation is a step away from the ordinary which is usually my taste in movies. Rod Steiger is that consummate actor that brings intensity to any part he takes on in movies, there has never been an actor like him, he is sorely missed. I think James Coburn brought his full talent to the screen as John, remarkable performance with great passion yet casual approach to the strife of human kind. While watching this movie, Once Upon A Time In The West is brought to mind, non similar story but a departure from the ordinary in story content and presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Torture of Dr. Villega","review":"Does this version of the movie include the shadowed torture of Dr. Villega??

Some people are very difficult to serve, arrogant and condescending, and if those people happen to be easily categorized, then that's the way it is. This book is funny, perceptive, and if something in his text dropped your jaw, then maybe the fault is on you. Another reviewer claimed Galloway was biggoted against Jews, but I don't know why, and I don't see it. I think he's just being equally honest when he talks about Jews, Salvadoreans, mob guys, and all the rest. The bottom line is, I loved this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Dining's Not Always So Fine (But This Book Is!)","review":"What a book. What a writer! John Galloway's work is witty, razor-sharp and wonderfully creative. He takes us behind the kitchen door into the world of fine dining, and what a trip it is! This book is often laugh-out-loud funny, but the laughs are sometimes bittersweet, tempered with Galloway's revelations about the food industry and its accompanying craziness, addictions and unconscionable waste.What makes the book even more poignant is the way in which Galloway weaves his own life story throughout his anecdotes about restaurant life. We clearly see how this man with so much seeming promise found himself in the chaotic world of fine dining, and we see his struggle to leave it and pursue his dream of flying.There are a number of behind-the-scenes expose books being written these days. Make this the one you read. Behind the anecdotes in this one is real heart. This is an amazing first novel. I anxiously await Galloway's next effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chef and Writer Give Dry, Up - Two Thumbs Up!","review":"Having had a past career in fine dining myself for over 10 years (I'm a certified chef), and being a writer myself, I whole heartily concur with the experiences as depicted in John Galloway's account of the pit and pratfalls of fine dining. A must read for any of those in the business or those who have the layman's dream \\"wouldn't it be nice to open a restaurant some day.\\" Don't even think of going into the business until you've read Galloway's \\"bible\\" on the subject! This book is also a deep and insightful philosophical look into human nature as a whole. An enjoyable read even if one is not affiliated with fine dining. Galloway should keep writing more, even about other subjects, his style is gripping and he knows how to write a real page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed out loud!","review":"I started reading this book last night and was unable to put it down. John Galloway is at once enlightening the dining community about how to behave at a restaurant and raising awareness of the 'plight' of the restuarant worker (at all levels).This book is a great read for anyone who has ever eaten or worked in a restaurant. I loved the sarcasm and appreciated the opportunity to assess my own dining behavior and laugh at all of the 'mistkes' I have made. I promise to mend my ways and to always remember that there is no such thing as a 'twist of lime'.Thanks for the laughs AND the education, John!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Find","review":"I was very glad to stumble across this book. Dry, Up with a Twist is a daringly original book. It is a well crafted story that works on several different levels. Not only is it a hilarious behind-the-scenes account of John's many years in the fine dining industry, but it is also a thought provoking critique of the restaurant business and the people invloved in it. Mr. Galloway holds nothing back in this book, he lets his former bosses, co-workers and customers have it, while maintaining his witty sense of humour throughout. Sometimes shocking, sometimes tragic, but always entertaining. I currently work in the service industry myself and I could instantly identify with John's tale. It's nice to know that there are sane people in this crazy business .

I love mysteries enough that I watched the whole thing. It reminded me of a play since I didn't think that most of the acting was very good as compared to Downton Abbey or Our Mutual Friend. I also figured out the ending about halfway through. The part that disturbed me the most was when the supposed murderess ridiculed the man of God and God himself. How rude. If she would be someone who believed in God and in morals, she wouldn't have been in the situation in the first place. I did enjoy the acting of the stepson and wonder what else he acted in. Didn't quite enjoy the part of the ending since people took the law into their own hands. Isn't that what got everyone into the predicament in the first place...everybody just doing whatever they felt like with no qualms about what's right and honorable? I decided that I enjoy refined Victorian mysteries, not amoral, vulgar characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This tripe was on Masterpiece Theatre???","review":"Not only was the plot full of holes, the acting was horrendous!

I had to position the phone just so in order for the plug to make contact and allow recharging. A week or two later it caused a short circuit in my car and blew out a 15 amp fuse that protects the car's radio, electrical port, rear view window adjuster, etc). I replaced the fuse; nothing happened when I plugged in my Garmin GPS's adapter, but when I substituted the Garmin adapter with the Just Wireless adapter and rotated the adapter's head downward, it blew out the fuse again.

I really wanted a watch that had a count down timer. I examined the information that Timex had on their web page, about this watch. They said that it had a \\"timer\\", so I purchased it from Amazon. The company that shipped it for you was very efficient, and I was really excited when it arrived. It is a really cute watch, and is feminine looking, which is rare in a digital watch. I was really disappointed to find that it did not have the count down timer. Other than that it was great. I can't vouch for how well it operates, because I haven't used it. Thank you for reading this, and if anyone at Amazon can contact Timex, and tell them that they have false advertising on their web site, I'm sure that they would listen to Amazon more than one disappointed customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to set watch","review":"This watch is attractive and I like the light up dial, however, the watch is impossible to set. I spent hours reading the instructions and figuring how to set the time--it isn't worth it.

He ate a little and walked away. Just enough to vomit it back up on my carpet. It came up just like it went down, in little balls. I don't know what the problem is, but he definitely won't eat it.

The smallish kibble perplexed him just a bit at first but I feel being slightly hard to manage is a good thing since it stops a cat from eating too fast.On to the caveat: At the time of writing this product page is titled \\"adult cat and kitten food\\" but the product photo clearly says adult cat only. I ordered before the change and got stock labeled cat/kitten, but if you have a kitten and order while they're mismatched please double check when you receive it. Foods indicated for cat/kitten have a different nutritional profile compared to adult cat only formulas.In any case I strongly recommend the food itself regardless of where you order it from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try a sample first","review":"Just like other reviewers, my cat also went on a hunger strike rather than eat this food. I DID gradually switch foods and yet when only the Wellness food was left, he would refuse to eat it. He lost over a lb over this whole ordeal. The only way I could get him to eat was to sprinkle some other cat food on top. (Someone randomly gave me some since he knew I had a cat.) What ended up happening for the past month was that the cat would pick around the Wellness pellets and eat everything else. I finally had enough and bought the food he's been eating for the past year (also grain-free, also expensive). He acted like it was Christmas and gobbled down the whole bowl, just like old times.My cat is NOT a finicky eater by the way. He is a stray that we found last year. Up until this purchase, he has eaten everything we set in front of him. Maybe your cat will love this food. Maybe not. Try a sample first because I'm pretty mad about wasting $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great nutrition, but my cat won't eat it.","review":"I really wanted my cat to like this food (especially considering how expensive it is), but she just doesn't want to eat it. I introduced the food to her by mixing it in with her old \\"junk food\\" dry kibble, as recommended. She simply eats around the Wellness kibble, and I find little bits of it slightly chewed up/spit out by her bowl. I've been testing to see what happens if I don't feed her again until she clears her little bowl of food, but she just mopes around howling (something she normally doesn't do) and starves herself instead of eating the Wellness kibble. What a waste. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"My cat went on a hunger strike rather than eat this food. I think it's the fishy smell, which is very disagreeable.

It is so much more than an art lesson. It weaves incredible history, literature, and the human experience into the world of art. I am so impressed with the people behind this series.

I give this my highest recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally someone tells this story!","review":"Art and artists create and reflect so much of the zeitgeist of their times.

I would periodically go in and search through all their documentaries trying to find it again. I had seen the art of archaeology presented in a light I never had before seen, and especially was impressed by sections covering the skulls found in the 'Walls of Jericho' and the temples at Gobekli Tepe. I tried Googling every combination of those words, and finally, about 3 years later ( must be good, right? to look for it that long?) I found it. Trust me, it is that good...it covers the psychology of art, the evolution of art from the Venus of Willendorf to modern, with scholastic attention to history and archaeology. It is truly a great set...two DVDs. Get it, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent BBC production","review":"Although I'm missing David's lovely voice in the commentary, this DVD, produced by the BBC folks that brought us many other topics, is again of outstanding quality. This fact alone made me confident that I would get my money back, and that I would get another topic to watch for the years to come.As usual, we were not disappointed! There is something for everybody in this documentary, it has a logical build-up, with great photography and excellent camera work. The topic is clear, and presented lively, with many facts. I learned a lot.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Art Made the World","review":"Loved the series, thought provoking and outrageous conclusions about art. Most interesting was how mankind took a three dimensional world and lost one dimension to paint on caves and rocks, abstraction in an early form.

But I would view with a skeptical eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating for art lovers!","review":"This is a really fascinating, very accessable series for any student of art and culture. Nigel Spivey is a very personable host, open-minded and a little humorous. The series included a number of surprising \\"new\\" connections and conclusions about ancient art and man's life today. I watched the first hour on a DVD borrowed from the local library, and immediately got online at Amazon to get my own copy. I have watched the entire set a number of times and still am picking up new information. I have used the section on \\"How Drawings Began\\" in the classroom with 5th graders, who were spellbound.

I expected a much better product from the BBC and related organizations. World history was greatly embellished by obvious speculation to the point that it almost became 'reality TV'.

Nevertheless the series is watchable and if you dont mind the embellishment, missing information, plethora of speculation etc it is not too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Minds Opine on the Evolution of Art","review":"Over ambitious project presents wild conjectures as truth, without proof. Slick exploitation of claims upon subject matter bolstered by sound and fury in place of substance. Intellectually vapid. NOT art history, and only half a step above those well researched revelations splayed on the pages of the National Inquireror. That the filmmakers believe they are performing the equivelant of translating the Rosetta Stone here-with-in is quite evident by the hubris of including their \\"Special Features\\" section, which consists of the filmmakers talking about setting up certain shots; what kind of a self-important mind could conceive that anyone would want to waste their time watching them relate that their camera crane showed up late one night. Who cares?! I am very disappointed that I wasted my time and money on this immature work of floppy-doodle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"\\"Yes, you heard him. He did say \`Seagulls'.\\" It's statements like these that make this documentary insipidly condescending. The narrator seems to think he can hide his blandness by jerking and nodding his head to every one of his banal syllables. These poor people also seem to think that they can improve a crappy documentary with fancy special effects. Many will no doubt fall for the trick.

Very appropriate for the music in question.Connor's straight clear direct singing, is an ideal vessel with which to convey both the melody of this very early music, and the lyrics...written in a very different manner to modern classical songs.I feel Connor Burrows would have been a favourite singing these lovely madrigals in the Elizabethan court, from whence they were originally performed. Consort songs were not really designed for the etheral voiced chorister. Connor Burrows and the equally professional Amsterdam Loeki Stradust Quartet, blend well together in harmony and take the listener back in time...to when music didn't need synthsizers or microphones to be enjoyed in all its purity. A fine recording indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for ethics studies reading lists.","review":"A recommended picks at the college level.

I actually played Frederick, in public, in 1960.They might not have been 100 per cent faithful to the score and libretto but they were close enough. What blew my mind was the amount and wild quality of the 'stuff'. The sting in the tail was when the Pirates happened upon and took apart a production of another G & S comic opera H. M. S. Pinafore. That was delightfully out of order.If Sir Arthur had seen this version he might have scoffed. Gilbert, I am sure, would have been doing cartwheels. I dropped a star because if they hed been faithful to the score it would not have changed the picture one bit. Really great entertainment and actually great acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Rendition of Pirates","review":"I adore Kevin Kline and have great respect for him as an actor. The same is true of the unparalleled talent of Angela Lansbury and the amazing voice of Linda Rondstadt. Sadly the staging, directing and occasional rewriting of the original libretto (one assumes to 'modernize it') are all catastrophes. The true wit and charm of the original is lost among the ill advised effort of the 'new' version to make fun of its older, time honored sibling.

As a child of two musical buffs, I was brought up on fare like Oklahoma, Singin' In the Rain, and West Side Story....but the most memorable (and most loved) was always Kline and Lansbury's Pirates of Penzance (first viewed when I was 4). Its fanciful story containing the age-old literary facination with pirates is an immediate draw to youngsters, as are the bright costumes, joyful songs, comedic characters, and (for those who have seen 1960's Disney productions) the familiar and much-loved face of Angela Lansbury. The story has only gotten better as I've grown and been able to understand better and better the subtle nuances of G&S humour.

Sadly however the most liberal interpretation of the score seems to have been taken with this production. It is thin, tinny, and when compared with CDs from proper stage performances falls far short. The orchestra appears to comprise 4 people who hop from one instrument to another, inserting \\"comic\\" sounds at various points. The traditional booming Pirate King is a mere shadow, lacking any presence. Some of the narrative passages are well done, and with tongue in cheek humour, but just when you start to feel a bit better about it they reach another song....and you just cringe at the awfulness.

It is totally daring and original in its style and its structure. The writing is stunning and challenging. The book is structured like the mathematics itself. It sticks close to fact but shows that truth does not just drop out like a theorem. The very idea is brilliant. The execution is poetic and powerful. I'm still surprised some people don't get it, but if you're up for a spirited and brilliant and original and inspired fugue, read this beautiful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incidents not Narrative","review":"By Chapter 5, this book was in the trash.

But few will expect a short novel this mushy, gushing, floral, and poorly edited. It comes off like a college creative writing project rather than an actual work of historical fiction, with the author/narrator standing in the way of the book's momentum at every turn.Great idea for a book - but many people, particularly those in science, may find the style queasy and borderline unreadable..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Brilliant","review":"The text is amazingly brilliant. Very well written and glued & will surely expand your vocabulary. Although a novel, it is still (mostly) based on solid and true facts. Only where necessary were the facts altered or modified for the sake of cohesion.Alternating between Godel & Turing, the reader can get a bit confused for a while but will soon get his grips on the text , specially that the last part is dominated by the details of Turing's war-time life until his self-prepared cold death.A great book highly suggested to everyone who has no or very little idea of these two brilliant mathematicians [& philosophers]. It can serve as a first book or introduction to their lives and work in a very interesting, entertaining & enlightening way."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor customer service on \\"lifetime\\" warranty","review":"Had this shower head for a few years and it just broke. For the money and the \\"lifetime warranty\\" it should have lasted. Grohe only honors the warranty IF you still have the original receipt. Mine was installed by my builder with a new home construction so obviously no receipt for every fixture from the builder. Grohe would not stand behind warranty, poor customer service! I put several thousands into my custom shower with Grohe fixtures and no support from Grohe. I certainly hope none of the other shower heads go bad. Wont be replacing with Grohe again.

After finally finding itself in Season Three, the series pretty much collapses in Season Four. Great casts (and sometimes directors) but consistently stale stories (how many times have we seen the sentient doll tale?) with few thrills.

I had to send them back. This was rather disappointing because I love Tales from the Crypt and would have loved to own the whole collection.I also recall someone mentioning on here that not all these DVDs have the French subtitles either.I think it is great that HBO and Warner have put subtitles on most of these seasons, but I would love to see them put the full set of captions on ALL the seasons, so I could add them to my collection.Hopefully Season 4 and 5 will be produced on Blu-Ray with English subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting worst and worst... but I can't help myself to go on","review":"Stories of the series are getting worst by each new season.

When it snows a LOT all you do is twist and extend the brush and it easy moves 8 or more inches of snow from your roof or hood and trunk in one move right across the entire car off the other side. Does a nice quick job on windows as well. However it does NOT allow you to get into tight spots like between and near the mirrors and such. It is a bit flimsy and the brush seems to on occasion come loose from the rod so you have to crank it back on tight. Overall I'm pretty happy with it however as I don't wish to scratch the paint on my new Camry hybrid. It seems gentle in that regard. I think the reason to get one is it is so easy to quickly removed huge amounts of snow as compared to a brush, which not only takes longer, doesn't reach as far and WILL scratch your paint."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"nothing fancy about this but it really works.

It does push the snow off the car and doesn't appear to scratch the paint. It does telescope so that I can reach the top of my SUV, and doesn't take long to clean the truck with it. The only issues I have with it is that it's made of some kind of styrofoam and nicks easily (my automatic wipers got it and took a chunk out of it) and where it screws together, if you don't twist it with hurculean strength, it comes loose as you are using it, so the head's either spinning, or the telescoping feature gets really short, really fast.

I've been using it for years; it made cleaning off the tonneau cover of my 2002 Ranger an absolute piece of cake. On a really bad day, it might take me 45 seconds to clear it. I've cleared 8+ inches off my truck quickly by pushing and pulling the snow off with this 'brum.'Since selling the Ranger, I held onto this awesome accessory and now use it on my Blazer.I loved it so much that I bought a similar product for my wife's car. Hers has a threaded collar which allows the handle to telescope - but that takes two hands to operate.

I bought this towards the end of last year's brutal New England winter. It scratched my car - not terribly, but definitely. I think it is due to the rather hard edge around the cushioned area. And the handle repeatedly unlocked. I am throwing this away and looking for something else for this year. I agree with another reviwer who said it is a good idea but very poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blizzard Dec 2010","review":"I'm really disappointed with this product. Sure, I was able to pull snow towards me. But the reason I bought this was because I couldn't reach the top of my roof to clear the snow. It's a law in NJ now that roofs need to be clear of snow or you can be ticketed. The telescopic pole kept collapsing. No matter how I twisted the darn thing, it didn't work. So in blizzard conditions if I wanted to pull the snow towards me (and into the 50 mph wind so that it hit me square in the face) it worked just fine.I read a review that you can use a wooden handle instead, but what's the point? That's not the product I bought. I'll be sending it back tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I help an elderly widow with snow. She has a Sno Brum, and I just had to have one!

Talking to a Stranger, Aligator Engine, Scream Who, and Watcher will please fans of the band's later efforts, echoing the sounds of bands like Blue Peter, XTC and the Boomtown Rats.

Antonio Tibaldi directs this story about a dysfunctional family and its secrets, particularly Jimmy\`s past, AKA \\"Little Boy Blue\\" (played by Ryan Phillippe). Despite the mysterious tone of the film, which offers some surprises along the way, this is an average effort overall, since the pacing is too slow at parts and the ending isn\`t too satisfying. The acting is convincing, though (John Savage, Natassja Kinski), so this offbeat coming-of-age tale still deserves a watch.Not bad but not good enough either."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch The Reflecting Skin instead","review":"What, have Antonio Tibaldi and Michael Boston just rented Philip Ridley's \\"The Reflecting Skin\\"?

When watching this movie I was particularly impressed by Phillipe as I feel this is his break-through role.

I am reminded of Fargo and other noir American films... but the sense of redemption and hope is a saving grace - for me to sleep. Too bad this film didn't get the kind of the support that American Beauty got. The themes of incest and violence probably scared some studio execs.

The star of the movie is the same hero from 'Dragon Claws' and the dreadful '36 Crazy Fists'. Sadly the bad guy in the movie looks super weak and just doesn't look like a bad guy at all. He is small and doesn't look like he could possibly be a mean guy but he does fight decently. And the final fight is absolute crap. Ku Feng actually has the best 2 fights of the movie and that shouldn't have happened. HORRIBLE movie.Version from Tai Seng has very bad picture quality.

Also, when transferring from tape to disc, you cannot edit by pausing. The remote control is like most, it has almost too many buttons too close to each other.

It's still going strong without any issues whatsoever.

The book covers a broad range of topics relevant to self-sufficient living. I've read quite a few books on \\"getting back to the land\\" and this book is the best introduction you can ask for - with an abundance of useful information.Seymour takes on the topic like a cranky grandfather. He tells it like it is with little or no sugar coating. In addition, he knows what he's talking about - since he is one of the \\"grandfathers\\" of the sustainability movement.If you are interested in sustainability, micro-farming, rural living - or just curious about \\"getting back to the land\\" - I highly recommend this book. While there are many books which are more in-depth on specific topics, this book is the best I've seen at giving the reader a well rounded introduction to the self-sufficient life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thorough!!

The book is written totally from the context of living in England.

I also raise catttle and horses. (I am also a licensed Vet in Texas) This author does not know what he is talking about on alot of animal husbandry issues and I see alot of ridiculous nonsense in his teachings of growing crops vegetables etc..To make a long story short, if you live in the U.S. don't buy this book, it is really awful.

It would be very good for someone who is already pretty self sufficient, or is on their way to becoming more self sufficient.

Mostly it's face time with hunters, and lots of non action as they listen for sounds of their hunting dogs, or boars in the brush.On the plus side, that French countryside is gorgeous, the sportsmen are having a good time, and apparently doing a real service. If I understood it right, those wild pigs are causing so much damage that farming has been largely abandoned in some areas.

If you run into something, the car seat flips upward, pivoting on the strap.I took this to Babies R Us and tried it with all the infant seats, but could not find one that actually snapped onto the cross bar of this stroller frame (tried Evenflo, Combi, Graco SafeSeat).

I am well placed therefore to realise the tremenduous effort and courage it requires to take a standpoint that is in direct opposition to what is commonly proposed. In particular, the chapter on the immense overuse of revascularisation procedures and cholesterol treatment is very much accurate and to the point.Obviously, there are statements that are debatable, but that is the purpose of a book like this.The book is very well written, very understandable for the layman and the references are documented.Please take time to read this book, it is worth it and it will make you change your views on many aspects of the \\"medical terrorism\\" that is so quick to appear in prevention, but that can be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Copshot","review":"Copshot is one of the first true investigative counts that looks into the saga of the mid-80s crack era Queens drug lords like Fat Cat, Pappy Mason, and Supreme, Prince from the Supreme Team and others that have been made infamous in rhymes by 50 Cent, Nas and Ja Rule. If you want the real deal on what was going on back in the day in Queens check this book out. It is a street genre and black gangster classic and gives a lot of insight into the crack era and how a police officer was killed by the machinations of the Queens drug lords and how that act has impacted national policy to this day.

It is for beginners, and it delivers admirably. Graham takes the reader step by step and in a very systematic way through the basic tenets of graphic design. Each chapter deals with a specific aspect of design and how the reader can use it to communicate more effectively. Graham gives plenty of examples of what to do as well as what not to do and the text is well illustrated, though it could have used more examples in color. That is a small criticism though and one that does not really detract from the book in any way.

I loved the opening with all the beautiful mediaeval/Renaissance art of cherubic babies and voluptuous nudes.Beautiful Claire Danes is superb as a mixed up teen, Hala, which gets her pregnant, thereby presenting a problem for her devoutly Catholic family.Sexy Lena Olin plays her strong willed and fiery mother, and Gabriel Byrne her thoughtful baker father.Great acting and probably a good portrayal of the Polish area of Detroit, but where is this movie going?It drags, there is no real story and perhaps it is simply supposed to be a Polish-American version of the Irish classic \\"The Snapper\\" (1994).And I didn't like the guy, Schuster the local cop, who got Hala knocked up either.

Also, it is from the Phillipines, subtitles are okay with me, but I wasn't aware of them before, if you hate subtitles skip this for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, muddled & ineffective","review":"Well, that about says it all.

After putting it together and pumping up the ball, I go to use it and the base snaps apart while I am on the ball doing some of the moves. I thought bummer, either I am just way to heavy that I split it or I did not put it together properly. I know it wasn't the latter b/c it only snaps together, so maybe I was just to darn big. Another thing I did not like is the fact that the ball is really small. You look at the lady using it on the site and think that it is a decent size ball...maybe for someone that is 5'7 and not 5'10. So, all in all it was not made for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Fang Complete Series","review":"Just purchased this DVD.

But fortunately because I behaved well, my parents got it for me. I started playing it, and instantly fell in love with it. It has an incredible soundtrack and a great feel to it. Ninja Gaiden was good too minus the horrible dreaded stage 6 \\"challenge of three bosses\\". This game is one I keep coming back to because it commands respect. They don't make em' like this anymore. I love how the story took a more apoctolyptic dramatic feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"toughy but goodie","review":"I consider myself a moderate to semi pro when it comes to video games. This game at times b/c of the level of difficulty, can cause a heap of frustration. You have enemies coming at you from every angle. If you try and run past them, they'll continue to follow you. The challenges just keep on rolling.I'm writing this review after recently passing this game. I actually downloaded it onto my Wii station b/c I never owned this game as a child. I had part one and love it. But in terms of difficulty, this game is harder, at least for me.If you can stay persistent, you can pass this game. But there is a fine line between enjoying a tough game and feeling like it's a chore just to pass. I felt like the latter on stage 7-2. I know i'm not an expert but at the same time, I can't imagine some 7 year old having an easy time with this.I will probably tackle part 3 and write a review in the near future but for the time being, after Gaiden, it was time for a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Perfect.....","review":"A SICK old school game that comes about as close to perfection as you can get on the original NES.Don't leave without playing Ninja Gaiden: Dark Sword of Chaos."},{"rating":"2","title":"rare masters released at last","review":"perfectly produced compilation of her long lost originalhits including music, and the never before released on cd choon gum novelty hit that followed.

Probably the most important concept addressed is the need for most therapists to switch to a business mindset. I'm still working on this myself. I appreciate that Lynn freqently gives different options on addressing different issues. Her awareness that one size does not fit all is well modeled in these examples. There are a number of exercises to help you craft your marketing message and evolve your business mindset. However, herTwelve Months to Your Ideal Private Practice: A Workbook (which she uses for her teleclasses) offers more exercises and is more practical. Her ebook Private Practice SOS offers more updated suggestions and resources. (I recommend both of those books.)

One, was the ability to get me unstuck and out of my fear-based paralysis about the future of my practice and the future of the business of psychotherapy. She has done this through her unbridled enthusiasm and inspirational message that apparently comes directly from her own business experience. If someone has a very successful practice than I want to know their experience, hope, and strength. Her positive mind-set has helped shake me out of a \\"victim\\" and \\"scarsity\\" mindset that was polluting my \\"off\\" hours,i.e. the hours when I didn't have clients in my practice.Secondly, she offers a ton of practical advice for a clinician like me. How to start thinking like a business person in addition to being a skilled clinician?

The box was in fair condition, but the instructions were included so that did help a lot. It takes a little while when loading on the playstation, and takes a lot of memory space on the memory card.

But when I bought RPG Maker 2, I was extremely disappointed. Yes, the game is now in 3D, there are now actual in-battle animations, and the music and sound effects have drastically improved, but none of this matters. Why? Because the interface is so clunky and user-UNfriendly that it's impossible for a layman like me to even start creating something. Tasks that you could accomplish in one screen in RPG Maker 1 now requires two, three, even four separate steps to accomplish, requiring that you save your work, leave to the main menu, then open another screen each time. The instruction manual is useless because it's practically in another language, and even buying the strategy guide didn't help.

I have a few ideas for rpg's and RPG maker 2 was going to help me bring those ideas to life....or so I thought. I found many flaws in the game right off the bat.1. Characters: You are forced to use just the characters that came with the game. You CAN NOT create your own character from scratch.2. Enemies: Just like characters, enemies can not be created from scratch.3. Map Creator: Extremely complex and very annoying to try to figure out.4. Battle: Today's RPG's must use side battle system. So both enemies and hero party can be seen.If you don't mind the above problems and you love to make rpg's of any kind then by all means this is for you.

I think it's great that it can play animal sounds or keyboard sounds, but remarkably, one of my biggest complaints is that even on the loud setting it's too quiet! The keyboard sounds are really muted and dull, and I can see why it doesn't hold her interest for more than a few seconds. She's an active kid, and this just isn't for her.

Little Fonchito, in love with his stepmother, is like the infant Cupid who does not realize what calamities his aphrodisiac arrows can engender. Or does he? The paintings that accompany the text are a jarring mix, from Venus at her bath, to a repulsive creature who despite a tousle of misplaced limbs and organs still manages to find a partner and get off.

Title track2. Super Stupid (Live BBC Radio 1 Session)3. Like a Stone (Live BBC Radio 1 Session)4. Gasoline (Live BBC Radio 1 Session)Look familiar? If you have the \\"Like a Stone\\" EP, it should, because all three bonus tracks on this are on there too. While the cover of Funkadelic's \\"Super Stupid\\" is really cool, and makes the CD a decent purchase, the fact remains that you can get \\"Like a Stone\\" (which has a live Letterman version of \\"Set it Off\\" as well) for the exact same price. They've been doing enough live shows, can't we get a new live track for new singles?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Struggle Continues...","review":"I recommend this book to all Latin men and women and to those interested in liberation theology. Although written over 10 yrs ago, the problems Isasi-Diaz spells out still hold true today. As an educated Latina, she helped me see how sometimes my own culture keeps me from reaching my God-given potential.

This DVD is missing 7 songs from the VHS version. 7 songs!!The company that produces this must only know how to put about an hours worth of video on a DVD. Could someone please let them know that, if done right, the whole concert could have been placed on one DVD? <sigh>Here's what you get on the DVD: Time Machine, Children of the Grave, I Witness, Mob Rules, Into The Void, Anno Mundi, Symptom of the Universe, Headless Cross, Paranoid. You also get the drum and guitar solos and the video for Feels Good To Me.What's missing: Black Sabbath, Neon Knights, Psychophobia, Wizard, Cross of Thorns, Iron Man, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross Purposes LIVE! NOT! Just another eye-sore here!","review":"The only reason this version did not get a 1 star rating was it does include the entire concert originally released on VHS back in 1995! The rest is one big downer for all Sabbath legacy fans! This footage is definitely copied from a VHS source with horrific sound and muddied picture quality! It's just like a few other edited releases out there with select tracks only? What's up with these teaser copies? What a huge waste of effort and time! Maybe someday a logical remastered or Blu-ray version of this Sabbath/Tony Martin era concert will finally surface on earth? I guess stay tuned for a while longer?? For now, it's Cross Purposes LIVE! NOT! Just another eye-sore here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomplete... but still good","review":"The back cover of the DVD proclaims that the Tony Martin era of Black Sabbath is often overlooked but this release seeks to at least remedy that in part. Tony Martin's voice is in top form and the band plays great. Tony Iommi as always delivers the doom-ladden riffage for which he is known (hell, the guy practically invented heavy metal single-handed!) while bassist Geezer Butler and drumer Bobby Rondinelly rock on non-stop. Of course the bad news is that the setlist presented here is incredibly short! Only nine songs plus the video for Feels Good To me. I think more songs could have easily been included. Still, it's really great to hear live versions of non-Ozzy Osbourne era songs like Anno Mundi and I Witness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful to see this re-released on DVD. Thank you!!!","review":"My words cannot express how happy I was to see this finally re-released on DVD. My VHS copy from way back in 1995 was destroyed by my VCR and never replaced. This is the only professionally filmed Black Sabbath concert to feature not only Tony Iommi and Tony Martin together on stage, but also with the brief reunion (for 1 album and 1 tour) with bassist Geezer Butler. Geezer must have had some time off in between Ozzy gigs, but it's always wonderful to see him live. Great picture quality, great sound, great performances from everyone (including new drummer Rondinelli), and great, great song selection. Worth every penny for Sabbath fans of Tony Martin era, which to me was worthy of filming a concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product Middle Atlantic PD-915R","review":"We have bought this product for years without any problems.

It really does a great job of telling the story of what life is like for many people in Russia and the former Soviet Union, and will open your eyes to the unfortunate reality of human trafficking and sexual slavery. I personally think that the last part of the film should have been done differently, and that really brought the film down a few notches in my book. But because of the overall power of the film I still feel it's worthy of 5 stars. Because of what it's about... it's not a film that you will really \\"enjoy\\", but it's still a great movie that's definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking. Why is there no Region 1 version?","review":"Forget \\"Hostel.\\" Tales like Lilya's are the true horror stories of Eastern Europe after the fall of the former Soviet Union. As children unloved and betrayed, and surviving in conditions that would drive adults to desperation, Lilya and Volodya will break your heart and stay in your memory for a long time. The two young actors who play Lilya and Volodya are outstanding. Those of you who have seen The Bourne Supremacy may remember the actress who plays Lilya here; she had a small role in that film as a young Russian woman.I have no idea why this film is unavailable in Region 1 format. It's a classic. It deserves to be a part of the standard American cineast's collection.As another poster said, get it on Netflix. You shouldn't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking but Excellent","review":"This is a shocking but absolutely wonderful film which tells the story of Lilja, a sixteen year old who is abandoned by her mother in poverty stricken Russia who is forced to turn to prostitution in order to survive. She then meets a handsome and charming man who promises her a new life in Sweden but it doesn't turn out how she imagines....I would give the film a five but the DVD is surprisingly disappointing with almost no extras. If you don't want subtitles in any language other than English (you can only have the Scandinavian languages anyway) then buy the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cardboard Cherub","review":"This is the third film by Lukas Moodysson (\\"Show me love\\", \\"Together\\"), and it's definitely not of the same caliber as the first two. Some of the plot details are not quite convincing, even in the light of harsh post-Soviet realities. But this is a minor flaw when compared to terrible acting by the main supporting actor (Artyom Bogucharsky). Every single line this \\"cardboard\\" cherub recites sounds artificial, as if memorized by rote, and badly at that. This renders all of the scenes in which he is involved unconvincing. The film is carried by the main heroine (Oksana Akinshina), who is, no doubt, a very talented actress. Overall, the film disappoints - I expected nothing short of great from Lukas Moodysson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sidi Bullett Mega","review":"great shoe for those with Fred Flintstone type feet.

She knew her brother as a baby and not again until the last three years of his life before he died at 33. So I should have known that a book about his death--because she never even knew him--is only, really, a book about HER and HER life and HER problems and HER kids and HER fears and regrets and struggle for independence and HER crummy childhood. Yeah, she had a terrible background. But this story and the way it is told does not leave the reader at all sympathetic. The setting of Antigua was the only enlightening part at all.

Only time will tell. The most remarkable thing about it, I think, is the way that Kincaid refuses to valorize any of the characters she describes. The incredible ire towards her mother is the only emotion that feels puzzling, given the lack of context for it -- I kept waiting for a revelation there that never came. With this exception, however, Kincaid seems committed to presenting a balanced portrayal: she does not heroize the dead, nor does she portray herself as particularly wise or noble in the face of death. It is this commitment to a human, complex portrayal that makes the description unique.I just want to add that I am only posting this to counteract what appears to be a long list of high school book reports that make up most of the \\"reviewing\\" on this page. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was looking forward to this book, but was disappointed.","review":"After reading this book I couldn't come up with a good reason for praising it.

What an example of human kindness and compassion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"take it to therapy","review":"OK I hate my mother as much as the next woman, but thankfully I didn't try to turn my whining into art by the use of the rather dubious device of repetition.

Or worse. When I started the first series, I was disturbed by the first courtroom scene as it seemed so chaotic. But I kept with it and it turned out to be one great series. The chaos was how it was then, with the wealthy minor royals there for entertainment, and the poor and mostly innocent defendants being the entertainers. Although actually, at the time there was no true defense offered them. They were murdered. Sent to death by purchased judges, and jurors who were probably purchased as well. The jurors took seconds to come to a decision and Garrow was so frustrated by the whole process he undertook to change it.His private life is also examined in this series, but the romance certainly adds to this a 'true story' about a real honest to gosh barrister."},{"rating":"2","title":"convenient","review":"It's always nice to have the convenience of a car charger.

The material is varied also, which is great, Frank Gambale uses both his electric and acoustic guitar with equalling effect, a true master player. Plus, there are Steve Smith and Stu Hamm individual solo showcase pieces which are moving and fun! Highly recommended and one of this years best in the fusion genre. Highlights include, All In Your Head, The Great Roberto, Geo 100, Saving Grace & The Challenger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good country rock","review":"I saw another review of this album that said Randy Rogers sounded like a cross between Chris Knight and Waylon Jennings. As a fan of both of those guys I can tell you, no way. Randy Rogers voice sounds like Steve Earle and his music sounds like Pat Green with a pinch of Cross Canadian Ragweed.

If you like Earle or Green you will like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shades of Jennings, Strait and other things Texas","review":"This album is by far the best so far from RRB. The songs are well written, performed and recorded.

Ten Miles Deep is also a standout for me, a song that Waylon would have been proud to record. If you get a chance to see RRB live, take it.

Get this one now, while there's still room on the bandwagon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Good","review":"They will probably never rock like this again with the major label and Radney Foster influence.

The heads of the punches were not totally round some were totally out of shape. Some punches have really pronounced nicks that will transfer to the metal, the punch block is in the small size but just OK. Need to keep them oiled all the time or they start rusting fast but that is normal. The wood block holds the punches but some holes are too small or big so the punches have the tendancy to fall, I needed to put paper to keep them in place.

The docking station connects to the computer via a semi-rigid cord which must u to connect. Certain HP laptops such as mine also need an extra adapter to connect. This creates a constant tug on the connection which means any presure on the cord causes it to disconnect.After less than a year with frequent disconnects the adapter lost many of its fine metal connection pieces into the laptops connection bay. Now, you must replace the adapter as well as figure out how to pull all the fine metal peices out of your laptop that are stuck there. There also is no number on the adapter to figure out what you need to replace.

I was surprised to find out that most of the women in this book, while they call themselves lesbians, are still married to men. This book may be good for married women who discover they are attracted to women, but for anyone looking for an insightful read on sexual fluidity and sexuality/gender studies, this book is of pretty poor quality. The author insists on using outdated terms like \\"sexual preference\\" and \\"same-gender relationships\\", and cites far too much Oedipal/Freudian theory. When she does cite research, it doesn't fit with the flow of the book and is random. Overall, I find it utterly perplexing that women can somehow maintain a lesbian identity while being married to men.

There seemed to be no understanding whatsoever of the damage caused to relationships generally by people withholding secrets from one another (and that damage principally affects the person withholding the secret - in this case the lesbian woman - and not the person(s) being withheld from).

It is especially good for parties because it's festive, cheesy mambo music, but occasionally it catches someone's ear, and they recognize it and wonder what the tune is, not realizing it's a mambo version of a familiar tune like over the rainbow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another pointless horror film","review":"Fist off i saw this movie for free on demand and i still feel someone,somewhere should give me my money back.this movie is a complete waste of time for any true horror fan like myself.the plot has been done plenty of times before and better like in the hills have eyes.a car full of young people breaks down,they go for help,a deformed man chases and kills them off one by one,repeat.the deformed man isnt all that great looking,the kills arent very bloody or gory,the killers family is in on the plot(theyre all crazy)and just when you think its over and the movie is about to end,guess what the killers still alive(with no explination as to why)and the only survivor has to go through all that all over again.but thank goodness that the veiwers dont have to.by all means stay away from this one,youll be all the better for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, sorry, I must have been snoring.","review":"The Butcher (Edward Gorsuch, 2006)And here we have, yes, another young-and-beautifuls-go-to-an-old-scary-house-and-get-massacred movie. Bad acting. Increasingly-common variation on old horror movie rule (instead of straight kids having sex, there's a pair of lesbians, who must, of course, suffer gruesome ends-- this isn't a spoiler, as the first occurs in the extended opening scene. So the lesbian must die even before they encounter the guy who does the massacring. Silly, anyone?). Awful, awful script. Incredibly predictable plot twist. Yeah, there's really nothing good to say about this movie. Some wag on the IMDB boards called it (forgive my paraphrasing) a bad remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre combined with a bad remake of The People Under the Stairs, and he's right. *"},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS: In all honesty, this is a pretty sorry movie. Sadly, I've seen worse.","review":"\\"The Butcher\\" is a low-budget slasher flick along the same lines as \\"Wrong Turn\\" although \\"Wrong Turn\\" is clearly superior than this trash, albeit, that does not say much. In a sense, \\"The Butcher\\" tries to be a mixture of \\"Wrong Turn\\" and the the remake of TCM. The kills aren't that great and are indicative of a low budget horror flick, there is zero horror movie atmosphere, and the acting is below average for this type of flick. Also, much of the action, these characters (including the killers) and the storyline are all just plain stupid!!! Very immature horror movie here...defintely one for the teenagers although I would not let me teenager watch this trash if I had one. All of these flaws make for a movie that simply is not worth a cuss, and that's my main complaint (along with the overly-retarded ending of course-they actually outdid themselves with that)."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUTCHERED HORROR","review":"Even fans of this gore-infested movie must be getting tired of the ripoffs of other films of this ilk, like TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACE, HILLS HAVE EYES, etc.Anyway, ONCE AGAIN, we have this collection of college-age students who are going off on some kind of trip only to be detoured and finding themselves at the mercy of a whacko hillbilly with demented wife and daughter.

I know that it was a B-horror flick, but come on. There were a couple of good actors but most were not that good even for a B flick. Yes, this movie was a rip off from other movies, but there was one movie that the rest of the critics missed and that was Jeepers Creepers. The only reason that I gave it 2 stars was because of a couple of the actors and there were a couple of scares in it that were pretty good.

Faithful effort is given to understanding situations that arise and learning that there are no accidents. When met with the unexpected river voyager - be it human or animal - Claire's account is told with humor and honesty. You feel her rapture with each realization and her uncertainty with each challenge. I hope she takes the advice of her newfound \`angel' and visits Nepal.

If I am not mistaken they treat the cord with something to keep down the pathogen count, but that is even worse.BTW, I contacted Zyliss about this design and they told me the cord is treated with something to keep down the pathogen count and they they were working on a new design.

Because of this my salad dressing is sometimes watered down (which I really dislike). I'm disappointed in this item and I'm considering ordering another salad spinner from another manufacturer.

This one is easy enough to use -- just pull the string for an appropriate amount of time -- not exactly rocket science. Result: alas, wet, wet, wet. The only way to use the greens is to hand dry them. Moreover, said greens would rot if I tried to store them in the refrigerator overnight.

Monica has a truly powerful voice and presents it nicely in \\"Inside\\", written by the 'ballad queen' Diane Warren. Other good songs are \\"The First Night\\" that deals with never giving too much on the first date, \\"Gone Be Fine\\", the hip/hop track featuring rap group Outkast, and the remake of \\"Right Here Waiting\\" featuring R&B sensation 112. The album also has the hit song from the Space Jam Soundtrack \\"For You I Will\\", also written by Diane Warren.

A prime example of making a gooddecision is The First Night, which lets young ladies and men know that its ok to say no the first night. I think my favorite track on this album is Street Symphony because it was a touchy subject but it needed to be toughed on and Monica was'nt afraid to do so, this song was about a girl who was trying to get her boyfriend a drug dealer out of the streets, but he was so preoccupied with being in the streets she lets him know if it does'nt stop then they did'nt need to be together.

I dont know, but her last CD, i really thought she was better than her \\"Competition\\", but this album, her voice isnt impressive. She hasnt done that well live either, she wasnt that impressive on the LENO show, and I have heard from people that she hasnt performed well on her tour. The two live performances i have seen of her are the MTV Music Awards with Brandy, where you could tell Monica was extremely nervous, and on the Leno show with some weird Street Symphony rendition. THe only good song on this CD is street symphony, she stole Angel Of Mine, I consider the Boy is Mine to be BRandy's song because brandy wrote it, and Right here waiting is also a cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not her best,","review":"Her songs almost make Britney Spear more appealing, but, eh, as her other counterpart says, Almost doesnt count. All I have to say is, that we are critizing voices and stuff, but this is a review of the album, and an album consists of songs. As Quincy Jones best said, three things make a dynamic song: The SOng, the song, the song! Brandy, Aaliyah, Mya, Monica all have good voices, but all have different levels of songs. Im sorry to say that this album doesnt have quality songs although her voice is sterling. However, Im not a professional choir director or the critique for Entertainment Today, So i dont really care about the voices they use. I care about the songs, and to me, this album doesnt have quality songs on it. Maybe thats why your counterparts seem to be doing better Monica! And as your sometimes ignorant fans say, DONT TAKE IT PERSONAL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are two good songs, the rest are just fillers and rema","review":"I live in Europe, and I thought it was wrong of Monica to remake ANgel of Mine by Eternal one year after they scored the same hit. People in Europe were already tired of that song, so nobody really wanted to hear it again. A lot of the other stuff is remade too, like the song with 112 and Misty Blue. The two good songs are The Boy is Mine and First Night which are readily available on the internet. I love For you I will too, but i had the Space Jam soundtrack from 96, and that song was a filler too. I like her voice, but sometimes it seems like she is trying to be the best vocalist in the world with \\"Star Search/Talent Show\\"-esque quality vocal runs, except sometimes they dont fit in with the song. As for her image, you can see the combination of anorexia and too uch makeup dont work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Miss Thang","review":"This album is a big step backwards for Monica. What a shame, since her first album was so good. Teeny boppers who don't know the old Monica might like this album, but older fans who liked her early stuff will surely be disappointed. There's absolutely no question that her first album was far superior in every way than this one. Why didn't she keep it real? Why, why, why? And whatever happened to this girl? It's been 4 years since this album, and I haven't heard anything new about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums in my collection","review":"Monica has out done herself with this album.

She remade 3 songs and then put \\"For you I Will\\" which is old,and then stole the beat for \\"Ring da Bell\\" from Missy's \\"Friendly Skies\\" which features Ginuwine. Overall i'm not impressed w/the CD. I liked her first ablum much better. She has a great voice, but her songs are terrible, people say that she sings better than Brandy.

Monica should never be compared to the talented Brandy.

Unlike her so-called pal Brandy, Monica has made it quite evident that she sings with wisdom, and her alto sturred up voice has overwhelming depth to it . Please make this girl not waste her time entertaining us through her music. Brandy might get the international acclam but Monica beats her every time with her music. All I haft to say is MONICA CAN SING, AND BRANDY NEEDS TO OOPEEN HER MOUTH!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monica's cd, \\"The Boy is Mine\\" is not her best work!!","review":"Monica's cd is not her style or what we were used to in the past. It doesn't seem to have a common theme througout the cd. Unfortunately, she failed to add her own personal touch to her music. For example, Brandy's cd reflects her personality and what she feels all the way from beginning to end. Monica's cd is music and lyrics that reflect someone elses personality and feeling. The music isn't very up beat and it seems kind of sad. I was very disappointed in her vocally and musically. If this is all we have to look forward to from Monica, she should have left things alone with her first cd \\"Miss Thang\\" - Alisha"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been a lot better","review":"I'm sorry, but for a person her age with the voice that she has deserves to sing some better material!

But i was also in the 6th grade. Listening to it now it sounds so corny. The vocal are very good and she is very talented. But that talent doesn't shine through because the songwriters give her garbage material. The production is weak too. If she got some bangin songs she would have done fine. Also 3 of the songs are copied. How original. I havent heard after the storm but I hope its better."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIRL PLEASE!!!! A BLUE FEATHER BOA??","review":"Monica's first cd \\"Ms. Thang\\" rocked the house, I still listen to it in my car,....\\"here we are face to face, with the memories that cant be erased, although we need each other......\\" ok anyways, the point is that I can feel her honesty in her voice, like(even at the ripe old age of 14)she was singing about life experiences. This new cd however reeks of misdirected voice lessons resulting in a nasal stuffy sound that went out with Dinah Washington, and Billie Holiday(both of whom she is not)!!! Don't buy this if you want a sound resembling \\"I wanna get down but not the first night\\". If you must touch the fire after seeing mama get burnt just buy \\"Angel of mine\\" as the single, and Brandys cd(much better on the whole) for \\"The boy is mine\\",(a must have)."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE GARBAGE, BY UNFORTUNATELY A GREAT SINGER!","review":"THIS CD IS BOOTY!

Monica CAN BE compared to Brandy because she definetly has the voice, along with the beauty and the skills to be able to compete with her, it just that her writers are AWFUL and that reflects on Monica. She has the capability to blow Brandy out of the water if she had talented writers. The lyrics do not have the credibility that it should. Monica is very talented and it is ashamed that no one wants to bring it out. I can give Monica my loyalty she deseves as a fan, but she has got to produce something worth listening to or else the talent that was given to her by god Will go to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"overproduced and overrated","review":"This hit record is as good an example as any of everything that is wrong with contemporary r&b; while there is no question that Monica has singing talent, it's all for naught here. The two big problems here are (1.) the production, which like so much else these days, is over done to the point of being much less appetizing than it might be, and (2.) the songs, which are hokey, cliched, and the product of a write-a-hit-song-by-the-numbers approach. It's a pity, because had this young talent been born a generation earlier, and been recording songs by great talents like Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and been accompanied by more soulful musicians, who knows what she might have been capable of. Greatness, perhaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monica Sophmoe Album-Excellent 2 time Around","review":"What can I say Monica. Does it again. This album reveals a Teen going into Womanhood.

Monica is very Wonderful in this song.Misty Blue- What can I say her voice commands and shines way beyond her years.Monica does it again.

The very beginning when the bass kicks in over the orchestra is the best part!! The message in \\"First Night\\" is a good one for young women. As for \\"Misty Blue\\", I didn't know that it was a remake at first. I just listened to it and said, \\"This feels like I should be sitting in a smoky nightclub somewhere listening to this girl blow!\\" Monica is awesome.

I've heard every version and everyone do that song, including the one where Coco from SWV, Fantasia, Faith and Lil Mo do it,,and they do to much damn screaming for me. Anyways this is the best version EVER, including where Karen does it alone on one of her CD's. There is only 1 son on this CD that I wasn't crazy about, but I'm gonna recommend my Praise Team leader get this CD and let us sing some of the slower songs...The songs do not feel dated or old, so don't be concerned that this isn't a new release item.

It's really a shame that this movie is so bad because Bruce Dickinson has such a great knowledge of Crowley and his works that this movie could have been something very special.

I have a 5.1 theater in the bedroom and a 7.1 theater in the family room, and I first purchased an SA-W2500 for the bedroom. I liked it enough to purchase a second one two years later for the family room. The sound is good for our 16' x 16' rooms, and the small size made it able to install inside a entertainment cabinet. The only downside, to me, is the clicking of the power-save feature turning off or on, and the time it takes for the power-save to turn off when subwoofer audio first starts. That problem is resolved, of course, by disabling the power-save."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Value","review":"There is not a lot to say. This is a 12\\" woofer that works like a champ.

That being said, the subwoofer looks amazing, very clean and polished, and I tested it with Pirates of the Caribbean 2, and the subwoofer combined with the speaker bar I purchased off Amazon a while back provided a definite thump and rumble to the sound effects. Setup was extraordinarily easy, just a single cable from soundbar to subwoofer and a big, impossible-to-miss power button. Overall I am happy with the purchase, it cost me about $85 I think so I knew it wasn't high-end or anything really, but the Sony name means quality to me and I got what I happily paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Muddy","review":"Nice speaker, not for a big room though.

The directions took a little time to figure out, but upon proper study, the installation and adjustment were great. The sound from this sub was outstanding.

My first HTS has 5-way, large L/R speakers including, 10\\" woofers so I never purchased a sub for it.However, I obviously didn't know what I was missing until I plugged this into my Harmon Kardon AVR 146 and powered it up. This unit can easily handle the bass requirements of the 15 x 20 foot area where the system is located. It was quite easy to set up and configure with the existing speakers. It adds immeasurably to the sound experience, obviously at the low end, that I wasn't realizing I was missing in my first system.I would recommend this unit,especially for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"step away from the Sony","review":"The Sony SA-W2500 Performance Line 100 Watt Subwoofer is mediocre sound, mediocre looks, and barely worth the fifty bucks I paid for it.

Imagine a 70's era TV's backside - That's EXACTLY what this looks like on the backThis unit does put some rumble in a movie, or maybe some hip-hop, but it's incredibly boomy-muddy at all volumes. DO NOT use it for any music, except maybe in the garage. I'll give it two stars because it does work and isn't the worst subwoofer I've heard, but it is close to the worst.

So I traveled to the nearest Best Buy and tested it out and it was out of thid world! I decided to purchase through amazon because the price is ALOT LOWER! than Best Buy. Once it came in and I connected to my Harman Cardon 635 AVR 7.1 receiver, WOW! WOW! WOW! This thing sounds great!!!! It gives you the right amount of low end from movies and as well the rumbles, and heavy breathing in movies! You can't beat the amount of quality for the dollar! I'm just taking AWAY!!!!!!!

It works great with my stereo. I am still making fine adjustments to different types of music. On the back side it has Volume control,phase-normal or reversed switch, and Hz adjustment dial--50 to 200 Hz. With these adjustments you can really dial it in to your liking. I have mine set most of the time to Normal Phase,150Hz,and 2/3 volume.It also has a power saver mode. That\`s nice to have so you don\`t have to turn it on and off every time you turn your stereo on or off. The power switch is on the back side. It can be wired with a LFE cable or if your stereo does not have a LFE port you can use standard speaker wire. Paper work that comes with this unit explains this in easy terms.

My living room isn't too big, and this woofer easily adds just the punch to enjoy any kind of low sounds from movies, games, music. I love the \\"Auto Off\\" feature: it'll turn on when it senses some job to do (i.e. low frequencies) and turns off a few minutes after the sound source is turned off.

For the price, this powered subwoofer is a great bargain, and provides decent bass for the medium-sized room where it is. My only complaint is with the power-saver feature (which can be disabled). If the volume level is low (and thus the signal to the sub is low), the subwoofer tends to shut itself off automatically. It's certainly possible that at low levels, my Onkyo receiver doesn't put any low level signal out to the subwoofer, which would cause the sub to power off. The simple solution is to turn off the power-save feature, and manually power on and off the subwoofer, which is what I do now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bass Great Price","review":"This is my secondary surround system in my family room and it's more than enough to fill an 18x22 room using a low end Sony receiver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sub for the price","review":"Can't complain.

Whenever that THX sound comes on when I'm watching a movie, I feel like I'm at the Theater. It sounds amazing. You will get as much bass as you desire with it, just make sure to set-up your system and levels correctly.

The enclosure is relatively compact, so there is not a huge \\"boom-boom\\" like from the larger speakers, but it adds a dimension to the audio experience that is otherwise lacking with boxed sound systems. This is certainly an add-on for a 5.0 home theatre set-up to make it 5.1 with little expense. The product is priced very aggressively and I found it to be an entirely satisfactory choice given its inherent limitations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising!","review":"I bought this sub as just a filler for my home stereo system.

The gist of the book seems to be that the CoC needs to reject the philosophies and teachings of our fathers and accept the postmodern worldview in order to grow and change along with the world. Not the Biblical teachings of our fathers but the traditions and ideals that they espoused and which have been a part of the churches of Christ for the past 150+ years.

Being written by two Southern Baptists, this volume is understandably most appealing to fellow Baptists. Still, the tone of the chapters and the treatment of the issues are presented in such a way as to apply to all ministers, regardless of denomination.I recommend this title very highly.

It tracks everything you could care about: distance, current speed, average speed, calories, and fat calories burned, etc. It also has a scan mode which rotates through these modes as you're biking so you can look down and see a lot of the data as it cycles (no pun intended) through it's list.This let's you bike smarter and with greater access to information corresponding to your overall bike workout. I strongly encourage the purchase of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty","review":"Ride the Silver Comet trail near Atlanta...flat, paved converted railway. Ridden with it twice so far...seems accurate (compared it to a GPS last ride). Neat features like tempurature plus standard distance & time. Set up was pretty easy. The ad makes it appear larger then it is...it's really about the size of maybe a G-shock wristwatch. But easy to read anyway. Intuitive setup and use with 2 buttons. Has a scroll feature to cycle through all of the functions. Uses watch batteries and seems easy to change them. Price was outstanding through Amazon.

The typical rider will only use about 4-5. The installation is easy, all you need is a flat head screw driver. I transition this computer from my road bike to my mountain bike with no problems. Speed and readings seem to be accurate (if using on 2 bikes they may be off on one, as the speed is calculated by the rotation of the tire, different size tires would result is miscalculations unless you reprogrammed for each use on a different bike). For me it was close enough though.

There is only so much information the human brain can digest on a ride while reading your bike computer, before getting so distracted that you get into an accident. The more basic the information, the better. This computer will tell you a bit more than the basics, but for the price I can forgive the information overload. When this unit is in the SCAN mode, it displays in progressive order the basic information that I really need to know on a ride. Distance traveled, top speed, average speed, time elapsed, with the current speed constantly displayed in large numerals. KISS. This gets five stars because of the price and value. It is easy to mount, easy to use, and will carry forward your logged mileage by entering it upon initial setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Skip it. I bought two of these computers for the kids to track their mileage. I was looking for inexpensive computers and was sold on the Schwinn brand name. Bottom line is that if you're already used to using bike computers that work, then you (and the kids) won't be satisfied by these. The display is fine enough, but the button/function control is poor. Usually bike computers have one button to change modes and another button for start and stop that you then hold down to reset the trip information. Not this one. It's totally not intuitive and none of the buttons are labelled. We can never remember from day to day how to start, reset, which combination of buttons to press, which to press and hold, etc. We needed to have the manual with us before each ride. We finally gave up on them and bought different ones. I think I only spent 10 or 15 bucks on these when I bought them last year, so I wasn't expecting too much, but I *was* expecting a usable unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't remember","review":"Do not remember getting this product.

My copy had a dead spot between 7 and 8 km/h and it the readout would be 0, stopping the distance meter and the rolling time meter. This would mess up any measurement where you would travel at these speeds, which are quite common for me on some steep and prolonged climbs. The other unacceptable flaw was the flimsy mounting system. The CC was constantly falling off on small jumps and when I went though rough terrain, until one day, it fell never to be found again. I since ordered a bell CC which is less than 10 bucks, it has always given me very accurate readouts with no dead spots and has never budged from its mount, which is very similar in principle to the schwinn mount. If your are looking for a cheap and reliable CC, buy the bell CC for less than 10 bucks instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap wiring","review":"Set up was an easy 5 stars, very easy to attach everything to the bike.The wiring on the other hand was just garbage. The wire is so thin and I didn't leave enough slack in the wiring so it easily snapped rendering this product useless. They do not sell replacements either, you would have to buy the whole new computer for it to come with the replacement wiring and sensor.The instructions did say leave slack, which I did because I am indeed smart enough to read simple instructions, but it should have given some pointers as to what enough slack is or where you should strap the wires on the bike.On initial set up, I gave enough slack to rotate front tire all the way to the left and right just to be sure. Somehow this was not good enough.The computer seemed pretty good though, too bad its useless.I will be going with a unit that has better and thicker wiring next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensor cable is way too short for my recumbent.

First of all it's a pain to hook up to your bike. The wires are hard to pin down with just the plastic ties they give you. I had to use a ton of extra electrical tape. The wheel sensor isn't held on with anything and easily falls off. Last time I got my bike back from the shop it was gone. Ugh.Also, there is no easy reset button. The toggle between features is a pain, nothing is clearly labeled, I had to consult my manual every time I wanted to switch the screen.Set up was a pain. You can't just save your settings and customize as you want. Every time you want to set up a feature you have to start all over again from square one. Very annoying.I know it's cheap but this ended up being a total waste of money for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too happy with this bike computer","review":"I purchased this bike computer for both my bike and wife's bike.

The holding clip can leave the computer very easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost the same as 2006 model","review":"I've got a bike computer with a front that looks exactly like this, but was purchased in 2006. When I needed a computer for another bike, I bought this in a heartbeat because the first one still works (on its original battery!) and has all the functions I need. Its clock is even accurate (< 0.001% off in 3 years), not that I use the clock all that often. Unfortunately, the new model comes with a different handlebar mount. In 2006 it came with a very adjustable mounting unit. The newly-ordered model came with a cheapish plastic part that is zip-tied to the handlebars. It seems to work acceptably well, but is much less attractive and usable than the 2006 version. It is still TOTALLY worth the $10 I paid for it, but I would have rather paid $15 and had a better mount. I still recommend this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat it for the money.","review":"Works great. All of these things should have the same accuracy, and all depend on having an accurate wheel circumference. Additionally, they all need about the same sensor/probe distance, since they all use the same technology to transmit a signal. The thermometer is a nice feature, though it's a bit slow to react. Backlight is also nice, but hidden (you have to press the left button). 2 complaints:1. It would be nice if all trip-related features reset together. As it stands, while time, distance, and avg speed reset together, max speed, calories, and fat cals all need to be individually reset.2. Mounting hardware is super chintzy. Everything is just held on by zip ties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hlywod","review":"Great computer for the price,Works good, I have two of these. One is a year old, One is a month old.

There are enough functions to keep me happy, but not overwhelmed. I like that it has a running odometer and a separate trip meter.

I also like the max speed and average speed indicators and the clock comes in handy too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im a little skeptical about this one...","review":"It was pretty easy to put together if you follow the directions. The only problem is that I find the speeds a little hard to believe. My girlfried and i bike about 12 miles everyday and it takes us about 2 hours to do it. That would mean that we are averaging about 6mph right? not according to this little device. this device will have you thinking you are Lance Armstrong. 17 mph up a steep hill?

I waited a bit to open up the box and install it, so now I can't return it anymore, either.Not happy, but for $11 it's not the end of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK - but takes careful adjusting","review":"For the price I figured I can't go wrong if it didn't function completely. I own a Schwinn Cruiser and figured I'd stay with a Schwinn product. The adjustment to get the magnet you mount on the spokes (which are angled) to be read by the reader on the fork is, well, rather arduous. I mean c'mon - 1 mm distance max. That's about as thick as a business card! And since the spokes angle away towards the rim - only one side of the round spoke magnet can be that close - the other (top side) is farther away. So sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. SO, I adjusted the spoke magnet so the lower portion slightly ticks (rubs) the sensor on the fork when the front wheel spins. After riding for a several miles (about 10) the ticking went away (due to wearing of both contact points) and now all is well. Be patient and you'll get 'er to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning it.","review":"I was very excited to get this unit, but I did not even get the chance to use it since the magnet could not be installed on the wheel. I've called Schwinn in hope to get the part, but they asked me to ship the unit back, so I have decided to return it directly to amazon. I'm sure it's a good product, but I couldn't use it, hence the review.I bought another one, so I shall leave a feedback for the other product. :P"},{"rating":"2","title":"it works good , better than you'd expect !","review":"I have this Speedo, and I like it ! It works good and is fairly easy to use . One thing to keep in mind when mounting it is to put the sensor as close as you can to the hub , or it won't be sending an accurate speed . To set it up you just choice your rim size it's written on the side of your tire if you don't know )they have a conversion table in the instructions , then you set your choice of Miles or kilometers , set the clock and your done . The only thing I don't really care for if you want to get picky is I can't find a way to reset the trip meter without resetting the whole thing over - a miner grip ! All in all I really like this little , inexpensive device and for the price you can't beat it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised!","review":"Good value for the money.

Installation was a breeze - took a little over 10 minutes. A suggestion, before you fix the components permanently, do a dry run and identify the final positions of the components. Once you have the positions pretty much defined then attach them permanently. A little tweaking might be needed but I found that a gap of 2mm or so is fine.

The magnet on the wheel has a flimsy plastic screw that bends easily and does not stay attached very well.

These Schwinn Computers are good and I'd give it 5 stars, but the quick release is total junk!!! I was sick of having to constantly check the old one, but thought maybe I had a bad one first time. New one seemed tighter, but evidently after a few bumps it was gone. Money down the drain after only being on the bike for an hour at most. I tossed the 12-Function in the trash too! I'm sick of the cheap plastic junk most things seem to be anymore! Bought a more expensive Sunlite and the quick release is sound! Don't like the computer as well, but I'll get use to it.

However, after a few days (or longer, pending how much you ride), errors start to rear their ugly head. At first, it was selectively giving readouts, with no alteration to the sensor/magnet. The next day, it was not giving any readouts whatsoever. Upon rearranging the entire setup, I received about 5 minutes worth of riding readout before the cable actually snapped. Yes, I followed the precautions regarding cable tension as a result of turning handlebars, and as a result, gave the cable plenty of slack to spare.

Also, the items for weight, age, wheel size etc. are not labeled on the screen so by trial and error you learn which is which and when to enter them.

And given the flimsyness of the quick-ties they give you to attach the sensor, and the potholes on basically every city street in America, that's almost impossible to maintain. It's also not very accurate (I tested it with my car, the speedometer was off by quite a bit), and before people go accusing me of not setting the wheel diameter right, believe me, that was the first thing I checked, and adjusted, and adjusted again.

This book should be a \\"must read\\" for those students still attending high school, and a definite \\"must buy\\" for those parents sending their kids off to college, especially if they want to see \\"A's\\" on their children's term papers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the regular Missing Pieces and save some money","review":"I think Autograph is one of the most underrated hair bands of the 80s. Being a big fan of their music, I was interested to learn that there was an import version of Missing Pieces that had seven additional tracks on it. I plunked down my $25.00 just to hear those seven tracks. Upon listening to the CD, I quickly realized that five of the seven extra tracks are simply rough demos of songs on their first album \\"Sign in Please.\\" I was dissapointed to say the least. The rehashed songs coupled with a printing error in the liner notes, make me regret spending the cash for this import CD. If you are an Autograph fan, stick with the American version of Missing Pieces and save yourself fifteen bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"good choice","review":"Great value, solid construction, closed perfectly.

I bought two, along with digital hygrometers and the Ice gel. Seasoned them for two weeks and I still can not get the humidity above 57% in one. The other one is even lower. These boxes weren't any better than the cedar lined boxes the cigars are sold in. I ended up putting the gel, my cigars, and the hygrometers in Glad storage containers. Works like a charm.

This humidor advertises a 25 stick capacity, the glasstop 25-50. When they arrived the packaging, color (cherry), hygrometer, divider and humistat were all identical. The only difference in the humidors was the glass top in the Capri.That being said, the Capri does seem to have a better seal, but I attribute that to the assembly rather than the product itself. As stated in other reviews, some of these humidors have better seals and maintain RH better than others. As expected the hygrometer is worthless.All in all seems like an ok humidor for the price and expect to have some extra space if you plan to store no more than 25 cigars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joanna Newsom sound","review":"Actually, a little different from Joanna Newsom. Cheer has an absolute pristine and unforgettable voice on her \\"Cafe Tien\\", as if she's singing directly to you. This one song will stun you with its absolute clarity and its perfect balance of silence and guitar. Her other songs are perhaps comparable to, well, Matsu Takako (sorry, I am badly versed in Western music). I'd recommend this sweet, soft compilation to anyone. I'd even play it for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"OGRE?","review":"Having loved The Tin Drum, I anticipated this feature greatly.

I honestly could not get into it whenever Malkovich started talking in his overly-American jargon, while everyone around him was either talking in a French accent or a German one, appropriately (Malkovich was playing a Frenchman). Just that intonation contrasted heavily to even when he was narrating in the background (he a different, heavier voice then) on the events happening around him. It is obvious the movie has no direction and some of the events are utterly unbelievable. It starts out well, when Malkovich's role is played by a younger actor in an earlier time in his life, but when Malkovich comes in, I think he ruins it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capabilities Limited Only by Your Imagination","review":"The perfect blend of traditional engineering and cutting edge technology.

It is packed full of so many great vitamins and minerals and the algae DHA in it is one of the main reasons I bought it, what a PLUS!!!! Oh and please refrigerate, it taste much better cold in your juice! I will continue to buy this prenatal vitamin for before, during and after pregnancy!!!

After I read the reviews I assumed that taking this with juice was the best option, but it's not to bad by itself. Very easy on my stomach and I will definately be ordering more! There is a pineapplish taste to it. If you have a hard time with taking large pills like I do, this is a great alternative. Definately was better than the chewables!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once a day is the way!!","review":"I have read so many horror stories about the taste of Prenatal Plus DHA...but my reviews are different.

I'm 25 weeks pregnant and I wanted to switch my prenatal vitamins to a liquid form, I have trouble swallowing big pills and this has DHA and I was so happy to know this vitamins got all I need. I asked my Perinatologist before start taking this vitamins, I am on bed rest with a cerclage and taking progesterone shots so i want to make sure this is a right vitamin to take but the ingredient on this bottle has \\"meadowseet\\" and I found this:(Avoid use during pregnancy. Meadowsweet may increase uterine tone and might stimulate uterine activity)So, my Perinatologist found similar information and didn't recommend it for now. I may start taking it after I deliver my baby. I don't want to put on risk my pregnancy the herb has 300 mg in each spoon you can read the labels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good alternative","review":"I couldn't stand burping up fish oil with the gel caps. This is a good alternative to get you DHA. Not the best taste, but at least it won't come up later."},{"rating":"1","title":"The smell as it was opened longer got worse!!","review":"I didn't mind the taste when I first started using it, and it was great for relieving stomach sensitivities. After the first week I noticed the smell and taste got a little rougher. The longer I used it the taste and smell got unbearable. Oh, and the color got gross. Normally when taking medications you can fight through oder and taste knowing it's short-lived but I just fight through it for 9 months. Sorry. I had high hopes but I just couldn't keep taking it as it felt like it was rotting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier than horsepills!","review":"It is much easier than taking giant pills and you only need a tablespoon per dose. Usually I am very sensitive to tastes and this vitamin is no exception. The worst part is swallowing it with only a short lived after taste. I have found it hides very well in only 4ozs of an orange juice smoothie. I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't taste bad!","review":"I have really bad acid reflux already so I cannot take pills very well. I got this immediately! It doesn't take too bad I got a cup from a cough syrup and measure it that way and just use a juice chaser whatevers in the fridge. I find it convenient to take anytime and it doesn't mess with my acid reflux. I can't just get up in the morning and take things though I have to eat toast first which is a good recommendation so you don't get morning sickness anyway!

More energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and easy!","review":"I never minded taking prenatal vitamins in pill form, but I had to take six a day!

It's also great for women who have a tough time with nausea during pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can say that its...nice, but not as nice as others...","review":"Simple plot, simple story, the entire series is so easy to understand. Also, the fight sequences are pretty pathetic as that there is no hand-to-hand combat, only high energy weapons. Another comment is on the imbalance of the factions, obviously Zeorymer is the strongest. Too little twists...too much wasted time...All of this can be summed up into 1 statement,\\"What a bore...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Find","review":"I just recently discovered this series....I was drawn by the fishing-themed titles. What a wonderful discovery! These books are all very well-written and the mysteries are just the right amount of 'complicated'. Most of the series I typically read feature a female main character (I seem to like these better) but I really like Chief Frank Bennett. He is a refreshing change of pace and interesting. The setting (Andirondack Mountains) is a character of its own and reminds me of the Donna Ball mysteries. My only complaint is that there hasn't been a new one in a few years. Does anyone know if the author is done writing this series?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood Knot","review":"This story was as good as the first one I read by this author last summer. It evokes a true feeling of being in the Adirondack Mountains and of being a native instead of a summer visitor, as I am. The hero, s small town police chief is totally believable with his all to human traits. The book kept me reading far into the night. Hope more stories with this lead character are forthcoming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inner Mounting Crimso","review":"Inner Mounting Flame meets Starless & Bible Black.I enjoy this album, but not quite as much as I did Frances the Mute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do what you want to do","review":"Okay-This album has its moments just like frances the mute where it takes everything you have not to destroy whatever format it is on. However there is a lot more good than there is bad. I expect every band to somewhat \\"change\\" from album to album, and I would love to see another \\"deloused\\" style album, but TMV have gone beyond that in my opinion.I enjoy this album. I haven't heard anything else quite like it. These songs bring imagery to mind such as having broken into an egyptian tomb, having a unremovable curse layed upon you, and then trying to escape these circumstances while having some howling banshee torment you at every corner. If this doesn't sound like a good time, then spend your money on a more traditional (worried about how much money I will make, and if we'll retain our fan base) style album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I really was hoping that I would like Amputechture. I liked the themes of the songs, but this did not hash out into an enjoyable release. The music was jarring and discordant, with no trace of melody to smooth the rough edges. Being unique doesn't neccesarily mean great music, and such is the case with this release by Mars Volta. I thought Deloused in the Comatorium was a great release, but I'm afraid to say that as a whole, the band is not for me. They make some interesting noise, but not enough true, quality music."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit lost...","review":"I'd pay Rick Rubin personally if he would come back, produce the next MV album, and finally provide the correct direction this talented band needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing......","review":"The Mars Volta is great but this album is terrible, its more noise than usual, at some points it seems like 2-3 songs are playing at once. The first track is awesome can't deny that but it progessively gets worse and worse. Make sure you sample this album at your local record store before purchasing, thank god its only $9.99. This album doesnt come close to Deloused or Frances the mute. Just listen before you buy and sample every track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring................zzzzzz","review":"This deeply saddens me. The Mars Volta went from being one of the most creative bands to just plain boredom. Like Frances the Mute, the songs seemed based on length instead of quality. Some songs are great in the start, but then they just keep going towards a pointless uninspiring ending. Don't get me wrong! I like long epic songs. But some of these songs could've been great short, instead of long with pointless annoying parts just to showcase some skills. The musicianship is still very technical and even amazing in some areas. But you've come to expect that from TMV. I don't think they will ever get better than \\"Deloused the Comatorium\\" or even close it, judging by the last 2 albums.This album is only for fans that like to force themselves to like albums. \\"Listen to it a couple of times and it will grow on you,\\" is what these fans like to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you really want it, wait till its in the $2.99 bin . . trust me it will be there soon","review":"Yeah to be blunt, first album was fantastic! A big hope for prog rock. Francis The Mute was ok but kind of loosing it. This album totally lost it. I dont normally write reviews but i rushed out and brought this album the second it was released and paid FULL price thinking it would be an improvement on Frances Th Mute and a return to former glory. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys were \\"punk\\"","review":"Sounds like the singer got his nutz caught in a meat grinder.

Is this unchartered territory, I think not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Mars Volta albumn yet","review":"I love At the Drive in, and even have a special place for Sparta, and the first two full length Mars Volta albums, but this latest release is not for me. Progressive rock must progress I guess, but the fractured and incoherence of this album make it tough to listen to unless you plan on paying full attention from start to finish, it's more of a auditory pennance. I would pass on Amputechture, it's disjointed and bizarre, even for the likes of The Mars Volta!"},{"rating":"1","title":"at least the disc wasn't scratched","review":"I bought this thinking it would have the CD case with it. I always look forward the artwork and liner notes, it's part of the whole \\"buying an album experience.\\" Well, there was no artwork, no liner notes, nothing. All I got was the Disc itself in a slim clear case. I was super upset and when I opened the package and it lacked all the necessary Items an album should have.

Its very good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but not compared to their other two albums","review":"Good but not as good as De-Loused or Frances. They don't change the formula all that much on this album. They just take out most of the horns from Frances and the extended sections of ambience (Which is probably a good thing)and go with what's left. Cedrics voice actualy get's a little rediculous at a couple places : Tetragrammaton 9:14- 10:41, again at the beggining of Meccamputechture, and one last time at 10:19 of Day of the Baphomets. He sounds like one of the darn Chipmonks at these parts. Other than that his voice isn't near as awesome and all over the place like it was on Frances.This IS a great album, don't get me wrong. It just isn't all that De-loused and Frances The Mute were. Don't worry too much though, according to Omar, they are halfway finished with their next album already and are hoping to release it around March of 07."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!!","review":"I always thought the Dictaors were one of the great rock&roll bands but I thought they had retired into obscurity somewhere a long time ago. I was looking to see if the disc \\"Blood brothers\\" was out on cd when I saw that they had released a new cd. All the reviews were great but I had to see for myself. I CAN'T BELIEVE THESE GUYS! After all these years the Dictators are still putting out rock and roll of the highest caliber This cd totally blows my mind. It's better than I could have possibly imagened. If you don't have a copy........your missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dictators Stand Tall!","review":"Unless you're some hopeless mook, you need to buy this album! From the opening \\"Police on My Back\\" riffage backed with Marshall power chords, you know the Dictators are back! This could have come out right after \\"Go Girl Crazy\\", it's that good. I haven't heard NYC style guitar riffs like Ross the Boss and Top Ten provide in a long,long time (kind of a cross between Donald \\"Buck Dharma\\" Roesser and Johnny Thunders back in the day). The humors's still there along with that unique punk/power pop/heavy metal amalgam Adny Shernoff pulls off so well. And what can you say about the Handsomest Man in Show Business? Dick Manitoba hasn't lost a thing in 20 years, he still sounds great!In this day of boy band, hip hop, techno, pop girl homogenized crap it's wonderful to hear a band that can still kick out the jams. Joey Ramone is smiling somewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dictator's Save Rock n' Roll","review":"It's been twenty three years...but well woth the wait. The Dictator's have roared back with a blistering collection of tunes that put the fun and excitement back in rock. From the opening cut \\"Who Will Save Rock and Roll\\" the bar is set high and the band delivers throughout the remainder of the CD. Andy Shernoff has a knack for capturing the fun elements of rock without the slightest hint of becoming a parody of the genre. The band is tight and spot on in performance. They are a killer live act and this new release should provide some real ammo for their live show. If you've had enough of the doom and glooms or smell the scent of phony in the \\"fun\\" rock acts ala Blink 182, then D.F.F.D. should be just what the doctor ordered. The Dictator's are the REAL DEAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Puzzle Game","review":"Great PC and handheld puzzle game.

This is a great port with some new twists from the PC version that I've played for years. There is the classic game version (with some new new features, such as the wild card and parachuting Snoods!) and also a fast-paced game and a two-player game that is really hard for me to win. When the kids went to sleep, I sat down and enjoyed the puzzle levels which are my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biter...","review":"If anyone is new to video games, or just downloads stupid corny games from co-workers, then listen up. Snood is an exact repleca of the Gameboy/NES classic Bust-A-Move. It really [ angered me ] when I saw this game on the computer, but that its made its way to GBA makes me want to, well, I'd rather eat broken glass. Bust-A-Move was made long before this [ game]and let me tell you, it couldn't be more of an exact repleca (expect for the added smiling faces - wow!). If you like this game, don't buy it - do yourself a favor and give your money to the classic - and the original - Super Bust-A-Move (for GBA)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snood, One of the best games EVER!!!!!!","review":"It is one of the best games I have ever played.

A couple things I found frustrating: 1) there is no way to \\"undo\\" a move. This would come in extremely handy. 2) I wish there was some way to regain some of your lives. I can only get so far on the lives I'm given at the start of the game. 3) It's also frustrating to be on a level and not get a piece you need! Some of the levels start out so close to the bottom that you need a certain piece to get some room, and then you don't get it. Impossibility in a game is kind of annoying. I still found myself playing, despite my complaints, so like I said-- it can be addicting."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love Snood on the PC, don't buy this version","review":"If it were an option, this game would get no stars. I love snood on the PC. In fact, I spend way too much of my life and college class time playing it. Therefore, I was completely exicted to find out that it was coming out in a hand held version. However, I was so disappointed in this format, I had to return the game. Don't let the other reviewers fool you - this is not the Snood that you love. There is no Hall of Fame. No Snood used counter. In short, the real motivation to play is simply not there. Unless you want to write down your scores as you go, there is no record to beat. BORING. Too add insult to injury, the harder levels of the game proved to be harder only in that telling some of the snoods apart was next to impossible. Please take heed, and only buy this game at a store that will give you credit if you are as disappointed as I am/was. Sorry Snood fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snood Rules!","review":"This is the game that Nintendo made Game Boy Advance for! It's so much fun to take the game with me. I no longer have to sit at the PC to play it. It is actually more enhanced then the PC version. Get this one! It's a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Case Crime's First Original","review":"So, I picked up the first pair of Hard Case Crime novels (this and Block's Grifter's Game), expecting a good read. Let me tell you, brothers and sisters, I more than got it.This is a fast read, a white knuckle story of gangsters, hoods and a femme fatale who all suck the loner/outsider protagonist into a tough underworld. It is a trip to hell.One of the main strengths of the novel is its author's voice, who brings something of a modern sensibility to material that could otherwise be dated. Still, the book has a vintage feel to it. The piece works and works well. If you like James Ellroy's Bop Quartet, you'll probably dig this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid story and writing","review":"A nice read in the hard-boiled detective genre. One problem, which may not mean much to most readers, was with gun details. Corson tells us he carries a .44 caliber Colt Python. There is no such thing. I understand this is a fictional story, but when an author tries hard to recreate a period, by talking about locales, movie stars and automobiles in the story as if the characters were actually there, why not check that the gun described actually existed as well? Otherwise, I enjoyed it, would recommend it and would read another by Phillips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pygmies rule.","review":"the baka are among the last remnants of our most direct line to the very firest humans. their way of life is being destroyed by mining and logging interests in central africa and i hope that we do what we can to raise awareness of the fact that we are about to sever our taproot of humanity. how do we expect to survive without it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a bit thick, but a good battery","review":"This battery replaced the original from my motokrzr cellphone.

The book is told first person as the author interviews individuals and goes thru records related to his search. What he finds is unsurprising, many Arabs did go out of the way to help Jews, though some also went out of the way to take advantage of Jews trying to escape the Nazis. His search takes him to places such as Paris, Tunis, Morocco, Berlin and Israel. The book focuses on personal stories of Arabs who helped Jews, but the book also includes solid compilations of records and references. All in all, a very interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"cat carrier, small pet carrier","review":"Don't buy this.

My friends loved it and the women begged to try it. What what truly amazing is that it smelled wonderful on each of them but completely different on each of them. The guys got into the act as well, and while it was a little too feminine for most of them, it even smelled unique on each of them. Long story short, you have to try this to see if you like on you.

Maybe the graphics are not perfect, but its fun to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me see...","review":"Wow, I gotta say... this game is pretty good. The graphics are nicely done, the loads are quick, and the mini movies clips are neat. I never saw the movie, but when I bought this game, I found out a whole lot about it. First of all, when I started playing this game, I thought \\"Oh man, this game is BORING!\\" Well, I thought wrong. The game begins with Mike or Sulley in the training area. Yes, you DO get to choose or switch off between the two characters. Later, you go to different levels of an area to scare these robot dudes. 99% of the time, you are successful unless you decide not to press any buttons. But why wouldn't you? Anyways, there aren't any BOSS levels in case you're wondering. The game is easy, I beat it 4 times, and you can save up to 4 files for 1 memory block. Overall, the game is neat, easy, and um.. I guess quite affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Fun","review":"If you like monsters, scaring people, or anything Monster's Inc. then you will love this original game. The graphics aren't very good, but you have to consider that it is a very old game. Probably from 2001-2002. As long as you can look past that, this game is very interesting and fun. You get to explore and do a lot of crazy things. Jumping, collecting, and scaring, just to name a few.

This game is flawed in so many areas I can't think of anything good about this game. For one thing, it is way too simplistic, to the point of where it feels like the idiot's guide on how to play a video game. You'll mostly just spend your time upgrading you scare meter by collecting many, many potions. When you finally scare you subject it doesn't feel rewarding even after you collect all those potions, it just makes you angry that you wasted your time on this crappy game. So to keep it short, the missions suck, the controls suck, the camera sucks, the graphics suck, the characters suck, and the enemies suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monters inc.","review":"This is a very fun game,but it's kinda short.They drew Sulley and Mike wrong but that can be easily forgot after you play a while.I think it's funny when they do there scares wich are not really scary at all.You alsoe can choose your character[Sulley or Mike]."},{"rating":"1","title":"A W F U L ! ! !","review":"Don't waist your money.

Besides most of the times, the characters fought with \\"Palms\\" or magic powers not with swords. As for the script, I can not uderstand what is going on at all.

Extremely useful and very readable. The author takes you step by step through the permissions process for all kinds of things. I especially like the practical advice on how to avoid or at least minimize licensing fees. The section on music samples answers a lot of questions and makes this book a must for people who do that sort of thing. The chapter on website permission should prevent anyone from getting (forgive me) tangled in lawsuit. As usual with NOLO, there are forms you can use at the back and also on a disk. HOW MUCH EASIER CAN IT GET? Great index too. This is THE book on the subject. If you have any questions about whether you can use something-- buy this book first. It'll save you headaches later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent practical advice","review":"I can't add much to the other reviews for this book, but I would like to add my two cents...This book does an excellent job of describing when permission is necessary for copyright and trademark issues, and give sample agreements to obtain the necessary consents. The book is very clearly and intelligently written and gives readers a very good sense of when permissions are necessary from a legal perspective or highly advisable from a practical point of view (very different issues)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shortest Path to Understanding Copyright Issues","review":"If you'd rather spend most of your time on your creative work rather than wade through the government's articles and circulars on copyright issues, I can't recommend this book enough. Getting Permission not only addresses common misunderstandings about copyright issues, but it provides clear instructions for getting permission if in fact you need to. Before I purchased this book, I was under the impression that you always had to request permission, but that isn't the case. This is one of the most valuable references you can own if the topic of copyright seems overwhelming, and I highly recommend that you read it before creating your masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO to lecture on racial purity","review":"While the basic premise of the book is sound and valuable, Gola lost virtually all credibility for me when he went off on marrying within your race/ethnic group.

He jumps around to multiple subjects on a single page. Or repeats arguments 2-3 pages apart. Statements of \\"fact\\" are just boldly stated as being \\"truth,\\" with no scripture or logical thinking to back them up.

Otherwise, it's the most accessible, convenient, compact and protective filter storage option available.

I find that most of my cordials taste best after 10 months to 1 year. Even better after 2 years (note: not the cream liquors), so don't throw it out if it still doesn't taste right after 6 months... let it age.

No, of course not. It's like any cookbook- the recipes must be taken with a grain of salt. I never make the recipes that use artificial flavors or oils, I only make the ones with real ingredients. I also cut out some of the sugar.I have found the recipes to be a good guide for adaptation. I use whatever fruit I can find and then choose the closest recipe and adapt it as I see fit. My favorite is the sour cherry that I made with cherries I picked myself. I bring the cordials to parties and no one ever has more than a half a shot-glass; they're too sweet.

Same diff I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful gift book!","review":"I found this book at the library by accident, but decided to check it out.

Step by step, the book takes you from the very basics of Interactive Data Language to such details as writing graphical interfaces, artfully using pointers and objects. For a beginning IDL programmer, the book guides you through generously provided example code (which by itself is invaluable and is being re-used all the time in IDL community). For an intermediate level IDL user, it is a reference that will sit next to your computer all the time. For an expert, it is an example to follow, full of great tips that increase your efficiency in writing IDL code. Traditionally, working with colors in IDL is seriously addressed in second edition. I use the book all the time and recommend it to anybody who needs a guide to building better, more expandable, platform-independent IDL applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply the best resource for any IDL programmer","review":"David has an excellent style of writing. It is clear and simple to understand and yet he manages to demonstrate throughout the book, the sheer power of IDL. This book was invaluable to me when I was learning IDL, and even now when I am much more experienced, I still use it. The book shows you how you should write code to get the most out of IDL. It deals with widget interface programming, and demonstrates many grahical display tips. It even shows you how you can produce excellent-quality postscript output, which will save you hours of frustration. The book is packed with well written examples which makes the boook come to life.If you're new to IDL, then you MUST get this book. Even if you're a seasoned veteran of IDL, there's probably still a lot that you could learn from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I can only assume that the reason this book got so many good reviews is because for so long it was the only book out there on IDL: and compared to learning IDL from the computer manuals anything seems good.My complaints: The author continually introduces extraneous commands into his examples just to show off what IDL can do. He does not explain where these extra bells and whistles come from, and so gives the impression that IDL is FAR MORE ARBITRARY than necessary. This is annoying to say the least, but also makes it difficult to learn the lanquage when you can't understand the complete example.

We use the weekly themes to choose fiction literature and non fiction reference materials appropriate for little ones from our library and add in some math games, circle time and art. You can use the book as a general guide or to flip through the year for some great tips.

It sounds like to a prelude to the later Blue Note label,\\" Belly of the Beast\\" recording. Same tempo. \\"Glamour\\" has more of the themes of seeking a romance or finding the stability of love elusive. I would recommend Glamour to someone who may be looking to OWN a SECOND recording to \\"sample\\" the RANGE OF MS. WILSON. It is only similar to \\"Blue Light Til Dawn!\\" in that it has many acoustic instruments, but \\"Blue Light...\\" is more African sounding. Glamour is mostly mellow toned with hints of blues, Latin, jazz, and folk. I would not recommend listening to this CD as music \\"to stay awake\\" or work the night shift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put your iPod away with this one!","review":"I have asked, as I'm sure many others, that amazon just tell us in the product write-up if a CD is \\"copy protected\\" - i.e. cannot be added to a legitimate digital music collection.

As for Cassandra, yes characterful and typical - maybe a bit predictable and \\"cookie cutter\\" by now?

Every cliche and elementary writing blunder and embarrassment is exhibited on virtually every page. Read the credits and the jacket and you know why this book was published: connections, connections, PC mania and chutzpa. Certainly not anything to do with talent.

Needless to say, my review was not full of praise like some others, but it was clear that I had read the book and had some valid criticisms. However, a number of reviews following mine said I didn't know a great book when I read one and what did I know since I didn't write a book and even insulted me personally. Anyway, my review and a rebuttal (and others' references to it) have been removed. Do bad reviews get dropped after awhile to \\"goose\\" the overall ratings and boost sales?

I thought this novel was poorly written, unimaginative, unoriginal, and cliched. If you want an honest review, check out the New York Times \\"Books in Brief\\" review. It was obvious in the first chapter who the diabolical mastermind was - so there never was much of a mystery. I also found a great deal of the book almost insulting in its implausibility. The only reason I finished the book at all was to be able to say with full knowledge, that it has no redeeming qualities. I gave it two stars instead of one only because, I'm sure worse books have been written - so I'm grading on a curve."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong first effort","review":"Okay. I figured out who set up/betrayed the murder victim less than halfway through the book. (Smith loses a star because he didn't fool me.) However, Smith kept me guessing how and why all the way to the last chapter. This is a great first effort for a mystery writer. FBI Agent Sterling Bledsoe is a believable sleuth. Add the scandal and intrigue of university life and the environmental twist (even though it felt a little like The Pelican Briefs), and you have a book with enough compelling characters, hidden motives and twists and turns for a very satisfying read. I look forward to following Agent Bledsoe's future exploits. Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good suspense...better than I expected","review":"Suspense, mystery and plot twists are what make a good novel, and all three of these ideas can be seen in The Blackbird Papers.

Dr. Ian Smith has proven that he is masterful at more than one profession. I'm a fast reader, anyway but when a book is really good, I can finish it even more quickly. I completed his book in just over two hours and I think I was absorbed with every page. That murder scene had me boiling with anger.

It's my theory that these 2 were just loafer friends who decided to put a metal band together.

It certainly can't be from serious admiration of the musicianship, songwriting, or singing, all of which are on the same level as a couple of teens who have just started to learn to play their instruments fooling around in their parents' garage, or perhaps The Shaggs. I guess this is one of those phenomena like Captain Beefheart's \\"Trout Mask Replica\\", where people pretend to \\"get\\" it so they can think of themselves as cooler-than-thou, while all the time ignoring that the Emperor is buck naked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake- Get the real deal","review":"This CD was OK but an obvious rip off of the flat duo jets.

THAT album is awesome. So I purchased this one today because I loved Elephant so much. White Blood Cells is obviously mailed in.

Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"oooo my god","review":"This is absolute poo... They dont have a bassist, and only like two good songs. Are they not intelegent enough to write a good song...

I can't believe Amazon ranked this the #3 album of the year!!! Where (...) is TransAtlantic's \\"Bridge Across Forever\\"? That deserves to be in the top 3 at least.

TERRIBLE NON-MUSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best is yet to come - trust me","review":"First of all, let me come straight out and say that the only reason i gave this album 4 stars is because im listenin to Elphant...right now, and its even BETTER!As of now, i'd have to say the white stripes are the best band in rock, and heres why. I've heard all their albums, and theres a definite progression between them - each arguably better than the last (note: this does not mean i do not HIGHLY recommend De Stijl - hello operator!). While i dig a lot of the other new stuff - set it off AUDIOSLAVE! - non of them have 3 ablums; count em: De Stijl, White Blood Cells, and Elephant... that all kick...in their own ways. Plus, i think that they're the purest (if that makes any sense) band out there; non of this pop sum 41 stuff. Dont get me wrong, i enjoy sum 41, but they aint lastin for long. Take my word (if you want), the white stripes are gonna be bustin out solid music for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Frickin' Weird CD - Cool!","review":"I bought this album for \\"Fell In Love With a Girl,\\" and absolutely hated it the first time I listened to it all the way through - I've since changed my mind - it grew on me - I have no idea why - Jack White's voice can be a little annoying at times, but his playing is great and the song lyrics are too good to miss out on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"\\"Fell in Love with a Girl\\" definatly isn't the only good song on here. It's almost always in my CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blues sound","review":"This is one of the best albums that i have heard in the last few years. Jack White provides a great blues feeling with his guitar. the rich sounds takes care of bass. His high pitched yelling and minimal drumming by Meg White create a unique sound that is rarely heard today.Just about every track is solid. Dead Leaves, Fell in love with a girl, Now Mary. If you are a classic rock and blues fan this is the best new stuff out there. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"instant classic","review":"This band actually deserves all the hype they've been getting. (Unlike the Strokes). Jack is a genuinely talented songwriter. (meg is his ex-wife) Surprisingly, has a lot of Led Zeppelin influence. A garage mix of Zep and the Pixies? I actually was living in Detroit as they were starting out, now i'm kicking myself for not finding out about them sooner. Everything I'd heard of the Detroit garage scene was pumped up..., but the White Stripes are a shining exception!"},{"rating":"2","title":"About that extra DVD...","review":"If you're gonna buy this cd, definately get this edition, with the bonus DVD. Although the DVD only features 4 music videos and 2 songs (it's pretty basic, and not incredibly exciting), it's a nice supplement to the CD. (plus it's free) Whatever you do, don't pay extra for the DVD disc. The CD is only about 40 minutes long, so the added DVD disc makes your purchase slightly more worth the money. Should you buy it? Well, I bought it and I wasn't disappointed. It's one of those things that if you're contemplating buying it, then go for it. The CD has an old early-60's rock-esque sound to it, yet while I listen to it, I am also reminded of the Violent Femmes."},{"rating":"2","title":"i would recomend it","review":"By now, you've heard the White Stripes on the radio or maybe MTV, probably either Fell In Love W/ A girl or Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground. Maybe you're thinking to yourself, \\"they seem just like the strokes or the vines.\\" Maybe you're thinking, they just copy what's popular. Maybe you're thinking they're nothing great. Maybe you're wrong. The White Stripes are reiventing rock music. It's not the best of the new wave of garage-band rock, but it is better than most stuff you can buy now. This truly is a CD that you will love if you enjoy rock. There are a few songs which aren't great, but for the mostpart, they are just one of many bands that are helping save the world from the likes of Nickleback."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm starting to get confused","review":"I'm really starting to get confused here with the recent \\"return of rock\\" era which has brought so many out of country artists like the Hives, the Vines, the Strokes, the White Stripes, i mean what's the difference, they all sound and look the same so why buy their albums?The White Stripes might look and sound the same as others but at least two or three songs on the album are decent enoungh to hear. I fell in love with \\"Fell In Love With A Girl\\" the first time I heard it. \\"We'll Just Be Friends\\" is pretty good and some of the other songs are alright.So, in my perspective, all the groups like this can just forget about having careers that last more than 15 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"another Blown Up Act","review":"I first saw this Band on a Tv Show&was curious why all the Hype? I was like what is the Big Deal about them&The Strokes?? but I have to Remember how things go in circles.the playing is alright the only thing that kinda makes them ok at best.but as far as Arrangements&Structure? nope not here.I don't feel the Vocals at all.it's ok at best but forgettable in months as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw emotion.","review":"This cd is pure raw emotion. Each song gives you a different feeling, and never bores you. You can feel exactly where Jack is coming from with ever lyric of every song. I admit, this cd is not for everybody, but if you appreciate raw, sometimes disturbing, heart filled emotion, buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"bigger room","review":"Jack and Meg pound out some kick butt rock and roll on just guitar and drum and vox. This will be your favorite album of whatever season you buy it in. FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS OF AMERICA: They may very well be on the verge of becoming huge so by it now so you can call all your friends posers when they buy it after it becomes platinum. They'd do the same thing to you but they don't read these reviews on amazon do't they? Go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a bass player","review":"As somewhat of an amateur bass player, I simply cannot condone any music that chooses to not have one. If I were to think of a classic artist - let's say Bread, for instance - not having a bass player, I would think that band's impact would be severely diminished. And don't go telling me the Beatles never had a bassist. His name was Paul McCartney.The songs are pretty good, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Deal","review":"I really can't understand what the big deal with the stripes are. it's very strange. they aren't very good. it's nothing new and it's boring. people seem to like them for the same reasons they like jon spencer. but imagine the blues explosion playing a show with the stripes. they would blow them out of the water!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the WORST audio recording I have ever heard.","review":"This CD sounds like two siblings got drunk in their basemnet and recorded an album on the equiptment they bought at the local thrift store.

No wonder we are hated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst cd I have ever heard","review":"There is no redeeming musical value in this cd... I wish there was a negative star rating so it could be properly reviewed...This one was given to me as a gift. I should probably wonder if that person hates me.

Stripped down, rockin tunes cut through the the air like a rusty hack saw for the entirey of this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!","review":"Four words: don't believe the hype! Yes, \\"White Blood Cells\\" is unlike anything else out there, but it's not doing anything worth paying attention to. It's also not worthy of all the hype radio and magazines have placed upon it.It's easy -- impossible not to, really -- to fall in love with the sheer rawness and energy of the White Stripes' first single \\"Fell In Love With a Girl.\\" I did and I bought the album, expecting at least a few more tracks like it. What a mistake ... there are exactly zero other tracks with the same screechin' guitars and raw noise. What's left is a whole lot of boring lyrics and odd vocals.I give the White Stripes two stars for potential. If Jack and Meg get a bassist and some decent melodies, they would be well on their way to stardom. I guarantee it. In the meantime ... wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just OK...not like the \\"saviors of rock\\" or anything...","review":"Boy, this prolific MemphisBowlerPimp guy must mistakenly think he's really funny and oh-so-clever.

I prefer a little more skill and a little less amateurish rough edges...err, excuse me, I mean \\"honesty.\\" That's what all the critics say, don't they? This band plays breathtakingly \\"honest\\" music. Well, it's not really all that good or life-changing or rock-genre-saving. Honest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"White Blood Cells [Limited Edition with Bonus DVD]","review":"The CD is great! The DVD has some videos of the band, it's ok, but i expected something more here."},{"rating":"2","title":"more fun than toothpaste and tuna in a blender with cheese","review":"good cd, but the songs are too short on it and it gets old too easily, i like there style a lot, raw and sw33t, but it gets too old with most songs hardly cashing in at 3 minutes, and the lead single fell in love with a girl not even squeezing 2 minutes onto the disk time. Its worth a check but it gets to old to easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Jack White","review":"I had heard Fell in Love With the Girl 1,000 times and liked it, but it wasn't until I heard Dead Leaves that I bought the CD. I was amazed. I had almost forgotten what a guitar should sound like. I grew up in the 60's and 70's and this CD reminded me of so much from that decade...The Kinks, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Hendrix, The Yardbirds. I actually cried the first time I heard \\"I Can't Wait\\". Thank you, thank you, thank you for renewing my hope in the future of music. I am anxiously awaiting the next CD and the arrival of their first 2 that I just ordered."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dad loves it too.","review":"My dad grew up in the era of what we now call \\"Classic Rock,\\" and he has never liked the new-fangled stuff I listen to, claiming that the best rock n roll was created when he was my age. But finally I have found an album that we both love listening to. Although this band has become really trendy, I think that alone is a horrible reason not to like their music. It's just good rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great effort","review":"The White Stripes are very smart. They understand that good rock music doesn't have to be some huge feat of enginneering. Two people can be more powerful than overrated bands such as Creed, Nickleback, and \\"nu-metal\\". The album has quite a few tracks, but some are filler that should have been taken out. If this CD was shorter, it would have been better. That is a small consideration however, since you can just skip them to get to the good stuff: \\"Dead Leaves..\\", \\"Hotel Yorba\\", \\"Fell in Love with a girl\\", and \\"Finding it Harder to be a gentleman\\". There a couple others that are good in the end of the album too, with their guitarist showing some skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"The White Stripes f_ _ _ing rule!","review":"I'll make this short and simple. If you have heard the two singles off this album (\\"Fell in Love With A Girl\\" \\"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\\")and you liked them, buy this album, you won't be dissapointed. It's the best album I've heard this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"the first rock cd ive bought in a looong time","review":"simple and simply nice. a few songs are horrid!!

If you gotta be the coolest kid in vintage clothes on the block, then this is the album for YOU!Jack and Meg make bass-less, message-less, and spirit-less loud garage rock. Saviors of rock and roll, I think not.\\"Fell In Love With A Girl\\" gets stuck in your head, and that's not necessarily a good thing. Singing along makes you sound like an epileptic at a discoteque.\\"The Union Forever\\" and \\"Hotel Yorba\\" save this from utter uselessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its worth it","review":"Im, sure by now at least every music fan has heard at least one song from this album. If you did and didnt like it we know im not going to change your mind so why try? but to those who havent i highly recomend it. It's just an amazing disc i'll admit at first i was Hesitant in whether or not to by it, then i slipped it into my cd player and just hearing the opening riff to dead leaves and the dirty ground....its a fantastic disc and i highly recomend it to any one who doesnt have it i mean come on have i ever steered you wrong? just take a risk and pick it up its worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Find","review":"I heard \\"Fell in Love with a Girl\\" on the radio and I thought that it sounded like The Hives, which was good. When I bought the album and gave my first listen, I didn't know what to think. I was expecting a punk rock album, and \\"White Blood Cells\\" is anything but a punk album. It's just so varied that I wasn't even sure how to feel about it. However, all it took was one more listen to get me hooked. If you're tired of corporate rock with its slicked over sound and over-production, give this album a listen. It's raw sounding... the way rock music is supposed to sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"friggin rock","review":"the only problem I had with this albulm was not being able to play it loud enough. If you like the sound of Led zep., Black Sabbath, Queen, T rex, mixed with strung out garrage rock and good modern lyric, get it. These two are a whole of sound, there's nothing I hate more than buying an albulm and then finding every song sounding the same, it friggin pisses me off but the Whites know about exploring the limits of their medium. This is what its all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Reccomended!!","review":"Personally, I loved this album. It's just great in my opinion. Jack's vocals and guitar and Meg's simple drumming blend in a way that seems perfect. I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I love all kinds of music, and this is an okay album, but there are and have been much better garage rock bands. Most of them never make the national scene. The White Stripes seem to have caught because of their personal style (I dig the whole red and white thing too), but it's not as great as the hype would have you believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a band willing to do something fresh","review":"White Blood Cells gets back to basics. It sounds like it was heavly influenced by the 60s and 70s greats. Beatles, Stones, Zepplin, it's all in there. Every song has its own flare and it never has the all to common problem of one song blending in with the next. I can't wait to see these guys live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal","review":"Sometimes you listen to an album and you know the band spent months and months recording it, and it has tons of complex layering and great production, and no soul. Even great bands can put out records like that. And then there's records like this one. This is the White Stripes at their purest. No polish - just great, great songs. I think this is their showpiece album. It is the most varied in terms of styles - from power chord rock (Dead Leaves) to country (Hotel Yorba) to punk (Fell in Love with a Girl) and, of course, lots of blues. But whatever style they play, Jack White can do it all. He is a songwriting genius - he is a white-hot (pardon the pun) talent who is better than pretty much anyone else out there now, and you get the sense that he can just get out of bed in the morning and write a bunch of them before breakfast.If he pulled together a real band to record this album, it probably would have gone double platinum. But it wouldn't have been as much fun as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I think I smell a Rat\\"","review":"This attempt at presenting us with the anti Britney/Nsync, only gives us another indication as to why the music industry is suffering. My wife bought me this CD knowing I'm into pop rock groups like Supergrass and early Kinks. The Hit: \\"Fell in love with a girl\\" reminded her of these Brit groups, with it's straight ahead rock/raw sound. This tune is pretty cool & catchy, But a complete album (16 tracks) built around 1 single tune that's only 2 minutes long???? (40 minutes total). Unfortunatley The rest of the album left lot to be desired. The CD is not bad, in fact overall I'd say its OK, but I can't listen to it front-to-back.After several listenings there is a sameness, in a bad way, that gets old really quick. I know that it's the toned down rawness that's \\"cool\\" about the White Stripes, but here it tends to sound almost contrived and \\"gimmicky\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped trash","review":"Anyone who thinks this is honestly good music must be in denial.The critics and music elitists have been desperately grasping for straws in this stale era of music and have finally found something they can hold on too, Mod rock, neo rock, garage revival, whatever you want to call it. But they are kidding themselves. The white stripes are simply a bland tribute to the velvets and ramones with a twist of \\"blues\\". They are not accomplished musicians, they dont even have a bass player. They sound like they wrote this album in 15 minutes after listening to a kinks or stones album. Please i urge you not to give in to the false hype and instead listen to good indie bands like pavement or jon spencer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is dreadful!","review":"This whole album sounds like two drunk teenagers got together and jammed in their garage.

The cynic in me didn't want to buy the disc, so I borrowed it from a friend. And my expectations were fulfilled. This disc is NOT worth all the hype it's getting from the music press. Sure, it is stripped down rock/blues music. But it can't be called anything new, or even an improvement on what came before... This White Stripes disc is boring to me.

In a golden era of music it would barely rate as a footnote. Since we are currently in such a bleak period of music, any little blade of grass that pokes up through the slag heap is greeted with tremendous acclaim, just for being a little blade of grass. I do not hear much genuine talent here, or potential for making future good music. This album seems to mean a lot to some people, and I am glad for them, but I think that this emperor has no clothes.

This means that they 'made it' in the business: everyone, starting from MTV loves them). If you ask me, the only thing I would love from 'The White Stripes' is the drummer, and not because of her drum playing. Sincerely, this is music destined to two kinds of people: A) boyfriends whose girlfriends love Britney Spears; B) 10 to 25 years old pink \\"Powerpuff Grrrrls\\" (see Kelly Osbourne).

Read this book in three days, couldn't put it down. It is a sorta hybrid between the classic sci-fi of Assimov and the more modern concepts in this day and age of A.I.The story seemed fresh and new and I loved the fact that it is obvious the author did some research and put some thought behind his sci-fi, so the worldbuilding has the 'feel' of being real which is very important to me.

And the writing doesn't get any better from there on out. This cringe-inducing prose could perhaps be overlooked if the book offered up new ideas, or even fresh (or at least exciting) takes on old ideas, but it does neither, instead spending 400+ pages recycling time-worn SF cliches about self-replicating machines, rogue AI, and humankind (of course) being a little too smart for its own good.This is the sort of work that gives Science Fiction a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential without follow-through","review":"Ballantyne took some basic ideas that have been explored before, and twisted them together in an interesting way.

The only improvement I would say the game needs is some of the board comes apart when you are playing on thick carpet. If you play on a table, it probably does not do this. Anyhow, it's not a big deal and it snaps back together. Another great game from Cranium!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cranium Balloon Lagoon","review":"When I first purchased this product I was pleased. My grandson had received it as a gift for one of his birthdays and the children and I enjoyed playing it. That is why I wanted one for my home.We have only played it about 4 times and the musical timer broke; the game board does not stay together very well (unless you have it on a smooth surface - not carpeting); and the stickers come off the game pieces. The box is not sturdy enough nor does it pack away well. I paid too much for it and could not even find a contact address to write the manufacturer about the timer. The children ask about it but I tell them it is broken. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! It is a shame company's do not take pride in their products to make them durable. It was not man-handled by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivering the promise...","review":"Romantic, sappy, and of course dream inspiring.

You could close your eyes and and be transported to below the city as Catherine was and feel you were there in person listening to Vincent. I had fogotten how beautiful the soundtrack and readings were until I listened to the CD for the first time in at least 12 years. Thank you so much!!!!

How could it not...it is so personal, so touching, and so healing in every way...nothing but a total class act. I too have a \\"worn out\\" cassette (I actually wore two of them out) and so I am happy to find the CD version. I did pay quite a bit more once to someone on eBay, too...that's how much I have loved this since the late 80's. I am also thrilled that FINALLY the entire series, the only one of its kind, has been released on DVD...I know a lot of people begged, pleaded and signed a lot of petitions. They heard us!!

When I first listened to it-not having any idea what they'd put on here from the show, the most beautiful music started up and then \\"Vincent\\" started reading the poetry that he read to Catherine and that made me fall in love with his character -eventually, well, the tears just quietly flowed from my eyes, surprised me! I wasnt aware of crying till the tears flowed from the pure beauty of the sounds from this CD. All these years later, I still treasure and love this CD above all my others, it gives you a sense of peace too and the poems bring understanding of true love. I highly recommend it!!

I love it, and you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's So Romantic!","review":"There's no doubt this review is tinted by my adoration of the show that inspired this recording. Vincent - or at least a man who embodied Vincent's gently heroic sensibilities - figured largely in many a dream during the run of the show. So to have a recording featuring his warm voice reading some of the most romantic verse ever written, with the added bonus of music from the show, is pure genius in my book! If you loved the show, you'll love this recording. It's that simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast...No guidance","review":"I was a practitioner of yoga many years ago in my 20's and 30's. At 52 I decided to start practicing again. I purchased the Yoga Zone beginners set with four videos and love it. However, they are all 55 minute sessions. There are times when a short session would be advantageous, so I purchased this video. It is an enormous disappointment. There are virtually no instructions, and when there are, by the time you figure out what is being asked, she is on to the next pose. I wind up feeling stressed and out of synch. Pass on this one, and go straight to the Yoga Zone. I'm still looking for a shorter but good yoga tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rocket Speed Yoga","review":"I was originally only purchasing a YogaKids tape when I saw this \\"Gentle Yoga\\" tape. So without any research, I purchased this tape. Instead of being a relaxing 30 minutes, the host rushes the viewer from pose to pose and all the while she constantly says breath in and breath out- she also doesn't say whether you should be breathing through the nose or mouth.Finally, the picture quality of the tape was grainy. Save your money or at least find another tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!!!","review":"There is nothing about this video that is worth bothering with.

Although the \\"Gentle Yoga\\" tape was supposed to offer modifications, it really didn't - Ivanhoe's tape did. And Deason's tape was too fast! One pose after another without explanations, warnings or suggestions. I felt like I was playing catch up during the whole tape, which is NOT conducive to relaxation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT for Beginners","review":"I have purchased other videos from this company and been extremely pleased with them. That's why I decided to buy this tape for my sister when she inquired about video recommendations to start a yoga practice. Fortunately I tried it out before sending it on to her. I never did. It is definitely not for beginners. I have had a regular yoga practice for three years and it was too much for me. I found the verbal cuing impossible to follow. And it is highly undesireable, if not impossible, to have to constantly look up at the tv screen while trying to do yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"this is a great cd it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd areTracks1.

But NO, it drags on... and on... and ON!And please, enough with the \\"Sophisticated Country Boy\\" routine. Kid Rock tried that, had his moments, and now where is the Kid?

Unfortunetly though, I bought this cd based on the singles that I had heard and even though I saw the \\"parental warning\\" I had no idea about the hidden soundtrack. I was so excited to buy this cd . I listened to it twice and really liked most of the songs, even the first rap song was o.k. although not my favorite. Because of the time lapse on the last track (and the fact that the cover didn't mention it unless you read the small print) I totally missed this last song. My teenage son was the one to find it and point it out to me. He is so great on most of his songs, I wish he would leave the explicit words out. Otherwise I will continue to follow his work, he has a lot to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drifting Away","review":"Like most people here, I got this CD for Drift Away, which is a fantastic cover. The other songs on here aren't bad, either. Uncle Kracker is a much better singer than one would expect from his Kid Rock roots. i even ike his rap/rock combo style. That's a big compliment considering I am not a fan of most rap music. The only draeback is the hidden track. It was vulgar apparently just for the sake of being vulgar. It kept this thing from geting five stars. I don't see wh Uncle Kracker feels the need to put such tracks on his CDs to earn his stripes. His vocal talents are more than enough to sell CDs without a parental advisory sticker to attract attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kracker 2","review":"I'm not an Uncle Kracker fan.

Some people may find \\"Letter to My Daughters\\" on the sappy side, but I think it reflects the true feelings of a father who has to spend a lot of time on the road. Most of the songs have a bit of a country feel to them, but even non-fans of country music will enjoy this artist's great vocals and his musicians' top-notch playing. Go! Buy!

I could see where this might be dangerous if you were to need to put any of your weight on the stroller while jogging, especially since the brakes are on the front wheel. I have since looked at other jogger strollers, and they don't seem to have this problem. My husband and I are safety engineers and agree that this can be an unsafe product.

I use the straps, but I think she is a little too small for them. She does seem comfortable; every time we go walking she is quickly put to sleep.

Crude, bawdy (and sometimes rather explicit !) \\"Restoration\\" encaptured the essence of the period in such an interesting, yet informative way. The book traces the life of Robert Merivel and his path to maturity and understanding. A fall from grace forces Merivel to leave behind a life of idle luxury and face up to responsibility. His character is presented realistically and exquisitely - even at his most detestable we cannot help sympathising with him. Everything in this book was perfect - the plot, the character development and the representation of the period.

Let me say, this cd is rather interesting. At first listen, Atomic Ritual seems like a another pop rock cd, but multiple listenings reveal the quality of the disc. Sure, some songs do not seem to go anywhere, but some are shimmering with genious. The opener is an awesome song. The lead build up with is an agressive intro. It feels as if you are being pulled through a black hole at warp speed. Nebula takes some time to calm and creates some mellow moments. One of them, Fin, is a rather peaceful instrumental that shows that the band has a flair for melody. Nebula is a great band, although there are defintely other cds worth getting. At times they do not seem to be all original. Still, if you are a fan of Kyuss or even Queens of the stone Age, then Atomic Ritual may be right up your alley. In a time where music like this gets little recognition, Nebula is a welcome addition to anyone's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great listen.","review":"This is really kickass music! Though Nebula doesn't get the brass ring for originality, quality space rock like this just doesn't exist in comparable quality today. It's not slow, plodding, sludgy stoner rock, but spacey, energetic stoner rock/metal. Is there a difference? You bet! Just listen. The rhythms and baselines are tight, the drumming very strong, and the effervescent soloing addictively layered through each song. The songs kick along at a good pace, feeling a little like a heavier 70's Deep Purple, and make for a very enjoyable listening experience; especially with headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke 2nd time used","review":"Grip 14 Gauge Electric Shears UL & CULused this tool twice results were a bolt in the head broke (holds the cutting blades) and part of the head has cracked probably from the stress of the broken bolt.

If you watch the other dancers behind her, they all seem confused as well. I was initially interested because the workout is split into three shorter sessions. This really appealed to me as I am often pushed for time. Unfortunately, the workout is so light that one has to do all three to really get a decent sweat going.

GREAT SERVICE, Amazon!!!Please keep in mind that some combinations of burners and discs work better than other combinations, so maybe these will work for you.

The RiData DVDs would NOT PRINT on this printer. Strange, huh! Anyway, the RiData were the only brand that my printer rejected.

Cats will not consistently eat them.

Not with a ten foot pole!!!!!!!!","review":"This facinating volume of amatuer photography taken in the brothels of 1970's Boystown in Mexico asks far more questions than it answers. Yet even the most voyueristic among us probably wouldn't want the answers to most of the questions posed by these pictures. You may need a shower and a breath mint by the time you are done reading/gazing at this tome! I want to highly reccommend this book, but I'm not sure to whom. There is little if anything erotic about it. The photography itself has an understated style to it but is clearly amatuerish. I suppose if you are facinated with the photographic subjects of Diane Arbus, as I am, you will be drawn into the pages of Boystown. This book is not about how the other half lives. In fact it seems like another planet to me. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! This book is NOT for beginners.","review":"Unless you are already very familiar with photgraphy terms and techniques, you are buying a lot of frustration and wasting your time and money. The author many time talks as if he is talking to another professional photographer. For example the author did not explain by a simple diagram what he means by 'angle of the subject from the sun' or 'exposing off the ground' or 'exposing off the sky'. Before start using many photography terms in the book, the author does not define or explain terms like exposure compensation, flash fill mode,etc. or at least does not explain clearly. The author wastes a lot of paragraphs on useless talk that is rather obvious or does not add to the understanding of the subject matter. This is dangerous to the poor trees that get cut.

And, I felt the \\"inside knowledge\\" everyone had about the \\"certain women\\" was barely shared, and I felt left out of the action. To perform if, a lot of stamina would be needed for the actors and actresses, as this is a lengthy play with full costumes and quick dialogue. For audience members, I'd say you need the Cliffs Notes for this time in history, and a great attention span.

Considering how truly terrible the Vienna Symphon(Pro Musica) was in the Westminster era, you have to tiptoe carefully indeed to avoid some real train wrecks. Even the Vienna Staatsoper orchestra, which is supposed to be composed of members of the Vienna Philharmonic, was veyr raggedy in those days. This is a breakneck Eroica performed without much technical finesse, yet among Scherhcen's Beethoven readings, it is typical in both respects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speed kills.","review":"\\"SPEED KILLS\\" is a common slogan in road-safety campaigns around the world. It is also an apt metaphor for the way Scherchen has conducted these two Beethoven symphonies. It's as if they had been recorded immediately after a telephone call from Mrs. Scherchen admonishing her husband not to be late yet again for dinner.The majesty, the idealism and the passion of the \\"Eroica\\" are not totally absent, but they have been pushed into the background by relentless speed and directionless energy. The same can be said for the charm, the color and the lyricism of the \\"Pastorale\\".These idiosyncratic performances are lively enough, but they suffer from a lack of soul--that most outstanding of Beethoven's qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexplainable Beethoven \` s readings!","review":"Hermann Scherchen was in a very special day when decided to record these Beethoven Symphonies: I have never listened them previous or later played with such urgency sense; a true greyhound race. The tempos are hyper fast, without expression and colour, the artistic gamut of his talent shone by its absence. Both works are pregnant of lightness and character that seem have recorded as a proof of works Anti Beethoven.Go for any other recording unless you are collector of weird versions, I bought this CD but the only fact to make a gift of it would be to offence that friend.Maybe this is the worst artistic register of Scherchen.

It's perhaps the most boring film I've ever seen. Period. If it wasn't for the cast, which includes a good number of my favorites, this film might have received one star from me and a much more stinging review. There is no doubt that the relative slowness of the movie was to paint a more accurate portrayal of small town life, but how does that explain the poor dialogue? For someone who is about to move to LA I never got much feeling of excitement from Breckin Meyer. The friend who's father ran a ranch(can't remember his name) had a story which was very poorly characterized. Maybe it's me but this film nearly drove me to tears it was so dull.

And for the best Breckin Meyer check out the movie Go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurry up and leave...so I can turn this off!","review":"Okay, I will admit that there were a few scenes here that touched me...but those heartwarming moments aside this movie is extremely dull and slow moving and really has no merit whatsoever. It's the coming of age story of four young men who graduate high school with plans on leaving town, a promise they made to each other that only one of the boys even wants to keep. This causes problems for them, fights ensue and then there's a happy ending. The problem is that getting to that happy ending is so boring. Nothing happens that holds your interest. I mean, I never really 'want' to turn off a movie, mostly so I can finish and write me opinion, but I was struggling to care about this movie. The young actors are a good bunch, but the script they were given doesn't allow you to care much for them. If you're gonna have a movie full of slow moving conversation at least make them talk about something we wanna hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try. Good locale. No return trip planned.","review":"I was looking for a 'small' film filled with goodcharacters. The premise was enough, fine with me. 4 guys in a smalltown trying to decide if they will move on to the big city. You don't need much of a plot if the characters are good. The comic relief character is not well written and directed without restraint. The Robin Williams-Jar Jar Binks like character doesn't cut it. It even weakens the main premise. The other 3 main characters are surprisingly serious about their futures and that makes it interesting. But it is unlikely that they would take this idiot to the big city with them. They tried to mix pathos and slapstick in one character and it didn't work. My advice-- take that character and go against the stereotype somehow, please. Either make him smart and clumsy or dumb but hard-working ( a paper route in a town of 81 can't be hard work). Maybe give him a girlfriend.

It ran in theatres for about a week, then disappeared. It didn't have explosions, car chases, sex or violence. This was the first feature that Tim McCanlies made. And then he did \\"Secondhand Lions.\\" If you like great scenery and a great screenplay (also written by McCanlies) this is the movie for you. I only wish that more movies were being made like this and that more people would go out to see them. It has a very small and talented cast, Breckin Meyer, Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry, Eddie Mills and Ashley Johnson. It was made in my favorite place in Texas, the Davis Mountains. It was an independent film picked up by Tristar. Look for it next time you are in a video store.

They are the epitome of funeral metal, following and perfecting the legacy of dISEMBOWELMENT, the creators of this genre.

Sorry to get all poetic about it, but listening to Evoken really does create an enlightened feeling.Similar bands include Shape of Despair, Mournful Congregation, and Remembrance, to name a few. Also, Evoken has a newer album called \\"Antithesis of Light.\\" It is another must-have for funeral metal lovers.

The main character, played by Mary Loise Parker, buys weed from Black people and still has an aura of arrogance when she goes to their house to resupply. And God forbid they should get busted---she would be guaranteed to get a platinum deal from the prosecutor's office.

Is it a comedy that is not funny or a drama without any emotional connection with the viewers? The lines are predictable, the characters underdeveloped, and the premise very weak.

This cuts off the left and right side of the picture. If you have an old set, maybe it won't matter to you, but the default for DVDs is widescreeen anamorphic which allows the DVD player to show old screen format just fine for old TVs, or the full beautiful 16:9 picture for new DVDs.

There I found scratches unlike any I had ever seen before, you could feel them running your fingers on them. they were really bad and deep. My guess is this is a factory flaw, because this disc came super sealed (sideways and up and down) and the disc was in it's place safe and secure.

I figured what the heck and from the pilot episode to the end of the first season, I simply could not stop watching- I stayed up all night! The show reveals what veils suburban America hides behind, and to a certain extent, what it's hiding. More insightful- and more fun- than Desperate Housewives, this is what Kevin Spacey might well have done with American Beauty if he'd been working in a series format. The entire cast is uniformly excellent and colorful- it's as if I had described a bunch of my old buddies to the producers. There is more real America here than all of reality tv put together. I ordered the rest of the available seasons the moment the menu came up showing that I'd sat through every episode. I hope they're this good! Warning!

It begs the question, \\"Is there really a place like this?, knowing well that the writers might have patterned the series after a place and people (with some exaggerations) they had actually experienced. As indicated by my title, it is fun, it is something that could really happen to a young widow finding, suddenly, that she has to try to afford her two young sons the lifestyle to which they had become accustomed, basically just trying to make ends meet, missing having a father/husband around.

Skipping tedious exposition, Weeds dives straight into the messy, complicated lives of its messy, complicated characters. It's funny, it's moving, it's bittersweet.

It's also what's scary.

It should probably be listed as fiction rather than non-fiction since it is so misleading in the way it sensationalizes the two divers with no real truth to back up the claims.Instead of wasting your time and money on this book I would recommend reading Gary Gentile's new book \\"Shadow Divers Exposed\\" since it proves to be an enlightening revelation on Kurson's fictional rendition telling the real account of the U-869. Gentile's book is an excellent expos�� of not only the history of the U-boat war, but also the actual events, which led to the demise, search and identification of the U-869."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor at Best","review":"This author fills the book with needless details. He makes a hero out of Bill Nagle, the captain of the dive boat, a hopeless alcoholic who should have had his master's license revoked years before three people were lost to this wreck. With the exception of John Chatterton, the only diver who seemed competent, you were listening to a story of people who had death wishes. The fact that the Coast Guard had to send rescue helicopters to save this collection of incompetents baffles the imagination. The author presents as fact details of several occurrences happening 50 years ago; hard to believe. Creativity at its best - and this book is classed as nonfiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fatal flaw","review":"This a fascinating story which is generally well-told, but the whole reading experience is marred by an excessive amount of profanity. Maybe some people talk like this, particularly in the diving profession, but the story could have been told without subjecting the rest of us to it. Check out the DVD instead (\\"Hitler's Lost Sub\\"); there you can enjoy the story without being covered in vile language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"This book reads well but the story isn't really that compelling when one steps back and examines it. Just about everyone in the diving community knew about this sub, so this is not an \\"untold story.\\" This is a classic example of the industry creating \\"buzz\\" on one of the books it determines will break out.

It's an easy read.However, I cannot recommend this book to anyone because of the author's frequent inclusion of profanity and obscene language by those who have never learned which end of their body is provided for defacation, so they use both ends. This potty-mouth language is totally unnecessary and is like a decomposing, dead rat in an otherwise bowl of delicious stew."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Account of Deep Wreck Diving","review":"I first read this book after hearing raves about the story from my Dad. I too couldn't stop thinking and bragging to people about what a great story this book tells. I recently bought this book for my boyfriend for Christmas...he finished the book in 4 days, with nothing but good things to say about it. Although we both are avid scuba divers, one does not need to have experience in this area, it is well written for anyone to enjoy! The book also provides a very unique perspective and accountof World War II. I highly reccomend this book to anyone interested in a great story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping tale of discovery, courage, and friendship.","review":"Ive seen Robert Kurson develop as a writer, so I was intrigued by his latest effort, Shadow Divers. His lofty reputation was certainly reflected in this masterful recount of the discovery of a German U-Boat just off the Jersey Shore. I care little about U-Boats, World War II, and diving, but I cared immensely about the heroes of this story, Chatterton and Kohler. Their courage, determination and compassion are great lessons for divers and landlubbers alike. Kurson's dominant theme of discovery transcends the physical into the spiritual and metaphysical, as his book transcends typical non-fiction into a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure!","review":"This is a thrilling real adventure of two extremely brave blokes. Only the ones who are actually into Scuba Diving know how crazy and audacious these people were to dive in conditions like those and with that primitive equipment. I'm only 21 but it makes me want to go back in time and experience what they felt when they were doing that. Furthermore, that drove me even further into wreck diving and exploring new places with rustic equipment. These days I'm even diving with a set of gear that my mates say it's absolutely crazy, I'm gonna get killed and so on. Thank you so much John Chatterton, Richie Kohler and Robert Kurson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book was recommended by a coworker.

A quick read, with significant twists and turns.

Get out your shades, crawl into the backyard hammock and indulge. It delivers a nice punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diving Ambitions","review":"Robert Kurson's Shadow Divers, is about deep sea divers exploring a sunken shipwreck. It is an exciting and spelling binding account of real-life divers and a real-life mystery. It is a window into the deep waters of the ocean and the deeper mind of men and their quests for adventure and truth.I generally do not read non-fiction and therefore generally do not enjoy it when I do. However Shadow Divers reads like a fiction novel. There were many times I had to remind myself that these were ordinary real life people with families and jobs. It is fascinating to read about how a quest can take control of your life how you can be compelled to do something so dangerous knowing there could be dire consequences yet not being able to let that quest go. For those who know little about diving this is a great read and insight into the world of deep sea wreckage diving."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCUBA as only a few can experience it","review":"I am a SCUBA diver and love adventure. This book takes you to the bottom with the divers and inside their heads as they explore for the identity of the U-Who? It brought to me a new appreciation for the dangers of diving, especially wreck diving at extreme depths. But, it also told the story of the divers and their motivations and brought the skeletons buried in the U-Who alive. An exciting and touching novel. Well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting adventure and history","review":"This is a great book-on-tape - it's got history, adventure, tragedy, success, and personal relationships all in the right proportions. You won't want to stop listening until the characters complete their obsessive search for the identity of the submarine they find on the ocean floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Could not put this one down.

I loved the book and so did my wife (who uncharacteristically, simply would not put it down)Let me just add two things:First, while completely captivating the reader by the true-life mystery of the sunken boat, the author also reveals what it means to be truly defined by our vocation, a sub-plot that speaks to all of us.Second, do you need to have an interest in wreck-diving to appreciate this book? HELL NO!!! The writing is both entertaining in telling the story and downright lyrical when Kurson wants us to personally experience the unknown and surreal. (P.32 -\\"Shipwreck interiors can be terrifying places...\\") When is the next book coming???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow Divers","review":"Excellent, can't put it down true story.Shadow Divers: The True Adventure of Two Americans Who Risked Everything to Solve One of the Last Mysteries of World War II"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Interesting Book","review":"It was just a riveting book, building on the story, mystery, characters and history surrounding the ship. Would highly recommend. I sat and read it straight through for 8 hrs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down--and that's the problem!","review":"I wanted to read this book for several reasons--I live in New Jersey, I'm of German descent, and I've developed an appreciation for WWII history through being force-fed the Hitler Channel by my husband. I didn't expect the book to be terribly time-consuming, as I'm usually a fast reader. However, the detailed description sucked me in and slowed me down considerably.Finally, after I'd spent most of a day reading (when I really shouldn't have) toward the end of the book it was mentioned that Nova had done a documentary on the topic.If you have the time to savor the images your mind will conjure up... If you want to read about the divers' childhoods and marital problems... If you really want to know the gory details of how an alcoholic ship captain died... then read the book.If you just want the basics of the story, I recommend watching Nova's show on VHS (soon out on DVD), called Hitler's Lost Sub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure in deep waters","review":"I very much liked \\"Shadow Divers\\". It is written for people who love diving, professional divers and most of all for people who have no idea about diving.The contents are personal combined with history mystery and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing story","review":"I personally am not a scuber diver, but you don't need to be a diver to appreciate this fascinating story. I read this book in less than 2 days because I could not put it down. I bet you will do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely enchanting","review":"This book was a recommendation from my father, who used to watch the TV show \\"Deep-Sea Detectives.\\" While I never really paid much attention to the show, I gave this book a chance. I'm so glad I did! I'd only had a mild interest in shipwrecks before and this book really changed that. There is nothing I love more than reading a non-fiction book that reads like a novel. It was very well-researched and very well-written. All I wanted to do was read this book, whether I had the free time or not. I was sad to put this book down when I finished. It launched me into a spree of reading other wreck-diving books (all of which were wonderful).A fantastic read! I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling narrative and a gripping story","review":"I have never been a fan of WWII history, let alone naval history. Nor am I a diving enthusiast. But the story and struggle of discovering and identifying a German submarine only 100 miles off the New Jersey coast was fascinating. I could have done with a bit less biographical information on some of the people involved (did I really have to know all about their childhoods?) but the twists, turns and dead ends make up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent, Suspenseful Read!","review":"I saw all the positive reviews on this book so decided to take a chance on it even though I'm not really into diving, WWII history, or German Submarines. Despite this, the book really grabbed and has a very compelling mystery story that really gripped me. I couldn't put it down and lost sleep trying to learn what happened next. There is a very good story contained within the cover which revolves around some very dedicated divers trying to learn the mystery of a lost, sunken sub. The suspense of dangerous diving missions had me holding my breath as divers were nearly trapped or killed while diving. Take a chance...this is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for a diving enthusiast","review":"I bought this book as a gift to my older brother, who works as a commercial diver in the Gulf of Mexico. He really enjoyed it. Definitely a good choice for a well seasoned recreational or commercial diver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story about bravery and persistence.","review":"A captivating story about bravery and persistence. Also learned a lot about deep sea diving; it is a different world down there. With all the beauty and wonder, there is also danger. I believe everyone will enjoy this true story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention N.Y. Times Bestsellers List: Make Room!!!","review":"The world's greatest fiction authors would be hard-pressed to top Robert Kurson's Shadow Divers, a breath-taking depiction of the true tale of American ship-wreck divers who discovered an actual W.W. II German U-boat sunken off the coast of New Jersey. Once you pick this book up, the pages turn themselves, your fingers mere passengers helplessly submitting to the momentum of page after page of Kurson's gripping story. (A word to the wise: Don't attempt to read and eat at the same time with this book, you don't have enough hands!) If it didn't actually happen as Kurson has told it, through the eyes of lead divers John Chatterton and Richie Kohler, you would swear it had to have been made up. When the Hollywood types get their hands on this one, they will thank their lucky stars they didn't have to create it, because they couldn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"Bought it on a whim having no real interest in wreck diving or even scuba diving. It's one of the best whim purchases I've ever made. This book reads like a suspense novel and I couldn't put it down. The story alone is facinating, and Kurson's presentation makes for a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read that should appeal to a wide audience.","review":"This is an extremely well written book that is both gripping and educational. You get a glimpse into a relatively unknown adventure sport as well as into the lives of sailors on a German U-boat. Those who liked Ship of Gold should really enjoy this. Don't assume you have to have an interest in diving or boating. I don't. This is a fun book you will care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books I've Ever Read","review":"I don't read much non-fiction, but I could not put this book down. After reading a review in a publication, I sought out this book and couldn't stop reading until I was done, and even now, I think of it often. It was one of the most thrilling and well-written books I've ever read and I cannot say enough about it. I found my heart pulsing right along with the divers' harrowing experiences. A beautiful book and real-life adventure that I will recommend to everyone I know. I will also seek out more information on Chatterton and Kohler - what amazing men they are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You are immersed!","review":"A wonderful book! So well written, you feel you know the main characters (Chatterton, Kohler, and Nagle) as well as you know your own friends, as you follow the ups and downs of their personal lives, their thoughts and emotions when performing hazardous exploratory dives, and their intense scrutiny of the minutia of historical U-Boat records (both accurate and inaccurate). There is suspense in the diving as well as a fascinating mystery to be solved. And I learned more than I ever thought I would (as a virtual non-swimmer) about the nuts, bolts, and dangers of deep-sea diving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Spoiler","review":"This book would be excellent if it was classfied as fiction. Gary Gentile's \\"Shadow Diver's Exposed\\" shows the utter disregard for truth and literary accuracey. Gentile cites hard facts and research. Shadow Diver's is filled with drama and embellishment.I originally read the book and was captivated by it. It reads well and is a good story, but it is just that, a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Yes they identified the U-Who. But they so embellished the rest of the story that another author needed to come out and expose it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I was eager to read this book and couldn't even finish reading it. The author goes on and on about very ordinary men with a dangerous hobby as if they are incredible heroes. Even the loser, alcoholic captain with no redeeming value is given the hero treatment. This constant drama about the divers with very uninteresting lives made the book impossible to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Fiction","review":"Great read - for fiction. It's too bad the author either had to embellish the story, or was given inaccurate information. Too many people have stepped up to dispute the accounts of this tale to consider this story as \\"true\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diving book that lacks depth","review":"I bought this book expecting to read thrilling accounts of the search for this WWII submarine. What I found was an non-stop endless focus on the dangers of diving, some fascinating insight in to what drove these men to undertake such a dangerous adventure and page afer mind-numbing page of boring background details on the key players. Unfortunately,that makes for extremely slow reading, with little sizzle to keep the reader focused on the book. That also led to 356 pages (in my paperback version) that desperately need editing to keep the pace flowing. At times I was left wondering if the author was getting paid by the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner","review":"I picked up this book due to an interest in World War II and found myself staying up late to see what happened next. The look into the world of wreck divers is fascinating while the determination of Cullerton and Kohler is inspiring. I think anyone interested in the Second World War, submarines, diving, adventure, or real-life drama would love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"Well written book about interests and obsession, both the good and bad aspects! Riveting! Reads like a Clive Cussler novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Engrossing Read","review":"Shadow Divers is an engrossing read, one you'll find hard to put down. It tells the story of two men and their friends who devoted years of their lives to discover the truth about a sunken U-Boat off the coast of New Jersey. The story is compelling, interesting and well-written and, unlike many works like this, does not contain an outrageous number of filler and asides to make the story a book and not just an over long magazine piece. It's a quick read--a perfect beach read given the setting. The story it tells is fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to stop reading!","review":"This book gripped me from the beginning. A real historical mystery unfolding in the lives of regular folks. I loved the descriptions of wreck diving and all the dangers inherent in that too. Had I not read this book I would've never known about how hard deep sea diving is.The author is quite a story-teller and lays out the story in a way that will keep you turning pages.I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from a non-mariner","review":"As someone who knows next to nothing about the subjects of this book (deep wreck diving and U-boats), I was absolutely fascinated by this work. The author's writing is first-rate and the plot of this true story was very well layed out. I highly recommend this book if you appreciate good writing and a true \\"mystery of history\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality trumps fiction any time","review":"Compelling reading that keeps you immersed throughout the pages and makes you crave for more. You want to go out and rent Das Boot and Hunt for Red October after reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"The writing standard is excellent, however, it is the subject matter that torpedos this book. Too much is written about the very sad deaths of three divers, including a Father and Son team. Since the US Navy views 130 feet depth as the maximum safe depth for scuba diving, then to dive over 200 feet to a wrecked WW II relic is clearly very dangerous, even reckless. If you are interested in all the dangers of scuba diving, buy this book. If you are looking for a gripping WW II story, buy the excellent Nova DVD that Shadow Divers is based on:NOVA - Hitler's Lost SubOr, for those looking for a gripping man against the sea story:Adrift: Seventy-six Days Lost at Sea"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Diving Adventure","review":"Anyone who loves a story with mystery and adventure will really enjoy this book!

Probably the fastest I've ever read a book. What a amazing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"As historically important as it is intriguing.","review":"This hard-hitting book puts a face on war, as did Flyboys and Flags of our Fathers. No one has better captured the perils of submarine warfare or deep wreck diving. The reader experiences many gut-wrenching dives in the quest to name this U-boat. Anyone interested in World War II would find this a compelling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"++++","review":"Fascinating, and I did not even particularly desire to dive wrecks. It was my initial dive story read as a new diver and not only intrigued me but taught me a great deal of this world I had got myself into. And inspired further education in the myriad aspects of diving. To my knowledge; the most recommended Dive Book must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, couldn't put it down!","review":"There are already 377 reviews posted here, but I enjoyed this book so much I have to add the 378th. This book is extraordinarily well-written and researched. I found it so exciting that if I stopped reading mid-chapter and went to bed I found myself getting up at 4am to find out what happened next!It doesn't matter if you know or care anything about scuba, U-boats, or wreck diving, you will surely enjoy reading this book. It's one of those books that would make an insanely great movie, but they'd have still have to leave out a ton of fascinating detail unless you did it as a mini-series. A 2-hour movie couldn't hold all this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow Divers","review":"I was on these dives completely in my mind.

The songs are generally upbeat, the music is catchy/punchy, with a well-done modern country rock backup, very memorable melodies and some excellent songwriting. The lyrics tell stories from the point of view of a woman who knows what she wants from life and love, and so her setbacks don't leave her totally down and helpless. Very refreshing!The recording mix is very well balanced, given that the musicians aren't playing to stand out. That's Jo Dee's job, and of course she has an excellent voice for this kind of material. If you like this genre, it's well worth having, an artistic pop gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jo Dee Rocks!","review":"This album is great. I couldn't have picked the songs better myself.

When my coworkers heard it they all said \\"oh wow, she does this song, I LOVE this song!\\" From Heads Carolina, Tails California to Bring on the Rain, this CD is a must have in your collection.

Not to say that she hasn't done some good songs, but this seems to be more of a marketing ploy by her record company than a Greatest hits album.

Not only is the satire right on, but the songs are great. Half the fun is suddenly recognizing a song from my teens (current events are lampooned to the tune of popular songs). My kids keep asking me what's so funny, so they now know more American political dirt than most adults. Anyone who has the least bit of interest in current events should get this C/D. And don't worry- all political parties take a beating. On this one it may seem a little heavy on Bush; go back a few years and they were wiping the floor with Clinton. However, it's so well done, you won't care when they destroy your favorite public figure.

The cat's water consumption nearly doubled after I installed the filter.

The way Tucker and Ellie find each other again and finally have conversations they should have had years earlier is pretty gripping and the reader's emotions are caught very early on in the book. It is well written and well paced. But don't expect a light romance, and have tissues handy, as it's a real tear-jerker. There are things which get resolved a little too easily but hey, it's fiction! In all, this story holds together very very well and is worth the time, but do not expect to feel light-hearted when you've turned the last page. There is a HEA but it is still bittersweet at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"always in my heart","review":"I'm very disappointed that I'm not able to get this title on my kindle!!

Granted, it's kind of cool to have a toy Jesus, but it's not a very good toy. Other than his arms, the figure has no flexibilty whatsoever: his legs are permanently hidden beneath a robe of hard plastic and his head is fixed in a frozen forward gaze. Even though his arms can move, they are only capable of forward and backward motion. Finally, the gliding action feature of the toy (meaning little wheels on the figure's base) is more of an annoyance than anything else. The toy has a coolness factor of a ten (It's Jesus, man), but as a toy it resembles something a kid can get out of one of those claw games."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy for toy kids that love the lord","review":"got it for my grandson he loves the lord he keeps it in the package so it don't get broken thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review","review":"Bilgerats!

It basically has combined four harpsichord suites and three flute/viola de gamba suites into one album. The two sets of pieces have nothing in common other than the composer.

The harpsichord works in particular have tuneful melodies.Nothing earthshattering here, but sometimes you just want to sit back and listen to some good music. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful played harpsichord music","review":"Boismortier suites for harpsichord and for flute.The harpsichord suites are very interesting and played in a beautiful way.The interpretation is accordingly to the baroque rhetoric, the rubati are well done at the right places. A very convincing interpretation.Unfortunately this is not the case for the flauto traverso and the gamba. The interpretation is without passion, non rhetorical and without the use of vibrato like it is described in 18th century sources. It is done in the way 18th century music was played around 1970-1980, it sounds very outdated.Very disappointing if you compare it with baroque flute players like Jed Wentz or Rachel Brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"marine speaker","review":"I was looking for an all-weather speaker upgrade for my new pontoon boat.

Some of The Fixx's best songs are on this album. \\"Sunshine in the Shade\\" was a minor hit, but there are much better songs on this album that were never played on the radio.All of The Fixx's albums are consistently great. Many rock bands have widely varying levels of quality among their albums, but The Fixx seemed to find their trademark atmospheric guitar-and-synth sound right off the bat, and they play it well through all their albums.

Personally, my favorite album by the band is \\"Reach The Beach,\\" but this is a close second. Legend has it that the label rushed the band back into the studio to get another album out, after the wild success of \\"Reach The Beach.\\" It is evident on this disc, but the band is so strong you barely notice it.

At the time, it was a pretty well-mixed medley of original Beach Boys hits from 15 to 20 years earlier, manufactured no doubt to compete with the then-popular \\"Stars On\\" hit single, a medley record of sound-alike musicians and singers covering the Beatles, etc.This CD single is given 4 stars for 2 reasons: first, it's the Beach Boys, so everyone should buy it regardless; also, it's a trivia single, not found on any other CD. It only got 4 stars because it SHOULD have included the 12\\" version of the Medley, as well as the 12\\" Ballad Medley, both of which were released on vinyl in Japan.

The author gives clues early on as to what may happen, which would be good, and they don't. Throughout the book the plot does not seem well thought out and the story does not flow. There were noticeable grammatical and syntax errors, and the author is always writing about things that \\"had\\" happened, rather than speaking in plain past tense. I do not know why I finished reading this book, but when I did, the ending did not seem pulled together, the book seemed lacking from character development. The hero of the book brooded about something the entire book that was explained in one sentence in the end, the heroin was depressed in the last half of the book. Not how I like a heroin to be. Don't waste your time reading this book. It isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful book!","review":"Jeff Berryman's book is a fascinating read about the life of a preacher. I almost felt as though I was intruding as I became privy to the most personal feelings, joys, fears, heartaches, and struggles of the minister who is a man of God, but still a simple man with all the frailties and temptations of all human beings. This insight into the life of a pastor/preacher and his family touched my heart as no book has in a long time. I highly recommend this book to everyone, but especially to anyone who has ever been a member of a church congregation or has ever known a minister. The church members in the book will remind you of some in your own congregation, and the minister's struggle with his feelings and his problems will almost move you to tears. This is a book you'll want to own so that you can pick it up and re-read it whenever you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could honestly say the same....","review":"For me, this is a slow moving depressing book.

He was able to turn me into a person who didn't really care for ska into one who loved it. If it was any band but the Crazy 8's he had introduced us to, I wouldn't have liked it. However, this group is easily one of the greatest of the 80's. Johnny Q, Work or Beer, and Bootyopolis are some of the greatest songs I have ever heard.

Crazy 8s stayed true to their Highly Independent status & went on to record several incredibly great albums, probably the best was \\"Big Live Nut Pack!\\" as these guys were one of the best live bands ever (and I've seen over 300!).

I mean I can see paying 13 dollars for let's say five songs, but this CD only has 3 songs on it, one of them is already on the original, so about the songs, song two is five minutes and is mediocre----I just had an epiphany, I realized that these songs artists put on singles are in fact ones that they have cut from the original releases because they weren't good enough to put on the release, so what do they do with them? Charge 6 dollars a song and sell them as imports, who pays six dollars a song? It must be one hell of a song, anywayz this cd is not worth the money, unless you really really are a collector.

He sure knows his stuff -- but after reading it carefully, my head is hurting and I still have no idea how to do some simple animation in my movie.I understand that Premiere Elements 2 In a Snap is probably more suitable for me -- and for you if you have trouble with books that focus on concept over How To."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Job, Ira!","review":"I picked up this little book only recently, although itwas on the suggested reading list of Chem 334 (OrganicChemistry I) at Portland State U. when I took it there many years ago.This is an informative book and details many practicalsuggestions for those who have struggled to do well.I dig many of Ira's quotations, suchas \\"Those of you who did well in school probably didwell IN SPITE of your work habits, not BECAUSE of them.\\"Strictly for laughs, and so true.

Mr. Rice would be honored. As for not giving Rice credit for writing it, I'm not sure where that information came from but if the reviewer knew anything about Seu Jorge, he would have known that this artist covers Western pop music with a Brazilian spin.Putting all of what I wrote aside, this is a lovely album and the songs are romantic and well played.

They said that \\"DURING A TV PROGRAM CALLED \\"ALTAS HORAS\\", WHILE ANA WAS SINGING THIS SONG, APPEARED BELOW ON TV, THEIR NAMES, AS COMPOSERS.

I didn't buy Scott's \\"troubled teenager\\" character at all because of who MacComber painted him to be in the earlier books. Scott would have talked things out with his family instead of internalizing and running away.The other two stories were good reads especially Promise Me Picket Fences but I felt that the stories moved too quickly and didn't develop characters.

It felt like they got to the middle of the book (which was good up until that point)then decided to end the story. They spent too much time explaining the back story. I had not read the others in the series, therefore the info didn't mean much to me. However if I had read the other books, then I wouldn't have needed all the back story. It would have been better to have more of their story than to get into all of the back story about the other characters.The Glory Girl was a decent read, but I wish there would have been more finality to the story.Promise Me Picket Fences was definitely the best story in the book, good storyline and you didn't feel like the ending left you hanging about the outcome of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I enjoyed this book but then I always enjoy Debbie Macomber books.

In the same way that the early Rolling Stones were influenced by the blues, you can see the connection here.That said, this rocks out as much as the early Rolling Stones music does too.

I wish more bands would just try to make something more interesting instead of sticking with these trends. They have the \\"LOOK\\" down and even the style of music down for the \\"60's FAD ROCK\\" they are going for, but they're just not that good.

The bass is too punchy sounding, the vocals are stretched thin, and the drums, well, the drums are just the drums.

They should change their name to \\"Brown Stripes\\"...you know the ones you find in your underwear....nuff said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fashionable rock with a subversive edge","review":"The most impressive aspect of the White Stripes is that they are able to extract so much sound out of (with a few exceptions) nothing more than a guitar and drum. Beyond that, their stripped-down, sometimes bluesy sound puts emphasis on lyrics that range from nonsensical to caustic. This album takes a bit of getting used to, but has some surprising staying power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living lineage of blues","review":"The White Stripes attract a following of shaggy-haired mockers. For good reason too, this duo shamelessley slides from power-pop (Pretty Good Lookin') to no-holds-barred Louisianna blues (Little Bird), hitting every genre on the r&b lineage. The symbiotic brother-and-sister sound is near perfect, in its scratchy minimalism. Lyrically these kids are tops, pulling the kinds of lines that veteran rockers still strive for. No simple pastiche here, the lyrics have wit and narrative flow. And live, these two are not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I give six stars?","review":"I first got hooked on this CD last year although my dad had it for much longer than that.

There was a guy who wrote a review on the Raconteurs who dissed Brendan Benson while praising White's efforts. While I agree Benson doesn't fit into the Raconteurs, he has more songwriting talent in his little finger than White will ever have. De Stijl may be some people's cup of tea, but I can't in any way see how it could be considered a classic. \\"But it's done with just guitar and bass, man!!!\\"... Yeah.

It's fullscreen, but that's fine since it was fullscreen when it premiered. Don't expect a massive battle scene or action, but the dialogue, footage, and interviews with actual living participants are worth the price of this DVD.

L.J. Smith is incredible enough to pull all of these styles together. Romance, suspense, horror, and tragedy. Secret Circle, with all its intensity, is still one of my all-time favorites. I love the way she displays witches. It takes imigination to think of them that way. Society tends to rely on \\"Glinda the Good Witch\\" or those cackling, emerald countenaces thwarted with warts as witches. L.J.

I really wasn't expecting some of the things that happened, though they may have been right under my nose. I won't say more because I don't want to spoil the book for anyone, but you're going to be surprised.This book, more than the first two, is very complex. Smith really does an excellent job of playing on many of the central themes of most pagan philosophy. The story is woven around the ideas of balance and sort of yin-yang philosophy. Plus, she obviously did her research on stones and herbs (as with the previous novels). The only complaint I really have is that there isn't a fourth book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it was good up till the ending.","review":"After months of waiting for this book to be republished, I wasonly slightly disappointed.

I would have liked to see how things ended up back at school, because Portia was still there and things were kind of at a cliffhanger. I'm not judging L.J.

And to read that everyone in the coven stood behind Cassie and helped her beat the evil lurking in their town.

We all heard the tunes. Just no album. There is a lot of controversy where Coelecanth is concerned. However, for most Producers fans, The Producers just wasn't the same after the departure of Kyle Henderson. Tim Smith is credited with giving the group another direction. This certainly changed the formula that made the Producers such a awesome group. The new direction changed the sound of the group. Coelacanth is frustrating to listen to. You hear the familiar hooks, but then it goes into completely somewhere else. The album is not good nor bad, but at least interesting. Wayne Famous's various keyboard styles are extensive, maybe overly done to cover very weak musical material. Let us be glad the album was not released in 1987. Certainly, it would be disappointing to say the least. Thankfully, the original group got back together, maybe a little too late to save."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coelacanth Ready To Go!","review":"I suppose I could add to all the superb comments about The Producers album Coelacanth.

The viewer is left to ask \\"What is terror to Chomsky?\\" and \\"Whose power, where?\\" and \\"What the heck is this guy getting at?\\" He could clear things up and liven the DVD up and it still would seem bluntly ineffective.

Amantes, on the other hand, is cut from the same cloth; Eres Tu fans will probably enjoy this song as well.The production values were as bad as I've heard on a CD. I don't expect that era to have as clean a sound, but there were also occasional dropouts in a couple of the songs. Very distracting. I am hoping that the original material does not suffer from this.One other thing: I'm not sure they've done this yet, but I think the Eres Tu lovers (myself not excluded) would enjoy an appearance of Touch The Wind somewhere on a CD. It was an English version to Eres Tu, the B-side of the 45. Not equivalent lyrics, but also very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"One great song","review":"Once in a great while I hear a perfect song -- sung and played so well that improvement is impossible. \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" by Bonnie Tyler and \\"Suspicous Minds\\" by Elvis Presley come to mind. (For those who dissent, please be tolerant. I never made any claim to have good musical taste!)\\"Eres Tu\\" (\\"It is you\\") is such a song. The slightly stressed and hoarse vocal by the female lead, the lush choral background, the guitar strumming are perfect. Even the phrasing is great. I love the lisped -- \\"esperantha\\" for \\"esperanza\\" -- a Spanish affectation that I usually find cloying. And the rolled \\"r\\" of \\"guitarra\\" is downright thrilling -- or is that trilling?Well, ok, one great -- perfect -- song, and a bunch of fair to good songs make for a four star rating.

The other songs are unknown, at least to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very inaccurate writing","review":"I don't normally review stuff, but this one time I had to say something. This book is wildly inaccurate at times, mostly in geography. Simple stuff like saying a break is north of another when it's south. More simple stuff like distances.There's one entry for Cabo San Lucas that says Todos Santos (the big wave break - not the town) is 60 miles north of Cabo. Well, it's more like 995 miles(!).... that 60 miles is to the town, which is not the big wave spot.Under Mavericks he says Jeff Hawks rode it alone for years. Even non-surfers know the name Jeff Clark.I could go on, but you get the point. It's not just a little inaccurate - it's way off base.Even the photos aren't particularly good - many are badly framed.I feel like this book was written quickly and without adequate research. Clearly the writer hasn't been to many of these spots, so why write about them without researching them first?There are far better coffee table surf guides out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"tv nostalgia","review":"Before I purchased this product from Amazon I hadn't seen any episode ofRoute 66 since it was last shown on British television in the early 1960's. I have to say that I enjoyed watching the episodes of Route 66 again as it brought back so many wonderful memories for me.

Thank you Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned: Picture has been cropped!","review":"Route 66, like all TV shows of its era, was filmed in a squarish 1.33:1 aspect ratio. But for this \\"Volume 2\\" DVD set, the manufacturer has shamefully CROPPED the top and bottom of the image to about a 1.77:1 frame. Essentially, you are missing part of the picture and it ruins the original photography.Sure, it fills a \\"widescreen\\" TV, but at what expense? Tops of heads are frequently \\"cut off\\", and the cropping further deletes some of that wonderful Americana from 1960 that provided the mesmerizing backdrop of this classic series. The packaging does not warn you of this image tampering, so buyer beware! Maybe one day we'll see a re-release of the FULL image that was filmed and shown back in the '60s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad treatment of a classic","review":"I would gladly give an intelligently produced release of Route 66 five stars. It ranks with the best American TV has to offer. Unfortunately, Kirk Hallam/Roxbury have chosen to disappoint AGAIN. The first 66 set featured mostly poor quality prints, as well as an edited episode. Mr. Hallam has subsequently explained that this was due to pre-Christmas release deadlines. OK, I'll buy that tale, but artificially altering the aspect ratio? Why??? How could a person who is involved in the creative process (Hallam is a film producer) approve such a bastardization of other people's artistic efforts? How would Hallam feel about someone doing that to one of HIS projects? Disgusting. Perhaps the next half- season can be colorized. Obviously Hallam has little/no appreciation for this series or it's historical context (witness the amateurish \\"Drive-In Theater\\" menu screens). I just wish Image had produced these sets. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Make that five stars for the show itself, which gets better with every episode.The two stars is for Roxbury/Infinity's unaccountable botch job with the fake widescreen aspect ratio.

It's not: As with Warner's first-season set of \\"Kung Fu,\\" which was similarly mutilated, it's distracting and disrespectful and makes me regret that I bought the set.If you haven't yet, consider renting it instead -- or better yet, complain to the company and maybe they'll fix it for a rerelease.

Sad to think that people making these compilations have no clue as to what they are doing to classic media. Cutting the 4:3 into a letterbox to simulate widescreen for people with big screen tv's?

It's totally different than Elephant -- much more raw and primal, but I like it. I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but Jack really brings back Robert Plant voice for me -- I would have sworn this was an undiscovered Led Zepplin garage tape had I just heard it out of the blue (well, maybe not the drumming, but the guitar and wailing voices). This album has that same effect that great Zepplin albums have on me -- I just want to crack them up and blast them for a while. Elephant is a bit more subtle with songs that vary much more in style.

Only insider connections or rabid flavor of the week/year journalism could produce such a uniform response, IMO.But I was wrong. And I'm happy about that.Anyway, what more can be said about the White Stripes that hasn't been said already? Like many of rock's greatest bands, TWS leap into the fray fulled formed and yet have plenty of room to grow.

The whole thing is just blastig out guitar on every track, making them all sound the same.

It is not loud or pounding or gory. Isn't that nice.All that aside, the dvd quality is NOT great in this last of the series, but maybe I just got a dud. The first dvd seems quite over-exposed and even with adjustments cannot be made to look good. Also, the sound is muffled.

I'd put it up there with any album I've listened to in the last 30 years. M Ward is an outstanding musician whose bank of pop musical knowledge is immense and goes back many decades. With this CD, Mr. Ward vaults to the upper echelon of the pop music world (not in sales, but in artistic expression). There is an effortless inventiveness here that you see in only a handful of musicians. It's the rare kind of album that gets better the more you listen. Joe Henry. Elvis Costello. Nirvana. Randy Newman. These are the caliber of people/bands M Ward stands with in my book. If you want something for a casual listen - the Dave Mathews/Jack Johnson crowd - this CD probably won't work for you.

He not only walks in the shoes/moccasins of Frances Slocum, he continues to amaze with his astonishing capsity to understand her heart and follow her reasoning as she reflects on her life, both past and present, while growing from childhood through old age with her captors - a people she comes to love, respect and in the end, prefer despite the hardships and horrors they all endure. This is pure Thom at his best.

The material is first-rate and the performances practically flawless. One or two bits do require more visual, but the gist is just as good--gets the mind working.Even the material that is dated (Harold Macmillan et al) holds up well because, in all honesty, have politicians really changed all that much in 40 years?

Then, after a few days I realized that since the main approach by these things to stay on your ear is by sticking (on the instruction it says not to elongate the silicon or press it in too deep - makes sense, if a piece breaks off in your ear you are in a load of trouble), if you didn't put it on perfectly or forget to put them on before you enter the water, there's no way to put them on again unless you come out and dry your ears.Take my words for it and try not to waste your time with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy real plugs, not hunks of silicone","review":"I'm the first to admit that I didn't read the description carefully.

This is a new Samantha Fox CD! Even if I used to like her older songs I was quite sceptical because there are so many artists that you didn't hear anything of and then they come back with so weak stuff. Not so Samantha! I listened to the Cd and I was like WOW! it's so fine! The song is so dancy! Dadadadadidada!!! Great! Also \\"Say what you want\\" is cool. Check also out her new album \\"21st century fox\\", it's great and has so many different styles on it. She's back and really fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT !!!","review":"I totally love Sam's new single \\"Let Me Be Free\\". She is in top vocal form, she has never sounded better. The second song \\"Say What You Want\\" is another wonderful song. After you get this cd single, most definately get her fabulous \\"21st Century Fox\\" cd. This is what pop music in the U.S. should sound like. I can't wait for her next album to be released. If you love Samantha's songs, I strongly recommend requesting her songs so they can be played on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grief Journal by Linda Andreozzi","review":"The journal forces you to face your grief and to address how YOU feel. The book works because it is written by somone undergoing the griving process. It forces you to face your grief and that is the first step to \\"healing\\". I find it best to spend some time reading a section and thinking about my writing before rereading the chapter and writing about MY feelings. It gives a procedure for addressing your grief. Gieving is a tough process. This book gives you a guided trip through the grieving journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Grief Journal","review":"After losing both my grandmothers and my fourteen year old dog within 8 months, I began searching for books to deal with grief.

This book uses footnotes instead of endnotes for easier reference. His documentation is amazingly broad (he does not pull from exclusively contemporary opinion, but source documents).He explains not only OT and NT canon, but also the criteria for canon inclusion. He is lucid. This book is clear and the progression is easy to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly produced","review":"The production values were very weak. The spoken section at the beginning was stiff. The background music was bad and the audio of the massage ssection sounded like the speaker was inside a can - very poor acoustics. I regret purchasing this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Soulful Passionate","review":"The songs on this album flow well into each other and there is not one you need to skip. The music ranges from joyful gospel to moving rock and roll hymns. How better to describe \\"Saving Grace\\" than a rock hymn; it defies other categories. The songs on this record show the backbone of his faith, literally, in the strongly constructed musical phrasing and repetitive lyrical phrases. By the end of the album (\\"Saving Grace\\") I was verklempt - struck by the raw passion in the music. And this is written by a confirmed atheist. My favorite Dylan album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have had this album for 26years","review":"On LP and recently purchased it on CD only to realise why I don't listen to it its Flat. Don't get me wrong I love Dylans music, he is the only musician whose's concert I went to In good old Sydney in 1977 I think. His singing is as good as any the notes are clear but is it missing that range of feeling and expression that he can produce. He is putting his soul into the album instead of giving to the audience. Slow Train Coming and The Times They Are a Changing, are my all time favourite albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to Save something...make it your money.","review":"Alright, I love Dylan's music. Back during the beginning of the CD craze I bought every cassette that I could find with Dylan's name on it. Unfortunately, this was one of them. During Mr. Zimmerman's \\"born again\\" phase he released a trilogy of albums with a strong Christian theme... Slow Train Coming, Saved, and Infidels. Of the three, Saved is the most consistently uninspiring. In fact, I would rate it as one of Dylan's worst albums of all-time. Now that being said...as a Christian Rock album (and, admittedly, I am not fond of this genre of music) I find it more tolerable than most anything else I have come across. Basically, it is a below average album for Dylan, but it truly depends on how one approaches his work during this period of his career. It is not an album for beginners nor casual fans, instead it appeals to the dedicated few or perhaps those whose message it reaches, the fans of rock with a decidedly spiritual bent."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 out of 5 stars? are you serious?","review":"can it be that people are letting their personal beliefs block the receptors in the brain that signal bad music? ive listened to many bob dylan albums, and every one is a gem. freewheelin' is my favorite, but so what? it doesn't matter which ones we love, because we all know what bob dylan's worst record was, and its saved. im not one to question this man's beliefs or anything like that, bob dylan deserves all the respect in the universe, but could it be that bob dylan made a transfer to christian music to help us all see how bad it is? could he have made the transfer to make a mockery of the christian faith? almost certainly not. but only a seriously bad album could have planted these seeds in my brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dylan's WORST Album","review":"I used to own the vinyl version. It made a lovely ashtry.Seriously: SKIP THIS ALBUM. I own almost every album by Dylan, but I threw this one away. Literally.Dylan was in this period apparently possessed by his born-again christian mania, and his lyrics are intolerant, didactic, humorless, and smug.Absolutely without a doubt his very worst album EVER. He's recorded over 40 other albums so far... start with ANYTHING ELSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the price, in a sense","review":"If you're buying this, you've probably already drained Dylan down to the dregs. Saved makes Self Portrait look like Highway 61 Revisited. As music or poetry or whatever one usually enjoys in Dylan, it's certainly not worth the vinyl it's recorded on. But as biography and especially as a joke, it's just about worth the retail price. I bought the cassette and have never begrudged the money I shelled out, since the album is always good for a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved--Bob Dylan","review":"Classic Dylan��Not his greatest album, however like every one of his albums there are at least a few gems. Highly recommended for those who want a complete collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evangelical Dylan","review":"You know, Bob Dylan is one of the most prolific songwriters of this generation. His lyrics are awesome. Another great thing: when someone covers one of his songs, many times it turns out even better. For example: \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" by Johnny Winter, and \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" by Jimi Hendrix. Here he is at his Evangelical best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart to heart","review":"This is an outstanding piece of music and as well as thought provoking. It will draw you back to it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Christian Rock Records Ever","review":"Bob Dylan's short-lived dalliance with dogmatic Christian fundamentalism produced some fabulous inspirational music. \\"Saved\\" is better written than \\"Slow Train Coming\\" but STC is arguably the best sounding Dylan record ever (\\"No Mercy\\" and \\"Infidels\\" would be the competition). \\"Every Grain of Sand\\" is THE classic song from Dylan's fundamentalist Christian phase and created a bridge back to a more wide-ranging spirituality on Dylan's part, but \\"Saved\\" is the best album all-in-all. Dylan's Christian music has never been drawn on very much by Christian folk/rock musicians but it's hard to understand why that's true."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAVED, by Bob Dylan - IF YOU LOVE BOB :)","review":"I bought this for my husband and he enjoys its. Im not that big of a Dylan fan, but the title song is inspiring and upbeat. Great for Dylan collectors and folks who like some folk rock gospel."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL pressing on............","review":"I don't think I can add much to a review that is this long coming.My first copy of this CD got damaged. So I decided to buy another one. I'm just glad there is one somewhere that I can buy and download into my laptop. Being the west coast type from the 1960s, I am hard pressed to find any other expression of my beliefs, in any other genre of music.I once had the piano book for this album but haven't seen it in ages.PRESSING ON is easy to find and play on the key board.Glad to see an old friend again, and happy to listen to it almost all day long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, boring, contrived","review":"I had heard S.J. Perelman's name so often that I was interested to see how he wrote. Unfortunately, this book was so boring that I couldn't even read it, and it wasn't because of the topic, but because of the writing style, the contrived descriptions, and weak attempts at humor.I have seen other reviewers say they loved it and laughed out loud, and this is a reminder that everyone's experience with humor and writing is subjective.I didn't like it at all; you'll have to judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unpleasant First Encounter","review":"An acquaintance recently recommended S.J. Perelman to me as a source of humor. Having read \\"Acres and Pains\\" today, I came away with but one feeling. To wit: What a horrible waste of my time. I have already purchased two other offerings by Mr. Perelman and can only hope that they are an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music poor visual","review":"The sound is ahead of the picture, and while it is very slight, those of us (probably not too many) who are bothered by that will find this difficult to watch. Musically, in lyric sections, Kremer has a tendency to let the sound die in a very predictable and non-singing style. Lastly, since it is a dvd....seeing Gidon Kremer in so many closeups with his mouth hanging open (even if his teeth would be perfect) is not an experience I want to revisit very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the path","review":"The book suggests that it will provide 16 paths to bulding wealth, one for each Myers-Briggs type. Unfortunately it does not do so. For mine, what the book refers to as a visionary or INTP, it says instead, to forget building weath because \\"money is not why Visionaries are here in this lifetime\\". \\"Use your talents\\" is the only suggestion. Maybe others are better, but it appears to use most of its pages to discuss psychology and spends little time prescribing financial strategies."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book for starting you on your first million.","review":"fun and well written book using the briggs myers and kiersey inventories. explains how your personality type can get you where you want to go financially and identifies some career paths to take you there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A karaoke nightmare","review":"The title says it all, Dance and Sing, so it is not for a nursery. Unfortunately, these people have seriously butchered some decent kids songs with really bad Casio-tone synthesizer and karaoke style singing. Pop Goes the Weasel may be the worst one of them all, the singer seriously needs to pop some energy pills and get excited about singing. The only tolerable song is \\"One to Ten\\" which has a slight B-52s feel to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Music...but...","review":"...the problem is that 95% of this \\"soundtrack\\" is Shakespearian dialogue from the film - with the actual music playing subtly in the background.I bought the CD presuming it was like virtually all other movie soundtracks - the original music from the film WITHOUT any dialogue, so I was disappointed. If I'd wanted the dialogue with the music as a mere backdrop, I'd have bought the DVD of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"This soundtack is amazing, it has quotes directly form the movies along with the music which makes it awesome. I love sitting in school and listening to The farewell scene in juliets bedchamber, its so beautiful and sad, and it just makes me want to cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memory fades and so does my liking for this album","review":"I remembered the one song from this album. What I did not remember from so long ago is that it is the ONLY song on the album. The rest is dialog. BORING! I felt like I wasted my money on this one, but if you enjoy listening to Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey waxing eloquent with Shakespeare, then this is the album for you. But, maybe you'd be better served by buying the DVD. At least you get to see the whole spectacle, which my memory seems to remember was quite good...at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I wanted (exactly)","review":"I guess I should have listened to the tracks before ordering. I didn't know dialogue from the movie would be included with the music. If I had realized that, I would not have ordered the CD. I get the same thing with the movie. I was hoping for just the music, as I thought much of it was very beautiful. Oh well, Goodwill will be getting another donation from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst live band ever","review":"Valuable document of one of the worst live bands ever. I knew these guys as Mr. Crowe's Garden in Atlanta when they were paying to play at the White Dot. They were pitiful then and have continued to be. Rich Robinson is about the most uninspired and unoriginal guitarist imaginable, his brother can't sing, and the addition of Audley Freed is wasted, since he's totally cut out of the mix. What a joke!!Oh, by the way, the idea that either a live album sounds like trash or it's not \\"authentic\\" is a false dichotomy. No excuse for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crowes Hit Rock Bottom","review":"This is by far the worst Black Crowes album ever. I like all the studio recordings, and have an extensive bootleg collection from the Ford/Colt era. Freed's guitar style is WRONG for the Black Crowes. there is none of the intricate interplay between the two guitarists as was always evident in their live shows, and specifically on the Sno Nuf box set live EP. I felt terrible listening to \\"Live\\" the first time, it sounds like a band that has sold out to stadium excess. The mix is muddy, Chris' vocals are neither soulful or bluesy. Even the \\"set list\\" is less than spectacular. Maybe in ten years the original line up will regroup, revive their original sound, and once again, be the most rock and roll rock and roll band."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad it's live","review":"I've been searching for a GOOD live recording of the Crowes, and except for Live at the Greek with Jimmy Page, it doesn't exist. The problem is that, despite what others have written, the Crowes simply are NOT a good live band. Sure they have the stage presence, the rock-star swagger, attitude, a solid library of studio work. But it all falls apart in the live audio mix. I have been to many Crowes concerts, and the only good-sounding shows were on the Jimmy Page tour. I had hoped they would have learned something from Page, but this double-live disc is evidence that they have not! Too bad, they're one of my favorite bands ever, I crank up their studio CDs often, but have yet to hear any live recording that does the band, and the music, justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"This could have been one of the great live albums, but Greatest Hits Live without Jealous Again and By Your Side...OUCH! For that I give a 4 rather than a 5. I am a live album fan, but it almost always seems that the one or two songs you would expect are missing, oh well. Other than that this is a great cd full of Rock and Blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Comfort","review":"One of the best albums of 2003 was this release from Mississippi native Claire Holley, and it is in the same ever-expanding bag of Americana roots rock that includes Tift Merritt, and such veterans as Lucinda Williams.Claire's approach is more Southern blues-oriented than many other Americana female singer/songwriters, who tend to lean on country and folk-rock inflections, but those Southern roots do show through on DANDELION, particularly on the album's opening track \\"6 Miles To McKenney\\"--a track that, if this were still the 1970s or if corporate radio would give it a chance, could be a very big hit. Claire is an effective enough vocalist, and her guitar skills are not too shabby either.For anyone with a taste for Americana and roots-rock, DANDELION is the perfect form of Southern Comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET A LIFE!","review":"Contrived vacuity and forgetable monotony -- with a condescending attitude.

As I don't live in US, I tried to buy them over the internet but nobody sells them, as you have to send the product to a service center to have the batteries replaced.

When you deal with elderly people they can get confused as to when it fell apart, but it sounds like it has been awhile. At least a week or two. This is a $100.00 product and I purchased it for the glorified comments (except the last one which I suspect is the real truth.DO NOT buy this object until you find out how responsive they are to me.

Also has a nifty lock to disable the 'pivot' function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the original box?","review":"I just received this shaver in a small yellow box, not in the original panasonic box. It must be refurbished one.

I've used the Norelco rotaries, including one of the new models which dispense gel, and a Braun foil shaver prior to this one. I retunred the Norelco prior to getting this model from Amazon. It takes me a while longer to shave with it to be sure I get all the hairs (it's sometimes difficult to see through the shaving cream), but once I'm done my face is as smooth as it can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are sending refurbished items","review":"6 month ago I bought this shaver, great shaver. Now that I ordered one for my dad, they sent me a refurbished unit. How could I tell it's a refurb aside from it coming in a cardboard box instead of the original sealed plastic packaging? It's the presence of someone else's hair on the shaver!! N-A-S-T-Y! I called amazon to replace it, and got another refurb!! I am sure I'm not the only one getting shafted by amazon for this product, curious if we should initiate a class action suit against them for misleading consumers!

It only goes about 5 days between charges whereas the Remington lasted 2 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"It's an Ok shaver (if your beard is not as thick as mine). You might find it a little annoying when you try to shave the neck area because in my case i need to make 2-3 passes till all hair leaves. When i bought it i thought that it was coming with a trimmer because i don't like shaving completely as my skin irritates very easy, so i have to give it to my cousin who had exactly the same problems as mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to the convenience of an electric shaver, but find this razor to be anything but convenient. It takes forever to get anything even resembling a close shave, especially on my neck. Typically, I have to go over my neck with my old manual razor. If anybody is seriously thinking about buying this razor, contact me and I'll sell you mine for cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very close shave, but it takes a few passes","review":"This is quite simply the best shaver I have owned. It gives me a shave that is as smooth as a razor shave without the nicks and constant replacement of blades. I have also owned Norelco and Remington electric shavers, and although I used the Norelco for a number of years, it never performed as well as this product.The only downside I have discovered is that it can take several passes to get a shave that feels very smooth. The first pass makes me look respectably shaved, however, so a two-minute shave is not out of the question when I'm in a hurry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value for the Money","review":"This razor is much, much better in features and maintenance than my Braun.One of the things I liked with this razor is that the clean-up is easy and I don't have to buy refills for the job (unlike Braun which performs cleaning with a cleaning cartridge that needs to be replaced periodically). And I don't have to hesitate in getting it wet.Another is the price - $60 A comparable Braun for this price does not have as many features..The design is also excellent: Ergonomic power plug, charging base that keeps the razor upright at all times.Downside?I'm not sure what the hi-speed feature is for. It does clean the razor any better than the normal speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"ES8152NC - Best WET Shaver","review":"For wet shaving highly rated.

I would slide its gently buzzing body over my face for a few minutes in the shower then \\"mop up\\" the stray remaining hairs with a hand razor. It would take a little longer than a manual but wouldn't scratch as much. However the reason I can't reccommend purchase is it started having charging problems after a little more than a year and soon wouldn't work at all. For a $100 shaver this is just not good enough; I will not buy another Panasonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome shaver!!!","review":"This is one of the best shavers on the market. Whatever they say about Norelco being the best,I think Panasonic rocks when it comes to shavers. My husband's been using a 7xxx model for 3 years now and I decided to buy a new, more advanced, model for him since he's been kind of reluctant to shave lately. And, needless to say, I like him better with smooth and soft shaved skin...The result- he's been shaving every 2 days thanks to the fact this model makes less noise, has a great easy-grip design, recharges incredibly quickly and looks cool in the bathroom (Men love beautiful toys- from Gameboy Advance to Pro Curve shavers.) I'll buy him more Panasonic products in the future; recommend you to do the same; won't regret it!!!:)You'd ask \\"why 4 stars, then?\\" Well, lets leave some room for more HiTech advances..."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE BEST","review":"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ES8152NC PANASONIC SHAVER.

Even on the face it does a half shave. If you wish to keep your beard and hair down to a can't see look you have to use it everyday and even then you still have a rough touch to the beard.

Unfortunately, I cannot give this album more than five stars. I finished the dissertation in record time, and now the research that went into it has become the basis for my new book. Are these Italians inspirational or what? When I lived behind the iron curtain, Cutugno, Celentano, Al Bano & Romina helped me through the dull, boring gray Soviet reality. Ramazzotti helped me through misunderstandings, professional jealousies, pseudo-morality, and idiotic, stale scholasticism I was forced to exist in at times.

My favorites on this cd are 'kelbi,' (my heart), 'yawlidi,' (my boy/son) and 'beb al madhi,' (door of the past,). Its refreshing to have a female arabic singer write her own music and songs in the vein of Natacha Atlas but two completely different genres. Even the upbeat tracks on this cd are very lulling."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York Times Review","review":"With a beautiful voice and a large palette of influences to draw from, Souad Massi is one of the most interesting new singers to come from North Africa. Influenced equally by shaabi music, French chanson, flamenco, 60's American folk and a variety of African traditional music, this Algerian guitarist and chanteuse (now living in Paris) makes music that is at once exotic and familiar.The music on her second CD, \\"Deb (heart broken)\\" (Wrasse Records), is heavy with ache - for love gone wrong, for lost innocence and for the plight of her home country. Yet underneath the gloom and homesickness, not unlike the music of the Cape Verde singer Cesaria Evora, the sun still shines and celebration is still possible. In nearly every song on this wonderfully arranged and beautifully sung CD, evil does battle with good. Evil seems to win every time, but the music stands as testament to a hope and spirit that cannot be dimmed, let alone vanquished."},{"rating":"2","title":"i recived this item in a timely manner and in great condition i will recomend this seller again good job","review":"i recived this item in a timely manner and in great condition i will recomend this seller again good job"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine book, dreadful printing","review":"This is the book it is advertised to be.

This study of the gospels is packed with information suitable for both students and readers of the New Testament. Packed with detailed notes and scholarly insight. This isn't a breezy commentary, so look elsewhere if that's your bag. This is serious scholarship, although not so serious that a general reader won't enjoy it. A great book on the subject by one of the best of today's thinkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Edersheim's Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"As a previous reviewer has noted, this volume is a tour de force of biblical knowledge, a virtual seminary course about Jesus in one volume. Yet it is easy to read, always interesting, and thought provoking. The early chapters cover the historical, social, cultural, and political backgrounds of the New Testament era. Blomberg does a great job painting a picture of what life would have been like in 1st century Israel. Then he has a discussion about how the gospels were composed and when they might have been written. He then gives a succinct summary of the events narrated in the four gospels, concluding with a nice essay onm the historical credibility of the passion narratives.This book does for the Christian community what Alfred Edersheim's Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah did for the Christian community over a hundred years ago, except to say that Blomberg's book is much easier to read. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Resource for Study of the Gospels","review":"One of the best evangelical resources on the Gospels. Blomberg does a terrific job of acquainting his readers with information on the scholarly/historical debates surrounding the Gospels, while also offering a survey of the life of Jesus. The final chapter attempts to summarize the \\"theology of Jesus\\" and is by itself worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Funeral Doom","review":"This album evokes the feelings of sadness and eternity of a funeral procession (which I myself have taken part in, so I know how it feels). The simplicity of this album simply adds to the ambiance and emotion. Not only is this a beautiful release, it inspired an entire new genre of doom, funeral doom, which is one of my favorite metal genres. One thing is that you will either love it or hate it. If your idea of metal is Blind Guardian style melodies or Cryptopsy style technicality/speed, you WILL HATE THIS ALBUM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doom has no place in the garage","review":"Thergothon was one of those doom/death outfits with status in the previous decades. They were discussed around doom circles, but never really hailed as one of the greats. After wasting my cash on this CD, I now know why.Everything about Stream From the Heavens is amateurish at best. The music is pieced together cut-and-paste style with uninteresting power-chorded rhythms that make little use of the melody that this genre has trademarked. The lyrics and vocal presentation are extremely weak, and the production is one of the worst in my collection. Even if something interesting was captured on this recording, you could barely hear it over the obscene amount of high-end in the mix anyway. Thergothon is a band that will make you want to openly weep. . . out of sheer boredom, and the $50 import price is not worth it at all!

I didn't think I would use it, but once I flipped through the included recipe book, I was inspired to try some of them. The Cinnamon Crunch Popcorn is a huge hit wherever I take it. Other savory recipes are great too. It's quick, easy to use and there is hardly a unpopped kernel in the pot. The popped corn is very large and light.

(OK, put on oven mitts and swirl it around every 4 or 5 minutes if it makes you feel better, but it's really not necessary.)When popping slows to 3 or 4 seconds between pops, remove from heat, salt, and pour into serving bowls.Pretty flawless in my experience: few un-popped kernels; no burned ones; easy clean up; and no need to stand there and tend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"This is a cheaply made item. It lasted for 5 uses. The gears utilized are faulty (they split/break in normal usage). Read the reviews on site. The ones citing breakage are correct. Thin gauge pot..sloppy connecting mechanism for the lid. I had registered my warranty but didn't even bother to request a replacement for the gear. Not worth it.

The problem I experienced with both was that after a while, the small wire arms inside the pot no longer \\"whirled\\". Then the little plastic gear on top of the lid would break. Without that it is just another (very) lightweight pot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy!","review":"I bought this for my husband last Christmas and we are definitely pleasantly surprised at how well it has worked out! We use a thin layer of oil (preferably peanut or safflower, but we do use corn occasionally) to a 1/2 cup popcorn. We also sprinkle some butter flavored popcorn salt in with the kernels BEFORE they pop, which makes all the difference. The popcorn is delicious.We have noticed that the gear mechanism is a bit \\"cheap,\\" as is the knob on the handle, but we've been able to jiggle things back into place and haven't broken anything. For that I'm giving four stars, rather than five, however for what I paid, I can deal with some little kinks.Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to microwave popcorn. Lots of fun for kids to twirl too...just supervise next to the stove!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gears were defective but easy to fix","review":"After we decided to start eating more healthily, we bought this corn popper as a means of replacing our microwave popcorn habit. I could hardly wait for it to arrive, which it did in short order. However, the crank's gears broke the very first time I used it! I was disappointed and confused, as I had read the directions and really thought I had followed them carefully. My husband looked at it and reassembled it for me. The next day, the same thing happened. I was prepared to return the item but decided to try Super Gluing the gear to the rod as a last resort. Well, that did the trick!

The popcorn was easy to make; only about three minutes, nearly every kernel popped, light and fluffy, taste is wonderful; you just swipe out the pan with a paper towel and it's good to go; it's so easy to clean. If you love popcorn, you are in for a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"you'll never eat microwave popcorn again!","review":"My old popper like this broke and I got the Whirley-Pop to replace it. Once you make popcorn like this you'll never eat the microwaved junk again! It only takes a few minutes more to make popcorn on the stove--half a cup of kernels and some oil, and in five minutes you've got a big, yummy bowl of hot popcorn.I wasn't crazy about their packaged mix. Too salty and too dry. But the popper itself is excellent and also comes with a decent warranty on the parts that tend to break on these--the gears and the handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea cheaply made. My old one was better.","review":"I bought this popper and it is too flimsy to be usable. My previous one was stainless steel and much better. These gears are plastic and slip when corn is almost fully popped. The inside part rubs on the bottom of the pan. The unit is much to cheaply made to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Bought this as a gift for myself. Turned out to be a cheap, lightweight pot that began to burn popcorn after only a few uses.

Very disappointed in the quality of this item. Will buy a different brand next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent popper, but poor quality parts","review":"I've had this popper for about three months now, and about a week ago, the plastic gears broke.

Such is the case with this brilliant album title. For the first time, we have a punning title that subtly references the use of illegal drugs. You see, \\"Waiting to Exhale\\" is the name of a famous book and movie from about 9 or 10 years back. By changing one word at the end of the title, to its antonym, the artist has ingeniously made an allusion to the smoking of marijuana, which I am given to understand is a popular recreational drug in both the youth counterculture and the black ghetto. I slap my head and wonder why no popular music artist had ever before thought of making sly references in his music to recreational drug taking. I stand it awe of this album's simple yet profound elegance and I hereby salute the arrival of a true genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful debut for a wonderful young woman","review":"I met Lily as she sang her heart out on the street in San Francisco-- her glorious voice and lifting guitar amazed me. She's as sweet as her music, and it's twice as nice to see her live. I wish her great success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lily Holbrook - Running From the Sky","review":"An enchanting collection of songs from someone who has a fantasy point of view and a beautiful voice. This is truly magical and definitely something which makes me smile!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting! Transcending!! Magical!!","review":"Running From the Sky was introduced to me when I went into this incredible store on Newbury in Boston, called The Fairy Shop. It was playing and I was moved to a deep sense of peace and gratitude while in there. I know the music was a part of it. I bought the cd there, brought it home, and her voice makes me remember. What a refreshing, hypnotic, ethereal voice and collection of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shirley Bassey","review":"I recently attended a screening of \\"The Deer Hunter\\" in New York City and I kept saying \\"That sounds like a song I once heard Shirly Bassey sing\\" and sure enough -thanks Betty from the USA for settling that mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deer Hunter: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack","review":"I can not review the album because the Realplayer I downloaded took all night to download and then would NOT play the samples. Can you help me ? germo@jps.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Favorite song not on the soundtrack","review":"The scene when they're in the bar, just before they leave for vietnam, there's an emotional piano instrumental. Its not on the soundtrack, so if you're looking for it, its by Frederic Chopin, called Nocturne Number 6, Opus 15-3, in g minor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment for a wonderful movie score","review":"All I can say is what a ripoff. I think this soundtrack runs less than 15 minutes--what a lost opportunity. Not only are the scores way too short--but the most two vital songs/socres--\\"I Love you Baby--not only at the tavern but also as part of the wedding festivals--and even more importantly, the score whose name I don't know--after the deer hunt and the most poignant moment in the films--the score in the tavern where a classical piece is played and all the boys go into the deepest moments of intimacy in the entire film--none of this is part of the sound track.I love the film, looked forward to the soundtrack--and felt I (and others) were totally ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is the real original soundtrack","review":"Including all the background sound from the movie, too! I had thought it was something fully-fledged music so that I can enjoy the music from the movie that I love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for an M.T.","review":"This actually starts out a little too uptempo for me, then it goes on to your typical massage type music which is okay but not spellbinding. The tunes are pretty and flow nicely, however the very last track is what makes this a terrible c.d. for any therapist. A man starts saying \\" ahhh massage...\\" and then goes on to explain how beneficial massage is. If you bought this c.d. and never listened to it and played it for the first time while you were massaging, it would be horrorifying. When the guy says'Ahhhhhh\\", its very weird. Yikes, what were they thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guitar case","review":"I've only had it for about a week, but this case seems to be holding up to the task. The only minor issue I have with it is that it's difficult to open -- there is nothing to grab on to to open the case up. It protects my new guitar very well. If it was easier to open, I'd give it the full 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the old songs live","review":"This album is worth every penny just to hear that 18 minute version of Wicked World. Tony Iommi is THE MAN. I would have paid full price just for that one song. This CD and Reunion are my favorite Black Sabbath disks and I have been a fan since the late 70's. Must buy for any fan. One complaint is that the audio seems a tad poor, or is it just me? Old material here, I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master's of Doom's Domain","review":"This CD is great,from beginning to end it has that old natural,raw sound of the 70's.People may complain about some of the sound quality but listen back to anything in the 70's or early 80's for that matter,technology was limited back then.Then again thats what i love about it,no faking,no overdubs,no additives at all,just raw sabbath.About the only track that seems to have VERY poor sound quality is N.I.B not sure why,and the only bone i had to pick is where is my favorite song (electric funeral)wish they would have added that gem as well.All in all though this is great vintage sabbath for any hardcore fan.Pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOOM DOOM DOOM....BOOM BOOM BOOM","review":"Metal may have changed a lot over the last 30 years, but thereis no doubt who are one one of the rulers. This double CD setreally captures Sabbath at their artistic peak. The riffs maynot be as bone crunching as that of later Sabbath releases ofthe '80s when Metal really picked up speed and virtuoscity, butyou can really get a sense for where this was all going to lead.Toni really sounds great. The real surprise has to be Ozzy. His voice had so many less miles on it that it leaves you wondering \\"Is that really Ozzy?\\", and of course it is!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Live album I've ever heard","review":"They pull out all the stops on this one. The vocals are awesome and the music is just plain Heavy Metal at it's finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"black sabbath past lives","review":"This is a must add for the Black Sabbath collection. I highly recomend buying this cd. you wont regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sabbath's Best Live Album!","review":"An impressive live album! Black Sabbath really puts on a great show, from what I hear on this album, and it's nice to know that the REAL Sabbath fans can appreciate something beyond \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"Iron Man.\\" A lot of great tracks, here, and the nearly nineteen minute \\"Wicked World\\" really demonstrates the level of musicianship in this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks Really Hard!","review":"I Love Ozzy! He is the best singer songrighter in my opinion. Black Sabbath Have Some great songs on here that i think sound better Live,Snowblind(the cocaine screams add to it) Sweet Leaf, War Pigs and a lot more. but still I think the songs Ozzy wrights in his solo career are much better. I Suggest if you want a live Ozzy CD to buy Tribute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful but not as a cookbook","review":"If you can find this book at a deep discount, it is worth buying for its breathtaking photos and diagrams of architectural constructions in ice cream and cake. The actual recipes, however, are based on French government formulas for professional \\"glaciers\\" (ice cream producers), and tend to include such ingredients as trimoline and stabilizer. Even things like butterfat and powdered glucose seem pretty mysterious.If you're looking for sorbet recipes, I recommend Caroline Liddell, \\"Frozen Desserts,\\" or Shona Poole, \\"Iced Delights.\\"If you're looking for ice creams, I recommend Bruce Weinstein, \\"The Ultimate Ice Cream Book,\\" or Marilyn Linton, \\"125 Best Ice Cream Recipes.\\"I can't list my site here, but if you do a search on \\"ice cream bibliography\\" (with quotes like that), you may be able to find my annotated list of ice cream books and recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful introduction to the Bible","review":"This is an excellent introduction to the Bible - by far the best I've seen. It manages to be both simple and fairly comprehensive and should serve its reader well as a companion to the Scriptures.One caveat: As always, everything in its pages should be compared to the Bible to determine if it's true. In particular, I noticed that he ignores some key verses in Revelation (1:1, 22:10, etc.) that would seem to contradict his millenial, far-future interpretation of that book.All in all, a superb overview of the Bible, especially for new students."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull, fumbling book!","review":"I can't imagine anyone remoting liking this book unless they have a doctorate in history and a desire to suffer in dusty archives. Pakula, a very famous and wealthy woman in her own right, seems to be turning out these biographies as a hobby. According to her acknowledgements, she employs a great many people to sweat out the research for her, do the unpleasant footwork, and then file and collect and piece the ton of information together. This may work as a vanity project for some celebrity authors, but for Pakula the disjointed and extremely uninspired result is all too obvious. There's simply an endless listing of dull, lifeless facts falling together to make a book. There's absolutely no developed dramatic narrative, no depth of analysis or feeling for what might have been of far more interest to the reader. Pakula may have the ambition of her literary brother, Boorstin, but she certainly has none of his talent or his hard-won individual voice or style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and boring!","review":"A pretentious subject examined by a very boring and inept author. Save your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still wondering how WWI started?","review":"This is an excellent book- imminently readable despite the plethora of Fritzs, Victorias, etc. It helps explain the atmosphere in Europe before the start of the First World War. At the same time, it paints a vivid picture of the difficult life of the much-maligned Kaiserin. Worthwhile for anyone interested in fin-de-siecle politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\" keep you hooked\\" account about both mother & daughter.","review":"\\"An Uncommon Woman\\" is an absorbing book. It covers some of the most interesting people of the past century, and some of the most turbulent times of the current century. Princess \\"Vickie\\" was her mother's daughter, and her own person. How someone like her could be the mother of Kaiser Wilhelm, well, read the book. I lost my copy last summer before I had finished reading it, and I couldn't rest until I had found another copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely has its moments","review":"Like too many Oz books (including Baum's), it's pretty much a wander-around-meeting-weirdos story with minimal plot. But this one has some great stuff in it. Starting with Pigasus, the flying pig. When I want to explain, briefly, to a novice, what's great about RP Thompson, I describe Pigasus. And Ruggedo's adventures are absorbing, and we get the best pictures of him, cowering and snarling. PIRATES is his last major appearance; in HANDY MANDY he's a bit part. PIRATES is also his most sympathetic appearance. We are actually glad, for instance, when he gets to eat and rest well as King of Menankypoo rather than sleeping on the ground. And you'll cheer for him when he uses the Standing Stick on the pirates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Product!","review":"After purchasing the wrong tie rod, I was able to get this purchased and overnighted for my job. Fast response from Amazon! Great part and very solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful continuation to an outstanding series","review":"After enjoying City of Pearl,I was looking forward to reading Crossing the Line, and I was not disappointed in the slightest!Having said that, please be aware that this is part of a planned 6-book series, and it would be very desirable to read at least the first two in order for full appreciation. They do NOT, however, end on cliffhangers, which I consider an unforgivable sin.The book's plot is interesting enough, but for me the characters are what make it rise above the norm. Each faces a number of ethical situations in which \\"crossing the line\\" in some way or other is an appropriate metaphor. Eddie the journalist must decide where his professional lines should be drawn; Shan must decide where her allegiance and her love belong; and Aras must decide where his destiny lies.Locus compares Traviss to LeGuin, Bujold, and Asaro. Traviss shows some of the strengths of each of these writers, a very delicious blend.Now, for me, on to The World Before!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty Top Cop or Tree-huggin Human Hater?","review":"CROSSING THE LINE takes off where CITY OF PEARL started, with gritty top cop Shan Frankland, who worked with the elite Envro Corps back on Earth. Now she has teamed up with a new partner, who happens to be an alien infected with a parasitic life form, which gives the host eternal life. The characters are well developed, the plot is fast paced and it will leave you looking forward to the next book. However, I did find it tedious at times, was Karen Traviss telling us an great story, or was she making a political statement? Shan Frankland seems to be the only Human who knows the TRUTH; the human race's only desire is to cut down the trees for profit and skin all the bunny rabbits for coats, and no one can see the damage that they do except Shan, and now she is going to kill us all to save the apes.
