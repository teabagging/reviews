The loading time between races is forever and the graphics do nothing to challenge the system. When it finally loaded and the racing began, all I could think of was Out Run. The handling is poor and difficult to manage. I dare not even try Campaign mode, this is just a poorly designed game. The upside and why I rated it so high is the FMV scenes are nice to watch.

The prose is so rich. The insights into human thought, feeling and motivations are entrancing. I first read OF FIRE AND SWORD, then followed up with the other two volumes of the story, THE DELUGE, Volumes I and II. I'm now into the continuation, PAN MICHAEL. I'm of Austro/Hungarian descent and live in a community largely of Polish, Russian and Hungarian roots, so the history means a lot to me. The love stories are woven into the history of wars and conquerers and political intrigue in the history of Poland. By far the best of around 70 books I've read this year. And free, to boot.

Some of the DVD extras are matches. From Japan when he won the Super J Cup, Wrestlemania XX world title match against HHH and HBK. This DVD is meant for Benoit Fans or People who respect the sport.

Also, the photos are unlabeled and I'm pretty sure sometimes attached to the wrong disease. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Idea, but Falls very short given the diseases it lists....","review":"How can this book even be taken seriously when it leaves out such diseases as Huntington's and Lou Gerics, but has something as mild as children's \\"Fifth Disease\\" listed, which is simply a mild rash? Also I have to agree with last poster, there was NOT 22 deaths due to anthrax in the USA on one given occasion-which I also read. This book was thrown together quickly with little research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent inspirational material !","review":"This book contains many practical stress management methods as well as a theosophical style inspirational message. Reccomended for anyone searching for the answer to that age old question of what brings happiness. Great effort seems to have been made to maintain a strictly non denominational tone and with success. This book will appeal equally to a wide variety of religious backgrounds. It is written for people."},{"rating":"2","title":"I envy all newcomers","review":"I envy anyone reading this who has yet to discover Yeats but wants to. One of my college professors said the same thing to me, and I still remember what it was like to fall under the spell of Yeats' language and his romanticism.(But hey, if Sodom120--from Louisiana, no less--says these poems are \\"mediocre,\\" then what do I, the worldwide poetry-reading public, generations of succeeding poets, and the Nobel committee know?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Collection","review":"This book contains all of Yeat's published poetry and I believe alot of his dramatic writings.

It's really great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"Inexpensive, but for a reason. A very quixotic selection of Yeats poems; most of the best ones are not there.

June Tabor has a rich, sulty contralto that lends itself best to this type of music.Songs vary from three-handkerchief tearjerkers to bright and funny.

DEVIL AND BISHOP MCGLYNN is hilarious!It's solid enjoyment from the first to last cuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the best to start off with","review":"The book is strange. It's written for beginners but they use a lot of jargon that beginners don't know. Also, while they do their best, there is a lot of things that they talk about but don't show pictures for.

The think thats sets Ronny apart from the rest of the field is his street-flavoured, hip hop fusion jazz thing. This album lacks that this ingredient, and if this doesn't bother you, than I think you will love this CD. Only cut I really like is 5/8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever this is, it sure isn't jazz","review":"Let's get something straight from the jump, I own 2 other Ronny Jordan albums. I think he gets excellent tone from his Gibson semi-hollow body. But this album is fully a half step in the wrong direction. If he thinks signing with Blue Notes means he needs to play more jazz, then he needs to develop more chops. The next-to-last cut with vibes demi-god Stefon Harris and drummer Tain Watts proves that; Jordan has absolutely nothing to say in that idiom. And trying to play \\"Mambo Inn\\"?!? Who is he kidding. No serious jazz fan can listen to that without thinking of Grant Green and his Latin Bit album of 35 years ago. Ronny Jordan is like Mike Myers; he has his niche (up-tempo instrumental R&B), but he absolutely shouldn't try Shakespeare (not sell it anyway)......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for saving me concert money","review":"I agree with Bob at the end of these reviews. I listened to this cd and what's Ronny Jordan up to? Hip-hop? Jazz? Easy listening? It's too mixed up. I like all the above but not mixed together.

The point is that he's coming to Anchorage at the end of September and I just saved $60 bucks on tickets."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCARY","review":"I bought this stove a few months ago and finally got around to using it last month in my backyard before a hiking trip. I experienced a catastrophic fuel leak coming from where the fuel line connected to the stove at the valve. I pumped it up, walked away for a few minutes to take answer a call, this was at night by the way, and I lit up the stove to prime, flash! A bigass a flame came off the ground from where there was a giant fuel puddle. Of course, I didn't notice this and I knelt down inside it. I'm OK, but it gave me a huge fright, I was next to the garden hose so I sprayed myself off when my pants caught on fire.Be wary of fuel leaks for whoever is using this or any other liquid fuel stoves. I haven't touched it since. The whole experience pissed me off to high hell and left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously defective","review":"I got this stove today. It was difficult to light with gasoline, but I finally did light it.Unfortunately the pump handle began to leak gasoline, and failed to pump gas after the very first use!A piece of the pump had fallen of into the gas can!As a small pool of gas formed inches from the open flame, next to the metal can of gas, I consider myself lucky to be alive and uninjured.This product is a death machine that should be recalled before it kills, if it hasn't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Stove","review":"This is a well made stove. The base is solid and folds closed to reduce size for packing. I have only tried with liquid fuel so can't say anything about butane operation. Product comes with a windscreen (don't think it stated that) so no need to order an extra. They normally will last a long time.The maintenance kit seems like a good idea. It has everything to keep this stove running. Hopefully they won't be needed for a long time. Products change and parts become unobtainable so buy the kit while you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, Fun and Appealing to Kids","review":"My daughter really enjoys this toy, and likes to make sushi for us, her dolls, etc. I have noticed that it has a lot of novelty to other kids and they are very attracted to it-- every child who has come over to our house (ages 4- 8, boys and girls) since we got it has wanted to examine it and play with it.It is plastic, and I'd say mid-range as plastic toy quality goes, but it is far better than those big packs of plastic food that you can buy at Toys R Us and I expect it to last awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribble Dribble Dribble...","review":"I should have listened to the other Amazon customer who said this is a beautiful decanter EXCEPT it dribbles.

However, I was very surprised when I listened to this CD that man came sick (Especially on maca-frama-lamma #11) . As for Andre Macassi there was no doubt he was gonna come with it and he did fa sho. This whole CD is slap from 1-12. The hottest track has got to be Dredio(#12) with a surprising visit from from the other V-town legend e-40.

I cook for 10+ people every meal so I wash my hands often. There's nothing like working in the kitchen and having your bandage falling off. It stayed in place really nice with the adhesive. The pad didn't stick to my cut which is a added bonus. I feel that for the price it's a good value for peace of mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend the Band-Aid Water Block adhesive ...","review":"I highly recommend the Band-Aid Water Block adhesive bandage! I found it to be longer lasting, less thick and constricting, and a more comfortable wearing bandage. After frequent hand washings, other bandages tend to tear at the edges and fall off, whereas this one didn't. I felt comfortable relying on it to offer me protection in my healthcare profession where frequent handwashing is a necessity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fine cello playing, mediocre conducting","review":"I'd recommend this recording overall, for Slava's glowing tone and impeccable technique. But the conducting is just adequate and a bit unanimous. Still, the price is right, the sound is great, and this is a worthwhile CD, though \\"Great Recording of the Century\\" is a bit much. I also agree with those who say you should also get Ma/English Chamber Orchestra (Sony), which is better overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"try Feuermann's","review":"Rostropovich may be playing himself, but I don't think it is nearly as good as Haydn intended.

BUt if you are looking for only their best stuff, get Just ANother Band from East LA: A collection, which has the best songs from this cd on it (though I wish they included \\"Emily,\\" I happen to like that song a lot). If you get the 2cd set, I don't recommend this cd. I would recommend getting Kiko no matter what, because that is their best cd to have no matter what Los Lobos hit collection you assemble."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY clever and VERY funny","review":"I stumbled across this book and as I am big fan of history made amusing (\\"1066 and All That\\" is another classic in this genre) I immediately bought it.

He loves it too. You just can't beat Will Cuppy for factual information written with lots of clean humor. This is a really painless way to read history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance Post Mortem","review":"This book was compiled by one of Cuppy's acolytes using the notes and writings of perhaps one of the most brilliant and definitely unsung American writers of the past century. Cuppy was indeed that rare breed known as \\"humorists\\"; far more insightful and respected than the mere \\"comedian\\", and far more poignant than the \\"humor writer\\"How such a mind could take his own life before seeing the culmination of this fantastic work is beyond me, but rest assured, you will delight in the fruits of his labors. MUST READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A humorous look at history","review":"Will Cuppy casts the larger-than-life figures of world history in a new light with this burlesque historical review. From the Egyptian pharaohs to our Pilgrim forefathers, no one is immune from his satirical barbs.In a style not unlike James Thurber, Cuppy reveals the great ones in all their human failings and foibles, with a host of irreverent footnotes.Some of the humor is a little dated (1950's), but if you are a fan of this period it is well worthwhile.Illustrated by William Steig, author of \\"Shrek\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Decent Read Based on Some Historic Oddities","review":"Not the most well-written work but an interesting read for the novice historian. This book is organized into miniature stories of the demise of individuals commonly found in history textbooks and popluar lore. At times, Cuppy expands on the story we already know with some interesting anecdotes but he also exposes some real shockers and wonderful stories you cannot easily find elsewhere. It would have been nice to see all of the references as this book could have been a great research tool, but it ends up serving as a neat, quick read that is honestly more entertainment than scholarly. This is not necessarily to say I didn't like the book (I did), but it is obvious it was made for a specific niche market. For the average reader it may be less than engaging but for a history buff \\"Decline\\" is worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Cuppy is to history what Mad Magazine is to literature","review":"By page two I felt cheated.

This is laugh-out-loud humor for the educated. This book is totally irreverent towards everything but the truth -- and even though it was written in the 1940s, it remains fresh and timely: Cuppy does not show us the builders of Western Civilization as heroes nor as villains, but as people who got into some very funny stuff (in all senses of the word). As soon as I discovered Cuppy I knew I had to get as much of his material as I could get my hands on -- and he has never disappointed me.

The fact that this product comes with NO user manual whatsoever is a testament to that.Although there ARE cheaper backup solutions to your Palm, the only one I can think of at the top of my head being using a normal expansion card and specific software like BackupMan or BackupBuddyVFS ($10 to $15 compared to this product for $40 - $50), this product still has >some< practicality.Many people consider a backup card for Palm PDAs for the case that BOTH their PC AND Palm dies on them. Here are some things to consider:-If you have only one expansion card and you lose it with your PDA, you just lost all info on your handheld and card. In the rare case that you lose info backed to your PC, you're out of luck-hearing as how software only backup solutions work well, it may be worth your while to pursue a better deal if u can on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well told and excellent explanations","review":"I found the explanations and basic/simple stories in this book very amusing and helpful.

Season 10 is a mixed bag, you can tell the writers really started running out of ideas. The series finale is incredibly moving and spoiler alert! Ross and Rachel finally get back together (they are so meant to be, seriously!). Monica and Chandler finally get a baby, well twins actually.

Stretching a show when the story is already told is not a good idea. In particular, this season 10 was awful. You can tell it was a rush job. The scripts were weak, when they existed; the actors weren't there, it is obvious that they had enough and that they wanted it over with.The first seasons were OK. The show is still a replica of Seinfield, but maybe because of that we were watching. They should have followed Seinfield's example and leave when they were still having fun at the party. I guess $1M per episode was difficult to reject.Anyway, if you must watch season 10 episodes take advantage of the reruns. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possible Reasons Why Release Date Took So Long","review":"The reason why it probably took so long to release FRIENDS: Season 10 is because I am sure there were syndication rights due to certain networks. That gives the networks that broadcast reruns the chance to obtain higher ratings. I am also sure there were also other \\"legal\\" issues that delayed the release. One thing for sure, I am so glad that it will finally be released. I have waited a long time for this because I want to complete my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon on demand is awful","review":"We downloaded the last episode because the last DVD of our 10 season boxed set was left in somebody's DVD player.We used Amazon as our source because we prefer to do E-commerce with known entities.The quality we received was awful and although watchable...we now know how the series ends, it was a total disappointment.

When a cd can barely get me into 2 songs, it needs work. This is Poison attempting a Punk/Blues album combo and for me it just doesn't do it. I don't automatically like EVERYTHING Poison puts out just because they are a favorite band of mine. This is NOT classic Poison and Bret changes his vocals WAY TOO much. Not to mention no CC input on this album. CC really does help the band out alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Be Better!","review":"Wow... I mean, this album left me speechless. This is hands down, without a shadow of a doubt Poison's best album to date. Look what the cat dragged in, open up and say ah, flesh and blood, and native tongue are great albums, but Blues has the chops to put CC to shame. As far as speed goes, CC rules... but Blues puts notes where they belong and his solos have more feel to them. The only way to describe this album is party songs with meaning (if that's possible).

It worked wonderfully in the beginning, but it started acting crazy after a couple of months. It double clicked on its own when I clicked only once (which is annoying when everything you click pops open). Then it started to lose the optical signal and then it just died.Luckily, it was still under warranty, so I got my replacement. However within 8 months, it broke down again (having the same problem). So I contacted Targus again. But this time they would not replace it because they only replace during the 1 year warranty of the original purchase. It's not like I abused it. I took good care of it. It sucks that Targus will not stand behind their product 100%.Don't purchase this if you don't want to shell out more money to replace every couple of months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse quality from targus ever","review":"This has happened to me for 2 of these mouse now (bought via corporate procurement so NO choice of mouse).

But seen in sincere perspective the film seems to be a video clip of long duration. The presence of the ever-smiling and inexpressive Tom Cruise with his partner Kelly Mc Gillis reveals an absolute presence of sexual chemistry . It is a film without dramatic structure and you feel the rest of the dialogue is forced to show the aerial gun fights and the overwhelming acrobatic scenes to satisfy a furious audience in that decade hunger for the magic of the Video Clips.However Anthony Edwards stole the show , Val Kilmer and Meg Ryan in their ascending careers .Do not search a profound drama . It is absent . But it is a feast for your senses . Good entertainment for the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Gun","review":"This movie is an awesome hit from director Tony Scott (also directed Beverly Hills Cop, Enemy of the State,and much more) dense with fun and excitement that will keep you FLYING for as long as you like. Tom Cruise (Days of Thunder, Jerry Maguire, etc.) stars as hotshot fighter jet pilot \\"Maverick\\" Pete Mitchell, who is elected with his partner \\"Goose\\" (Anthony Edwards) to enter the Navy's very competitive \\"Top Gun\\" program, where many comparible opponents challenge him to win the top rank, including \\"Iceman\\" Tom Kusansky (Val Kilmer) and \\"Slider\\" (Russ Rossovich).

A great action film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I like Top Gun as a movie. A good balance of action, comedy, personal interactions. So my rating is not based on the movie itself - you either like Top Gun or not. My comments are about technical issues only - namely 3-D conversion. Briefly, not impressed. Very poor conversion in my opinion. There were a couple of good 3-D effects in some flying sequences but just a couple. Definitely not the quality of Avatar, most cartoons, and a multitude of others (I own about 40 3-D titles). I see no benefit to this conversion and advise not to buy it if you already have a good DVD or Blu-Ray copy. You will not gain anything. This is the first 3-D movie I can honestly say that if Amazon would let me return it even though I watched it I would have it back in the mail immediately with priority return shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Excited to see one of my favorite movies come out in Blue-Ray 3D.

First off this is a great movie especially if the F-14 is your favorite aircraft. However the picture looks the same as it did when I used to watch this on a 19\\" inch TV in the late 80's on a rented VHS tape. Paramount should be ashamed, this is not even close to 720 let alone 1080. I have old DVD's that offer a better picture in the bluray player then this. Yes it does have a cool menu but the picture is NOT high-Def and the sound is only acceptable when you put the setting on 6.1 DTS Master (only reason I gave 2-stars). If you do not have a good external speaker system do not waste your money because the picture and the sound won't be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE American Classic of the 80's","review":"I saw this in the theater when I was in third grade with two of my best friends. When we left we all wanted to fighter piolts. I can quote almost any line of this film to this DAY! If you have a pulse, this movie is for you! This is the movie that defined the 80's for most men in America. It plays off of cold war, anti-russian sentiment as well as some good ol action. It's been over ten years since this movie was made and I still get chills down my spine every time I hear the theme from this movie!

Will definitely invest in DVD surround sound format eventually.Well worth watching. Typical storyline of trainee falling in love with trainer. However, it goes deeper than that. 'Maverick' has to prove to everyone, including himself, that he is a 'Top Gun' in his own right - not merely a shadow of his father, who flew before him and was KIA.Once you've seen a few movies, the plot becomes predictable, however the action, and also the soundtrack are definitely 5 star!Great flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Tom Cruise, but seriously, is this a 5 star movie?","review":"No, not really, but it is awful close. Movies like Top Gun don't hold my attention for very long usually, whether Tom Cruise is in it or not. This movie is definitly not \\"mach 2 with your hair on fire\\" but it has action, an antagonist who actually comes through (and shows that he is a pretty ok toward the end of the movie) I think there are some very endearing qualities to this movie that would make me want to watch it once or twice, but three times is pushing it. i think that this will have a timeless soundtrack, and that this movie will be viewed for generations to come. Whether or not it is a masterpiece, well, that is certainly debatable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best movie ever made??","review":"It's hard to believe that anyone considers this the best movie ever made.

It's a benchmark in motion picture history ... and worth owning because of it's impact on pop culture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great screen shots","review":"There is no real explanation as to why this film is so good. The acting is not spectacular. Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis are two of the main characters while Val Kilmer and Meg Ryan play their minor roles well but are not phenomenal. The soundtrack to this film is awesome: Take my breath away, Danger Zone, and Great Balls of fire are the highlight tracks. Perhaps the aspect of the film which makes it so special is the fact that while \\"Days of Thunder,\\" had awesome shots within the racecar, \\"Top Gun\\" has hands down the best shots ever within a fighter plane. The dogfights are spectacular. Another aspect of the film that makes it so good is the story itself. A hotshot fighter pilot Maverick is sent to the top flight school in the world where he has to learn to control his flying. There he meets the love interest and the story really takes place. It's one of those great friday night movies. The plot is good and there is some great action. I wholeheartedly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Airplanes are great","review":"The only thing worth watching in this film is the flying scenes.

However, wide-screen isn't really wide screen. it's a 4:3 screen chopped off from top and bottom. in other word, instead of having a whole theatrical picture, what you get is picture that's been chopped up both vertical and horizontally. what we are seeing is only 1/3 of what's filmed, which is even smaller than 4:3. somebody cheated big time from paramount. setup menu is false leading.

The sounds are incredible! I've watched this movie 30 times and still haven't grown tired of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, poor video","review":"Well, this was really a mixed bag for me. Top Gun was always one of my favorite movies growing up, and I've owned it on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray. The lack of aspect ratio information on the box is quite telling, as there is no TRUE widescreen - all video is letterboxed, even on a 16:9 HD LCD TV. The \\"widescreen\\" is simply a cropped version of the full screen edition, with black bars. This was very disappointing to me, as I was hoping for some full 1080 F-14 action.That said, the EXCELLENT DTS 6.1 sound track nearly makes up for the visuals. The encoding seems theater-pure, and is one of the best BD audio tracks I've heard. It's really astonishing how defined the audio is, especially the spatial effects and rumble during the flying sequences. Simply superb audio.Hopefully, Paramount can dig up a better quality version of the master and give us a TRUE widescreen, full HD experience for Top Gun. Until then, this is the best that we've got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Copy","review":"I have now owned this movie on VHS, DVD, and now BD. Unfortunately, the copy from the masters is rather grainy for HD. The audio is outstanding, but again, while it obviously looks better than a DVD, this might be one of the worst BD's I've seen since they came out. I know that the masters are 20 years old, but the BD of Halloween looks AMAZING, and that movie is 30 years old. I must admit that I had high hopes, and was a little dissapointed. My reccomendation would be wait until they release the \\"Special Edition,\\" which I'm sure they undoubtedly will.Side note: extras are all in SD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Widescreen format is a joke","review":"The widescreen version of this movie, is actually just the full screen version with the top and bottom replaced with black bars. This means even more is cropped from the movie, and you actually see even LESS than the full screen. This is fraudulent, and the video and sound quality are mediocre. It's a real shoddy job for such a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL TRANSFER","review":"The quality of the transfer on the blue ray disc I have was awful-one of the worst I have seen for grain. I use a sony PS3 blue ray player and a sharp elite 70\\" led tv which is basically a referance tv set. To get the ascpect ration the film was cropped top and bottom from original but its the grain that is plain awful. The sound track rocks however and makes up for the picture quality somewhat. As a comparision I put in my original DVD and let my new set up convert the quality and it looked just as good as the blur ray version. The 3d is very nice and its a real shame that this picture did not get the treatment it deserves. Hopefully with a new top gun in the works in a few years maybe we will see a new release with the original up to snuff but until then avoid this disc if you have a quality set."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPECULATIVE FANTASY?","review":"It never ceases to amaze me that some people actually beleve \\"TOP GUN\\" has a basis in reality.

The reason I am giving it one star is the quality on the 3d Blue ray is so bad that it makes VHS tapes look good. The picture is so grainy that there is one scene in the beginning when there flying back to the aircraft carrier at night that you can barely makke out the jet against the night sky. That is how bad it is. I did not expect the 3d effect to be stellar since it was being converted from a movie from 1986. But, did expect the picture quality not to be so grainy and look like garbage. The non-3d blue ray looks fantastic and did enjoy the regular blue ray. I will never watch the 3d version again becsuse the 3d quality is so bad that it is unwatchable.

I was convinced at first I must have received a defective copy but after reading the other reviews clearly that is not the case. One of my favorite action movies ever...ruined to the point of who cares about the 3D, the graininess is so bad in many scenes that it is un-watchable IMO. Much better off just watching the 2D blu-ray disk, which I already owned so now I have two. Sigh, lesson learned - never pre-order a new release.Also note that almost every review SINCE THE 3D BLU-RAY RELEASE has been 1 or 2 stars. The high ratings for this disc were written BEFORE it was even released (I hate it when people do that). If you look at the actual post-release ratings, it gets about a 1-1/2 star rating, which should tell you something.Shame on Paramount Studios for releasing a garbage 3D transfer of a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"chopped off heads","review":"DONT BUY IT, great blu ray quality. but it zooomed up and u will see the screen with some chopped off forheads and background.

But the irony is WWII propaganda movies had a purpose, and the real problem is Topgun just isn't any good. It's cute simply because the film has NO basis in reality. For jet planes-insert-rockets ships to mars-or maybe-racing cars-? The cast of two dimensional characters can't help a bad idea, BUT the sound track is pretty good.Hindsight shows us that Tom Cruise has been-in general-playing the same guy for the last-what-19 years. Whether he's acting at flying a jet or flying a bar, he still plays the same grinning, depthless character. The last time TC really acted was in \\"Rainman,\\" and sadly he was passed over.Topgun like an injured horse should be put to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray no improvement here","review":"I bought Top Gun on Blu-Ray as my first BD disc, in part because it was relatively inexpensive, but also because I was excited to see the dogfight sequences in high def.Unfortunately, it looks to me like only the dialog sequences were improved by the change in format. The dogfights, the carrier take-offs and landings, and the other scenes with the (still cool and exciting F14 Tomcat) look like they are in standard def.With that disappointment, it was hard to get excited by this movie. The dialog is so painfully cheesy that unless you are are teenager, there was no real reason to watch it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough cheese to cause heart disease","review":"Yes, this film deserves credit for the technical work on the flying scenes. I won't repeat all the reasons for not having much respect for the film (they're all here) but for those of you with sharp eyes: Watch over Cruise's left shoulder when he's flying. That brass wheel is a tool used to separate the main beam from the catapult when disassembling the ejection seat. (Strike 1!) Also - the \\"MiG-28\\" (AKA an American-built Northrop F-5 Tiger) has two guns, yes, but they're in the nose. (Strike 2!) Finally, anyone that reckless wouldn't be trusted with a government vehicle, never mind a fighter aircraft. (Strike 3!) So... its a fun movie in a comic-book sort of way, but don't take it seriously, it will only make one's head hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top Gun Stream","review":"This is a great movie, lots of action and great acting. And then there's Kenny Loggins music. Sound isn't great, and no CC. When you are half deaf CC makes the viewing experience much more enjoyable. This stream isn't HD, but not too bad.

This is an over the top movie that is replete with lousy acting, slipshod story writing, and is wanting in creativity, style, and quality. Perhaps it is because this movie is 20 years old that much of it appears to be outdated, but it does seem as though there could have been more improvements. Of course, CGI technology was not as advanced back then, so it is hard to hold the movie to such a high standard. Perhaps the worst part of Top Gun are the hackneyed lines that are contained throughout the movie. The lines could have been written by any immature 13-year-old boy with a lot of spare time on his hands. Although the creators of the movie obviously intended the movie to be timeless, they did a very poor job of it. This is the worst military-oriented movie ever created.

But the addition of the second disk really makes this a great deal. The background of the film and the commentary from those Naval aviators who did the flying made this something I could not pass up.I was lucky enough to get a ride in an F-4 and land on the USS Eisenhower in the '70s, and the term \\"postage stamp in the middle of the ocean\\" doesn't begin to describe what you see.This is a great deal, and I recommend it to all.."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies from the 80's","review":"This movie has it all! from great fighter plane action to inspiration! and more.... great balls of fire!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, a true film classic!","review":"This movie has always been one of my top favorites both for just being a great movie to one of the best for sound. The launch off the flight deck at the beginning of the movie is one of the most awesome visual and audio recordings of a carrier launch that I've ever seen. I haven't stood on a carrier deck during a launch but this is the closest I've been. I fell in lust with Kelly McGillis in this movie and have loved her since. And, as a pilot but not jets darn-it, I loved all the flying sequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"the jets have more personality than the characters","review":"Ok, I like this movie and watch it often (at least, I watch the flying scenes a lot, a nice benefit of DVD) but the script is weak and the characters laughable. Tom Cruise would have been busted out of the Navy in the first 10 minutes, and the dialogue is painful. But the cinematography is terrific, and they have lots of real shots of carrier operations and F-14s (even if the film-makers have little comprehension of modern air combat). Watch it straight through only if you're nostalgic for the 80's. Great supporting cast with little to do.

It's more fun than the colorized version of 'Night of the living Dead' on Halloween. In fact, like all the 80's classics, it quite nicely walks that slender line between sly homage and genuine barn-burning horror. It also has some serious spirituality sneaking around in it, but nothing so heavy-handed as to interfere with the good-humoured, intense storytelling. Hey, 'Night of the Beast' would make one [heck] of a movie (pun fully intended). It is morbid, horrifying, emotionally moving, fast and at times even laugh-out-loud funny. If you like your horror fiction served the old-fashioned way, \\"Night of the Beast\\" delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror that doesn't quit","review":"This book is thrilling terrifying. And, it doesn't just scare you while you are reading it. It sneaks up on you later when you are driving around or doing the dishes. Very creepy.

I think the reason it failed there was because it was marketed as a horror film with killer rats, and to me, it isn't a horror film. The film is primarily about one man's descent into madness; the rats in this film serve more to illustrate this, rather than as a tool for horror and scares. The most important things about this film are the atmosphere, which throughout the film is creepy and gothic, and the acting, which is silmply fantastic.

This director did not. Why the special effects? Oh ya, i forgot when you have untalented people in Hollywood you need special effects.

The movie was actually so bad that it prompted me to write my first negative review on Amazon. From the other reviews, you should have gotten a synopsis of the film. Now I didn't know that this film was a remake, it might have been a great movie during that era but for the generation that grew up on the likes of Fight Club, Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smokin Barrels, this take-it-to-the-man story just doesn't mean much. It's simply just creepy. I'd give it one star if the performance of Crispin Glover didn't make this film a bit less dull. Whatever metaphors, allegories or themes the film was suppose to invoke seemed to be completely overshadowed by the mere creepy factor that is this film. I bought this film (used) for one dollar, and it is so bad that I don't want to even keep it in my collection, I'm simply going to put it back where I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"The only reason that I did not like this movie is because it is not what I expected. It was not a bad movie, it is just not the movie that the trailers made me believe it would be.Crispin Glover gives the performance of his lifetime. I guess the rats do as well.I won't get in to the whole story as others have already covered it very well.All I can say is, I thought it was going to be this horrific story of Crispin leading the rats to enact his vengeance on those who cross his path. That is correct in the one case where he has them attack his boss. But then the movie turns, almost instantly, to be a Crispin versus the rats movie. That is not what I wanted and what I wanted is not what I got.Also, from the trailers, I was led to believe that he hated his mother. That is not true either.I guess that is my only true gripe. It is not what you are led to believe it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crispin i love you","review":"Oh i love this film, i love it, i love it.Crispin Glover's performance should win him an Oscar without a doubt. The only other actor of Crispin's generation i rate as highly is Sean Penn. You see Crispin like Sean does not care about looking cool and hip on screen, instead he wants to make the character he is playing as realistic as possible. I do not know how Mr Glover managed to deliver what must be, the greatest performance by a male actor since Sean Penn's performance in Hurly Burly. Yes Crispin is that good, this film will make all the under-dog men in the world, cry and laugh, as Willard fights back against his evil boss.I love his relationship with the rats \\"Tear it Tear it Tear it up\\" I completly identify with his relationship with Socrates, animals are so comforting, in this cold hard world.This film is beautiful to behold.Please. Film-makers of the world, Crispin should be staring in more films as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rats","review":"This is a great film. Its a bit hard to see at times, just because of the lighting techniques they used, but I feel like it really sells the visual effects. But what really stands out about this dvd is the bound material.

You just don't get that kind of stuff nowadays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whaaaaaat????????","review":"Ok, the only good thing about this movie, if you can call it GOOD, is Crispin Glover's performance. Other than that, this is a boring movie!! Too slow paced and silly at times. I was disappointed in this movie. The rats didn't bother me at all, what bothered me was the fact that this movie was such a letdown. If you intend to see this film, prepared to be bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"You guys are talking about the same film?","review":"First, a round of applause for Crispen and now the brutal truth. This remake was shot in a very unique style that I rather enjoyed, but the film itself was a dreary thing to sit through. There is no horror, no suspense, and the only creepiness is a terrific performance by Crispen Glover. I usually enjoy a twisted little flick, but was sorely disappointed in this attempt to keep me interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS: PLEASE, do NOT call this a horror movie...thank u!","review":"A movie about an idiot and his friends, which are rats...this is what \\"Willard\\" is about.

With diffrent game modes and tons of variations for every fighter each with a unique style to master you wont belive the fun this game has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold your horses fighting fans","review":"I am a big fan of fighting games, so when I saw last blade 2 for the sega dreamcast at a fair price I decided to give it a go. I was a big fan of other games of SNK's such as samurai showdown, but when I put this game in my system the first thing that I noticed was dated graphics. I wasn't sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me so I ventured on. The next thing I noticed was that it is pretty much basic fighting. There were no fire balls or hurricane kicks, just slicing with knifes and simplistic button mashing. In conclusion if some of you amatuer fighting game fans are looking for something to play an expirenced person at then this might give you the upper hand. But if you are a fan of the high flying moves then maybe this is a rental game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful game","review":"If this game were for the original Nintendo it might be decent but even then it would be hard pressed to find an excuse for why it plays so badly.I like 2D fighters. I still think Street Fighter 2 is one of the best games ever made. Samurai Showdown is another classic example of a great 2D fighter. It was this game that made me decide to pick Last Blade 2 up. If you also loved Samurai Showdown and are considering picking this game up, don't! This game is just awful.From the lackluster graphics (even for a 2D game) to the four frames of animation per sprite (character) this game is just a poor example of what fighting games should be. If you want a 2D fighter stick to the Capcom games and you should be fine. If you just want a great fighting game, Dreamcast has one of the best in Soul Calibur. If you're into samurai, get Bleemcast (or a PSOne or PS2) and get Bushido Blade 2, but by all means, ignore this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A devastating exploration of a serious ill-minded man!","review":"\\"The criminal life of Archibaldo de la Cruz\\" is a fabulous and demolishing portrait of a perverted aristocrat who since he was a child believed firmly the possession of a music box, intermingled with a legend of a king, has conferred him if dark powers to kill just when he wishes it.Bunuel explores with zealous realism every one of the branches of the society, political, religious and social conventions and arrangements, crumbling and excoriating them with implacable lucidity.A powerful, brilliant and very original proposal, that would find -years later in Carlos Saura- a memorable tribute with Cria cuervos.A must see and another powerful evidence of the genius of this Spanish master filmmaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended for gundam fans!!!","review":"a gundam fan myself, i bought this boxed set out of impluse seeing that it has the complete collection in three discs, for $39...too good of a deal. i did a little more research & found out that this collection compressed all 10 discs into a movie format. many of the important scences are missing & too much will be happening. i canceled my order & will wait for the price to drop on the economy box set with all 5 discs per season"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"I too bought this Set for the \\"Amazing price\\" that it sells for.

He misses the mark. In fact, i don't even think he is aiming at target. He quotes dissenting authors and Protestants on how they see Catholicism. The only time he capitalizes \\"Church\\" is when he is talking about both Protestants and Catholics together holding hands- pg. 9. His discreet language at times is misleading on what the church really teaches. he also keeps bringing up the church killing \\"millions of witches.\\" this is just historically wrong. he has a revisionist history of almost every time period in church history, promotes women's ordination, and following modern scholarship on the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith. i bought it used and it was still a waste of 4 dollars and a couple hours of my life. i can't believe this guy is a professor. sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"What DOES Make Us Catholic???","review":"I just finished Thomas Groome's \\"What Makes Us Catholic\\" and found it to be worthwhile reading.

However, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Baptists, Lutherans, and a whole host of other denominations also call themselves Christians. Then I must ask myself, \\"What's the difference between a 'Catholic' Christian and a 'Pentecostal' Christian?\\" Obviously both consider themselves Christian, yet if you look at the two religions they have very little in common.

These reviews do not give a fair and objective review of the book on it's merits. If you look at the earlier reviews of this book, most give it 4 or 5 stars. The book has been very successful because it clearly tells the reader why they must read God's Word to discover His plan for their life. Dan answers the excuses people give for not reading the Bible, the major benefits of reading the Bible and gives a review of all 66 books, main characters and concepts of the Bible.

If you are looking for a working person's view of reasons to read God's Word, this is a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"grinding axes","review":"Please note that all the reviews (Pro and Con) are from the general Houston,Texas area where the author has a radio talk show.Getting beyond views of his politics and back to the content of the book-it is inspirational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and naive","review":"I was hoping for a common sense guide, with a pragmatic approach to the Bible, and while the author tries hard to acheive this, he gets lost in marginally literate writing style and self-center voice. I am not sure if he is trying to prove that he and the people he knows are very important because of their faith or is actually trying to facilitate the reader's understanding of the bible. Basically any real connection to God is obscured by the writers pride. The book was lacking in any real depth of spirit, and suggests that the writer, while probablly a man of faith, has little understanding on how to communicate it on any but the most surface level. The book suggests that his understanding of the Bible is concrete and fails to uncover the beauty and wisdom that lies beneath a literal interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a good book for neophytes like me who has not studied the Bible very much. Dan's sincerity and enthusiasm makes up for his less than stellar writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial Junk","review":"I totally agree with King Alphonso the Wise, \\"If this is the way God did it, I could have given him some very useful advice.\\" Apparently God isn't all knowing or all powerful enough to write a book that sells out its first edition, instead God gets remaindered. A little old lady neighbor that meant well gave me a copy that she picked up at a church rummage sale. The book contains superficial overviews of the Bible corrupted by Dan Patrick's vanity and self-centeredness. This is blasphemous exploitation at its worst. The book really saddens me,since, in all religions, goodness starts with love and humility. This book, since it perverts our most sacred values, poisons our society. At least nobody seems to be reading it. Try again, God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irony defined","review":"I'm not quite sure what to make of this author, who spews hatred of gays, minorities, democrats etc...on a daily basis from the hate radio station he owns, commenting on the teachings of the Bible.For someone who spends all his waking hours spewing hatred and divisiveness to write a book of this nature, boggles the mind. Your money is better spent reading works from someone who actually understands the teachings of the bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"This bold and arrogant title should turn off any thinking person.

Also, please pay special attention to one particular commentary by Jim Cornette, in which i just couldn't stop laughing as i listened to it). Bottom line, it's a can't miss item INDEED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The War is Over but the Battle Lives On (WWE vs TNA)!","review":"The only reason why I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because even though the documentary as a whole was very good, I wished there was an additional DVD on it that featured more classic matches from Raw and Nitro and more additional interviews. I was a little upset when they censored Ravishing Rick Rude taking cheap shots at the WWE in the Extra's menu because he said more than they shown on the DVD. They also censored X-Pac's interview when he's taking cheap shots at Hogan and Bischoff when the showed the clip of him going back to the WWE from WCW. I did think Eric Bischoff did a great job telling his side of the story but he did leave out some small (but major) details as well as Vince holding back some info. Overall, a nice WWE DVD to add to your collection. I just wish they added more matches and interviews. TNA better watch themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was OK, but one sided...","review":"It would've been nicer to get the story of the Monday night wars from both sides. Sure, Eric Bischoff, Paul \\"Giant/Big Show\\" Wight, Chris Jericho, Benoit, and Eddie Guerrero of the former WCW put in their 2 cents but they all work for WWE now and you know they're not going to bash their bread and butter even if WCW is defunct. A nice trip down memory lane nonetheless. Gerry Brisco is such an ass kissing yes-man. Those segments alone made me want to Ebay this DVD.WWE's starting to look like the WCW of 1999-2001 now...

They show anything and everything and hold nothing back. I personally liked WWF much much more then WCW but I guess I never really realized just how bad WWF was being smashed by WCW. Don't get me wrong WCW had awesome talent but as I look back to 95 and through the years of the battle I thought WCW didnt know how to use the talent in which they had. I thought the story lines were stupid WWF had better storylines better matches, Better Pay Per Views and so on...WCW did slaughter WWF for 83 consective weeks but like i said in my opinion I still felt WWF was the better program due to the way they used their talent, better matches, and better pay per view eventsThis dvd covers it all, if you contemplating getting this dvd, do yourself that favor and get it.

I was pleased with the way it was presented, the documentary-style production presented both sides of the story in a very fair way. But many unforgettable moments were either left off of or shown briefly, and for hardcore fans like me it left something missing.About the extras, I have to agree with one review I read, stating that of all the great matches on Raw, they chose a tag match, but was very pleased with the inclusion of the Flair & Horsemen comeback at Nitro, which to this day still gives me goosebumps.I recommend the DVD to anyone new to wrestling because that era layed the groundwork for what wrestling is today, however for us old fans it revives a lot of memories, but leaves some of the best ones out.Hopefully WWE will produce separate documentary-stylye DVD's chronicalling the evolution of both RAW and NITRO."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good.","review":"it is very strong. if you like mono stick with it. no give, tangles are impossible to sort and buries on your spool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I put this line on a high-end fresh-water spinning reel, and after several months, used it for the first time.

For years I've been contemplating using this type of line, and was looking forward to casting out and not seeing twirly string floating on the water. I loaded my Zebco 33 with 10 pound test and went out for cats. On the first cast, I went out about 10 feet before it snagged in the reel. I spent several minutes casting, pulling several armlengths of string out of my reel, reeling up and repeating until I could cast about 40 yards without hanging up. After a successful cast, I let my bait sink to the bottom and caught a catfish about 5 minutes later. Fish landed and bagged, I went to cast out again. This time, the line went out about 4 feet before it snagged. I repeated the process twice before I gave up and packed that rod and reel away.

The love of the parents for both big sister and baby is obvious on every page. The illustrations are compelling and the story is warmly reassuring. The big sister is genuinely helped by both parents and grandma--she's not forced to grow up too quickly, she's neither ignored nor pampered. She's loved and equipped for loving. Just the right balance of family members getting along. The illustrations of waiting are so what a child would feel and a mom would help with. That the child is allowed to dress herself is even better. Just delightful. The children I've read it to ask for it to be read again and again.

Awful in low light. Setup and configuration procedures are draconian. The motor is LOUD when you pan or tilt.It's entirely possible I'm being unfair. There are challenges for compressing and delivering video over wireless or ethernet. Sacrifices in image quality must be made to limit bandwidth.

Take a listen! Seems she fell off the map with this one; who knows why? It's a direct continuation of the eclecticness of \\"Ancient Heart\\". Songs for introspection, for falling in love, for writing. Though vastly different, her strong female sensuality is similar to Irish lass Sinead O'Connor's and British siren Kate Bush's work.

On the one hand, it appears that the authors wanted to publish a book of arty fence photographs (and indeed the book includes a number of lush, imaginative shots), while at the same time offering a how-to guide for fence building. Unfortunately, the how-to portion keeps the book from being a bona fide artistic endeavor, while the space and presentation given to artsy fence portraits prevents the book from ever developing into a sufficiently comprehensive building guide. Bottom line: don't expect this book to deliver an adequate lesson in actual fence-building techniques, if you don't have building skills to begin with; but if you just want to look at pictures of a bunch of other people's fences, you probably won't be too disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the imported version with SACD","review":"This CD was listed as a CD/SACD + DVD on the depechemode.com website.

I listen to this CD almost every single day. The music is just so dark, sexy, and seductive, and David Gahan's voice goes so well with the music. I just can't help, but to say over and over that I absolutely LOVE this album. I agree with another reviewer who said that \\"Policy of Truth\\" was the best DM song ever made, but along with that song my favorites include: The World in my Eyes, Sweetest Perfection, Halo, and who can forget the 2 biggest hits which were Personal Jesus & Enjoy the Silence. This CD is a winner.

I choose 'PL II music'mode from my home theater from the dvd disc with DTS 5.1 then i was blown away from all new exprerience ! especially from this 'Vilator'.

I admit, I do like it pretty much, I like Martin's lyrics a lot and the music is quite good. I liked about more than half of the tracks (seven or eight of them) and I thought the music for both \\"Blue Dress\\" and \\"Personal Jesus\\" are great. However, I am not giving this album a perfect five as I thought some of the music sounded a tiny bit the same such as \\"World in My Eyes\\" and \\"Halo\\" may give some people a feeling that they resemble.

It's a personal all around favorite song of mine of ANY band as well. The way it moves, the melody, the chord pattern, it's truly a magnificent piece of music.Although just that tune alone would bring the CD to 5 stars, there's plenty of other great tunes here. \\"Policy Of Truth\\" also gives you that noir tinged musical feel. I liken DM to a musical thunderstorm. Listening is like watching the sky blacken and lightening and thunder approaching. I hope that makes sense to someone other than me. \\"Personal Jesus\\" is another dark classic for devout fans of DM.The \\"Violator\\" CD is perhaps the most commercially viable and well known CD of this band. Therefore, if you like Depeche Mode, adding \\"Violator\\" to YOUR CD collection would be the \\"Sweetest Perfection\\" of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"At their finest moment","review":"I am a big DM fan....I believe that the height of their best work is the \\"violator\\".

This is genius! I hope they plan to have each of their albums redone in this manner. The true prize is the DVD. If you appreciate viewing intimate interviews with the songwriter, producers, musicans, and other key players as well as an insight into each track and how they came about, this is a must have. Best of all, the DVD features current interviews of Alan Wilder and for those who appreciate his past contribution to Depeche's music, it is certainly a treat to see him again. I did heed the advice of others who suggested purchasing the import. A great addition for collectors and fans of Depeche Mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the import version instead","review":"For whatever reason, Rhino decided to leave off the SACD layer of all three U.S. Depeche Mode re-releases, which is a real shame. If you have an SACD set-up, the audio quality of the import versions is noticably better (especially on \\"Speak & Spell\\"). Plus the DVD is region free, so the import video will still play in your PC or Mac (although it will not play on your TV, unless you have a DVD player that can convert PAL to NTSC). I highly recommend sending Rhino a message that selling watered-down versions in the U.S. is unacceptable, by purchasing the Mute label import version instead (all three of which are outstanding)."},{"rating":"2","title":"80s but a goodie! Awesome beat!","review":"I've always loved Depeche Mode and I still do. I thought that I'd get tired of listening to them...I thought wrong. I got this as a birthday gift and too bad that \\"Strangelove\\" is not in this cd. Well, I guess I'll have to buy a cd with that song. \\"World in My Eyes\\" is intriguing, enigmatic, and explosive. Love the \\"Policy of Truth\\"...love his deep voice...how can you deny Depeche Mode? Lovelovelove! Thank you Depeche Mode for creating awesome music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their greatest recording","review":"There is no filler on this CD.It contains only nine tracks, and anymore would be overwhelming, because all of these tracks will move your soul as well as your feet. The bulk of these songs are touching, moving, and are hard to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every single track up to par","review":"This is one of those albums that doesn't disappoint. Every, and i mean EVERY, track on this album is a hit. Not one dud. What i like best about Violator is the dance-ability of most the songs, i.e. \\"world in my eyes\\", \\"enjoy the silence\\"; hence most songs are rather upbeat. \\"Blue Dress\\" is a hauntingly beautiful slow track reminiscent of \\"Somebody\\", which i listened to over and over, it's just beautiful. DM has the reputation of being dark and gloomy but they actually aren't so different from OMD or New Order, esp. on this album. The Goth-Pop association is something i've never really understood, for DM represents euro-alt-synth-wave-techno-dance more than anything else. 5 stars is not enough for this album--it's a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"That album is THE BEST !!!","review":"I am a great fan of DM (and various other synthie, gothic and wave bands) and Violator is definietly their best album ... a bit different from the earlier albums but still rocgnisable as a DM part of work after listening to any song for a few seconds. I love the way they introduced some guitar (and yes, go to a DM concert and watch the crowd when they play Personal Jesus ... boy, that rocks !!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahh, junior high memories...","review":"This is the only tape I bought in 8th grade that I don't want to hide (laff, late 80's). I actually hardly listened to this tape except for the usual radio singles, which I already had taped off the radio in the 1st place. I didn't get heavily into this cd (had to replace the tape) until a couple of years ago & ahhhh, I love it. Upbeat songs, slow songs, dance songs...it rules. One of the few bands I can say I've liked since junior high, & since I saw them in concer for the singles tour, they've become 1 of my favorite bands by far, along with The Cure. It's kind of hard to say why you should get this cd (other than because this is a great band) if you don't have it, unless you're looking for something not too heavy & dark. I think Dave Gahan's voice is at its best on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"What can be said that's enough for this album? Simply a masterpiece, if not the best, one of the best albums by Depeche Mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!!","review":"I'm a bit too young to have experience these songs the first time these songs were released. Having only heard some of these songs on the radio, it's great to experience the album in all it's glory.The sound quality is great and the music is deep, dark and raw. A great listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DM's best","review":"After having listened to some six of their albums, this is by far the best one I've encountered, with only one main shortcoming: it leaves you wanting more, since it only runs for 9 songs at approx. 5 minutes each. This album was such a pivotal point in their careers that their 2001 Exciter Tour DVD (ten years after the album was first released) showcases the album's three best works: \\"Waiting for the Night,\\" \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" and \\"Personal Jesus.\\" Yet, incredible tracks like the brilliant \\"Halo\\" and the intimate \\"Blue Dress\\" are missing... The point is this is one incredible album you can't get enough of. Though there have been some great works following it throughout the nineties, 'Ultra' is the only one that comes remotely close, and 'Violator' retains the place of Depeche Mode's best production to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Violated.","review":"Their album prior to this may have been called \\"Music For The Masses\\", but this is the one that really made them huge. It's easily their most popular, and probably their best. It's a near perfect mix of alt-rock, goth, and electronica. This includes the hits \\"Personal Jesus\\", \\"Policy Of Truth\\", and the excellent \\"Enjoy The Silence\\". But other tracks like \\"World In My Eyes\\", \\"Clean\\", and \\"Waiting For The Night\\" are just as good. They have many other great albums, but none of them are so short on filler. I think the better name for this might have been \\"Sweetest Perfection\\". Almost half of these songs are on \\"The Singles 86-98\\" as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sweetest Perfection...really.","review":"What can I say besides WOW. I bought this album a couple of years ago because the singles, like \\"Personal Jesus\\" and \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" kept getting stuck in my head as I was trying to get through my otherwise mundane day. I certainly don't regret it because DM is one of my favorite bands now.This is one of those rare records where there is no low point--everything is excellent. It also has, to an extent, a universal appeal. No matter what your \\"scene\\" is, you will find enjoyment and perfection in this record. It is, to this moment, the best DM record ever made. I can only hope that Martin, Dave, and Andy can exceed their own standard one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"another poor remaster","review":"Let me begin by saying that I love Depeche Mode, and this is one of their best albums IMHO. Unfortunately, this remaster is like so many others from the 80s with a bloated mastering level and squashed dynamic range. Compared with the original CD it sounds thin and fatiguing. Maybe this is a conscious effort on the part of record producers to make the sound more friendly to compression to MP3 format or to listening on a portable device with really poor earbuds. However, when played on a high performance system the sound really suffers. Listeners are encouraged to check out this phenomenon [...]. Do yourself a favor and hold on dearly to the original CD. It sounds much more potent and involving. The same goes for other remastered music from the great 80s. Regard the remasters with a healthy dose of skepticism. Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the sweetest perfection!!","review":"This is my favorite album of all time. It is not only DM's best but the best of all synth/new wave. This album has such power and emotion behind it. The feeling u have when u listen to it is unexplainable. If everyone on the planet owned a copy of Violator silly as it sounds.. I think the world would be a much calmer place. and if there was such a thing as perfection.. this would be it. I wore the cd out back in 1990 when I lived in Germany where Depeche Mode are gods and I continue to do so. My favorite songs are Halo, World in My Eyes, Policy of Truth.. ok ok so I can't name just one.. LOL the whole thing is a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This will be the World in your Eyes....","review":"Probably the best of Depeche Mode.. and let's just say that I'm one of the \\"devoted\\"... As already said in another review, this is now more than 10 years old but would still be able to get at the top of certain charts. I liked the planar style of Exciter, and was hardly caught by the alternative sounds of \\"Song of Faith and Devotion\\", but I don't think anything from them will ever beat \\"Violator\\"Put your headphones on, you're won't regret the first beats : \\"World in my eyes\\" is pounding with good but not to agressive electronic. Probably the best DM Beat I never heard.It his true that there is only 9 songs. Also that 1 or 2 of these could have been worked harder (we unfortunatly all know that 1 or 2 good ones is usually enough for Depeche Mode to sell a lot) But the others, specialy \\"World in My eyes\\" and Policy of Truth\\", are the jewels of my DM collection..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Violator..a beautiful masterpiece","review":"Violator was Depeche Mode's best-selling album and is considered one of the best(if not the best) selling electronic albums of all time. But labeling the music \\"electronic\\" throws it in a confining category. Martin Gore is truly one of this century's best songwriters. The lyrics are sad, sensual, honest, and very moving. Critics who say electronic music can't bring forth emotions need to listen to this record. Tracks like \\"Waiting for the Night\\", \\"Blue Dress\\", and \\"World in My Eyes\\" still give me chills..and I bought this album when it was released over a decade ago. This isn't just a great electronic album, it is one of the best albums of all time. If you are new to Depeche Mode, this is an amazing introduction. It'll become one of your favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Vivacious Vinyl","review":"Out of my entire collection, this is one of the best sounding new vinyl records I've ever come across. I wanted to give some details on the 2008 reissue Amazon is selling.The jacket is a quality gatefold, with black matte finish. Minimalist artwork. Commentary by Daniel Miller on the album's impact and success. Inner sleeve is printed with lyrics and artwork. Vinyl is thick, 180 gram, little to no surface noise. Sibilance becomes noticeable with the inner bands, but overall quality is very good! Printed in Canada.If you have to buy this album, I highly recommend the vinyl release."},{"rating":"2","title":"you CAN wear out a CD","review":"This is the most I have ever played a CD.

This last one displays Pierce at his puckish best, with lyrics that read like superb poetry, coupled with catchy melodies and arrangements.This man's music is like sushi, you either don't like it, or you're hooked for life.

There was actually a hit song from this album (\\"Just Want To Hold You\\" reached #34 on the charts). Jasmine has a good voice, but this album sounds too much like a lost Paula Abdul album. It has that same kind of \\"late '80s early '90s R&B; influenced pop\\" feel to it. But it's still better than most albums recorded by actresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Whitley Gilbert she was tart and peppery, but as Jasmine Guy she's smooth and sensual","review":"Not a bulls-eye from start to finish, but still a sweet, sexy album that is solid and consistent, especially the slow, tender ballad \\"Just Want To Hold You\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT WAY TO CONNECT THE PERSONALITY AND HEALTH","review":"This is a great book to learn about personality and health.

The experiments (this book is entirely experiments - which I disliked) take a long time to set up.

The plot is interesting and likable as are the main characters. This film is a refreshing change from the usual Peckinpah fare. It's actually rather light in tone though with a harsh desert scenery and setting that lends grandeur. The New York Times called it, \\"Peckinpah's gentlest, boldest and perhaps most likable film to date.\\" And this is accurate. The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars was the ending which seemed a little convenient, if not forced. But that doesn't mean it isn't worth catching. Overall it's a pretty fun little movie from 1970."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for the Western lover!","review":"This is an older movie but it is a really great story.

My intellectual knowledge has expanded tremendously on the issues of gender, racism, racial prejudice, ethnic cultures, sexism, and classism thanks to this great scholar book. On my 22nd birthday I was given this new edition and I am glad a new edition was released with more updates and information.I recommend this book to any person interested in those issues and concepts that shape our everyday life and our sociological evolution as humans. I am a university student of history and I have found this book to be a valuable tool for research papers and self-education.I strongly recommend this book.

This is a text required for grad school---a diversity class.

If you want an arcade b-ball game, get NBA Showtime.This game also tries to be a basketball simulator - and fails. All those wonderful offensive sets to be run, but the only thing that works is to plow towards the basket with the turbo button pressed.

Well, maybe a LITTLE...","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. The writing was decent, and the story wasn't BAD, but the \\"metal\\" part of the book seemed forced to me. It was the story of a young man who likes to party, who has friends who like to party, and then falls in love with a girl. The metal parts of the book couldn't almost been added after it was written. \\"I made her a mix tape, and here are the bands on it,\\" he basically says (not word-for-word). Wow, impressive.

I look forward to more from him in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to disagree with most of these reviews","review":"It's easy to tell the author is just embellishing his own thoughts and experiences, and what it really comes down to is he's just full of crap for the most part. He is name dropping bands left and right and trying to give a quick crash course in the rise of Norwegian black metal before turning around and talking about bands like Shadow's Fall. Anyone who actually pays attention to the music when they hear it knows this band is worthless metalcore crap. He also prefers Possessed over the band Death. Yikes. I eased up on the judgmental stuff when I saw how young he was, but it didn't excuse the repetitive nature of the writing itself. He spends much of the book with the same setup: the metal head character screws things up with his too-good-to-be-true girlfriend, has to apologize, and they make up until it happens again. Some of the dialogue is funny, some of it is just bad. It was a quick, easy read for a few days on a train, I'll give it that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A caricature of a movie","review":"I am not an expert on the historical accuracy of this account of Wild Bill's life. It seems to be a bit off. Overall, this movie is disjointed, uneven, poorly written, moderately well acted given the material,and very badly directed. None of the characters feel genuine. None of the settings feel authentic. Wild Bill's character has no depth. Jane seems to clean and pretty to be the hard drinking person she was. David Arquette's performance as Jack McCall is out of the blue and terrible. I gave this film 1 star for the people in the cast I like, namely Jeff Bridges and Ellen Barkin. Avoid this portrayal of Hickok at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE, JUNK!","review":"THIS IS A VERY INACCURATE MOVIE. JEFF BRIDGES ACTING IS GOOD AND SO ARE THE COSTUMES.

Granted, there are a lot of historical facts that creep into the story, like the fact that Hickok was developing glaucoma, and he spent time in a drug induced haze in the opium parlours. But the rest is pure hogwash. If this is the best that Jeff Daniels can do, then Jeff my boy, HANG IT UP. He staggered through this mess like a drunken man. Even more annoying were the flash backs that popped up. It wasn't so much that, it just made the story hard to follow.

Bridges performance as Wild Bill doesnt completely white-wash the character and so you may or may not like that. I enjoyed it and as a student of the life and legend of James Butler Hickok I had a good time spotting the myths and legends used to make this film. It sure seems to me that director Hill had to make a lot of cuts to decrease the running time of this film and I bet the director's cut would be much better. Still this is what it is and it's not bad and in fact it's damn fun. Just remember that this isn't a documentary. Fans of the legends and myhts of Wild Bill may enjoy it more than others. I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book came highly recommended, but I ended up sorry I'd used the time to read it. The beginning is excellent; the main character and her nearly-pathological needs are absolutely riveting. But as soon as the plot begins to move, the character retreats to normalcy and the magic dies. Then it's a very ordinary story of family problems and secrets, made even duller by lack of logic: WHY do they let this stranger do as he pleases? WHY does the main character, again and again, not ask the next question that anyone would ask? WHY did nobody hear a horse moving quickly through the empty forest; Why no hoofprints; why is everybody so dam*ed dumb that you'd shake them except that you don't like them enough to bother?If this is a typical Gilbert novel, I'll pass on the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Jimi In Here","review":"This is a documentary showing other musicians recording a tribute to Jimi Hendrix album at the end of the nineties. You get the feeling most of the musicians aren't really even that familiar with Hendix' music. I did like the Five Blind Boys From Alabama; they were working out a gospel sounding acappela version of Driftin' which sounded like it was going to be great. But none of the tracks are played as a finished product, and there is definitely no Jimi Hendrix appearing in this film.

This is one of my favorite albums. I play it more than Bronfman and more than Serkin. ... It is the chamber music version of the 3rd and 4th piano concertos and it is a revelation ! The intimacy of the piano with a string quintet draws the listener more deeply into the heart of these concertos. ...Good recording sound and great musicianship.

Actually, it does deserve one star, it's not THAT bad. I mean, other than not being able to move the mechs or the point of view as effectively as you should, and the fact that the combat is ineffectually balanced, this game is fine. The controls are awkward. The way the mechs move is awkward. The PS2 is not a good platform for a mech game in the first place, because of the relative simplicity of the controller, but this implementation goes above and beyond the call of suck.

I have beaten 5 of them, and I have played 7 of them. Out of all of them, this one is still my favorite. Although this was not the first Armored Core I played, it was the one that got me hooked on the series. In my opinion, this one has the best combination of features, parts and missions out of the entire AC series. If you are into the action of the game, or if you haven't played any of them, but are considering getting into it, get this game first. Because while the other games may have more integral parts of the story, and a large insider following, this is the game that outsiders tend to find the most appealing. And once you get into it, you'll want to play the rest of the series too.This game is challenging, but has a forgiving learning curve as well as an extremely high replay value.

The only downfall about this game is the Holland team is very [edited] up as it dosent include the names and some of the faces of the players, I found this very unfair indeed as I saw another international football game in the gamestore with the official names of the Holland squad.

Even when we weren't using the game, they didn't stay on the board and in place when it was packed up, so the magnets were all over the place. Also, they weren't all accurate to what the state's most common plates look like, so he had a hard time matching them to reality if he couldn't read the state's name on the real life plate as the car was going by.

For example, if you're a true music fan, then think back 7 years at New Born (\\"Baby Baby I'm Falling in Love\\")...he made one good song and then his career was over.

This is a very nice CD, that I think any parent would like to purchase for there child(if they like Sammie). Mom/Dad I don't think you will be disappointed and you won't find anything to strong that is hitting wrong for your child. Sammie has wonderful vocal skills and is a child at heart, not sounding like a child who is trying to be an adult before this time, but is expressing emotions on a child level.

The second half, set in London, was ridiculuous. It sounds like it was written by someone who spent a weekend in London after reading an article in an inflight magazine on the Thames Barrier. The attempt to evoke a sense of impending doom by describing Londoners packing a supermarket, with kids tearing open packets of M&Ms; is about as convincing as \\"the young cop struggl[ing] to inflate a dinghy by blowing on its tube like it was a balloon.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forced Partnership","review":"Eddie Murphy followed others from SNL as me emerged from Mr Rogers sketches and began his movie career. It was 1982 and people wanted to laugh as the US economy was struggling back from its worst period since the great depression. Eddie Murphy teamed with Nick Nolte, who got his fame as the bad boy brother from \\"Rich Man Poor man\\" and EM and NN were tremendous together. This movie created a lot of \\"buzz\\" where I worked and of course we got a 48 Hours II. Nick was the big star payroll wise, but in his first movie, EM shows the promise, which I believe he has fulfilled in becoming one of our greatest movie actors. For sheer talent is there anyone better than Eddie Murphy?I give this only 4 stars because of the language and violence which makes it not family friendly. So put the little ones to bed, sit back and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"never to be forgotton","review":"This movie may look slightly dated now, but Eddie Murphy's film debut in this flick still remains one of his best. I still find parts of this movie simply brilliant, and Nick Nolte's performance is equally as good, as cop Jack Cates and convict Reggie Hammond constantly spar verbally and physically, but with the same goals in mind. The performances and strength of the characters really bring out both the drama and comedy in this film, which balance superbly.I won't bother going into the story as many other reviewers have done this, but this movie is simply hilarious in places and is a must see for anyone who likes an adult-comedy movie. For the record, the sequel is equally as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray Bad Picture Quality!!!!","review":"Bad, crappy, horrible picture quality!!! 48hours is the best action comedy of all time!

Don't buy this Blu Ray version unless you have to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOSOM BUDDIES REDUX","review":"48 HRS, a nifty actioner from director Walter Hill, is considered as the buddy movie upon which future films of this ilk would be judged. Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy certainly had a sharp chemistry in this tale of a veteran cop who \\"borrows\\" convict Murphy for the titular 48 hours to nab a prison escapee and cop killer, played luridly by a young James Remar. The action is fast and furious and Murphy in his first big screen breakout overcomes his foul mouth with a good turn, especially in the critically lauded scene at the redneck bar. Sonny Landham and David Patrick Kelly are suitable villains but lovely Annette O'Toole is wasted in the role of Nolte's sometime lover. However, this is a very entertaining film and shows why Murphy became such a hot box office property at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Dull Like an Unsharpened Pencil.","review":"Viewed: 7/05Rate: 27/05: 48 Hours is full of crap. The too much profanity in 48 Hours kills my mood. When a sex-starved convict and a hard-nosed cop are looking for two killers that killed many cops, I wonder why Nick Nolte is the only one looking for those guys. What was the point of using a convict? The killers look stupid to me. Why would a guy trade half a million for a girl? With that kind of money, he can get many women as he wants. 48 Hours is just a stupid movie that falls flat on jokes. There isn't much of an action, only a boring chase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Dissapointing","review":"I wasn't expecting a sophisticated film by the Cohen brothers or food-for-though from Jarmusch or other heavy weight director. I supposed it was going to be fun, but the film didn't do the trick: slow, violent, sexist and racist. And not even funny. \\"Showtime\\" and \\"Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man\\" are masterpieces compared to it. \\"48 hours\\" made me realize that if the last white guy available on Earth were somebody resembling Nick Nolte, I will surely pick a better human being from any minority. His character shows the poster boy of a sample of the worst pieces of \\"white trash\\" on film.

In fact, the Bishop of the diocese in which Medjugorje resides has written at least two opinions that the Blessed Mother is NOT appearing there.If you can get your hands on The Medjugorje Deception by Michael Jones I believe you will get a more balanced view of Medjugorje.

But it didn't compare to being a Hogan fan. Regardless, I think this dvd was really well done from a production and editing standpoint. It was extremely comical. Although it obviously was at the UW's expence, and was a blatent attempt to bury the UW and his character forever. It still brought me back to a time where phoney names for wrestlers was the way to get over. Current WWE talent looking back on the UW's character was beyond funny, and have WWE Hall Of Famers, as well as Mr. McMahon looking back on the UW really brought into perspective what \\"Jim\\" or later leagally known as the UW was like. Backstage, and in ring. I just hope WWE doesn't decide to make \\"burrying\\" DVDs a habit. It was funny now and truthfull at the same time, but eventually would make the WWE look like an unforgiving bully in the wrestling industry. But overall it was a good DVD and very worth the price of purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining...","review":"Not quite the hatchet job it has been made out to be, this documentary actually does get across what a huge star Ultimate Warrior became, before his 15 minutes ran out. However, in the last third or so, it does become rather unrelenting negative in its portrayal of the guy, and it would've been better if he had been given the opportunity to give his side of the story.Then again, having read some of the nonsense he's spewed in recent years, he does seem a little 'off', and it would've probably been quite difficult to get anything worthwhile from him. If anything, having him rant about himself on this DVD might've ended up making him look worse.A must-buy for any wrestling fan who grew up in the 1980s."},{"rating":"1","title":"the self destruction of ... my wallet","review":"Other and the \\"AWESOME\\" Pick your Poison Jake the Snake dvd, I don't buy dvd's centered around one wrestler, but I decided to make and exception for this one since I was curious and it was cheap. I wasted my money, I bought this dvd because I wanted to see the Ultimate Warrior made fun of. I never liked him and always thought he was a joke. They could of done so much with this documentary, and they missed the mark BIG TIME. Other than Bobby Heenan there is nothing good about this DVD. The background music is too loud and awful, the interviews are done with little heart, I didn't believe he was as much as an idiot as I would like to think he is, because it seemed to me (again other than Heenan) that everyone was reading from script written by McMahon, and not their hearts. The extras were piontless, and the Christian impression was disappionting. Oh well, off to the Salvation Army with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True moron and Joke of a Champ is Buried! What not to like?","review":"Warrior sucks, he has always sucked in the ring and how he became a marketable Champ is honestly beyond even the most hardcore fans.Myself, being a Striaght up 100% Wrestling fan sees enjoyment in the works of lets say: Benoit, Angle, Guerrero, Melenko,Jericho,STyles, Daniels, CM Punk, Samoa Joe and all those guys, while the casual wrestling fans love lower talented yet charismatic guys like, Hulk Hogan. Batista. John Cena.ULTIMATE WARRIOR.goldberg.See if your a hardcore pure wrestling fan then you hate the Ultimate warrior since his Talent is very limited.So, If you like flat out wrestlers and absolutly DESPISE the spotlight hogging low talent stars, this burial my be for you.If you enjoy the cartoony, charismatic and gimmicks of Warrior and love him regardless of how absolutly awful his in ring ability is,than this Burial of him isnt for you,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Character Assassination","review":"Just watched this DVD and found it to be purely and simply a revenge piece by Vince McMahon against somebody that crossed him in the past. It was completely biased and one sided. The best part of it to me was seeing a match between HHH when he first started in the WWF and comparing him to how he looks today. The guy looked like he weighed 200 pounds. Now after a steady diet of WWE he looks like a huge bodybuilder.Anyway, this DVD has some good footage and some of it is funny but back in the day of the Ultimate Warrior there were lots of goofey and cartoonish characters in the WWF. This is something that is not pointed out. From what you see on this DVD Jim Hellwig was a jerk, a liar, a scumbag, and a miserable ungrateful person. Nice to see that they were impartial."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Ultimate Warrior leaves no openings -- Except in his mind.\\"","review":"Although some folks have painted this DVD as a total hatchet-job on the Ultimate Warrior, it is actually a fairly balanced record of the Ultimate Warrior's strengths, i.e. charisma and connecting with the marks and his weaknesses, i.e. bad business sense, poor social skills, inablity to performing wrestling moves.The WWF marketing machine worked full-time to cover the Ultimate Warriors weaknesses while he was in their employ. Now that he is no longer with them, and they are no longer covering his flaws, his limited strengths pale in comparison to his failings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HILARIOUS DVD","review":"THIS DVD IS SO FUNNY. I CAN'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS, U HAVE TO GET THIS DVD. IT SHOWS HOW MUCH OF AN IDIOT THE WARRIOR REALLY WAS, HOW MUCH TALENT HE DIDN'T HAVE, HIS TERRIBLE MIC SKILLS, ETC. THE EXPRESSION \\"MILLION DOLLAR BODY, 10 CENT BRAIN\\" FITS HIM O TO WELL. BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF GOOD MATCHES, I MEAN, GRANTED THE OTHER GREAT \\"ACTUAL\\" WRESTLERS PULLED HIM THROUGH THE MATCHES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riot","review":"This dvd was funny and makes you wonder why people liked this fool. They skipped around in the 90's, and forget about him being locked in a casket by the Undertaker. The matches were a big yawn, and WWE has a wealth of matches but refuses to put some unseen gems on dvd. Warrior Vs Andre or Warrior VS Undertaker would have been a nice change to the already seen Hogan title match or retirement match with Savage. Seriousally, why Vince? Did you run of ideas so you decided to mock wrestlers who screwed you in the past? Who is next on your list? Best of Doink? Koko B. Ware?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's a first....","review":"Apparently, this WWE DVD was supposed to be made with Warrior (unlike Bret Hart, who has somewhat mended the fence), according the official comments from WWE; unfortunately, THIS is the reason why they RIPPED him hard on this instead: when the fans made him the top wrestlers and he just say \\"f*** u WWE!\\" in return, and then insulted just about everyone else like the minorities, per se, on top of it all. Need we go on the fact, he was also the reason (directly or indirectly) why Davey Boy Smith is no longer among the living. While we can say he has what it takes to be a pro wrestler, his mind is \\"so out of it\\" that the people once loved to see him succeed, is now ripping him badly. I can't wait to see what details it'll bring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give this \\"video\\" ZERO stars if Amazon would let me.","review":"Why was this video made? The Ultimate Warrior is not self-destructive. He's alive and well...married for about 13 years, and has a couple kids. He is also an artist and businessman. He has several web sites in operation too. Plus, he's into fitness and living a healthy lifestyle. That's not my definition of self-destructive. This video comes off as a bunch of guys sitting around bashing the Warrior and his character. What is their purpose in putting a dvd like this together? To make him look bad? Why? If these athletes & managers in the wrestling business don't like him, then so be it. But, come on...grow up and mature a bit. Live your own life, and leave his alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not awful but be careful!","review":"Interested in the Tamil language I bought this CD even though there were no reviews, but it is disappointing.

Four useless heavy metal covers at the end (and a lot funnier than most of the comedy bits), and a smattering of classic lines. Worth a listen, but not much more than that. You'd be well-advised to buy any of his other albums instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leader Of The Banned","review":"Unless you don't mind playing good money for 33 minutes of comedy avoid buying this CD until you've heard some of his better material. There are some flashes of brilliance but overall a disappointment due to its length. The music tacked on the end seemed to be a poor way pad the length of the CD. Louder Than Hell & Live From Hell are better bets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Get \\"Live from Hell\\" or \\"Have you seen me lately?\\" if you want comedy.

It's actually a book that I have been reading more for pleasure than for study, and I recommend it to anyone who is even remotely interested in painting, architecture or any artistic elements. The photos are fantastically sharp and accurately placed near if not next to the corresponding text and in no way is it difficult to read or understand.

I don't like to let it bulk up which happens if you let it sit for too long. So I've been using a level spoonful, mixing it quickly in 16oz of water, then slamming it as quick as I can.

Some are very difficult even with repeated play. Control interface is excellent. Fun to drive the tanks on a variety of realistic terrain. Maps are big, plenty of room to manuever.

Ms. J has a no-nonsense, big-sisterly style that is quite assuring. Her advice about \\"veneral disease\\" is strictly 1969, but even there she has something timeless to say - \\"If...there is something wrong in the genital area, don't sit around frozen in fear, run to the gynecologist.\\" For the most part she says what countless others have said since - Self-confidence is sexy and taking responsibility for your own pleasure is even sexier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old but GREAT","review":"The first time I read this book I was too bashful to read it completely.

The pitfall, it seems, is an agenda established by the editors to discount the slightest consideration of evidence of any kind for Norse contact south of the Canadian boarder, reinforced by gratuitous remarks throughout the catalogue (we wonder by whom) denigrating pre-contact research.

The problem is it is far less satisfying in its execution. The music does not have the bite that was found on GRACELAND it tends to meander and lacks the strength of rhythm found on GRACELAND.

Although \\"The Obvious Child\\" enjoyed the most radio airplay, \\"The Coast\\" (dedicated to poet Derek Walcott) is the album's best song. Many of the selections show Simon's new musical direction, while others, such as \\"Born at the Right Time\\" feel familiar and classic, as if they were written during the heyday of Simon & Garfunkel."},{"rating":"2","title":"great; thanks","review":"See the title of my review to learn that it all turned out \\"great\\" -- and that, for that, I offered heartfelt \\"thanks.\\" So ...

It is not a deep work but who cares?.The elegant style and supreme elegance directorial in Beecham makes you to forget the search for the expression, the color and exact intention of the composer .The Suites ae exquisite though Paul Paray is a serious matcher with the Detroit Symphony .Beecham was a conductor much better than the great majority of the people think . Another triumphs from his glorious batoon were The Jupiter Symphony ; Sibelius fourth , Delius symphonic works and Liszt Fausto among the most remarkables ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a great conductor???","review":"This was the first recording I ever purchased of a performance conducted by Beecham and it is also certainly the last. Bizet's vibrant Symphony in C becomes utterly flat and lifeless under the baton of this man Beecham. As an extra touch of complete perversity, he races through the elegant stately passages at the beginning of the second movement like he can't wait to get through them. How he got the reputation of being a great conductor is beyond me, and I guess I'll never find out because I am determined never to waste my money on a Beecham disc again after this farce of a performance. If you want a great recording of Symphony in C, stick with Leonard Bernstein, a true maestro!"},{"rating":"1","title":"decent book for price","review":"Nice book, comprehensive overview of his work.

Decent book for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful picture book.","review":"I was in great anticipation of this book because I found her previous ones (with the exception of the Gift Giving one which I have not read) to be beautiful, inspiring and filled with great, new to me, information. I wasn't expecting another book like the first ones and had I, I think I would have been disappointed. What I was expecting, however, was just another beautiful book filled with wonderful images to give my brain a creative spark. And it did just that.It's not really a how to, it doesn't lay things out easily, and it's not really for home ideas and living. But it is beautiful, thoughtful, unique and true to Shabby Chic. So if you're in the need of some more inspiration and love her books, this would be a great match. If you're looking to learn more about shabby chic for home and how to do all that, her other books are much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE FAN OF SHABBY CHIC","review":"and very dissapointed with the latest book. I was hoping for HOUSEY pictures. I want what she is known for...... decor & pictures of beautiful rooms with beautiful one of a kind treasures. I would love to have seen homes or rooms she has done for clients. Or from her new home. This book just felt like a dissapointing waste of time. I can't believe anyone would be interested in seeing what Pamala Anderson did for her SONS birthday party. What I really would have liked to have seen is what she does for childrens room, master bedrooms, living rooms, family rooms, kitchens, This was dissapoiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I was really excited when I heard that Rachel Ashwell was releasing a new book, however, this book is not what I expected at all. Rachel spends too much time on areas that I feel have no practical use for the average reader - such as Jennifer Lopez's restaurant. How many readers just happen to have a brand new restaurant that they need decorated in the Shabby Chic style? Each chapter is solely made up of just one function, instead of showing several different examples. She showed us how to decorate for one birthday party - a little boy's birthday. How about showing us some ideas for little girls, teens and adults? She completely skipped over any type of holiday gathering too. I thought she would have included several ideas for decorating the table for Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas but there was nothing mentioned about it. As a devoted Ashwell fan, I must say that I was really disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shift in Focus to Parties, Away from Home Decorating","review":"Maybe \\"Elegant Shabby Chic\\" would have been a better name for the book. The photos are gorgeous. The events the author created are lavish affairs for Hollywood socialites. The reader can find inspiration from these and depending on the budget, create your own event.Each chapter covers a separate affair or decorating challenge. There's Jennifer Lopez' restaurant and Pamela Anderson's son's birthday party. Paper parasols, vintage/flowery hats, a mixture of china teacups, and lots of old-fashioned flowers.I picked this up, originally thinking it was a decorating book. As a party planning book, it's can be an inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lost Treasure","review":"Loey Nelson's \\"Venus Kissed The Moon\\" is a lost musical treasure. Originally released in 1989, this disc is a glowing example of the great music that was starting to come out of the midwest along with other bands like Firetown.\\"Venus Kissed The Moon\\" covers a lot of ground musically: folk, rock, jazz, blues, americana, country, etc., yet it stays cohesive throughout. This is a timeless piece of work that deserved a lot more backing and promotion from Warner Brothers back in '89. Rolling Stone Magazine raved about Loey Nelson as an up-and-comer out of the Milwaukee area. It's a shame hardly anyone noticed.Still, that doesn't change what's been released -- an outstanding work for anyone who truly appreciates a disc that it is hard to get tired of. Excellent songwriting, creative arrangements, emotive & smoky vocals. Treat yourself and buy this disc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And I thought MY family was dysfunctional","review":"While watching this film, camera placement will be the furthest thing from your mind.

You'll question the truth. Well done and deserves its prestige."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damage Control","review":"Unbelievable. If a priest is accused of this crime, based on someone just remembering something thirty years later, he gets indicted and does life. Here, members of a jewish family get busted, charges are delayed until there is public outcry no arrests are made, and finally, easy sentences are given. Only Arnold, Jesse, and Ross Goldstien went to prison. Their sentences were so lenient that the judge incurred criticism. Now, a movie is made making the family out to be victims even though the old man and two others were caught abusing hundreds of young children and threatening their lives. Unbelievable trash from the synagogue of satan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true account only in hollywood","review":"The film is a very biased documentary; there is a ton of information that further reinforces the guilt of the father and son that has been left out to make it seem like maybe they didn't do it. The fact is that for as questionable as the film makes all this seem, almost all of the victims still vehemently claim that (a) they were raped (b) the police did not get them to make up stories (c) they were never hypnotized. If you have any doubt about the guilt of the accused, search around on the internet - it gives a much broader bigger picture of what happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great American documentary","review":"This is a great American documentary. It is disturbing because it involves the sensitive topic of child molestation. It introduces us to a upper middle class family residing in Great Neck, Long Island NY USA. Father Friedman is a school teacher. He, giving piano and computer lessons, as he retired, in the basement of his home. In 1988, police discover child pornography in the office, he gave these lessons, in. The nightmare begins for this formerly upstanding family.Like most good docus, we do not judge this man and then his accused son. Riveting all the way to the end.Unfortunately, in the 2-disc set, the second disc is quite stingy in its extras. I haven't chequed it out, yet, but there are CD-ROM extras on DISC 2.Otherwise, excellent film.

You can see more coming out of one end rather than the other. The kids love staring at the bubbles! We'll see how long it lasts. I know these stones tend to get clogged up after a while.

I ordered the Aqua Mist 5 1/2\\" stone along with a Tetra Whisper 10 air pump. It works great, producing bubbles all along the surface (needs to be flat.) It is fairly heavy, and has edges that can be covered with gravel, holding it in place. (It can be placed completely under the gravel as well, but I have it level with the gravel surface.) I run it for a couple of hours a day, and the water is crystal-clear, has never looked so good. The fish look healthier, have great color, and are more active. The tetras love swimming through the bubbles, and the plecostomus will sometimes lie directly on it, fun to watch. It adds considerably to the current in the tank, and the fish are thriving. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bubble Wall","review":"Rated 4 instead of 5 stars as the bubbles initially were coming through 4 or 5 holes. I had to take it out the water and literally blow into it, opening up more pores and now it looks great. The issue wasn't with the air pump as I have a powerful pump and it was just the holes being blocked. I searched the internet on techniques to make this work and people had suggested submersing the stone in water for an hour before connecting it to the pump. For me it was too late and hence, I blew into it clearing the pores and its all good now.Also this comes with no instructions and hence, a slight struggle to get it to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work as shown in the photos","review":"just received this from Amazon. Price was great but the product doesn't work as advertised, at least in the photos. Bubbles only come from the first 3 inches of air stone. My guess is that my pump is too small and if that's the case, the description should state that you need a pump with enough force to get the full benefit of this product or it should be made to accommodate various pump strengths (adjustment knob or something). I have a 50 sized pump made for a 10gallon tank. A 75 or 100 would probably do the trick and get this to work properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerating Aquarium Ornament 5.5 in","review":"Very sturdy, good, even aerating ornament.

Do not recommend, unless you want moderate quantities of larger bubbles. Smaller bubbles are better in terms of surface area to speed gas exchange. The gaps on the edges might be just a fluke, but the similarly sized pin hole like air bubbles along the stone seem to be the same size, so I suspect its a design issue, not a one-off bad one.

Most of the Penn Plax Air stone I have bought lately just don't last long. They are made in China so what I bought maybe counterfeit or they just aren't making good quality anymore.

However, after using these brushes 3 times now to clean bikes, I've realized that the brushes are just too stiff to work properly. The two 'bottle brush' type brushes and the one that looks like a skinny paint brush are almost useless because of how stiff the bristles are. And the big tire brush I haven't really found a use for. But, the cog brush is great. For it's purpose the stiff bristles are a plus.If I had it to do over again I would just buy the cog brush for $5 since it's the only one I'm getting any use out of (I still use an old tooth brush to clean the chain)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four instead of five pieces","review":"I received four pieces instead of the advertised five pieces (no brush with metal handle). The brushes came in a solid black nylon bag, which is probably better than the pictured mesh bag. I got the brushes primarily to get another Pedro's toothbrush (the brush with bristles at both ends). This brush is stiff enough to do a good job removing mud and oily gunk from the drivetrain of a bike (and frame if you do not mind micro scratches), and is also good for removing oily sawdust from the drive sprocket area of chainsaws. However, I got the set because I thought some of the other brushes might be similarly stiff and give me more options for removing such materials. That is not the case. The bristles on the other brushes are relatively soft like the bristles of paintbrushes, which are not useful for cleaning a bike, i.e., too soft for removing mud and oily gunk, and a rag works much better for things the brushes could remove like dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with Caution","review":"I say read with caution due to the nature of this book. In the act of naming grace, Hilkert makes one major mistake; she neglects to actually name grace. Trapped within her Thomistic and Kantian structures, Hilkert fails to grasp that grace has a name rather than existence as a disembodied, ethereal noun. Grace is the Word made flesh-Jesus Christ. Thus, from the outset, her system and thoughts on preaching are flawed due to a limited understanding of what he Word is that is proclaimed as well as its relationship to the sacraments of Baptism and Eucharist. While there are glimmers of beneficial material, overall one should take this book with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a feel for the culture","review":"This book on the University of Oregon gave me great insight into the school and the area around it.

It is a light-hearted story of intrigue mixed with heart-warming characters who are so vividly portrayed. For the uninitiated this is a good beginning for those who would dare to read more by Bellow.

I loved the moral dilemma the protagonist faces at the end of the book when the stolen ring is less than \\"stolen\\". Some of the other people who wrote reviews said it was slow going, but in some way it's just a slow buildup of the elements and tension in a whodunit where you really have to get a good idea of what the people in the story are like before you can fully appreciate what the event really means in the characters' lives.It reads very quickly and leaves you amused at the antics of these sophisticated (but maybe not so very sophisticated) Gothamites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing, Poor Storytelling","review":"Having read some of the other reviews, I have gathered that this was not the best book to introduce the reader to Saul Bellow. Unfortunately, this is my first attempt at reading Bellow. At the very beginning, I was very impressed with his vivid description of people and their situations. However, some 20-30 pages into the book I began to wonder when the descriptions would end and some kind of story would begin. Perhaps I am just not used to Bellow's style of narrative, but I found this one very hard to get through, despite its very short length. Somewhere down the line I may attempt to read more by Bellow, but at this point it's not real high on my list of priorities."},{"rating":"1","title":"cardboard cutout characters","review":"Unfortunately, I chose this book as an introduction to Saul Bellow's writing. I can see from other reviews, by people who have read other Saul Bellow books, that I made a mistake. I thought the characters were 2 dimensional at best, and annoying at worst. I am not a fan of short stories, and maybe novellas fall into that category, too. I can, however, see that Mr. Bellow's insights and language are interesting and creative, and I will try to read him again, but this time I'll choose a full length novel, one that I've actually heard of, for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Aptly -Named Theft of the Reader's ValuableTime","review":"There was a time when I thought no one wrote self-indulgent pap as well as Bellow, but in light of A Theft, I may change my mind. The other reviewers seem to agree on the absence of plot; I suggest that this novella receive goose eggs in the character development and dramatic tension categories as well. Considering how beautifully Bellow can write when he's making the effort, this book is particularly offensive. Note to Bellow newcomers -- don't give up without reading Mr. Sammler's Planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't make one want to read more by Bellow","review":"The first work I've read by the 1976 Nobel Laureate, and quite disappointing. Characters are self-absorbed and psuedo-intellectual, Bellow spends all his time describing people through conversation rather than through their actions, and nothing much seems to happen: sort of \\"My Dinner With Clara,\\" except with bad food. The book ultimately is a character study of boring, unsympathetic characters, and a chore for the reader.

The game unfortunately doesn't match the channels to how a real RC helicopter is set up (i.e. throttle and rudder on the left, elevator and aileron on the right). The game lets you switch some channels but it won't give you the configuration that you'd expect. Other than that it's nearly as difficult to fly as a real helicopter -- although overly stable and unaffected by wind at least in the first few levels.

I soon realized why the plastic wrapping was still intact since the game arrived at the preowned games dealer. Obviously, the previous owner heard how bad RC Helicopter was before even opening it. The story is extremely anticlimactict!

Even though the choppers are completely stable, you still can't fly the damn things due to the horrendous controlls. Also, all the text is really bad. Whoever translated this game into engrish spent less time learning the english language than you will probably spend playing this peice of crap. Do not be fooled by the flying machine on the cover.

With that said, I also want to say that I love this album! Every tune is catchy, and the duo of Vito and Burnette do a heck of a job. It's a shame they didn't become household names from their tenure with Fleetwood Mac. \\"Save Me\\" has long been one of my favorite F-M songs, and I still can't understand why it's not on the current greatest hits package; \\"Skies the Limit\\" is there, but not \\"Save Me\\". Stevie's songs are great, as usual, but one of my absolute favorites is the awesome tune \\"In The Back of My Mind\\". It's an epic-style song, with a cool, long intro. This CD doesn't get much respect, but you should check it out if you want a good album with good songs from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, But Not Essential Either","review":"\\"Behind the Mask\\" is Fleetwood Mac's effort to mask the departure of pop genius Lindsay Buckingham. They almost pull it off. Billy Burnette and Rick Vito do an admirable job of sounding like the absent Lindsay, and the album delivers its share of hooks. If fact, it's actually a more satisfying listen than \\"Tango in the Night.\\" However, there's nothing here that your average Fleetwood Mac fan can't do without. \\"Behind the Mask\\" is nice filler, but not much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did They Bother?","review":"Post-\\"Tusk\\" Mac generally comes off like the band was treading water. Where \\"Mirage\\" and \\"Tango\\" have some redeeming characteristics and killer songs, this album has scarce amounts of either. Make no mistake, THIS IS NOT THE FLEETWOOD MAC ALBUM YOU WANT TO BUY if you want a fair representation of the group's music."},{"rating":"1","title":"......","review":"Behind the Mask, a victim of production. Obviously it is. Great songs, \\"Affairs of the Heart\\", \\"Save Me\\", \\"Skies the Limit\\", \\"Freedom\\", and then some. This could have been a great album and it needed to be at the time. Unfortunatly though, it only proved how much Fleetwood Mac depended on Buckingham's production. Depite the great songs, there are some truly terrible ones as well, usually contributed by Burnette or Vito and they just bring the album down further. The exception to that rule being In the Back of My Mind, which could've been fine if it weren't for the bizzare three minute intro. That is the story of this album. The production is terrible, and to top that, it's so blatently early 90's that it just gets worse with time. In effect, the album is only interesting to dedicated fans who will be able to read through the mess to see the great songs that lie underneath it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's hardly even a mask","review":"Overlong and showcasing the most banal production I've ever heard, \\"Behind the Mask\\" is an album without flavour or purpose. It isn't because Lindsay Buckingham left, either--they're just plain uninspired. Nicks' \\"Freedom,\\" co-written with Heartbreaker Mike Campbell, is passable, but the other eleven tracks make a pit of gravel look galvanized. On \\"Hard Feelings,\\" Buckingham replacement is even insensate enough to sing: \\"Still you want to be friends/But I don't want to be just friends.\\" The most interesting part of the record is the spellbinding cover image, commissioned by Fleetwood to depict the band's spiritual essence, which shows a girl clearly representing Nicks leaving the band behind her--which Nicks actually did three years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"I thought I couldn't go wrong with this album after the glowing review it got in Rolling Stone. I was wrong. Some of the problems can be blamed on Lindsey Buckingham's departure, but I doubt he could have done much to salvage it. The songwriting is substandard and the production lacks focus. New members Burnette and Vito try to inject a blues influence, but it comes off as contrived. The Vito/Nicks collaborations wander aimlessly (\\"Love Is Dangerous\\"). Christine McVie's four lightweight but catchy contributions are this record's only redeeming value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Behind The Mask","review":"After Tango In The Night, Lindsey Buckingham, to the surprise of no one, left the band. The remaining members took three years, but released another album, Behind The Mask. They replaced Mr. Buckingham with not one, but two guitarists, Billy Burnette & Rick Vito. While they are competent musicians, the two of them together do not even come close to equaling Lindsey Buckingham. Behind The Mask is not without good tracks, but without Mr. Buckingham around, the Stevie Nicks & Christine McVie songs may as well been solo recordings. It is in fact Stevie Nicks' songs that save this album from totally ruin. \\"Love Is Dangerous\\" and \\"Affairs Of The Heart\\" are strong songs as is \\"Freedom\\". \\"Save Me\\" is a decent track, but there isn't much else to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"When Lindsey Buckingham left the show, it seems that Fleetwood Mac was left to flounder. This album proves it. Almost every song is bad. Nicks only true contribution is Love is Dangerous and Mcvie's is Save Me. Hard feelings is decent but this album is just GOD-AWFUL!

The sequel is nothing like the original. The movie doesn't go into depth and explain the origins of the monster. The plot is rather simple and just has a group of high school football players trapped on their bus with the creeper lurking in the sky hoovering over its prey. The acting in the film is not all that great. The film starts off good but out stays its welcome very quickly as it loses all suspense after the first 35 minutes. The film actually relizes on action to make the film good instead of the horror. The movie deliveres the gore but gore is not the only thing you need to make a film like Jeepers Creepers 2 good."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"He Can Taste Your Fear\\"?????","review":"First I must say, I wasn't expecting much from this because I found the original nothing more than tired. The story about the 23 days every 23 years is great, they just need better writers or something because the films are very watered down with screams and never-ending scences that are just dull and far from interesting. This was better than the first video, the number of main members in the cast is a great improvement with the first only having two. But, aside from the movie, the DVD is ok, by saying that I mean the picture is very clear with great darks though most of the movie. The sound was also nice with some, not too much, use of the back speckers. If the movie had been better the DVD would be a must have with it's awesome transfer. Overall, see this only if you liked the first or if you really think you'll like this one and will not listen to my advice.

Bad mistake. I wish I would have rented it first and not spent the money to buy it. This version of Jeepers Creepers centers around a group of students who's bus breaks down, naturally on the side of an isolated, deserted road. The \\"creeper\\" is back and the students are his new victims. Taking place mostly in a school bus, this movie has poor acting and a silly plot with the \\"creeper\\" purposly selecting certain students to kill. You get tired of seeing the \\"creeper\\" flying around like a huge bat and look forward to the ending.

Inane, pointless, plotless and completely lacking in suspense or imagination, this is the nail in the coffin of what was only a mediocre concept to begin with. The plot: Bus breaks down several days after the events of the first film. Creeper attacks bus and the high school students therein. There is screaming, running, boring philosophical debates on the subject of who should live and who should die, and lots of close ups of a creature that- since the original film- has apparently transformed into a version of MAD magazine mascot Alfred E.Nuemann..by way of Freddy Krueger. Thats it kids- thats the movie. It gets one star and one star only for a creepy opening sequence set in a cornfield. Beyond that, this film is nothing more than a way for the producers to line their pockets. Skip it, and rent one of your old favorites again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sniff, something stinks. Oh!

My girl thought it was scary and stupid. I just thought it was stupid. I had so much faith in this movie however, that this would be a great horror flick, and it failed on so many levels. I thought it would have been forgotten. To my surprise, they are making another one. I guess hollywood can do anything they want nowadays. But if these morons can get film studios to give them millions of dollars to produce a film like that, shoot, they should give me half and I can produce a film that will turn a profit too.

The characters are... well they are the farthest thing from characters ever. They are cardboard cutouts being moved across the screen by \\"actors\\". There are a few interesting \\"characters\\" but Salva never focuses on them. Instead he brings in issues like racism and homophobia... and doesn't do a thing with them. The action is... well there is a lot but I was still ready to doze off during most of it, and then Salva just abandons a good portion of the cast, never tells you if a good portion of them live or die, and then... the movie ends with the possibility of another sequal.

Now you know the entire plot and don't need to rent Jeepers Creepers II, the sequel to the original disappointment Jeepers Creepers.I think director Victor Salva, upon realizing the vast crapocity of the original movie, opted to repress its memory and thus explains why the sequel has little if nothing to do with the first. Hell, they even forgot entirely about the films namesake, that being that lovely little ditty of a song that has been covered by just about everyone (my personal favourite being a rendition by Siouxsie & the Banshees).And that's all I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first one.","review":"After watching this movie I was kind of disappointed. The first one is much scarier and the creeper is more mysterious which makes it a better movie.

At the end of \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" we see the creeper looking out through Derry's eye sockets, his eyes no longer being there. What an excellent ending, both shocking and suspensful. The opening of this film shows potential and I briefly changed my mind as to whether it should've been made. After the creeper grabs the little farm kid it plumments, badly. As soon as the bus appears and you hear that annoying sound of a school pep song in the air, you just know that this is going to be, yet another, teen exploitation film. Who wants to see the creeper relentlessly picking teens and their teachers off one by one, and a grief stricken father going all out for revenge? We've seen it all before in a much better fashion. As well as being very predictable and lame, the acting sucks. When are they gonna learn that some people just can't act?

It worked with classic monsters like Frankenstein and the Wolf Man because they had enough moral sense to realize they were abominations. You were able to empathize with them. It worked in movies like The Wizard of Oz because you cared enough about Dorothy and Toto to have a bp spike every time the Wicked Witch mounted her broom.

The Creeper's freaky truck never makes an apperance, the sog that was tied nto he title and theme never is played and the Creeper siply flies around looking stupid and not scary. The entire movie revolves around a bunch of jocks on a bus, stranded on the road,which alone is beyond lame and boring. None of the characters are interesting, and I felt this was just a lame excuse for MGM to cash in on whatever money they coud gross off this as that studio has had very few hits recently. Don't waste your time with this mess like I did. On a scale of 1-10 I give this pile of junk a ZERO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"This was horrible. They stole sceanes and looks(exp:The monster looked like freddy kruger)for 15 other films!!!!(yes, I did count)It's about some kids getting a flat tire and this freddy bird thing is after them. Luckily for the kids, they brought weapons on the bus so now they have a way to defind themselfs(why would you bring weapons on a local school bus?). Come on!!! They even did a two hour close up of the monster smiling!!!! If your looking for a good mordern horror film(which is hard to find) then don't look at this, look at films such as Jason X, Halloween8, and the texaschainsaw massacare. This was just pure junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie SUCKED!!!","review":"From what I seen of the movie it was Horrable. I hope an Pray they don't release a third movie of the series. PLEASE, don't waste your money on this Piece of crap"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than expected","review":"I've gone back and forth on whether to even watch this movie. Some critics so trashed this movie, that I figured maybe the director was just cashing in on the success of the first effort (not uncommon in horror flicks -- just check out the terrible Ring 2 (no don't!)).Well, what an (un)pleasant surprise! Jeepers Creepers 2 got me going right from the get-go, with the spooky scarecrows and a boy, increasingly isolated, in a field in the middle of the day (beware of the noonday devil). But I'm not going to spoil it for you. Clearly, Salva has issues with boys -- that seem to be disturbingly playing themselves out on the screen. But like it or not this adds to the unease of both Jeepers movies. And unease is gold when it comes to horror. Oh, and Ray Wise is great in this. Not Ahab, but a vengeful father that strikes back, and that was something I needed as relief from the disturbing first film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining and intelligent sequel","review":"I am a very picky horror movie patron, and I have to say that all the negative reviews for this film astonish me. This is better than part 1! It is a well-directed, intelligent andgenuinely scary movie, with one of the most disturbing and original monsters I have ever seen. No, it's not a flawlessabsolutely excellent film, but few modern horror movies even come close to being this entertaining and fresh. Usually a movie staged around a busload of teenagers guarantees lame, predictable dialog and stupid little romantic sub-plots. But this one rises to the occasion and it shines out as one of the best sequels in the horror genre. Rent it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home about","review":"Ehh it was ok and fun to watch, though not as original or well executed as the original. Nice collection of jock & cheerleader hotties, but the monster concept played its way out in the first film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Posessed by demons","review":"I ordered this clock less than three months ago, and within the last several weeks, it has become possessed. The alarm fails to go off occasionally for no explicable reason, and the CD player runs amok, requiring that I unplug the radio from the wall socket. Not only will the demonic thing not play my CD's, it refuses to respond to any of the control buttons once the CD player takes over.It was disappointing to discover that the display has no brightness control, but that information is not always given online. My old GE clock radio, god rest its soul, did have brightness control. I bought this GE based on my high level of satisfaction from my older model that functioned as expected for 16 years before I gave it away.I've already ordered a replacement for this little monster."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Let Down","review":"This Hostel is just plain bad. Does not have to Eli Roth touch, and Mr. Kelly said it very clearly without elaborating. He really got to the point. This movie is simply a waste of time without any good qualities.

At least it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too disturbing","review":"Part 1 was about in sync with the Saw movies, then part 2 came out & that movie really wasn't that great. Now with part 3, this one is much worse than the Saw movies, and too disturbing for me.

Sorry, but people should know that Sony's Direct To DVD movies are all crap. I can't think of one that was worthwhile. Heck, even the ones that are mainstream are pretty much poo on the bottom of my show. Sony sucks and the Hostel series is nothing without Eli Roth or even Quentin Tarantino, sorry, but Hostel has gone from Graphic Torture Porn to the likes of an episode of The Walking Dead, lame and watered down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hangover Meets Hostel","review":"Hostel 3 had a good idea-have the club from the first few films bet on people's lives. It was only shown three times while the rest of movie just dragged on with boring characters who drank, gambled, & try to get laid. I wouldn't even recommend this film to fans of the first two movies or horror in general. This movie just sucks, plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"Worst one by far. Doesn't even begin to match up to the first two. Is the hidden meaning in this that Americans are tame? Probably. Starts off with a twist in abduction then fails... They don't even kill anyone. The girl gets taken away and bleh, nothing. Nothing ever. Not even a glimpse of what might have happened. As for the rest of the killing, torturing and maiming... it looked as though it was made for television. The whole thing just stinks. Netflix it and save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary as Hell","review":"This is not torture porn, there are only a few scenes of pure evil and they will scare you to death. You get to know the Characters more in this one and like them which makes it all the more tragic. More plot twists than the originals, a must see for Horror fans who want more than just blood, a good plot as well that is deeper than parts one and 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do the 3rd sequals always suck?","review":"I loved Hostel and Hostel 2, this doesn't hold a candle to either, if it wasn't called Hostel you wouldn't even know it was part of the same series. I don't think any one involved with the first 2 was involved in the production of this drivel. The whole thing takes place in one room with an audience watching and paying for different kinds of tortures to be performed on the victims, there's practically no story line or character development, it looks like it was shot with a digital camcorder, some of the gore is ok, but this doesn't have any replay value for me, it's a shame what happens to horror sequels when they hit unlucky #3 almost every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hostel Closes: Spoiler Alert","review":"For all you big fans ofHostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition)andHostel: Part II (Unrated Widescreen Edition), including myself, you shall be very disappointed in this film.The betting on how people are killed is ludicrous and ruins any chance this film may have had.If the face peeling killing isn't enough for you to turn it off then sit and see how this franchise is put to death.I bet you'll be glad it's now dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the second","review":"The movie arrived on time and well packed. The box had no damage to it - the was reflected by the fine quality of the the DVD inside. The movie itself is a solid buy for the price. I will not give anything away, but I must say that the movie is solid and is better than the second. There is some nudity and as expected, it has a fair amount of gore. Over all the more is great for any fan of this franchise or the SAW movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie that will kill you out of boredom.","review":"Bum, Boobs and Breasts added with Blood, Brutality and Bitches is no replacement to a terrible script, horrible acting skills and an absolutely mindless story-line.

I would give it no stars if possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"This movie was so crappy, it didn't make it in theaters or even have a blu-ray version. !

The Cinematography is abysmal and the acting is laughable. The kills are insipid and very cost effective. I really saw minimum gore in this film to say the least. And when you find out that the subject mater revolves around a woman it just kills it. Its reguarding a person that is barely in the film. Its quite obvious this was on a smaller budget or lack there of.I just feel like Eli Roth visually is a better director and cinematographer. This movie appears to be divided into two chunks and when you get down to the last chunk it loses momentum. The actions sequences are insipid and the explosions look CGI'ed. Watch this only if you are bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"If you are thinking about watching this because it is the third installment of Hostel.

The standard rock and folk styles David Gray had been working with on the previous two albums are present here as well; in my opinion this is where they gel most sucessfully.If you've only heard White Ladder, be warned that Sell Selll Sell has none of its techno-tinged stylings. The first two songs are straight-ahead electric rockers, as are several others scattered further in the album. Overall it's a more musically upbeat album than the somewhat reserved White Ladder; it's also more musically cohesive than its two predecessors (though that's splitting hairs -- all four albums are terrific.)If you want to get just one of Mr. Gray's earlier albums, I'd recommend this one to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic rock/pop","review":"This CD is a wonderful and energetic contrast to the smooth and sleek White Ladder. Sell Sell Sell is a far more energetic album and also gives the listener more varieties of style and song than the more famous WL. The opening snarls of \\"Faster, Sooner, Now\\" might shock those who are more at home with the the likes of \\"This year's love\\", for example, but there are mellow moments on this CD too - such as the lilting \\"Smile\\". Too many good tracks to name here, but my favorites are \\"Late night radio\\" and the title track, with its gongs/bells introduction. A terrific album that showcases David Gray at his best, and gives plenty of pointers to his more recent material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"First of all, if David Gray is coming to your town, GO BUY TICKETS NOW! He's so great live...so great that when you leave, you'll want to buy all of his CDs, which is how I felt.

Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowning David","review":"David Gray is the best the music sceen has heard since Van Morrisson. So, I'm not going to let him off easy on this one.

His best work, however, are those songs which we can hear his lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album is horrificly overated","review":"... It is absolutely horrible. I really do not understand at all why people like it so much. The songs are annoying, unoriginal, and just plain boring.

The humor is mostly of the sort where the protagonist makes many blunders and you (the reader) are glad that you, at least, aren't *that* clumsy. I found a lot of the people and conversations were so exaggerated as to not be realistic at all. While it's true that exaggeration can be a part of humor, it was just not believable to me at all that one person would make so many silly mistakes, and yet have such a perfect happy ending. There were some good things that the main character learned, which were more poignant due to the awkward circumstances she found herself in, though these insights are often talked about too much and demonstrated too little. It was a quick read, though, so if you want some light, funny reading and you find this book lying around, you might enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my bike sluggish","review":"I purchased a pair of these and they lasted about 3 weeks.

The poncho was light weight adjustable on the sides, keeping me dry as a bone. I'm a little hard on my gear , so you may want to buy 2 or 3 of these: for the price you can't complain.

I was taking it off, it fell on a hard surface from about two feet and cracked on the weld located directly opposite the snake \\"head\\" part. I was never excessively rough with the ring, so it had to be craftsmanship. Also noticed was that the silver plating had begun to come off rather quickly around the edges of the ring, and it turned black. The plating wearing off wasn't too bad looking but I was rather dissapionted when it broke in half in a situation were most rings would leave unscathed. I am giving it a two because it looks good and feels heavy, but is simply made to a standard not fit for everyday use.

The first three tracks open gloriously giving you outstanding drum and bass combinations with clever vocals and guitar. This leads to 'obvious' a simple but simply magnificent song (translate the lyrics how you want).'Been caught stealing' is probably the bands most danceable tune on this album and is in perfect place to lead you to rest for '3 days', the albums centre piece song. It's even better live! 'Then she did' is the perfect song to compliment '3 days' and kind of continues the journey. The final two songs 'Of course!' and 'classic girl' are totally different in style but end the album perfectly.

Unfortunately the next three songs get bogged down in the band's pretentions; there is nothing wrong with a 10-minute song in theory but it has to have a reason for being that long and Three Days just becomes boring, grating, and self-indulgent after an admittedly beautiful beginning. The album does end on a stellar note, however, with the gorgeous and poignant Classic Girl. You know for us, these are the days..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Shocking 2","review":"A good record.

Ritual de lo Habitual is a well-rounded album that contains two of Janes Addiction's biggest hits, Stop! and Been Caught Stealing. Althought this album packs a punch that will appeal to any fan of high-energy rock n' roll it also contains songs like Three days that reveal the softer more reflective side of the band. Ritual de lo Habitual is a free-spirited album that would be the perfect sound track for a summer road trip or a backyard barbeque."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best","review":"This is the best Jane's addiction album period.It blends world music with hard rock to create a truly original album.Songs 6,7,8 and 9 are the album's best.But the first half is also awesome.Pick it up if your a fan.You won't be dissapointed.Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Graceful Beauty","review":"This album is just magic i mean it is so excellent. It really is the epitome of alternative. Perry's vocals are just so melodic and beautiful.Dave Navarro's psychedelic solo's and guitar playing just add to the bands brilliance. Its a shame that Eric Avery left because he is a legend. This is very differant to 'strays' because this is more melodic and raw. I highly recommend this album for it inspired me in so many different ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Better 90s Pop Bands","review":"For some reason many people have love or hate thoughts toward Jane's Addiction vocals. I am not of the opinion that the vocals are bad. However, though there are a few hits this album, it lacks consistency. I can't say I care much for the songs that didn't chart on this album, and that leads me to believe that Jane's Addiction's popularity is more due to corporate promotion than anything else. Jane's Addiction was a part of the 90s rock revolution, and they are definitely among the better bands of this time. Their guitarist excellent. I am not going to say that they are not talented. However, I will remind you that the local jazz artist is making much less money, and is probably much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanish in Jane's Addiction Songs 101","review":"Ira Moon,The spanish spoken intro actually means \\"We have more influence over your children than you do, but we love them.

Only song that comes close is Pets from Porno for Pyro's. I am sure that the excessive radio play has had something to do with it, but they are mindless drivel of blech. Stop is an epic song. Easiliy one of my all time fav's from any genre or band. No One's Leaving is great too. The rest of the album is ehhh, but the strength of the 1st two songs carries this album to 4 stars in my opinion.If you are just getting into Jane's, Nothing's Shocking is still the best of course.I will say one thing, if you are able to see Jane's live, they make even the ehhh songs on this album great.

Of course they choose entertaining historical trivia such as Mad King Ludwig, sex scandals, disasters and mistakes, and other such things.I don't normally give such things five stars but I can't imagine producing a better example of the genre.

This is the story of Paul, the son of a Roman legionnaire in Britain, who sets out on a journey to Rome, avoiding gangsters along the way, to take a message to the Emperor, and try to save an innocent man's life.

The orientation went against all of my training as a radiology and ct tech, since the image orientation was not consistent.(the right should ALWAYS be the right, doncha know?) I do not recommend it to imaging professionals, as there are better books out there, but it might be ok for medical students or the like.

I do believe I'll continue to use this kind when I decide to color my hair again. It didn't seem to damage my hair, as other haircolors have in the past -- my hair was even soft afterwards.

Instead, what we're left with is the \\"We're SO persecuted!\\" brand of paganism filled with inaccuracies and borrowings from Christianity. In addition, almost all the songs sound alike other than songs taken in whole or in part from others.I'm sick to death of the mentality so many pagan musicians have that just because they have pagan (or vaguely pagan) lyrics that it's okay for the music/lyrics to suck.

Sing, that is. The female manages to hit the right notes most of the time, but the guy---Eeee Gads!! This is what happens when the tone deaf decide to harmonize. The lyrics are cutesy fluff and not intolerable. This is a good bit of music for people new to the Craft, who tend to think anything even remotely Pagan is a good buy. And they do have a nice chant or two which, thankfully, the guy sings so softly he doesn't ruin it.

If you're not afraid to listen to their point of view, then you can enjoy their skill with words and melody and mixing--all are very tightly done.

But we all agreed that the hero stepped out of his well-drawn character at the end. That's the problem with a good character - an author can't just make him do any old thing and have it work.

The sound is similar, the songs are of course perfect in melody and production, and that same relaxed fun feel can be found here.But I just didn't find these songs interesting.

The Wilbury influence is there for sure, specially because George Harrison made contributions in 4 tracks and Tom Petty co-wrote the excellent \\"Blown Away\\". The wonderful ELO sound is also present and perfectly blended with the recently acquired influences.\\"Armchair Theatre\\" could be considered as an introduction to the future sound of ELO. \\"Zoom\\" (2001) is even better, but in order to enjoy it, you probably need to listen to \\"Armchair Theater\\" first. You will find some of Jeff Lynne's best compositions here: \\"Every Little Thing\\", \\"Lift Me Up\\", \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" and my personal favorite \\"Blown Away\\", which is probably the best Petty/Lynne colaboration ever.This one is a must for all ELO fans and a revelation for the non-converted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible design, not worth it","review":"The suunto bike pod is not worth it.

The songs range from thetechno inspired Spinnin' Round, to the Celtic influencesof Mists of Dalriada to the etheral beauty ofLight From Your Eyes. I'm guessing the singlewill be \\"Believe\\".

My supervisor bought several of these monitors to replace the tired old 17\\" CRTs we had around the office and, upon installing them, instantly regretted it. While the dead pixels that plauged most of the screens were irriating enough, the 'pixel jitter' that afflicted every one of the monitors was murder on the eyes.

Approx 6-10 of his books are classics; however, Dick also wrote a lot of just plain awful books (esp. in the 1950s); and due to his growing popularity, some of these books are actually being brought back into print (e.g., the Man Who Japed, World Jones Made). Luckily Counter-Clock world (1966) isn't one of them; however, this is one of Dick's lesser works. It's a short, mildy amusing read, but the ideas in it are frankly underdeveloped and unconvincing. Race relations also are thankfully much better than depicted in this rather quaint and obsolete \\"clunker\\" of a book.

Have you read a lot of his books?If you answered yes then you'll love this. If not I would try one of his more approachable titles first (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, or one of his short-story collections). I would not recommend this to a first time Dick reader; if you don't know what you're getting yourself into you probably will not like it.With that said, I love PKD, and have read quite a few of his works. I, having been aclimated to his style, found it very enjoyable. The only concerns I have are that some of the ideas, with reguards to the backwards flow of time, are somewhat garbled. A good example is how cigeretts are smoked by inhaling the fumes and blowing into the filter- yet the people still manage to communicate while inhaling. Try it yourself, see it's not so easy. I know it's nit-picky, I can't help it.All in all a great book for anyone who already enjoys PKD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, flimsy premise","review":"Anyone who has seen the Red Dwarf episode \\"Backwards\\" will know the basic premise of Counter-Clock World. Based on Dick's short story \\"Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday\\", Counter-Clock World has time running backwards, curiously only on Earth, due to the naturally occuring 'Hobart Phase' (in the short story the Hobart Phase was artificially created).Logic would dictate that everything would have to run backwards but in Counter-Clock World people have a forward-pointing 'arrow of time' while the world they are living in has a reverse arrow of time. Dick selctively has his characters doing certain things in backwards (such as 'imbibing' Sogum and later on uneating a plate of food) and other things forwards like driving a car or carrying on a conversation.Even though the environment of Counter-Clock World is a bit hard to buy it nonetheless a good story and is as worth reading as any of his other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"City: Works of Fiction","review":"Many years ago I found this album on cassette in a cut-out bin and picked it up for two dollars.

If you already know Adobe 2.0, it is very easy to become familiar with 7.0. Also, the precision and accuracy of the various functions reach a higher level and the additional possibilities leave more flexibility to individual creativity. This powerful software is becoming for me a must in all digital works and I cannot give it less than five stars.

The book focuses on a man named Herman Being as he moves through a process of learning to appreciate classical music. Despite the underdeveloped and unrealistic subplots, this book does succeed in presenting the author's idea that repetitive listening is the best way to gain an appreciation for classical music. The book is humorous and enjoyable but I would not recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who agreed to publish this?","review":"Well this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I had to read it for a music appreciation class, and the only good aspect of the entire thing is that it was short. The \\"helpful information\\" and \\"secret\\" theories of music appreciation could have been easily fit into a modest paragraph, and the rest of the book was unnecessary and irrelevant fluff that was so poorly written I was truely shocked. If you have a choice about reading this, I would say don't bother. If you must, do not buy it because it is not worth the paper it is printed on. I suppose it was better than a boring text book lesson on music appreciation, but the information it provided was minimal and barely scratched the surface of the complex methods of music appreciation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but will need to replace","review":"I love these wheels for my hammock!!

Very low grade plastic. The metal wheel caps will simply not fit on the wheels and as a result the wheels wobble off the axle every time you use it. Seemingly designed by a monkey. Comes without assembly instructions too--although it's so basic you can figure it out after a few minutes. And just because it's assembled, doesn't mean it will actually work. Surprised that Pawleys Island put their name on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this thinking it would be an alternative to the belt clip, which people said was flimsy.

This current double (or large) pawley's island rope hammock is not really a double. It's closer to the size of a single. I bought a double pawley's island rope hammock about 5 years ago and the older one is much wider and longer. I guess that is why they now have the larger hammocks(i.e., presidential)...they are probably the size of the old double. I can live with this for a few years, since the cottom hammocks only last about that long. The poly or duracord last longer, but truthfully, they feel hard when laying on them. The cotton is really much more comfortable. Although the size has reduced, I don't think the quality has. We shall see.

I listen to this album fairly regularly for the variety: lyrically and rhythmically. On the Inside, Vincent's Ear, Blue Pacific, and Long Slow Distance are Franks masterpieces.

And singing with only piano accompaniment, as here, she simply can't use most of the power in her voice. As sensitive as her performances are I can't help feeling that she's having to hold back. For American song sung with more delicacy and grace I would suggest Barbara Bonney or Dawn Upshaw (I can't agree with previous reviewers' suggestion of Cheryl Studer's Barber, though Hampson is wonderful on that set)."},{"rating":"1","title":"May have a heart but what good is it if the artistic results are a void?","review":"The header says it all.

They initially were (as usual) unreceptive, but are actually getting into it now. Most of my kids won't go to college and won't need to be able to conjugate verbs or locate the object of the preposition, but they will need to fill out applications, search want ads and read prescription medication. I love this book and really like the areas that allow them to look into things in their own lives (local newspaper, magazines, etc.) for a more practical handle on learning. These kids need to know how it will effect their lives before they are willing to put forth any effort.

I've always been a fan of Shawn's singing and songwriting; so anything that overshadows those basic things, I am reluctant to accept. I couldn't get the songs out of my head, and after listening to the CD a couple more times, I have come to face the fact that I love his new CD. I'm glad that I didn't just discard it after finding it to be different from what I was expecting; I have come to believe that this is his best CD yet.

I finally asked who the artist was, and it was Mullins. I'd never heard his music before, but I've really enjoyed this cd. It's very mellow, very smooth. I really enjoyed the emotions Mullins put in each of his songs. I can't really compare this to any of his previous cds, but I will definitely check out some of his earlier releases now.

There's a couple of design functions that the manufacturer should have looked at a little closer before sending these out. While watching a movie the display reads \\"Play.\\" I personally like to keep track of the time when watching a movie and have to push the Display button to get the time. Movies play well though I seem to hear this one more than my last VCR (low pitched hmmmmm). And the remote control! Don't get me started on the remote control! Just as reported by others, tiny buttons and weirdly arranged. But like any new appliance, you adjust and sooner or later if you spend enough quality time with it, you are able to push the buttons in the dark! Good clear picture when FF and REW. The commercial skip, while it sounds like a cool feature, is a little confusing. Panasonic should have done just a little more road testing with devoted movie watchers/vcr users to fine tune the design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice","review":"This has to be one of the most poorly designed remote controls I have come across. The most frequently used buttons are so small they are difficult to find and activate, especially the CM Skip (commercial skip). You cannot press this twice in succession, but have to wait a few seconds after it stops to start it again. In order to stop a timed recording, you have to hit the power off button(which does not turn the power off) and then hit \\"stop\\". The \\"program\\" and \\"menu\\" keys are also very difficult to find.

You don't need to know the manga (I didn't), to enjoy the story, so definitely recommend this one.There is mild nudity, could have done without the nude bathing scene and occasionally forced hints at lesbianism, but other than that, solid series, great plot, excellent voice acting, well-animated, and a good combination of both action and the humanity that drives all the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting from the start","review":"I tend to lean toward a particular genre of anime Shonen with swords.

Instead of learning words like \\"war\\" or \\"literature\\" you learn \\"hat department\\" and \\"credit card.\\" Perhaps it's the lack of interest/demand for good russian textbooks in the States. The grammar explainations are fine. Quite good in fact. I'm just depressed at what these authors think is of interest to an american/english audience. I can't imagine anyone interested in such an extremely materialistic introduction to Russian. Sadly, I haven't found any alternatives.

The author, Jessamyn West, has captured the \\"evanescent\\" (one of Cress's favorite words) nature of a young girl's personality as she is growing up. The book is a collection of stories about a girl between the ages of 11 and 17 who lives on a ranch in Southern California. Each chapter entrances the reader with Cress's shenanigans. You think she is doing something outlandish or brave; you think the story is going one way, and then you get a view into the workings of Cress's mind and you suddenly understand what she's doing and the story goes in a different direction. As an adolescent I loved Cress because she was me, in all her insecurity, feats of boldness, crass humanity and growing understanding of boys, friends, family and relationships.The last chapter transcends all and always makes me cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coverage of themes in a small space","review":"I was interested in the Thomistic view of the mind and soul per another book of Feser.

A HUGE letdown from their previous album, Bringing Home the Ashes","review":"The Wild Swans 1988 debut album, Bringing Home the Ashes, is a home run: Excellent melodic angsty songs, good chimey arrangements, well sung, winning from end-to-end.At the time of its initial release, I was quite looking forward to this, the followup (and as it would unfold, final) major label album. What a disappointment it turned out to be. The melodies don't stick, the lyrics seem slight, and ultimately it passes without making much impression. Such a disappointment. It's not horrible; just horribly mediocre.Go back and get Bringing Home the Ashes, which holds up quite well 23 years on. This album is simply a footnote to a career that didn't really play out the way it appeared it might."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychedelic Seconds","review":"This is a good album, but to understand it you need to understand the time. The debut \\"Briunging Home the Ashes\\" was a late 80's mope masterpiece, influenced heavily, I believe, by the Smiths. This album, however, was a sharp turn to a psychadelic early rave-influenced sound. Though I did not love this upon release, I did like it, and in retrospect it grows better with each listen. In the context of the time, it has songs reminiscent of \\"Fools Gold\\" by Stone Roses in grooviness but with a much more 60's themed dopey psychedelia. Definately influenced by the Ex & ah-ceed so available during the early 90's. A pleasent distraction for today."},{"rating":"2","title":"White field marker","review":"I bought this to use it at my son's preschool's sport festival.The school has been using spray paint field marker for years, but it was expensive andwe decided to try something different.For a small sport field we used half a bag.We used it on grass, and the lines were difficult to see from far away.We applied the marker several times to make sure the lines were visible.Still, it's a money saver compared to spray paint marker, and we would buy this again.It would probably work well if you are going to use it on soil (or very short grass) baseball/soccer field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author's Comments","review":"This book was put together in the mid-eighties and was a \\"first off its kind\\" in the sense that it covers all the important aspects of the Australian marine environment - oceanography, an introduction to the animals (from the tiniest corals through to whales), the coastal fringes, Barrier Reef, deep ocean as well as providing a look into the seas of the future. There is even a diving guide.What makes the book so special is that the contributors were all top marine biologists and the photography is the best you'll see in any publication.The book was re-printed over and over again and even featured in the American Museum of Natural History bookshop for many years.The author also wrote the quirky Sydney guide - Roland Hughes Wraps Up Sydney - which was very popular at the time and copies of this book are still available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if it you have a cradle","review":"This Wallet only works if you have a hot sync chord as opposed to cradle.

The business card holder has also been helpful to have a convenient place to put the cards I am given while the Pilot is out.

I use a color that is 2 shades lighter than my own hair color so the gray looks like high lights. My hair dresser even asked me where I had gotten my hair high lighted.

I was delighted to discover it on Amazon and surprised to find that I was not the only one who was having this problem. I used a peroxide color on my hair one time and it felt like straw - plus the roots showed up just as quick. I will go gray before I will ever put peroxide on my hair again.

This one does explain that the possible interpretations are subject to the dreamer's own associations, which is the first thing we need to know about dreams. It gives a good range of symbols and is one of the best of its type that I've seen. The basis for the psychology is Jungian, which is simply way more fun for dream interpretive work than Freudian. By the way, there's nothing wrong with approaching dream interpretation with a sense of fun; dreams aren't always weighty psychological things, and we're missing a lot of the entertainment that our minds can provide if we disregard our dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"Everyone at the office loves this book.

One of the other features I like is you can press rew then power and the VCR will shut off after it gets done rewinding.One of the features I do not like is VCR plus+ because you have to use the tv guide to get the numbers and you have to change that number for ever time and channel that show is on. what I wanted it to do is you tell it the show and it records it no matter if the channel that show is on changes or the time that it is on."},{"rating":"2","title":"vcr","review":"I have one very similar to this one and have always loved it.It is very very easy to program and use.It is on it's way to my house and I can't wait to get it.Well I got it yesterday and it was very easy to set upand I am very very pleased with the way it works,and would recommend it to any one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No LP Mode Here","review":"I can't recommend this VCR.

Then a little after the 3 year warranty expired, the screen goes black and the only thing they offered me was a %15 discount to fix it which costs another $100 plus $50 shipping costs depending where you are(i'm in the same state, California). Thanks to all these other reviews, i'm finding that other people are having similar problems with this company. If I were you, i'd find a company WHO CARES ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS!

This VCR is one of the best out there. It's pretty much plug and play. And if you have another component that uses RCA cables for its hookup, you have a choice between the front stereo inputs (perfectly located) or the rear ones. Panasonic is a company that my parents bought from when I was young and I am totally impressed with most, if not all, of their products. My only complaint is that the owner's manual is a bit much, but from another Panasonic VCR that I bought for my parents (1 year ago), that is how Panasonic does things. The blood red auto head cleaning message makes up for that, though! Forget Sony, go with Panasonic (I intend to get that DVD-CV50 DVD player that Panasonic makes as well!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality, Affordable VCR","review":"I am very impressed with the quality of this VCR. The picture quality is excellent, it's relatively easy to use, and the numerous A/V jacks definately help since my TV was running out.However, I do have two gripes that keep this VCR from getting 5 stars. One, the Record button on the VCR face is too close to the Stop/Eject button. I've already accidentally recorded a few seconds of random stuff onto a pair of tapes while trying to Eject them. Additionally, the Light Tower remote control seems to completely defy the ease of use characteristic of other Panasonic products. Awkward button placement and the buttons are really small. If you have another multi-function remote, use that instead. I use the remote that came with my Panasonic TV.However, despite these two issues, if you're in the market for a basic Hi-Fi VCR, this should be at or near the top of your list. It's a good price for a great product, and despite some ergonomic shortcomings, the picture is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, noisy, noisy with a poor remote","review":"This VCR sounds like a muffled electric razor when you turn it on. It forces you to jack up the TV volume so you can hear it over the hum/buzz of this VCR. I can't recommend this VCR to anyone because of this. Plus, the remote has about 30 small buttons which my family found very confusing. A big thumbs down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but confusing","review":"When I purchased this PV-V4620 it was highly recommended by everyone I mentioned it to including my grandson who is a whiz at electronic stuff.

Its hundreds of photographs, drawings, and panoramic paintings bring to life a long buried Indian town and Spanish colonial regional capital. The authors help establish the importance of the overlooked yet once great chiefdoms of the Southeast and of the abortive but still influential efforts of the Spanish to make those chiefdoms part of their empire. At the same time, the authors vividly reconstruct the daily life of the Indians and Europeans who lived and died at San Luis. Hann and McEwan show commendable sensitivity to the native Apalachee inhabitants in the process. This is a book that can satisfy readers of history, Native American studies, or archeology at several levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"quilts","review":"excellent program. well photographed with detailed close ups. if you're considering this dvd, order \\"a century of quilts\\" at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great early toy","review":"I have a 6 month old that loves this pig.

He's brightly colored and extremely cute. She started playing with him at around 5 months. I wouldn't recommend him much earlier, he'd be too big to hang on to. I imagine later, when she's older, she'll think the coins are neat too. You can't see in the photo but on the other side of the coins they have as many dots as the currency, which seems to hold her gaze for a while.

This is John Lennon as the myth-makers want him remembered. Lots of good, interesting information in here, but it is obvious it's a whitewash. My advice...read the good, bad and ugly books on John, (you can skip Goldman's), shake well, pour, and you might get a somewhat accurate portrait of the artist.I liked the book by the guy who stole the diaries, but liking it doesn't mean I believed it totally. Disliking this book doesn't mean I think it's all B.S. It's just that this book was written by his friend with input from Yoko's publicist.

Coleman tells the Lennon story from his perspective as a British journalist and former acquaintance of John Lennon. As such he is in touch with many valuable sources, and not with others. Perhaps this books should be read in tandem with Albert Goldman's negatively sensational but well-researched biography.

Chet Atkins, Stevie Ray Vaughn are/were others. Robert Cray. I have seen Knopfler do so many diverse things in his career, so I was not surprised by the uniqueness of the style and the more I listen to this, the more I like it. It is one of my favorite for the past several years. Another is Screenplaying by Knopfler (music from four soundtracks he did) which I have given to half a dozen friends.

I thought the format was DVD-Audio because that's the specific search I conducted, but the format is actually DVD-Video. Also, I read in one of the reviews that the disc was Dolby Digital compatible but it's not (it's DTS). As such, I couldn't appreciate the 5.1 surround sound, which was the whole point of my purchase (as well as to serve as an introduction to the great Hector Berlioz). Couldn't return it because I opened the package. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing stereotypes abound...","review":"Really disappointed to see the stereotypes this author connects to different styles of shoes. She was totally off the mark on several styles I wear, connecting them to personality traits that aren't even close to how I am. Judging by the other reviews I read, this book may just unfortunately reflect what \\"the masses\\" assume about certain people who wear certain styles. Sad to say that this book will likely cause wrong impressions and even discrimination against people who wear certain styles by those who read this book and buy into it. Could be a generational thing in that the author makes assumptions that date the book, reflecting a limited age range's view of others. Alarming thing is that readers may give more credence than they realistically should only because of the author's credentials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check it out!","review":"This book is such an accurate read on your personality, it is a must have!

It's awful. Simply about some nerd that goes missing in the woods and one kid that wants to find him. This book was horrible language, containing the somewhat-dreaded 'effword' and many things containing sexual references. It was like a Stephen King wannabe book, and really doesn't pull you in. If you want a good read, pick up \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.\\" It's at least the littlest bit suspenseful, and though it's a little over my age group and still says cursewords, it was far better than this dissappointment of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A parent's perspective","review":"This book is on a reading list for 9th grade. I bought it for my son to read and I read it myself. It contains several \\"f\\" words and several \\"a\\" words. It also has other offensive language. I don't particularly mind the language, my son has certainly heard it before, but should this be on a 9th grade reading list? I don't think so. Also, the book contains many sexual references and is written from the perspective of an 11th grade student. The author tries to use slang for the teens she writes for but isn't often successful. Terms such as \\"crashed out\\" for falling asleep don't make sense. The term is \\"crashed\\". Also, what teen says \\"don't wig out\\"???? The story was predictable and I knew what was going to happen by the time I was half way through. If there are any other books on your child's reading list I would recommend you look to them.

Sometimes it's hard to remember what it was like to be a teenager, even for someone as young as I am. But Plum-Ucci obviously hasn't. She manages to capture all of the gut wrenching humiliation and heartache that go along with those years. And I have to admit that I was one of those kids watching from the sidelines.

So I read around a chapter or two every other night or so.The easiest aprt for me to read was toward the end of the book because thats when it got really exciting and the mystery startd to unfold.I think that this book is excellent for anyone who enjoys mystery stories.

The other problem is the weakness in signal amplification in the auto: I find it necessary to turn the radio volume almost to the maximum level to acheive reasonable volume. This means that when you revert to normal radio usage, you will be blasted out of the car if you forget to adjust the volume.I also have an issue with Sirius' advertising claims of \\"commercial-free\\".

It's got Humphrey Bogart and Peter Ustinov - two of the best reasons I know for watching a movie - along with the inimitably villainous Basil Rathbone and the bumbling likeable Leo G. Carroll (aka Mr. Waverly in 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'). Sean Penn left comedy behind with Ridgmont High and can't seem to find that magic again.

The acting is wooden, the writing is hackneyed and the direction misguided...and it proved that Demi Moore wasn't an actress even 10 years ago let alone now. Not one truly enjoyable moment in the whole production. The cinemtography is the only saving grace; a keen eye for space and composition. This film lacks soul and humor. The two things that made the original so engaging You would be better of spending your $ on the 1955 original.

She loves to play babies with her two older sisters so I thought that the \\"Little Mommy\\" items would be great for her. She loves having her own baby items (we also have the swing) but I have been very disappointed with the quality of the toy. The wheels often fall off while she is trying to push the stroller and any of the poles used for support also fall off often. I wish they would come up with something that snaps together and stays there. The swing is also very flimsy and the poles that hold the top on just slide right out causing the swing to fall apart when she tries to get her doll out. I am usually very satisfied with Fisher-Price toys but not in this case. I am planning on getting one of the Graco strollers for her for Christmas. They are much more durable, larger, and they look just like the ones real mom's use!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"While the style and colors of this stroller are really cute for a little girl, it is a real piece of junk!! Not sturdy at all, very flimsy and too lightweight. Bought this for my 18-month old and I should have listened to the other reviews. The dolls DO NOT stay in the seat and the seat belt is too difficult for young children to manipulate that they get frustrated with it, as do I. Why Fisher Price didn't make a more hammock-type cloth seat on this is beyond be. Also, no basket on the bottom either.

It is cute, fun, works well with the doll, etc. But I agree it is cheaply made. The one wheel pops off almost daily, and if it happens to fall the wrong way or my daughter pushes it the wrong way the seat detatches from the back of the stroller. Despite these problems, they are all easy enough to fix, just a little annoying, and I find that the plastic is nicer than fabric as I have seen many tattered and torn fabric strollers. It appears that many little girls don't realize they can't fit in the stroller when the moment strikes, and the plastic stroller is more forgiving of this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this stroller. My 19 month old daughter has the Little Mommy doll, and loves to use her older sister's doll stroller, so I thought I'd get her one of her own. It is cute, and goes together easily. However, it's not designed well. The Little Mommy doll is almost too big for the stroller. The velcro strap is difficult for a 4year old to fasten. The wheels do not roll well, and the stroller base is too close to the ground - there's not enough clearance room. It's difficult to push on any kind of surface that has any height (plush carpet, grass). We've also had a problem with one of the wheels popping off. My older daughter's stroller was a different brand, was cheaper, rolls much easier on all different surfaces, and has held up well."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute stroller!!!","review":"My daughter has played with this stroller for over a year now, and it's still holding up.

Not so, the wheels constantly fall off, we have lost one of them so now the stroller is no good. The seat belt comes out and is a frustration to me to keep putting it back in.And it doesn't fit any other dolls well, if you have a lot of small dolls it's ok but only one of my daughter's dolls fits in here. It's fine for a short child as a first stroller, maybe in the 1-2 year old range as long as they have help putting the doll in it.

This one is a good size for a two year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick a different stroller","review":"I bought my daughter the \\"Little Mommy\\" doll and asked relatives to purchase the accessories as gifts at Christmas time. The doll is adorable, but the plastic accessories leave a lot to be desired. The stroller seat is made of stiff plastic, therefore the doll will not stay in the seat unless the velcro straps are fastened. The is a difficult feat for a 1.5-2 year old. To make matters worse, one strap broke about six months after she received it. So now it is pretty much worthless. I have found all of the \\"Little Mommy\\" products poorly made. She also received the Baby center (it is a diaper changing station/bath/bed/potty/high chair in one). The little booster seat is too small for the doll, making it nearly impossible for my now 2 year old to get the doll in and out of the seat.My advice it to buy the doll and then purchase the Graco products to accompany it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but flimsy","review":"My two year old daughter absolutely loves this toy, but the velcro doesn't stay closed and the frame is always popping apart.

It didn't take ten minutes for the front wheels to fall off, and the seat to come apart from the stroller. It tips VERY easily, and even a small toddler has to bend over to push this stroller.

After some digging, I found the yellow one first as well as the Separatist Starfighters, I was triumphant. The wings and cockpits of the two Jedi ships come apart, but are very easy to snap back together, and very durable independently. The two Vulture droids are very spiffy, and have a very simple assembly that allows for simple deconstruction and re-building. The Tri-Fighter is unfortunately very unwieldy, and doesn't store well, but as a fan, it's a must have. The current price is probably not worth it for a new set.

The songs stick in your head and demand to be played, and beg to be played for your friends as well.The piece that stands out the most to me is Jacaranda, and gets my vote for Best Song To Sing Along To In The Shower Or Car, which, rest assured, I do when alone as a public service, since I couldn't possibly compete with the singer.Said vocalist has an elusive voice that is silver with texture and secrets, and she sings the faerie theme well. Most of the songs have an upbeat melody peppered with some non-Western influences, and provide a nice contrast to the subject matter that reflects the title. In short, the lyrics manage to be unconventional while the music is exotic and personable at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated classic.","review":"This album is as good as Holy Diver, Last In Line, Dream Evil and Sacred Heart. The slow songs are great and the faster power metal songs are great too. Ronnie's voice has never been better and Rowan Robertson is as good if not better than any other Dio guitarist. Robertson was only 16 but his riffs and solos are amazing. The best songs are Born On The Sun, Lock Up The Wolves, Walk On water, Why Are They Watching Me and My Eyes. Every song on this album is worth listening too. If you like Dio's other albums or good metal music in general than buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy but slow","review":"I think this album was a start to a string of Dio's albums that were heavy, but slow. After this we had: Strange Highways and Angry Machines. Most of the songs on here are well-written and a few of them are more faster and upbeat. \\"Wild One\\" and \\"Walk On Water\\" are more reminiscent of old-school Dio. The title track, in my opinion, is an 8:30 metal treat! I can understand the lower review numbers, it is a slow album.

He found some 18 year old kid to play guitar on this one and added a former AC/DC drummer as well. While there are some very good songs on here like \\"Wild One\\", \\"Lock Up the Wolves\\", \\"Walk on Water\\" and \\"My Eyes\\" for the most part it's a pretty boring album. Most of the songs are the same mid-tempo rockers that Dio loves to do and they don't really contain anything memorable as far as riffs or melodies. I'd recommend this one over Dream Evil but just barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more case of the missing guitar player","review":"As Ronnie got further and further away from the COMPLETE guitar players of Ritchie Blackmore and Tony Iommi, the more his solo albums suffered. The series of Viv Cambell speed/thrash/shred/look a likes began to make every track on the album sound like the next. You end up hoping for a decent ballad to justify your money. But unfortunately on Wolves, its just another guitar PLAYER. Blackmore and Iommi were PLAYERS and COMPOSERS. RJD just needs to find himself the right axe man (Hey Ronnie - Tony isn't doing much these days) and with his pipes and lyrics, we could still get some more 'magic' out of Dio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good album","review":"This album isn't good.

I grew up with Dio. In the 80s he was one of the biggest names in heavy metal with legions of fans and followers. Most importantly, he played with some absolutely incredible musicians in Elf, Rainbow, Sabbath, and his early solo career. I'll never, never, never, never understand how his music slipped so much after the departure of V. Campell. As popular and experienced as Dio was, he should have been able to recruit better musicians, the way, perhaps, Ozzy recruited ZW. Even the most honest, die-hard Dio fan has to admit that this album sounds like a demo of B-tracks. Sorry to be so blunt! Dio is a legend, deserves to be a lengend, but there's nothing of his greatness--his MAGIC--on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dio's decline","review":"I was excited to get this CD. I was much pleased with Dio's last album Dream Evil, and judging by the cover art, I was going to enjoy this album. But I should've remembered never to judge a book by its cover. I was actually shocked by Lock Up The Wolves because its so darn SLOW. The only real rocker is Wild One, a good song in its own right. The title track is stomachable but the rest are just forgettable. Only Die-Hard Dio fans should get this, but even die-hard Dio fans, like myself, will be disappointed.

Every track is excellent, highlights include \\"Born on the Sun,\\" \\"Evil on Queen Street,\\"Night Music,\\" \\"Between Two Hearts,\\" and \\"My Eyes.\\" Really, every track is strong--even the title cut, though it runs a bit long and starts off slowly, is a good song. The sound quality of this particular CD is pretty good--better than my older 80's Dio cds, and no as good as the albums from the 2000's. Very good CD, whether you're a Dio fan or not, this is a great hard rock CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful to all ages","review":"A beautifully illustrated book without words telling the tale of an intrepid and inventive mouse who escapes from his book by using the materials at hand to create a boat to freedom in the real world at sea. Monique Felix is a gifted illustrator who's characters speak volumes in their expressions. I used to take turns \\"reading\\" the books in this series to my children and having them \\"read\\" to me when they were young, and to my delight, they have remembered them fondly and still \\"read\\" them from time to time, even though they are teenagers now. This is a charming book, timeless and ageless. Both young and old will find it's simpliciy and beauty an enduring treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good documentary on Greece","review":"As the other reviewers have mentioned this is more a documentary on Athens not Greece. However, there is an enough educational material for me to recommend this one for those who are interested in the study of historical Greece. The Athenians are the main focus with Sparta mentioned in passing but the Greeks made valuable contributions to civilization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but should have been called \\"Athens\\".","review":"My only complaints are that it only covered Athens and I wish it had covered a larger time frame. It covers from Athens revolutionary conversion to Democracy thru the death of Socrates. I wish it had continued through to the Roman conquest, but what can we expect for just under 3 hours. I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Budget Pulp","review":"Lot's of dramatic music, words like \\"astounding\\", \\"astonishing\\", \\"amazing\\" and endless close-up shots of ancient pottery, trees blowing in the wind, armour hanging on walls etc makes this a boring DVD. They obviously had a low budget. The idea of telling the story of the Greeks is good but this DVD doesn't do it any justice. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly devoid of information","review":"You'd think a PBS production on one of the most important and well-known civilizations in history would be worth watching, but you'd be wrong in this case. This video series has amazingly low information density: a few historical facts are thrown in to keep Liam Neeson half occupied in a slow narration, while the video footage consists mostly of long closeups of still actors posing as Socrates and Pericles, or of a few urns. There is almost no discussion of Greek mythology or gods, little discussion of city-states other than Athens and few references to Sparta, almost no discussion of architecture, etc etc. You'll mostly waste your time and money with these tapes. 15 minutes reading the most cursory and simple chapter of high school Greek history will give you three times the information. All in all, a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"165 minutes of quality time","review":"I won't get technical in my review but I'll tell you this, if you want to learn a good bit about history in a very entertaining way then buy this DVD. It's not too lengthy but doesn't end when you feel that you want more either. The story telling is good and systematic and easy to follow. The pictures and scenes are well acted and shot.They even have men posing as the real characters, and they're very convincing too! Don't laugh, but for a while I was wondering how did they get to know how did the characters look like to be able to generate such a true-look image of them! LOLHmm, I hope that this remark doesn't diminish my credibility after all! LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and relaxing","review":"This first book in the trilogy is the only one written in \\"letters home\\" form. I found Lucy's character to be real and believable.

The author hardly touches upon any real principles and the examples are shown as miniature screenshots which you need a magnifying glass to read! Why not use the standard \\"fixed width font\\" code listings everyone else does.This major failing of the book makes it hard to gain anything from it and I sent it back for a refund.Buy Mastering Cold Fusion 4.5 by Arman Danesh instead : he's vastly improved on the earlier version and corrected most of the negative areas commented on by reviewers of that book to deliver a superb reference work which demonstrates real-world CF examples that you can learn from.The only people who MIGHT benefit from this book are: a) people with Bionic vision or b) people who want a vague overview of Cold Fusion's capability.A much better Beginner level book is Cold Fusion 4 for Dummies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Product","review":"This product suggests that you take one pill in the morning or 2 in the morning for more rapid results. Well I went out on a limb and took 2 in the morning and 2 in the early evening.What I like most about this item is that I noticed the difference by the 2nd day of usage. My friend gave me a few, so I only had 3 days worth. By the 4th and 5th day I was still able to maintain the hunger control without even taking the pills. So they definitely work and they don't give you the jitters or nervous feeling that other diet pills give you. It does not speed you up which is a good thing for me because that feeling scares me. It simply decreases your appetite. But it is very important to eat breakfast so that you can get your metabolism going and eat small meals through the day. Snacking on healthy foods is even a great idea to keep your metabolism going so that you can burn calories.\\"LOVE THIS PRODUCT\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"The pictured product above says \\"Triple-Action Weight Control\\" and the one I received only says \\"Liquid Soft-gel Weight Control.\\" I looked everywhere on the box and found no mention of any \\"action\\" that this product is supposed to do.

How fantastic! I took the pills anyway, they did absolutely nothing for me, not even the energy I didn't ask for. Maybe they found out that the product is useless and changed the packaging to avoid getting sued?

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the price; $7 is a lot for a 20 minute read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"This film blows!If you're looking for a good zombie movie, pass this one up in favor of any Romero film. The plot is non-existant (did the little girl grow up?) and almost nothing the characters do makes any sense. You actually cheer for the monsters in this one, becuase you think it would make the movie shorter if they kill all of the people.Some movies are so bad they become funny, but this isn't in that case here. With inconsistent (ninja?) zombies who like to duke it out and succumb to punches in the stomache (since when do the living dead get boo-boos?)you're sure to regret wasting over an hour of your life.I write this warning becuase fans of the horror and specificly zombie genre are only going to be angry at watching what might have been a halfway decent film with better actors, zombies that behaved like zombies, an actual story instead of none and characters that you kinda understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Extremely BAD Zombie Movie!!!","review":"Sometime back in either February or March, we had a big snow storm and got out of school for a about a week. I watched ZOMBI 3,4,and 5 during that time! The only one I sort of liked was Zombi 3! I didn't like this one because it took place on some kind of tropical island. I don't like zombies on an island! I didn't like that it dealt with Voodoo. I didn't like the depressing ending! The gore effects were ok! DO NOT WATCH ZOMBIE 4!!!p.s.

It is, of course, a poor Italain gore epic. It portrays poor acting, poor gore effects, poor directing, etc. Muct like Zombi 3, it entertains for all the wrong reasons it was intended for....it makes you laugh. It takes place...oh my goodness....on a tropical island! How original! The dead rise and attack some scientists on the island and then some visitors. The zombies aren't your typical zombies; these ones run, jump, THINK, and use weapons. Again if you take this film for what it is, you will find some entertainment in it. One complaint is that the actual title in the film says just \\"After Death\\" and the box art says \\"Zombie 4: After Death\\". I hate when company's release movies like this. Please put the title of the actual movie on the box! No more white lies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Zombie Movie I have Ever seen!!!","review":"Plain and simple... this movie sucks!!!! The Zombies are really lame looking, and they are not consistant with thier actions (one moment they will be jumping around, the other they will be walking slow, and they talk in some parts of the movie).The acting is HORRIBLE!!!!! This movie is good for a few laughs (unless your the one that spent money on this peice of crap).STAY AWAY from this movie!!!!

It contains dozens of great photos from Lee's career. Lee's growth from a young handsome actor to a legendary star is traced by the photos and the reviews in this book. The book tells the story of each film by Lee Marvin and also contains much information about Lee Marvin's television and documentary work as well.The film reviews have detailed information about the films' plot and theme; and information about the producers, directors and other actors in the film. The reviews are set in chronological order so the progress of Lee Marvin's career may be easily followed.This book only minimally describe Lee Marvin's personal life outside the movies. It takes the view of a student and fan of Lee Marvin - a fan who has all the best photos and has compiled all the details about Lee Marvin's films and his acting career.

Obviously hand made by unskilled workers. Bad welds and sloppy hole drilling made them almost impossible to assemble. Ordered four and had to re-drill holes in two of them.

My favorite tracks are I'll Be Your Everything, When I Dream of You, and You're the Best Thing(That Ever Happned to Me). Tommy Page is one of those artists who are musically dead now in the 'States, but he once was a craze for the listeners about a decade ago. You can sit back with this album and reminisce about the great times you had.Tommy Page also reminds me of another artist named Michael Drange.

It sounded like one of those dreadful American Idol auditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This book is an analysis of a non-sexual folk-lore tale. There is nothing 'erotic' about it. The first chapter is the actual commonly known tale of a miller tricked by a water fairy (nixie)into losing his son to improve his fortune, yadda, yadda, yadda. The rest of the book is a break down of each part of the story as it is 'interpreted' by the author. Very dry, very disappointing. Even the analysis is done poorly.

It makes an interesting pair to read with John S.D. Eisenhower's \\"Intervention\\", which focuses more heavily on the US role in these events (especially the incident at Tampico and the seizure of Vera Cruz).The book does have a bit of a \\"bias\\" you should be aware of going in. He really seems to come across with the idea that radical revolution is good, and those who are not radical (like Madero) are to be dismissed. In the circumstances, he may not be wrong, but I prefer my history not to wear his opinion quite so blatently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for a long trip!","review":"We purchased this for a long trip with the kids.

They absolutely loved the game, and for that reason, I think the concept is fantastic.However, the round magnets used to mark the items you've found/seen are of terribly poor quality and barely stick to the pages. We went over one bump and my youngest child lost close to half her magnets on the floor. We found only two of them (no idea where the other seven went). We're going to end up going to the craft store to buy strong round magnets to stick on the board instead. Unfortunately, that will probably cost me almost as much as replacing the entire game outright. Kind of crappy when my kids only got to use it once.If the magnets were stronger and the pieces would actually stay on the board, I would have given this game five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"The old adage applies...\\"You get what you pay for\\".

The compartment for your cheque book is easily accessible without exposing your cash and the calculator is a bonus. It is well made and professionally stitched. not tacky at all.

The content of many of the poems contained in this book is similar to the great beat poets of the 40's and 50's. While the poetry rarely contains the anger found in Ginsberg's poems, the language occasionally lapses into crudity.

I was expecting clear definintions and a buildup of theories and ideas but instead was thrown headfirst into Nazi occupied France and bombarded with seemingly unrelated events and people who I guess are pioneers of this philosophy? As in my title, I think I should feel pretty smart if I can just make it to the end of this book and have a fraction of an understanding of what existentialism is.

His list of recommended books at the end is very useful. However, he is too rigid in his interpretation of dragons. Dragons are not necessarily symbols of Satan. What about the dragons in the Psalms (in some translations at least) that are exhorted to praise God? It would be unfortunate if children, on Mr. O'Brien's advice, were to be denied the pleasure of reading \\"The Reluctant Dragon.\\" Or Laurence Yep's Chinese-dragon series. Or Patricia C. Wrede's delightful \\"Dealing With Dragons\\" and its sequels. There is nothing harmful about these books, or about Madeleine L'Engle's, Lloyd Alexander's and Stephen Lawhead's fantasies, all of which celebrate virtue and the victory of good over evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks very easily","review":"The device has two major drawbacks, the first is that the earpiece hangs off a thin bit of plastic that quickly breaks off. They clearly realise this is an issue as they give you a spare, but that is no good when they only last about a week each.The other big problem is that they both have multi-function on/off buttons instead of a switch. This means that getting the thing turned on is about 30-45 seconds since you have to push and-hold-the-stupid-thing-down for a very-very long time. The sender is worst of all, that has three modes, off, standby and in use. In practice the standby mode is completely pointless, you might as well turn the thing off completely since it will take ten seconds at least for the thing to make a connection to the earpiece - often much longer.There have to be better designs out there that this turkey.

It's made for--that's right--photography in its digital form. Professional photography to be used in publications and on the web.Someday I hope to understand all the tricks and tools of Photoshop. But even if you have a basic knowledge of layers, the pen tool, fill, and an eraser (paintbrush if you're creative), you can do amazing things.I'll never outgrow Photoshop.

That is to say, it has a good range of features and is very flexible, capable of producing anything to which you set your mind.However... because of the depth of features, it can be INCREDIBLY difficult to use at first, and even the simplest tasks can take an age to perform if you aren't fluent with the software!! In that respect, it scores low for ease of use, but since it is probably not intended for the amateur user, it would be unfair to let this count against it.Don't be intimidated by this -it'll become easy once you've done a few tutorials, and once you've mastered it the world is your oyster- but be prepared to have learn first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Exactly As Described","review":"What I ordered.

I tend to like a more prominent lead guitar sound, so I can't quite say he is on par with Springsteen yet.

To put it another way, average artists seem largely incapable of this, and great artists can do it -- but not always. With the release of \\"The Animal Years\\" Josh Ritter has clearly identified himself as a songwriter with staying power.I think \\"Animal Years\\" is a more consistent album than \\"Starling.\\" If it perhaps lacks any single song that reaches the romantic/poetic heights of \\"Kathleen\\" or \\"Wings,\\" it makes up for it with more-than-solid offerings like \\"Girl in the War,\\" \\"Good Man,\\" \\"Thin Blue Flame,\\" and \\"Lilian Egypt\\" (sure to be one of his best live tunes for years to come).A fantastic album from one of the era's best songwriters -- don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE SONG OF THE YEAR...","review":"My favorite song of the year by a longshot is Girl in the War.

In both instances, the characters were trying to meet a particular challenge. In Missing Links the challenge was to be the first to play a round in the elite golf course next door, where, I suppose, the grass is greener on the other side.This book was a perfect choice for summer vacation reading.

As it was, I never really got the sense that this was a real person/character telling this incredibly predictable story. There are some nice touches in this book, notably when he's talking about golfing with his uncle and really developing a passion for the game.

Now we can ponder the deep literary meaning of the words \\"frick\\" and \\"boink\\". Buyer beware!

The bet ends up affecting their friendship and their lives. After many (often hilarious) schemes, things work out for our heroes. Reilly is best known as a columnist for Sports Illutrated and this is his first novel.. As such it is a great effort.

But there is no place in this book for the sobering and depressing family history, especially with regards to the main character's father and brother. Still, this book is a MUST read for all golfers, and especially those from Massachusetts, although I don't think it refers to Ponkapoag Golf Course, a muni in Canton, MA, but rather to Franklin Park Golf course in Dorchester."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious look at the real world of golf","review":"Golf the sport is not in its truest form at Augusta National, or Pebble Beach, or Sawgrass. It is at its best on the everyday courses of America, where hackers try to keep their scores low and their blood alcohol content high.That is the world Rick Reily writes about in his unroarious book, Missing Links. Centered on the shenanagans of four duffers who try to play 18 on an exclusive course, the book is really nothing more than an insightful, biting look into America's real golf world. Let's face it, forks: there is a cementhead and a two-down at every public course in America.If you play golf- if you have seen golf-hell, if you know what golf is, you should read this book. It is absolutly hilarious, dead on accurate, and a joy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny!","review":"I don't know too much about golf but the descriptions of Ponky, the worst golf course in America, had me laughing out loud.The situations that the characters find themselves in, in an attempt to play at the exclusive Mayflower Club, are hilarious!I recommend this book to any lover of comedic fiction, whether you understand the game of golf or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Substance","review":"Being an avid golfer and having been employed in the golf world I could not believe how repetitious and boring this book was.

The golf, the characters, the golf, etc.My favorite line: \\"I love golf for all the times when it's just the twilight and you and the crunch of your spikes on the fall leaves.\\"Yeah. That about says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gollf nuts will love this book","review":"Good book about the kind of golf most people play- not the exclusive country clubs we see featured in golf magazines, but the run down muni's who could use a few extra groundskeepers, a little more grass on the fairways, and a ball washer or two. Reilly does a first rate job of describing the world of a bunch of blue collar hackers, with all their foibles and eccentricities. The plot is well crafted, too, although maybe a little storybook in the end.The one criticism I have of the book is that while he does a good job of including women and ethnic minorities among the regulars at the muni, he resorts to every cheap stereotype imaginable when it comes to describing a couple of homesexual characters. While a writer wouldn't dare use cliches about women, african-americans, or the disabled for cheap laughs or as plot devices anymore, apparently Mr. Reilly sees nothing harmful in portraying gays as sexually deviant, deceitful, lisping caricatures."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One's Shanked","review":"I bought this expecting something much wittier, and less like rejected lines from Jay leno's monologue.

A little bit over the top, perhaps, but I don't think there are any pretenses that it won't be. Rick Reilly could have wrote a snoozer with the somewhat stereotypical & one dimensional characters, but instead they all seem to come together.The insults & side gags are great, the quest to win \\"the Bet\\" has a lot of twists & turns and (somewhat) unexpected interconnected threads.There are some truly funny situations, and even the running jokes seem to hit the mark.A lot of people will call this \\"Caddyshack, the novel\\", and I think it's really the highest compliment. I don't find too many books to be laugh-out-loud funny, but this one is.The sequel, \\"Shanks for Nothing\\", while entertaining, is no where near as good as Missing Links."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"Do yourself a favor and buy this locally.

This *very* slim volume barely skims the surface of the topic, and contains much out-of-date information, such as references to the Census Room and St. Catherine's House. At the very least a new edition is called for, and this one should be withdrawn. I think all researchers would be far better served by one of the publications directly from the PRO (such as Jane Cox's 'Never Been here Before?') or the excellent guide to UK research, with vast amounts of information on the PRO, by Mark Herber - 'Ancestral Trails'.

Very little in terms of an intimate portrait and advice on becoming a champion skater.Christine Brennan did a better job capturing intimate glimpses of Witt in a few pages in \\"Inside Edge\\" compared to this entire book. I wanted to read more about growing up in GDR, how her friendship with Roz Summers developed, the controversy of the government spying on her, more biographical information about HER and her skating.

Never quite sure if this girl actually exists or not.Also, this book is preachy and....boring, boring, boring.Where are the great skating stories, the background info on skating in Germany?What about Katarina's fears and thoughts on life in general.None of this in this book.Skate right by this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Katarina's involvement with the Stasi?","review":"I wonder why Katarina stirs clear about her real life and her close involvement with the Stasi, and how it ruined and destroyed people's lives, it would at least have made a more interesting read than this dull book.Ho hum, it has been said that Ms. Witt was never a very naturally gifted figure skater, that even her wonderfully choreographed programs were never easy for her to do.It's also rather odd that for such an unrepentant and strident communist to take advantage of all the opportunities western life has given her, but she doesn't seem in the least bit grateful. Everything is about her, her, her.

There was more information about Abraham Lincoln in these videos than the shorter,and less interesting, A&E; or History Channel versions. The presentation was done very tastefully and thoroughly. The pictures and theme music seem historically accurate.Also,the voices of James Earl Jones and Jason Robards literally gave me the chills for their perfect portrayals and narration.Also, no one voices a better Mary Lincoln than the one-and-only Glenn Close. On a whole, the video was excellent. These videos even entertain children of all ages.The downside is that this edition is no longer in production, and only available in VHS format.

Jude wrote this album from the heart after breaking up with his girlfriend, and spent a long time with his friends in a small apartment. The music is diverse, tending to be Rock/Pop, but with smotherings of blues, and a few rich ballads. There is not a low point on this album. Anyone who has suffered a bad break up with thier partner will find meaning in the lyrics, which are sung with passion. \\"time for letting go\\", and \\"this time its us\\" are good examples. \\"baby its tonight\\" was the standout single, but so many could have been. \\"Heart of blues\\" is an all time classic, guitar rock groove, and \\"get me throgh the night\\"is a crank it up killer.

You wont with this one, i guarantee it. I have every Jude Cole CD, and as this was my first, it is still my favorite. The music on this CD is downright soulfull. Each song evokes emotions and memories long forgotten. You can also hear his innocence implode onto each song.

And it's hard to decide which direction Jude Cole is going here. There's a hit of a Mellencamp-esque roots approach (could have something to do with co-writer George Green) but that is glossed over by a late-80s production of keyboards and slick guitars that would later be known as \\"adult contemporary rock\\".

Have been a great fan of Steve Mann for ages & own all his LP's, but didn't know the obscure Max Ochs made a (recent) record. And also didn't know Harry Tauusig made it on vinyl, already in the sixties.I guess the vinyl version of this LP is impossible. But also the \\"young\\"ones on this CD are great; most of them I already knew, but the delicate Kaki King is new for me. She has a great sounding, orchestral fluid sound in her playing; reminds me a bit of Michael Hedges.I'd be able to give only a few additions to this marvelous CD: Fred Gerlach on Folkways (1958) or Elisabeth Cotten.

It offers plenty of protection so that stuff doesn't spill out--the bag's cover is fastened with a velcro strap, and over this you can fasten a buckle that adds a second layer of protection. The main inside compartment (where you will store the digicam) comes with a moveable/removeable boundary that you can adjust so that however wide your digicam is, it will not bounce around. These guys thought of everything!

SOMETHING TO REMEMBER is not to be confused with a later recording of Madonna's of the same title(from 1995). The cover photo is a promotional photo for DT,theatrically released in June or July 1990. The other songs are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bless This Mess","review":"Most of this album is just not that great! Vogue is the sole bright spot, but i'll admit that Hanky Panky, More, Something To Remember and What can you Lose are O.K. If you have not been exposed to any of Madonna's albums before, don't let this be your first! Go buy Music, Like A Prayer, or Erotica (my personal favorite) instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Ok!","review":"When this was released back in 1990, I was a huge Madonna fan. She had just got through promoting her 1989 masterpiece \\"Like A Prayer\\" album and I was awaiting what she had in store for us now. I am truly disappointed in this album, the only reason for the purchase of this album is for the classic track \\"Vogue\\". Besides that, the album is total noise! The song \\"I'm Going Bananas\\" is odd, Madonna must have gone bananas to record that. I am still not sure to this date, why she released this album. The only other decent track on this album is \\"More\\", it's not a jaw dropping song but its decent. As for the other tracks they are not good at all. The song \\"Hanky Panky\\" is just plain bad. As I stated before, the only reason for the purchase of this album is \\"Vogue\\", and as of now, you can get that track on the \\"Immaculate Collection\\" album. Not a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz is what Madonna can do best","review":"Madonna has all ways changed her look and her music and this album is no diffearnt I thought itwould be ok, but I did not think it would be the best.I think this cd is a most have for all Madonna fans. recommed songs would be \\"He's a man\\" ,\\"\\"Cry baby\\",More and Vouge\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie soundtrack","review":"madonna is always great no matter what. This was a great album and is full of swagger and class. LISTEN TO IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Madonna's best","review":"Although as a Madonna CD collector it remains one of my least played, I'll go ahead and write a review. Here it is: The one bad thing about pop stars is that they always recycle their sound. Not Madonna. The good thing is is that she took a break and went jazz. Now the album is not 100% jazz, but the music did not quite fit her. I'm sure a lot of Madonna fans may agree with me on this one. Yes, I know she played a lounge singer in Dick Tracy. I'm glad though this caps off with \\"Vogue\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unknown Gem","review":"I am a huge Madonna fan and this cd ranks at the top of my list. This is one of her less discovered cd's and I definately reccommend this for anyone who has not heard it.\\"I'm Breathless\\" shows off the familiar sexy side of Madonna, but in a new 40s style. She plays the dithy blond of the 40s to perfection, creating a hilarious cd. You can't help laughing during the tracks \\"Hanky Panky\\"and \\"I'm Bananas.\\" The moody soleful melody of \\"What can you lose\\" brings another element to the album. And a bonus track at the end- \\"Vogue\\" a Madonna classic.Overall, this cd brings out new elements in Madonna and strengthens those that she is famous for. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best song is....","review":"madonna i'm breathless is a GOOD album but madonnas done better!the BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM IS DEFINITLEY VOUGE i love more tooo the rest is uhhhh BORING!the cover is O-KAY and the inserts are avradge there is a mini poster in side so i recomend it for MADONNA FANS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different From Madonna","review":"I like every track on this album. It is good to hear Madonna do something like this. It shows off her voice better than do most of her other albums. She really does have an intriguing voice. My favorite track is \\"Something To Remember\\" but I also like \\"He's A Man\\" and \\"Hanky Panky\\". Of course, this is the album that gave the world \\"Vogue\\". And it does stand the test of time, along with everything else on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Padded like a mattress","review":"I picked this up after reading an enjoying a few of Ramsey Campbell's short stories in various horror compilations. This is strange to think back on now, as my big problem with this book is that it feels like an underdeveloped short story that was needlessly padded to novel-length. It is a shame, because there are seeds for a good story buried in the mess, but they don't really appear until about 2/3 of the way through the book. By that time, they have been smothered by poorly executed and repetitious exposition. By the end of the novel (admittedly the strongest part), the payoff is too little, too late, and largely predictable. The potential for a good story was there, but bad execution seems to have squandered it. I cannot recommend this book. A good horror/supernatural suspense novel should never leave a reader bored and uninvested in it's protagonist, but that's just what this book did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of this Book","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago...and yes it is confusioning @ times...I still liked it...But not as scary as I would of liked....More Occult and Astral Projection stuff...But a Mild thumbs up..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hat","review":"Pleased with delivery. Shipped flat so it took a couple of days to regain decent shape. Hat is good, sturdy quality. Worked out very well for us, thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical Excrement...","review":"...would have been a better title for this video. There is nothing funny about this man! He's not clever and tries to grossly overcompensate for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Never Sounded So Good","review":"Christmas Traveler is one of my favorite Christmas CDs and I'm a major Christmas fanatic. The Browne Sisters and George Cavanaugh sing old standards like \\"White Christmas,\\" as well as lesser known songs like \\"Christams in Killarney.\\" George Cavanaugh's version of \\"We Three Kings of Orient Are\\" is beautiful and haunting. You can almost envision the three kings on their way to the manger. For those of you who, like me,cry everytime you hear \\"I'll be home for Christmas\\" the Browne Sisters version of this timeless song will make you want to call family and friends near and far and tell them how much you love them. Whether you like the old standards or are looking for something new, this CD has it all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great for all ages","review":"I have used this violin scale method all through out my training in the violin. It is really comprehensive and easy to use. It starts from easy (one octave scales) to very hard 3 octave 16th notes scales. So that you won't need to buy countless scale books while you are learning.The only draw back I see (the reason I rated the book a 4 instead of a 5) is that I don't like the way the book is set up, the order the scales go in."},{"rating":"2","title":"learning to play","review":"I bought this item to help me learn how to play the violin. It arrived on time, if not early-It is a little more advanced than my skill set at this time. I would order from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keter Storage Unit","review":"I was very impressed with the engineering and construction of the plastic Keter Storage Unit. All parts easily clip together to give a stable, strong storage unit (no screws other than those for the door handles). The \\"metallic\\" appearance is very attractive and blends well with the stainless steel tables in my shop. I have minor issues with the shelving and the doors. The tabs on the back shelf supports have a tendency to break off. The installation of the shelves onto the side-wall hangers requires two people, one to install the shelf while the other pushes in the bowing of the side-wall. The storage unit has to be on a flat surface so that the doors close properly. This a common problem will all plastic storage units I am familiar with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb film making","review":"This is one of the finest films that you can hope to see. A magnificently crafted work, it has a bravura cast headed by Keira Knightly, James McAvoy and newcomer Saorice Ronan who is just plain incredible as the young child who sets into motion a false charge that will have a profound effect on the lives of everyone concerned. Superbly photographed, it features the greatest single tracking shot since Orson Welles' \\"Touch of Evil.\\" Thought provoking, emotionally draining and totally unforgettable. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring stupid waste of time","review":"i got suckered in at first--thought it might actually be watchable even maybe good-- the plot sickened instead of thickened and it became really annoying--dont waste yer time or believe the critics!!!!!! its junk----"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story?","review":"First of all, this is NOT an Oscar-worthy movie in any way, shape or form. I just can't believe the trash that has been coming out of Hollywood these days and the phony hype these movies receive. There is no story here - just a lot of posturing and bad acting.If you enjoy seeing Keira Knightly looking like a sullen, half starved-looking cadaver cavorting around in her slip, then this is the movie for you.One star for the cinematography, Vanessa Redgrave (always a class act) and the 12-year old version of Briony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Unromantic Romance","review":"2.5 Stars. This is a real mixed bag. It is beautifully filmed and acted, but at the same time it hops around so much in POVs and time sequences that you lose your way - and interest. What's really going on and what is purely imagined? Even though this is integral to the story itself, the final payoff -- which you may find yourself tapping your toe awaiting -- is more, \\"Are you kidding me?\\" than \\"Wow!\\" American audiences may also find these emotionally straightjacketed Brits so intolerable that you'll want to scream, \\"Jesus Christ -- just tell her you love her already and kiss her!\\" Then there's the assortment of accents, some of which are so thick and mumbled I had to turn on the closed captions in order to understand them.'The English Patient' this ain't. More like, 'Better Be Patient, 'Cause it's English'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over yet?","review":"This movie was so slow moving I had to struggle to stay awake. The movie is just one big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apocaplyse Now redone in WWII?","review":"I didn't like this movie. It was as interesting as watching paint dry. And the scene that showed them waiting on the beach of Dunkirk - drinking wine, riding on a ferris wheel as artillery rains down around them, just having a great time - What junk! I got the distinct impression that they were trying to remake Apocaplyse Now set in World War II.I gave my copy away to someone who made the mistake of telling me that they liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the book","review":"I read the book Atonement in my book club and had a hard time getting through it. I thought the movie did a very good job of telling the story and the acting was very good. I'd recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"a boring Atonement","review":"I really wanted to like this film because of the actors involved in it. James McAvoy,who was excellent in \\"The Last King of Scotland\\" & \\"Narnia\\", Keira Knightly, and Vanessa Redgrave were the lures here plus the film had received excellent reviews. However, the direction was plodding and that was a big surprise to me because I had liked Joe Wright's direction in the previous film to this, \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" also with Keira Knightley. Because of this and despite McAvoy's and Redgrave's excellent acting, I felt disengaged from the film. Also Knightley somehow lacks that \\"something\\" that made the late Audrey Hepburn magnetic and so I felt little of McAvoy's passion for her because of this. So regretfully, 2 stars which means okay but no bonnets for this very over-rated film (check out \\"The French Lieutenant's Woman\\" for comparison)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous!","review":"\\"Atonement\\" tells a heartbreaking story very well. The score is fantastic, and the sets and costumes are certainly well done, making the film a fairly accurate period piece. Beyond all of this, the cinematography of the film is excellent and would be a fine motivation for seeing this in and of itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring!!!","review":"I like Keira Knightly and James Macavoy, but they were not in very many scenes together at all. The movie was slow. There was not the romance depicted in the trailers shown. I was very disappointed to say the least. I am surprised that any five stars were given to this uninspiring movie. The only thing I can say is that the cinematography was nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keira was BORING!!","review":"While I usually really like Keira K, she totally spoiled this movie for me..we felt(the others who saw it and I) that she put in just as little effort as she could in her role and get paid for showing up.Totally no emotion!!!We felt absolutely NO chemistry between them....James Mcavoy was awesome and the plot was also, but Keira gave the worst performance I have ever seen her give."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passionless and formulaic","review":"Atonement is a passionless, formulaic movie. One can see the director set out to make something along the lines of \\"The English Patient\\" or \\"Out of Africa\\"; but sad to say, he has failed miserably. It has all the ingredients of an epic, but no soul. There is no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors, James McAvoy and Keira Knightley. The war scenes could have been lifted from any other big-budget movie, complete with violins weeping in the background and all. The acting by Saoirse Ronan, who plays the 12 year old Briony Tallis, is very convincing and, to some extent, so is James McAvoy's. But the rest of the cast (not including Vanessa Redgrave) ought to enrol for acting classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bueno","review":"They could have told this story in 20 minutes, the Dunkirk scene was way too long, the fact that his true love threw him under the bus cannot be overlooked. NBD"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"A relatively uneventful and unrewarding and pointless film with little romance, and not even any battle scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfying","review":"I expected to love this movie. Kiera Knightley, James McAvoy, and Saoirse Ronan? 7 Best Picture nominations? It must be good. But it wasn't. The acting was good, it was interesting at times and picturesque, but it just wasn't that good a story, and it certainly didn't have a happy...or satisfying ending.Unlike other reviewers, I liked Briony Tallis, at least as a young girl. Cecilia Tallis was the one I didn't care for. She was the epitome of a spoiled rich young woman.The discovery near the end of the film of the true identity of the \\"rapist\\" was a very interesting twist, but nothing else about the story was memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing!!!!","review":"I am very surprised to see so many good reviews about this movie. I was looking forward to watching this movie which such a great cast. I could not have been more dissapointed! The story line was awful and it just seemed to keep going nowhere. I actually bought this movie and promptly dumped it in the trash. It was so bad that I don't even want to pass it along!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous coincidences","review":"This movie has so many ridiculous coincidences going on (imagine everytime you do something in private, someone is peeping in on you), it's impossible to take it seriously for one minute. A horrible adaptation of an overated book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GO BETWEEN???","review":"OK, anyone remember that one - Julie Christie - Alan Bates??Originality ....originality .... everything seems to be recycled upon an unsuspecting YOUNG public today.Performances? Certainly they are great in this motion picture .... but DO stay calm and reflect upon originality?Poor Redgrave .... someone soon must get her a proper script - something befitting her superior talent.Keep on trying ....."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies I Have Ever Seen!!","review":"I saw this movie the year it won the Oscar and I was bored beyond belief. The movie goes from child erotic/peeping-tom/I am gonna watch my sister get boinked/OMG! This movie has a great cast but the story is so chaotically told and disjointed you lose focus and interest almost from the get-go."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good. Much better then the book.","review":"I bought this dvd because I was having a hard time getting through the book which was very detailed and boring. The movie was very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Atonement","review":"For those who love romance, for those who love sad movies. For those who love to laugh and cry at the same time, and for those wholove real love stories.. this is a MUST WATCH! Amazing acting performance, and great great story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and heartbreaking","review":"This is the first movie I've watched in a very long time that truly had an effect on me. It is at once beautiful and tragic. Knightley and McAvoy's performances are stunning. The score for the film is poignant and very memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow","review":"very slow and boring start, sound and accents hard to understand, not usually interested in theis time period for movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a 5 star","review":"I felt this movie stayed as true to the original novel as it could. The book was beautiful and upsetting and so too was the movie. I didn't like the \\"false\\" ending of Robbie and Cecelia on the beach because I think it gave a too optimistic and happy ending. The tragedy of the story is that they NEVER got their chance together, that Briony made their homecoming up. The story is heartwrenching but I think that is one of the reasons the book is unforgettable. Also, for some of the viewers that didn't like the slow pace of the movie, I think if you read the book you would understand that it was a part of the story. As a stand alone movie it may not be a typical love story but as a representation of McEwan's novel it did a great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, and Disappointing","review":"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But I didn't feel for any of the characters, I didn't know who they were or where they were coming from. And when you finally figure out what really happened, it's over.In the end I was just left wondering how anyone could truly like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"This movie was much a buzz about nothing. Almost every movie requires that you suspend disbelief on some level, but this movie depends on the viewer doing that with the most crucial plot point. The whole story crumbles when you accept that the fork in the road taken to bring the viewer to this story's ridiculous end could never exist. The performances are amazing, with the exception of the 18 year old version of Briony, but they can't save this absurd plot. Save yourself the money, don't buy it. In fact, save yourself the time, and don't even watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price of admission. Very disappointing.","review":"Atonement starts promisingly and then dramatically declines. I felt the acting was fine...the location and cinematography were interesting...the story was imaginative and somewhat believable...but, I am just not into artsy period pieces. The flashbacks and flash-sideways coupled with the slow pace of the movie just didn't hold my interest. I was hoping for a little more action and this movie just crept by at a snails pace.Critics give this one rave reviews and I have heard Oscar rumors...but, as far as I am concerned...It is a rainy day rental at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atonement is not atonement","review":"I was disappointed with this movie for two major reasons. First of all, the title is misleading since the 'atonement' was only a fantasy. Secondly, the directors could edit the profane language that was spoken. Bad language is totally unnecessary and it is a major distraction to individuals who wish to keep their language civil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Awful. I wanted to shut the movie off in the first 15 minutes. But, I suffered through it. I have NO IDEA why this movie was even nominated for any award. I love period pieces and, still yet, could not watch it just for the scenery. The music was completely annoying with the typing brought into it. And where is the \\"Atonement.\\" And when I kept hearing \\"come back to me\\" I thought I've heard that before with \\"Cold Mountain\\" couldn't they have been more creative knowing \\"Cold Mountain\\" used that phrase to identify to the movie ?????? It could have been so much better. Lot's and lots of unnecessary scenes and not enough scenes to see chemistry between the two loves."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Oscar worthy","review":"This is my first review because I felt compelled to disagree strongly with the majority of reviews. I agree with Doug Anderson: weak characters and weak story. If it were edited down about 20 minutes and we CARED more for the characters I could agree with the 4 stars rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad bad","review":"its a disgusting movie.. i kept waiting to find something interesting in the movie but NO it just got worse. very boring and a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too long","review":"This might have been a better movie if it were much shorter. There's a story in there somewhere, but its buried in scenes that look beautiful, but do nothing. I could barely understand the actors, especially Knightley who spoke too fast and mumbled. The exception was Vanessa Redgrave, who almost rescued the movie in the final scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was looking forward to watching this film with great expectations, I was greatly disappointed. The story line was poor and confusing, flipping back and forth to different angles on a scene. Not much time developing the characters and getting to know and understand the relationships between them. They all seemed cold and uninteresting.It was not a happy movie from start to finish and just when you thought you were going to get a semi happy ending..it is ripped away from you and you are left with a bad taste in your mouth.I thought that it was a waste of the talent of the actors. And a waste of 2 hours of my time. It was boring. I kept waiting for some excitement, anything to pick up the pace and it never came. Comparing this movie to Titanic...well hey..there is no comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!","review":"Beautifully crafted with stunning cimematography. Wonderful in high def, eventhough in hd dvd. Startling ending makes this a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film worth seeing","review":"This movie starts to my mind in a slow and confusing way. But it gets better as it goes along. And in fact its most powerful segment is the final one in which we see as an elderly woman the child- writer- sinner retell what has happened in a surprising and moving way.At the heart of the movie is a false accusation which ruins two lives and makes the romantic love - story also at its center- more poignant, wrenching and dramatic.At one point in the movie the hero struggles to be evacuated from Dunkirk and there is a vivid picture of the chaotic elements of the great historical event.I do not go to the movies much any more and I am not a great maven of them. My judgment for what it is worth is that this is a film worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the novel","review":"An epic romance, but not quite as good as the English Patient or Out of Africa. The cast is terrific, but occasionally the dialog suffers from being a bit too allusive. Abrupt cuts between scenes give the film a contemporary feel that is quite different from the nostalgia the settings and affectations the film generally tries to convey. Finally, there was too little development of the lead characters, who are simply thrown into a tragic situation (about which the viewer is compelled to sympathize), without the viewer really being given an opportunity to develop much of an affection for them. Definitely a film worth seeing. But not as good as the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartachingly beautiful film about love unfulfilled","review":"\\"Atonement\\" explores the theme of love unfulfilled. It starts of as a typical English drawing room comedy set in the relative calm of 1935 England - but storm clouds are gathering.Performances are uniformly excellent and the film, beautifully shot, has an almost dreamlike quality. There is an extraordinary extended shot that weaves along the Dunkirk foreshore. And the ending is heartachingly beautiful. This film is stunning achievement on a modest budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must have seen a different movie...","review":"I'm really surprised this movie is getting so many bad comments. Maybe it's the difference between seeing it with certain expectations and seeing it (as I did) knowing practically nothing about the plot. I found it fascinating, romantic, visually stunning, well acted, and, yes, tragic. It might be a bit long, but I wouldn't trim very much. Not everything has to be wrapped up in a neat bow in 90 minutes.I suspect some are annoyed or offended that the movie doesn't have a typical Hollywood happy ending and Briony doesn't truly atone and make amends for the lives she ruined. But that's the point, isn't it? We all have to be careful what we say and do because some things simply cannot be fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully photographed but overrated","review":"Gorgeous photography, but the story really drags. Let's face it - this is a women's movie. Huge amounts of time wasted on sisterhood themes - jealousies and snooping and deception between Cecelia and Brioni. Robbie just exudes sensitivity - he goes to war and doesn't seem to fight at all - he just sniffles and cries and longs for Cecelia. Particularly annoying is time-shifting, which seems to be in vogue today. The story jumps back and forth for no particular purpose and sometimes events are changed. Confusing affectation."},{"rating":"1","title":"No English Patient","review":"Now and again British cinema gets overestimated and this is one of those sad events. It maybe that the pairing of James McAvoy and Keira Knightley does showcase some serious talent but it is still a far cry from the Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet type publicity it got.We will be hard pressed to find such an original script that attempts romance, sexual deviance, war time shock surgery and delusions but after seeing it on the screen one can't help but feel that such concoctions end up mixing like coke and Alka-Seltzer, fizzing instead of sparkling, the acting is on par as is the lush cinematography, but direction and story leave pollution where sweetness should have been. We don't mind sad stories, but aberrations like this make storytelling pointless and blunt. Very dissatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":":-)","review":"Great movie !!!!! excellent performances by most actors and a great plot.. i would highly recommended to anyone... thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can sum it up in just a few sentences","review":"I'm in the minority here, I know that, but when I sat through Atonement I just couldn't find any \\"story\\" to get involved in.

Elder sister finds herself in love with a boy that the younger sister has a \\"crush\\" on. Younger sister tells a lie that sends the boy away to prison and distances the sisters for the remainder of their lives. Elder sister goes to nursing school and meets boy (released from prison to serve in the army). Elder sister and boy both die young, meaningless deaths before they can be together so younger sister writes a novel where the two wind up together to \\"Atone\\" for what she's done.

This is an awful movie from beginning to end. It is a shame because the actors are superb in their field. The story may have been great as a book but the movie version is disgusting.

I can't recommend this movie to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEATING","review":"This movie plays around with scenes that seem to be the product of a writer's imagination and then turn out to be actually so. That is, until the ending, when, with no warning, the viewer discovers that the ending really didn't take place. So how's that for wasting two hours? If that's the way the novel ends as well, that's a cheat as well. Quite a betrayal of the viewer in a movie with an annoyingly slow pace.

It was shallow, dark, and without any kind of a silver lining. Keira Knightley can't act, which one could gather from watching \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".

I'll never get those hours back and I'm still angry that I ended up getting this movie. Most of the scenes were just plain SLOW. Felt like an eternity to get to the really poopy ending and the ride wasn't fun along the way. Costumes were OK, but the waify stuff they put on that twiggy Kiera was just plain bad.

The whole movie I was rewinding trying make out what they were muttering. But the funniest thing is that every time the actors would stop speaking and the dramatic background music started, it would be so loud that I would turn the sound off.

How it ever was nominated for anything is a total mystery to me. It isn't even about atonement but about making up a story to disguise reality and avoid guilt(not a bad theme but that's the \\"surprise\\" ending and it's popped on the viewer right at the end like an old \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode -- it's all just a dream.)

Mercyful Fate's Kim Ruzz was much better in feeling and much less \\"glam\\" than Mikey Dee !!! Have you seen the band photos in the booklet? I thought for a while that it was POISON !!! Of course Michael Denner's playing is a pleasure to listen, always, and that's why I don't rate this album one star only."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW CAN IT BE?","review":"Since King Diamond writes lyrics abou horror and mystery histories, maybe he should write a songs called \\"HOW CAN IT BE?\\", that would deal about the amazing fact that how such talented musicians like La Rocque, Michael Denner and Mikkey Dee could work to such a singer like Diamond.King Diamond is a \\"Love him or hate him\\" kind of musician. I'm not on the hate side , but I just think is fantastic how this guy is capable of writing bery good metal stuff and them destroy them with his own vocals! It's like a father killing his own son!!!Ok, it's different, it's not commercial, the songs deal about horror stuff, but that's not enough for me. For me, Diamond is almost unbearable to hear. He's not like Dirkschneider or Brian Johnson, who have utterly weird voices, but manage to deliver them in a manner that fits the songs. Diamons does not do that. He screams, whispers, shout, talks, all of it without any talent, any fun. Blergh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Abigail is Awesome!","review":"I had never heard ANY of King Diamond's music,much less ever bought anything by him,but I've been hearing his name for 20 years.The price was right,so I thought I would take a chance.(It's 2 dollars cheaper now.)Glad I did! \\"Abigail\\" is a dark story set to great mid 80's metal with King's wild and crazy singing.Guitar fireworks throughout!Sounds great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Metal Masterpiece!","review":"\\"Abigal\\" was my introduction to King Diamond and I have been a fan ever since. This is King's second release but his first full-length concept album, told in a classic Victorian-age horror style. The descriptive lyrics and music makes you feel like you are in \\"the summer rain of 1845,\\" that opens up the story. The music is heavy and represents the story well. When this album came out, it was the perfect marriage of Modern Metal and old school ghost stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!!!!!","review":"Let me first start off by saying that a lot of the rythm work on this album isn't bad, nothing really that stands out, but nothing that seemed horrible. Other than that the rest of the album is a let down. The melody work is the biggest downfall to this album. Instead of trying to work up some good melodies to his lyrics, King Diamond just came up with radom spurts of meaningless tunes that have no structure to them at all. The lead work doesn't stand out at all, and there are way too many boring solos for my taste. The concept for this album was pretty cool, but after listening to this album one time I didn't want to listen to it again. This album has absolutely no replay value. I would only recommend this to somebody interested in giving King Diamond a try. But to those just getting started in metal, and looking for some good heavy metal bands to start with, STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept; bad result.","review":"I have to give this album credit for its concept. The lyrics are interesting, and the desired creepy and gothic atmosphere is generated effectively.Almost.I must admit that I am more of a fan of melodic death than anything King Diamond has ever done, so the guitars in this offering seem quite bland to me. The real kicker, however, are the hideous, hideous, hideous, HIDEOUS vocals. Someone must have been pumping severe doses of estrogen into poor Mr. Diamond's system when he was a child. Maybe he and Michael Jackson should make a collaboratory album...I would say that this band should dump their vocalist, but unfortunately they're fronted by said vocalist. King Diamond should stick to singing covers of \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" and attending face paint conventions, and leave metal to those who actually know what they're doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Jabra!!!","review":"This does not work as they say!!!!!Battery does not last as long as they say.They say that it works up to 30 feet away. It started droping out around 3 feet and by 6 feet it was all static.Also it is hard to hear, not loud enough.I returned it and got the Jabra Freespeak that is less and works GREAT. Good range, easy to hear and smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great vitamin!","review":"I like these vitamins- my last vitamin needed 6 a day, this only 3. Great ingrediants and quality.

I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"life force vitamins","review":"I have been researching a good multivitamin and I would say this is a pretty good vitamin for the price and the ingredients seems to be of a better quality then any synthetic I have found. I have noticed a difference in my energy level and I am sleeping better at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works = )","review":"The past couple of months, I noticed that I have less energy and would get sick more often than my normal 'sickly' rate. As they say, when you hit the 30's, your body changes and I suspected that it might also be that my son is a preteen now and required more parenting. That's how I started my search for the ultimate women's vitamins. My criteria was simple - cheap and effective. This fit the bill. It is recommended to take 3 tabs a day - but I only use 1 a day. I feel better, I have more energy. The only 'complain' I have is that my pee is really yellow. But it's a normal side effect. Plus, I get to motivate myself to drink more water just so I can get a better colored pee. TMI. My other 'complaint' is that it smells like some organic farm soil. But it's normal with multi-vitamins. I give it 5 stars because it was the 'perfect' supplement to my otherwise healthy self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains Iron...","review":"It was my mistake to order the vitamins that contain iron. There are others of this brand that say \\"No Iron\\" on the label. My body's reaction after I began taking them caused me to check the label and discover the iron. I thought I could use them up by taking 1/2 tablet once per day; but I do not like the way my body reacts; so have stopped taking them. I do not know how I would like them if they did not contain iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life force women's vitamins","review":"Extremely overrated. Way too expensive. had I known that I had to utilize 3 to 6 pills per day, I would not have purchased it at all.No difference, no change compared to other a lot less expensive vitamins I had used.Going back to old faithful for less than half the price and same results if not better.Again, over marketed and over rated. Not a customer at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars if I could!!","review":"I bought this vitamin after seeing several good reviews. I used Rainbow Light Womens Organic, and loved them but this one was spoken highly of so I thought I'd give it a try. HORRIBLE! As soon as I opened the bottle I literally gagged...they smelled just like urine...an old nasty outhouse. I took 2 and got sharp headaches off and on all day (I'm not a headache sufferer). If i could return them for a refund I would. I'll stick with what I know works from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dead fish gains the power of observation","review":"2.5 stars - I am a big Joy Electric fan so naturally I was interested in this Ronnie Martin side project. No blips and bleeps, this album is mostly acoustic with some analogue synth to spice up the tracks. The unfortunate thing is that it sounds like a bunch of Joy Electric toss offs stripped down or late 90's Starflyer 59 songs that were pulled from the trash. Ronnie's voice is better suited to Joy Electric's sound. The usually fantastic Frank Lenz adds little to the mix to help.At nine songs and 25 minutes, you kind of feel cheated if you paid full price. But the that's the Martin brothers philosophy. Too much music gets boring. If you've ever been to a Joy Electric or Starflyer 59 show, you know what I am talking about. They rarely play more than 30 minute sets.If you loved \\"Unelectric\\", this album is for you. If you are a rabid Joy Electric fan, you will probably be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to time series.","review":"I have read the entire book, and I am quite satisfied with it.

Her hair is smooth and silky with a few slightly thick braids. Her clothes are really cute! They are blue and green. The doll also comes with a fuzzy little penguin keychain, and if I remember correctly, a round sled.I would recommend this doll to Bratz fans, although there are a few other dolls I would tell about before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrowed thinking","review":"It is firmly established and widely know that plagiarism is rampant in most, if not all, of Twitchell's writing, this volume is no exception.

Troward's Dore lectures can be downloaded for free from: [...] You would be better off getting the information form the original sources, the presentation is more coherent, and not marred by any lack of integrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"tight as a drum","review":"This is my favorite post-Lowell George album by the mighty Little Feat. Forget U2 and grunge, these guys were the tightest band of the 90s. The rhythm section, Paul Barerre's guitar, and Bill Payne shine. The song writing is more consistent than the predecessor, Let it Roll and has a lot of the energy found in their incredible live show. \\"Texas Twister\\" starts out smokin'. \\"Daily Grind's\\" not bad, but then the Feat lay down three classics in a row: the title track, \\"Woman in Love,\\" and \\"Rad Gumbo.\\" Following a couple \\"in the pocket\\" quintessential Feat tunes like \\"That's Her She's Mine\\" \\"Feelin's all Gone\\" and \\"Those Feat Will Steer You Wrong Sometimes,\\" the album finishes with two eclectic and brilliant recordings \\"The Ingenue,\\" and \\"Silver Screen.\\" The title track, Ingenue, and Silver Screen represented some real growth. While the next few albums have been solid, Feat have retreated into more comfortable territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amongst Feat's Finest--a Brilliant Album","review":"This work is classic Feat with some twists. Loaded with clever, intelligent songwriting, lots of Cajun boogie, and some wildly eclectic songs such as the title track, this album, along with its succesor, \\"Shake Me Up\\", shows the variety and originality of this great band that never loses touch with its heritage. Lowell George would be proud of his incredibly talented desciples. This is a \\"must have\\" album for the Feat fan and will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Where this recording is not their best, the band explores some more interesting rhythms. Whether its the guitar driven Texas Twister, the jazzy interpretations of the title track and The Ingenue, or the heartfelt Feeling All Gone its all quite catchy. Craig Fuller comes pretty darn close to replacing Lowell's vocals on many of the tracks. A few ordinary tracks but the product is quite solid especially when compared to other music out during that year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Feats Ever.","review":"Having been a Little Feat fan for over 30 years, I find that this recording is their best total effort by far. A broad range of many styles of music. Amazing guitar work on \\"Texas Twister\\", and \\"Teenage Warrior\\" The shuffled beat of \\"Daily Grind\\" to the funky \\"Rad Gumbo\\". The music is a must for any \\"Feats\\" fan. And a different type of treat any music lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"pablum","review":"sad,sad, sad. sure, the band is tight, but these tunes have no soul, grit, humor or anything close to innovation. any one of them could be something they did better before, with the possible exception of the title track. blech!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent unit but, larger than I hoped for.","review":"I purchased the FL-360 for use with my new Panasonic LX-5. While it does a great job of illumination, it is larger than I had hoped for, ( the LX-5 is smaller than the flash unit). I will continue to use the FL-360 because of it's flexibility, bounce, rotation, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery life is terrible","review":"The flash works, but only if you only want to take a few shots. I used the best possible batteries in this flash and only got 5 or 6 continuous shots before having to replace the batteries. Not good if you are shooting a wedding or something else where it is important to catch all the action without having to stop and replace the batteries. I returned mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahoy!","review":"Good book to use at the beginning of a treasure hunt. There is so much to look at and talk about in the illustrations.

I guess nobody knows how to smell out a deal and some fun better than cheap, adventurous college students!I love the Let's Go guides, and the Australia one does a great job of covering everything from Ayer's Rock to Sydney Nightlife to Reef scubadiving. -Rucker Alex"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mid-1980's technology and no playability... avoid this ripoff.","review":"Of all the toys my children have ever enjoyed, this one ranks at the very bottom. The box is marked as manufactured in 2007 but the pictures should have given it away to anyone that's been around Commodore 64's and Apple II computers since the 80's. Game play is similar to a mid-school computer science project. The sound is based on low-tech frequency generation and, frankly, the \\"songs\\" are not even recognizable. The scoring is more or less dicepherable but badly designed. To top it off, singing is not part of the game; kids can try to sing along the noise this toy makes but they'll only hear themselves through the amplified head set and mike.Save yourself the grief. This one was created to garner cash during the Christmas period and dissapoint your child. It's hard to believe major toy stores carry these and even worse that American Idol ever granted its license."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice evolution.","review":"I must say, other than the brilliant writing, that it is exciting to be able to watch, at my own leisure, the evolution of the Simpsons' characters. The loose, corny animation of the first season gave way to much more clean-- though, what's up with those mouths???-- and crafted animation just by the next season. Matt Groening reached into the brain of the public and pulled this out. Perfectly packaged with a nice assortment of goodie extras. I am so happy i added this to my dvd library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kings of Comedy","review":"What can I say?...

Arguably this is when the Simpsons hit their stride. The first season was good, but the art and the voices still haven't come together. By the 2nd season, the Simpsons found their look and sound. This season had some of the best episodes ever, such as Homer's brush with death by sushi, Dustin Hoffman as Lisa's teacher, the first appearance of the comic book guy... This set is a must buy for all lovers of great television, live or animated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dvd ever!","review":"Ok just to start this im going to say that i have the first season and the drawing were abit different and homers voice is just insane! But in the second season homer gets his voice back and the simpsons just start to get funny! With 434 minutes of episodes (7 hours 14 minutes) you will never get bored of it And the 434 minutes isnt even including the extra features! Like commentary on ever single episode! Too finish this im just going to say If there was a 1000 star option i would have put that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must own for all Simpsons fans","review":"Probably the greatest thing I like about this is that you get see a lot of scenes that are editted out on TV because of either time constraints or because of the network needing to have moe commercials. I completly forgot about scenes like in \\"Dead Putting Society\\" where while Homer's reading Ned's note, Marge leaves the room to hide her laughter, or in \\"Three Men and a Comic book\\" where at the convention, Martin goes to the lost and found in search for his lost vulcan ear. The episodes seem more complete with these scenes in. This set is definately worth your money, and watch for season 3 to be released in April 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Simpsons\\" Classics Definitely Worth Viewing!","review":"This DVD is full of classic episodes.

Let me tell you something from a (nearly!) middle-aged female point of view: you're probably laughing just because you hear everyone else laughing. It's not unlike being at a comedy club (which I'm no stranger to, having had some experience as a professional comedianne): at the club, the laughter is contagious, but if you see the same thing on TV, you don't even crack a smile.I think Julie Kavner has the most annoying voice this side of Fran \\"the Nanny\\" Drescher.

It's too bad they don't make 'em like they used to. I love the fact that in the beginning theme song they show Bart writing on the chalkboard. He's always writing different bad but funny \\"lines\\". Also near the end of the theme song, they also show different scenes. Like Homer almost running over Marge, etc. It's also amazing that the two guys does all the characters voices. They are very talented I must say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Classic","review":"As for what is now and forever be classic television, the Simpsons are on the top. The first season was a bit choppy and underdeveloped and with this season it is easy to see that things are starting to come together and that the writers and animators are working the bugs out.The high point of season two, the real reason to make sure that you own it is that this seasons begins the annual tradition that is the \\"Treehouse of Horror\\" specials that have always been amazingly done. This particular episode gives us the amazing creation of the Simpsons doing \\"The Raven\\" as read by the great James Earl Jones. It is worth the price if just for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signifigantly better than the first.","review":"Unlike season 1, this time everything was redone.

Having the whole season of shows available full length (the shows in syndication are shortened somewhat) in DVD format was enough to sell me on this set. The video is crisp and vibrant. The audio is fine as these are the pre-stereo shows. The audio commentary ranges from okay to hilarious and includes much insight into the creation of the show. Finally, adding in the little details, from the packaging and the extras to the animated bits in the menus, makes this DVD set a 5-star recommendation for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can be said?","review":"These are great!

Season 10 and 11 disappointed me so much that I stopped watching them but the first 5 seasons are classics with many unforgettable episodes. 4th and 5th season are the best for their comedy and they used to be my favorite but the first 2 seasons became my favorite eventually. There's a certain edge to the early episodes that the show gradually lost with age. The stories have more serious parts throughout but I still got a good amount of laughs, particularly Bart making crank calls to Moe's Tavern. I'll always look back and remember the show in it's early days with a rough, grainy sketching. This was the real Simpsons and the show was at it's peak here. Two Cars In Every Garage, Three Eyes On Every Fish is my favorite episodes but all are great. This is also the first to include a Tree-House Of Horror Episode for every Halloween."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Episodes - DVD flaws","review":"The episodes fetured on this DVD are great. But every time you put the dvd in the machine you have to play a stupid game. After you get out of the game you see 5 or so episodes on the screen. My main issue was the fact that there was NO PLAY ALL OPTION. Maybe I am spoiled but I really like playing all episodes straight. Overall the episodes fetured are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantabulous","review":"I highly recommend this piece of pop-culture to anyone who wants to laugh, be sarcastic, and generally understand what was going on in the early 90's in the United States. Never before has a cartoon impacted a society like the Simpson's. This DVD sets up well and is easy to navigate. Pick your favorite episode from the second season and sit back and enjoy. This DVD will not let you stop laughing. The episode \\"Dancing Homer\\" is a classic, along with \\"Bart gets an F.\\" This DVD takes you back to the second season, where Homer's voice is made-over to be the Homerific voice you know and love. This season also was really edgy especially with some of the role-players like Lenny. I am hooked on this series, and will buy the Third Season as soon as it comes out. You won't go wrong with this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counter attack boredom","review":"I absolutely love this season, I bought season 1-4 because in my opinion those are the only ones worth having.

Every episode is a winner, but for me the standouts are \\"Lisa's Substitute\\" (Dustin Hoffman's voices a substitute teacher that replaces Homer in Lisa's affections), \\"Three Men and a Comic Book\\" (Bart, Millhouse, and Martin buy an issue of Radioactive Man #1, then cannot trust each other alone with it in a hilarious nod to the classic \\"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\"), \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\\" (any episode with Itchy & Scratchy is great, but here Marge forces them to become kinder, gentler characters), and \\"Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish\\" (Mr. Burns may be the funniest character on the show)."},{"rating":"2","title":"best season of the best show ever","review":"Arguably the Simpsons at its creative peak - season 2 had the ability to be hilarious, satirically razor sharp and powerfully moving, all in the space of an episode. These are the classic episodes, light years away from the cheap empty gagfests of recent Simpsons seasons. Recommended to anyone who appreciates clever comedy television.The music videos, documentaries, etc are good, and the commentaries by the staff are very entertaining and interesting, but may be dull to the more casual viewer.NOTE - Bart The Daredevil is NOT edited, it appears on the DVD as it appeared on its original airing. The animation of Homer falling down the cliff for a second time after the ambulance crash was specially made for a season 4 clip show, it was NEVER in the original episode. Bart The Daredevil just shows the kids looking down the gorge as we hear Homer fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vast Improvement","review":"22 episodes, Homer with his normal voice, and a higher quality of cartooning, all make Season 2 a great buy.

Nowhere is this more evident than the second season. The writing, animations and voices are all sharper than the first season and the concentration is more on the family as a whole than Bart's antics. If you are a Simpsons fan these box sets are essential, the creators give an unusual amount of insight and fun in their commentaries that are almost always absent from most DVD audio commentaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"censored and edited","review":"Too bad. I have watched the first 2 dvds so far and have spotted two episodes that have been altered (censored) from the form they were originally aired in. Bart The Daredevil had a scene from the end completely cut (where Homer falls down the gorge while strapped to a gurney). Itchy & Scratchy & Marge sinks to even lower depths - for one thing the original reporter on \\"Smartline\\" (who resembles a popular on-air personality) was replaced with very poorly rendered Kent Brockman - and Krusty and Marge's scenes on \\"Smartline\\" were altered. To add insult to this, there is no indication on the package that such alterations were made.

The dress had a retro feel to it, very Audrey Hepburn. I did not want to get matching shoes - that would have too much of a bridesmaid feel to it. I didn't want to spend too much money on the shoes as well. When I found this pair of shoes, it was just perfect! The heel isn't too wobbly like a stiletto and it's sooooooo comfortable. I wore them to a wedding with my lavender dress, and for once, my feet didn't ache after a few hours. I thought they were going to be slipping off and on my feet, but because there is a strap that secures the big toe, it didn't slip off at all! The best part? I thought that I wouldn't be able to wear these shoes with any other dress, but since there are different colored crystals (lavender/pink, blue, green), I've worn these shoes with different colored dress from multi-color blue to a rosy pink. I am definitely getting my money's worth.

Both can be solved (one with an elastic cord glued to the camera and one with practice) but they detract from an otherwise excellent product.

I did not break it on the first day but I was certain that it would break at very short point in the future and that I would be stuck with a high end, expensive camera that would have to repaired (4-6 week wait usually).

The camera is very slow with a poor quality LCD screen. The user interface is not intuitive and can be quite confusing. Button placement is questionable, with the capture video button directly next to the shutter button. Too easily the shot or video can be missed. Image quality is a joke. The images produce far too much noise and color representation looks to 'cartoonlike' and unnatural. This camera produce images that may be able to compete with a sub-par VGA camera.

I watched this movie for free when it debuted on the SciFi channel and forced myself to suffer through it. I had to believe that they would have some real payoff for making another movie, but I was wrong. The story is beyond horrible. You'll find yourself questioning every plot point and director's choice while wondering if a room of drunken monkeys could have made a better movie. Read the Wikipedia entry for the movie to see the troubled history of bringing it to market and satisfy your curiosity of the plot. All the performances were mailed in and the director must have been on peyote during the whole shoot. I was wondering if anyone in the production company had ever seen or remembered any of the good Highlander product that was produced. Stay far away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Highlander movie EVER","review":"Like someone else said, I wish I could give it 0 stars. I saw this for free, and while I didn't have to pay for it, I wish I had that 90 minutes of my life back. Honestly, the only good thing in this movie was that Peter Wingfield still sort of remembered how to pull off the Methos character. Even Jim Byrnes, as Joe, turned out bad. The plot was awful, and the ending didn't make any sense. And, okay, I admit it, I liked the \\"renegade\\" version of Highlander II, but there is no way anybody could ever, ever re-cut this movie to make it bearable. If you really need a Highlander fix, spare yourself and just go watch Season 4 again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End Of A Great Saga","review":"I will tell you right now this marks the end of the highlander movie series, This movie first came out via the internet as a torrent file as the russian cut leaked. Everyone saw this movie it was supposed to be originally released in theaters but the reviews were so bad that the producers were not going to take the risk of releasing it theaterically. So a couple months later the dutch cut of this movie premiered on the sci fi channel on september 15th. It was basically identical to the russian cut with very little editing. THe thing that hurt this film the most is its story line, Editing, quality, Dialogue, This film is missing so much. It makes the previous highlander movie Endgame look like a master piece. With that said i wouldnt recommend buying this unless your a die hard highlander fan like myself. If you are a new fan of the Highlander series i recommend only the first and third movie. Or the first and fourth movie and tv series/Good Luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Film Of The Franchise!","review":"Let me start off by saying that I am a big fan of the Highlander series. I liked the original film (especially in its Uncut form) and the last move called Endgame (in its extended form). I LOVED the TV show (that's what really drew me to the Highlander world)!That being said, it really hurts me to give this film one star but I have to because that's all it deserves! I saw this on Sci-Fi and it nearly put me to sleep. When I went back and looked at it later, I could find nothing redeeming about it! I have underwear that's made of better material than this movie!Let me put it another way. Highlander 2, the original cut with the planet Zeist, was better than this! That's how much The Source sucked! At least H2 had better action, a better villian and had the great Sean Connery as Ramirez to off-set an otherwise terrible film! In the words of David Chappelle, it sucked a**! Unless you must have everything Highlander, avoid this hot mess at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've ever seen","review":"This is a review based on the version broadcast on the SciFi channel.I was so excited to see a new Highlander movie, though in reality I didn't expect much. Unfortunately, its every bit as bad and even far worse than Highlander 2. The story line is dreadful and (like the other movies) changes previous events. But in all, I think the main problem I have with the movie is the fight scenes. I mean, why did the creators all of a sudden decide to make everyone fight in super speed with ridiculous sound effects? This movie is absolutely horrid in pretty much every way possible.If only someone would make a Highlander movie worthy of the original (or better for that matter). Unfortunately, if it ever happens, I doubt it will be anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst Highlander film","review":"That's right - worse even than the disastrous Highlander II.

It was ... we have to invent new adjectives to describe how awful this movie is; worse than 'ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES'.Most fans of the Highlander and ADrian Paul were appalled at how much of the legend got 'trashed' for this dreck. And, the worst part, ((Spoiler ALert)THEY KILL OFF JOE!! Badly(Hey, all 'mortal'characters 'die', only 'immortals' have a shot at 'forever'; that is the premise of Highlander.

The plot and details make so little sense. The supporting actress is not attractive enough to be in this type of film. The location is cheap and ugly. The characters are not sympathetic, not even MacLeod. Terrible camera work and horribly lame and shallow ending that manages to ruin the whole Highlander concept at the same time.But if it means another Highlander paycheck for Adrian Paul, then so be it.

Please end the Highlander Legacy on a good note."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD AWEFULL","review":"I read all of the other reviews prior to watching this movie so i was not in an actual hurry to see it. In fact the only reason I watched it was because i was given a copy and explained how Mockable it truly was. So I watched it. The movie starts and ends as a total failure. The plot is terrible, the story lacking, the characters comical. One of the immortals looks like the love child of Mathew modine and Jessica simpson (not kidding). The special effects were shotty and looked like they were edited by a 3rd grader. The protagonist's acting , make up, and complete appearance is sickening. No wonder Bill Panzer died before this movie was aired. The worse part of it all is if you watch the behind the scene on the DVD the writers and produceres sound proud of themselves and say its just the begining of the new Highlander folklore twist. TERRIBLE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly executed sequel...","review":"After Highlander: Endgame I was expecting a film on the level of that movie, but what was released left me dumbfounded. The only thing I liked about this movie was the visual style, and the concept of 'The Source'.Now I'm not an expert on the Highlander movies, but every Highlander movie I've seen had flashbacks to the Highlands of Scottland where Connor and Duncan lived hundreds of years ago. I always thought that helped ground the movies and give reason to call it 'Highlander' in the first place.The use of colors and the way scenes were framed made the whole movie feel alot like it was a living comic book, and the concept of The Source is basically that the history of the immortals had gotten lost in myth and the original intent for \\"There can be only one\\" wasn't to be the last immortal standing, but to be the only immortal to pass the test by the Source. But even withsuch a seemingly good concept and visual style the producers used poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing!","review":"Echhhhhhhhh. What a shameful thing to happen to a fabulous old series. I guess all the random camera speeds were supposed to be a cool effect, but they were just dumb.

Don't judge this movie before you watch it for yourself and make up your own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst movie ever","review":"If you are a fan of the TV series DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Besides having basically no plot, bad acting, bad fencing/fighting, bad cinematography, it destroys your favorite characters - figuratively and literally.

It will take a while to get this horrid taste out of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever. Really.","review":"I think this actually qualifies as the worst movie ever. It's certainly the worst I've ever seen, and I used to watch B-lot horror films (at least they don't have pretensions of being good). Seriously, the plot makes no sense, the acting is horrible, and the sets are ridiculous. It doesn't even pay to go into detail about how terrible this film is as doing so would require a comment on every singly line of dialog, every absurd costume, every nonsensical, contradictory setting (cannibals in huts with guns and motorcycles?), and every absurd violation of physics (planets coming into alignment makes them huge in the night sky). The only reason this gets even one star is that Amazon doesn't allow zero. Just recalling the movie enough to write this is making me stupider. I want my 85 minutes back."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF guys. WTF","review":"This is not only the worst installment of the entire Highlander franchise, but quite possibly the worst movie ever made. The acting is horrible, the sword fights are lame and impossible to follow, the soundtrack is awful, the direction is bad, the ending sucks, and it has officially hurt my respect for the series as a whole.

However, after how thoughtful and imaginative the series was, there are no words for just how bad this movie is.

I don't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Methos","review":"After hearing this was a straight-to-Scifi Channel movie I had my doubts. The only reason I continued watching after the first five minutes was because I knew Methos was in this movie and I would walk through fire, or sit through this movie, for that ROG! This could have gone in such a better direction if only the ridiculous special effects hadn't been thought of nor the idea to go futuristic b/c that worked so well for Highlander movies in the past... I really don't have any words to describe the epic failure this movie left with me and I blame Methos for making me watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astoundingly terrible","review":"There really isn't too much to add to the other reviews; this movie is dreadful. The special effects are worse than anything I've seen since the 70s. The audio/sound-fx are horrific. The acting is uninspired. There is no story and what they've attempted doesn't fit in with any part of the Highlander-universe.The best part of of the series was, of course, the swordfights. Rather than choreograph a fight here, they've elected to take a picture of the characters and jiggle it at high speed around the set. Like seriously, I could make a better fight scene with my great-grandmother and a tortoise.Do not under any circumstances consider buying this horrific piece of nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this","review":"I only gave this movie one star because you have to. It deserves no stars. I am a big fan of Highlander. I was drawn in by the tv show and I had been waiting to see this movie for awhile. I found out it was on tv the day after it aired. I had thought it was coming to theater. This was so bad. I had to force myself to watch this and I did not feel like I was watching Highlander. Princes of the Universe was a remake, there were no flashbacks and the Guardian was just plain bad. We learned that the girl from Highlander The End died and Duncan is depressed because he is tired of loosing everyone he loves. There is not one thing I could find about this movie to redem the movie which is really sad considering how much of a Highlander fan I am. If there had been flashbacks it might have been bearable and felt like I was watching a Highlander movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a fan, but this movie was a let down","review":"I hated the atmospehere as it opened. Reminded me of a bad attempt to used some of the stuff from a Terminator movie, or even Mad Max. There was no originality. I stuck through it and it just got worse. I enjoyed seeing Jim Byrnes as Joe, and of course Adrian Paul as Duncan and Methos...but after I waited years to see a sequel - the writing was bad for this movie. Endgame was a great movie, and so this one is dissapointing. I do like the end though. I wish they could have told us more about his wife - how they met, their life, their marriage, their troubles...seemed like it lacked character development. It's hard to vision Duncan separated from a 'wife'. I do hope they make another movie showing Duncan having a son, and make it more like the series Highlander and the movie Endgame. Then I'd go to the theatre and see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Horrible","review":"This is the most poorly edited \\"film\\" that I have ever seen in my life.

I own every season of the series, movies 1-4 and quite a bit of merchandise. However, I must concur that Highlander the Source was absolutely horrible. I sat through it only because I was in such slack jawed shock at the absolute substandard garbage that was on the screen, I was unable to reach the remote. I commend the actors for their professionalism in not walking off the set, but I honestly wish they had.In Summary:If you missed Highlander the Source it was probably because it never made it to the big screen, it was for very good reasons.If you watched Highlander the Source keep telling yourself that this horrible Highlander blasphemy NEVER happened! Eventually you can forget it, but then you see an ad like this one and the pain returns. This never happened. This never happened.

I am a big fan of the character of Methos, but in this movie I barely recognized the character I'd loved so much.

The direction and cinematography however...The movie has the look and feel of a poorly shot mid to late 80's music video.I have loved the Highlander franchise for years. This film is the worst of the worst of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey look, a new version of Highlander 2!","review":"This movie reminds me so much of Highlander 2 it is not even funny. I have always said that I like Adrian Paul as the Highlander better than Christopher Lambert. Christopher Lambert's movies are a complete hit or miss (you either love them or you hate them). Adrian Paul's TV show was the pinnacle of the Highlander franchise in my opinion. Then, Adrian Paul made this, his very own version of Highlander 2. The movie is about as good as rock is able to float. It is not as good as the TV show (neither the story or the FX's), or any of the other movies (except maybe Highlander 2). Most of the back story is missing and the \\"Source\\", well I don't spoil movies, but you will be left thinking, \\"What? Is that it?\\" I am not going to say don't buy this, but you better have seen the first 4 movies and the TV show, or this really isn't going to make any sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop with Endgame","review":"As you may have heard, this movie is beyond bad.I will mention the bad acting of the original characters that will ruin any good opinion you ever had of them.

You shouldn't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highlander II returns!","review":"For those who loved Highlander II, this movie is for you. This is supported by the fact that they even advertise Highlander II's newly enhanced DVD in the opening previews!For the rest of us Highlander fans who loved the original movie and the t.v. series, this one is at best a rental. Aside from the cast (Joe, Duncan, and Mythos), it lacks any resemblance to the t.v. series.This film takes place in the near future in which all government and law has broken down (aka Road Warrior). A few immortals remain and go on a quest to track down \\"the source\\". So scrap \\"there can be only one\\", forget about historical flash-backs involving Duncan or Mythos that develop their characters, and instead insert an immortal \\"mutant\\", loads of bad acting and generic scenes and *poof* welcome to Highlander V.This film is a great disappointment to this Highlander fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The SciFi Network Should Be Ashamed!","review":"This is an original production of the Sci-fi Channel and it's bad. Production values are incredibly cheap. The only good thing is that Adrian Paul and some of the other actors from the excellent TV series reprise their roles. Fans of the series, be forewarned. The idiot writers had the nerve to kill off Joe Dawson (Jim Byrnes)in this poor effort. They relegated Methos (Peter Wingfield) to a cameo appearance that is, thankfully, dignified and compelling. Effects wise, the main battle with the villain (wearing ridiculous make-up) is a Keystone Cops fast motion fight. Trust me, I have seen every episode of the Highlander TV series and ALL the films. There can be only one and this isn't it. And, yes, the other reviewers are telling you the truth: Jabba the Hutt makes a cameo appearance. This film is such a sad addition to the Highlander canon. If you are a Highlander fan you will be embarrassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is as bad as it gets","review":"Watching this movie you would think the producers are going out of their way to kill the franchise. None of the things that made the original Highlander movie or the TV series so good are here. They turn the entire mythology previously established on it's ear. I think this movie was filmed for theatrical release but then they could not get a distributer so went to TV instead. After watching it you can see why only Sci Fi channel would show this garbage. It fits right in with all of the bad B movies they make. Do your self a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brillant!!!!","review":"Something new, Something different.

Not quite","review":"How anyone who has read Faulkner can compare this book to his works is beyond comprehension to me. This book was average at best--certainly nothing approaching a classic. The protagonist is a cold-blooded murderer--yet this fact doesn't seem to bother anyone--least of all the author. The worst part of this novel was the amateurish gimmick of having Therese's mother tell her whole life story to her daughter over hot chocolate one night. Much easier than trying to weave those facts into an actual plot I guess. This book was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB","review":"this was one of those that i seen on the shelf in the bookstore that buy me and read.

It is hard to understand how such a weak story, poorly written, populated by so many one-dimensional characters, could find its way into print. Biguenet is a pretentious writer, with little to say, who offers up caricatures better found in made-for-TV movies. His dialogue is embarrassing; his attempts at \\"regional flavor\\" an affront; his plot utterly devoid of originality. There is a ton of Deep South fiction to savor -- Welty, Percy, Faulkner -- before turning to the likes of Oyster.

I also encourage you to look into Upper Cervical Specific Care as a possibility in refining your health status. Many folks, through traumatic events (accidents, slips, falls), have caused damage to one of the most vital structures that is very little understood in the public eye--the brain stem. An injury to this area can lead to such conditions as diabetes, decreased thyroid function, and more.[...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for...","review":"I suppose it's a good book in it's own right, but I bought it with the hopes of finding some good low carb dessert recipes. Instead what I found are recipes that are low sugar, not the same thing at all. In addition to cutting the sugar out, she seems to concentrate on cutting a lot of the fat out of the recipes, which tends to add carbs in some form.If you're on Atkins, this is not the book for you. There are a few recipes that are lower carb, but nothing that I couldn't get from straight Splenda=Sugar substitutions, and often not even with as good of results. Custard and cheesecake are 2 that pop to mind that are simple enough to do straight substitution without sacrificing flavor or texture. I didn't need to pay for this book to get those recipes.All in all, rather a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable because the recipes are that awful","review":"So far not one recipe has turned out tasting good. I have spent way too much money on the ingredients...only to end up tossing the whole mess. Really awful tasting desserts I'm sorry to say.How about using Splenda in an Atkins sort of way? Using REAL butter, eggs, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Splendid Book","review":"This little book is far more useful than many cookbooks I have whose bulk consists mostly of color photos and big type. The desserts are in the American tradition of home cooking, and simple to make. The author has worked to make classic desserts not only low in sugar, but low in fat and calories. (I have no use for the low-sugar but high-fat recipes I've seen elsewhere; fat is bad for you.) The author has tested the recipes thoroughly. Not only do the desserts taste good; the cooking times, procedures, etc. are correct.What I'd like is for the author to write another cookbook focusing on low-calorie versions of the fancy European style desserts I used to make (before I went on a diet and my husband found out his cholesterol is high). I'm sure it would be wonderful.By the way, Splenda really does taste exactly like sugar, and cooks like it except for having less bulk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous cookbook!","review":"I bought this cookbook when my husband and I were still dating because he is diabetic. This book changed his life and gave him back his sweets. I have made most everything in there and love this book so much I may have to buy a new copy as it is falling apart. The author of the book really understands how to cook sugar free and I have not had any recipe troubles. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable how bad a dessert can be!","review":"I tried several of these desserts -- all horrible. I truly think the author never prepared any of these or has lost all sense of taste. I love Splenda and use it in all kinds of desserts, but don't try these recipes unless you want to waste good ingredients."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book","review":"I enjoyed reading this book so much. I hope this is just the first of many Mark Gimenez's Books. Once I started reading it, I could not put it down.Keep up the excellent writing!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN","review":"I am in the process of reading all of Mark Gimenez's books. Hopefully he will have more new books coming. I live in Texasand am familiar with lots of the places he talks about."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a word -- PHENOMENAL!","review":"Humorous. Delightful.

Well done Gimenez - we are ready for your next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This man is RACIST!!!!","review":"I was going to drop this book after the first chapter but i decided to continue just to understand fully the mind of this myopic, ethnocentric human being and the only thing i could suffice out of this book was that this man is racist.He made lawyers look like they were above the law and can treat women like trophies.Stay away from this book and spend your money on something rather more interesting,engaging and brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUSTED AND FURIOUS","review":"THIS WRITER, MR. GIMINEZ, IS A RACIST. IN HIS MIND, NOT AN AFRICAN AMERICAN ALIVE CAN PUT A SENTENCE TOGETHER. IN HIS EYES, THEY ARE ALL POOR, UNEDUCATED, AND AMORAL. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS RACIST WAS ALLOWED TO PASS THIS \\"BOOK OF HATE\\" OFF AS \\"FICTION\\". SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.BY THE WAY MR. GIMINEZ - THERE ARE PLENTY OF POOR, UNEDUCATED, AMORAL WHITE PEOPLE OUT THERE - WHY DON'T YOU WRITE ABOUT THEM SOMETIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time and Money","review":"This book is not, repeat not, the legal thriller it purports to be. Instead it's nothing more than a book on race relations. Mark Gimenez is obsessed with race. Just in case you missed the fact that a rich, privileged white lawyer is defending a poor black hooker, he repeats it every two pages.It seems everything Gimenez knows about Dallas, he learned from watching the TV show \\"Dallas.\\" I was shocked to learn that he is actually from the Dallas/Fort Worth area. I've lived in Dallas/Fort Worth for over ten years, and I can't believe we lived in the same area.This book doesn't have characters, it has caricatures. Characters appear, say their clichéd lines to move the plot along, then disappear until they're needed again.Don't be fooled by the fake reviews that proclaim Gimenez as the next Grisham or this book a literary classic. If you paid more than a $1 for this book (like me), you paid too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Unique Style","review":"I am liking this author more and more with each book of his that I read.

I think the ending could have been better. This could be a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, buy something else.","review":"I thought this book was boring, wordy, and tired. You can tell that his heart was probably not in writing this book. Did he just do it for the money? I don't know. Either way, you would be far better off spending your 14 bucks on a classic like Catcher in the Rye. Hell, buy Jessica Conseco's book. Just steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"So, after reading and really enjoying \\"The Perk\\" I was so disappointed with this book. I have two concerns. First, and this is just personal, I don't care for the lengthy explanations of history/politics etc that the author delves into. I prefer the story line to proceed at a reasonably brisk pace. Clearly some people like this...I don't. My main complaint is how the characters are stereotyped, and how the story line is just so uninspired that when piled together with pages of \\"information\\" it really slows the story down. We also get to read, repetitively (ad nauseum), about Scott's red Ferrari, his fancy house, how succesful his career is. The author let's us \\"listen in\\" to Scott's thinking and it just goes round and round (and where it stops nobody knows) with the same thoughts. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This end being quite the page turner as the lead character struggles with his own morals vs. those that want him to maintain the status quo. Great read that allows you see the protagonist develop into the true expression of what he believes he should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"the color of law","review":"This is the best novel of its type that I have read in years. The Color of Law is a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. I look forward to reading a lot more from the pen of Mark Gimenez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite Morality Play","review":"Billed as a legal thriller, I unfortunately found this book pathetically predictable and flat. Characters are one dimensional, the dialogue is stilted and cliches and stereotypes abound. The plot line of a greedy big time attorney finding redemption in a criminal courtroom just never clicked. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I ordered this book based on the recommendation of a friend and am happy I did! It's fast-paced and the first book I've read in a long time that keeps me up past my bedtime--I have a hard time putting it down to go to sleep. I've also learned a lot about Dallas. I can't wait to read the other books by Mark Gimenez!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. It reminded me of John Grisham's novels. Excellent. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining!!!","review":"It's not a deep and philosophical commentary on life, lawyers or race ralations and I don't think that it was intended to be. It is simply a fast-paced and very entertaining fiction novel. Color of Law would be a great book for your next flight, cruise,etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced, alive","review":"This book was great! The characters seemed so real that several days after I finished the book I was still thinking of them as real people. A review called the book a mix of To Kill A Mockingbird and Law and Order. Because To Kill A Mockingbird was mentioned throughout I kept expecting sad things to happen, but they did not-thank goodness. This author is up to John Grisham caliber. I am anxious for another book by him. I hope he can keep up the suspense/tension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mekhaye!","review":"A particularly delicious story! My reading group and I enjoyed every moment! What a joy to have such a wonderful new author to look for in the bookstores. Congratulations on a splendid book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Entertaining Read.","review":"Color of Law is an entertaining story. I read it cover-to-cover on a cross-country flight. The storyline has a quick pace and while, at times, predictable never becomes boring. I recommend the book enthusiastically if you enjoy legal thrillers.In rection to some other reviews:Gimenez will not win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction as Harper Lee did for \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" in 1962. Also, the author is not as polished a social critic as Tom Wolfe whose first book was published in 1965 -- more than 40 years ago. If those are the measuring sticks used for comparison, then Gimenez is doing well.Also, reviewers should have the good judgment to review the book without re-telling the plot, the twists, and the conclusion.Finally, I see that reviewers throw out charges of racism against blacks and whites. Well, there are heros and villians, educated and uneducated, good and bad in all skin colors. The racism accusations here are misplaced.Go enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I had the pleasure to read \\"Wicca Demystified\\".Being a Wiccan myself, I have read many books about Wicca and I looked at this one as another of the many inconsequential ones, but this is a truly exceptional book.There is much to know about Wicca that common people does not understand or, does not want to understand. Perhaps this book will reach the people who, out of fear, bigotry, or whatever, attack Wicca and will let them see what truly Wicca is about.By going from the very basic beliefs, Mr. Lankford reviews the different aspects of what we believe; our spiritual experiences; how we see the Divine, male and female; how we see those that disagree with us and the \\"live and let live\\" philosophy. He also talks about our celebrations, the Wicca Rede\\" and the \\"Three Fold Law\\".My wish would be that everyone would read this magnificent book. Everyone would learn something but especially they would see that there is nothing to be afraid of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book to come out of the Broom Closet with","review":"I have recently come out of the broom closet with my family. This is the book I chose to use to explain my spiritual practice to them. They had been reading some very bad things and were very upset. The format of the book with questions and answers was just the thing to settle their fears. I highly recommend this book. Bryan Lankford explains very clearly some of the most pressing questions non-wiccans have concerning our beliefs. It is also very good for a beginning wiccan to learn more about the faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Early Attempt at Explaining Wicca","review":"Admittedly the goals of this book are fine, but it misses the mark by having way too many details about Wicca to serve the purpose of explaining this way of life to family and friends. The book WHEN SOMEONE YOU KNOW IS WICCAN does a much better job. Nevertheless this book is interesting and worth reading, but does not serve its intended audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for people who want to be informed!!","review":"Bryan Lankford has put a gentle and humerous hand upon an incredibly sensitive subject - Religion. He stayed true to his word when he said that this book is not intended to convert, but to inform the reader of the basic tenets concerning Wicca. Unlike Buckland, Bryan answers the questions that many family members, friends and co-workers often pose to a practitioner in ways that are humorous, non-confrontational and in layperson's terms. It is as if he is sitting in a chair having a conversation with you!Since most people fear what they do not understand, I truly believe that if people of all different paths or faiths would read this introductory glimpse into Wicca, discrimination that is based on fear which is fed by misunderstanding and/or ignorance will be a distant, gray memory - rewritten and replayed with the brilliant, vibrant colors of tolerance and respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good...like really not good.","review":"First a foremost, I bought this on a whim. I had no idea what this anime was about, didn't check out any other reviews, just wanted a surprise. Boy did I get one...Story: Was alright the first, um, 2 episodes, then it just never picked up and went south...fast. You won't care for the characters at all...AT ALL. There are just way too many characters, none of them are developed, just totally shallow and pointless. One positive note was the occasional funny bickering of the lead guy and two of the lead girls...but that's it.Animation: Not good. Just not good. There are a few fight scenes, and even then the animation is lackluster.Overall: Just not good!Save your money and buy something else. This was a waste of time, patience, and money.

Any 007 fan would love a compilation of the greatest Bond hits. However, there is one all-important factor missing from this CD: The original artists! Dont expect to hear Cheryl Crow belting out \\"Tommorrow Never Dies,\\" because it's not her. Hoping to hear Tina Turner sing \\"Goldeneye\\"? Look elsewhere. In all fairness, some of the renditions are better than others; \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" comes across fairly well, as does \\"Goldeneye\\"; However, \\"Live and Let Die\\" follows its own advice and \\"The Living Daylights\\" is just plain sad. (Who would have thought A-Ha would be such a hard band to cover?) Can somebody tell me why the chorus for \\"The Living Daylights\\" is in the background and panned to the right? If you're looking for a cheap version of 007's greatest hits, you've found a winner.

Liz stepped into the more alternative rock styles this time around. WhipSmart should be listened to more. It was said to be a failure, but to me this album could be as good as Exile.Liz manages to make memorable songs that would just want to play over and over again, Super Nova for example. The album is haunted with many types of songs, such as the slow and sad (Nashville, Shane) to the fun pop (Jealousy). WhipSmart is an album Liz should be proud to have made and you should be proud to own. The album never seems to get old, but you should be careful because it is harder to find in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sophomore efforts ever!","review":"How does that saying go -- an artist's first record is about their whole life, and the follow-up album is about the next six months? Given that \\"Exile in Guyville\\" changed my life forever, I was fully prepared to be disappointed in the second album by Liz Phair. However, \\"Whip-Smart\\" came through with another stunning lineup of songs whose lyrics sounded like she'd raided my brain (such as \\"Jealousy\\").The melodies are a little more catchy in a \\"pop\\" way than on \\"Exile\\", but are just as addictive. There are more radio-friendly songs on \\"Whip-Smart\\" than on her debut effort. However, these do not overshadow or outshine those songs on the album that are less \\"single\\" in nature. Rather, they are equal contributors to an incredibly satisfying whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"A Classic album intelligently written.

(cool album jacket too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked.","review":"When I was in high school (when it was released) I didn't get into this album so much, but now it is most definitely a sing-along favorite of mine. Some of the slower, quirkier songs (Crater Lake, Dogs of LA, Alice Springs, etc) didn't appeal to me at the time, but giving it a couple years, (almost a decade!) those are some of my favorites now. \\"Crater Lake\\" is the perfect \\"sick of small midwestern liberal arts schools\\" song. \\"Supernova\\" is a great pop song--priceless geologic reference there."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album.","review":"It took me a while, but this album has really won me over.

Then I read the comments and discovered that they had replaced the atmospheric opening titles to the first 14 episodes with the idiotic Love & Curses theme.You may think I'm being silly to refuse to buy a series based solely on the opening titles being changed, but I'm sick and tired of studios screwing up DVD releases. Buying them just tells the studios that consumers don't care what they do to a show, they'll still buy it. Well, not me.I want the episodes in their original form, uncut and unaltered.

The actors work very well together...the chemistry between Kate Hodge and Neil Dikson develops rather quickly..on the first disc.Only one minor tiny flaw with this set...i think the opening music sucks..\\"70s style\\" so i just mute the opening music .

The content is very comprehensive and focuses on different body systems and how normal aging of these systems effects the person with SCI, and how SCI may modify the aging process. While this book was published a number of years ago, it contains most of the research to date, and is based on collaborative data from major SCI centers in both the USA and England. While heavily focused on the medical model, it can be a valuable resource for both professionals working with people with SCI as well as those with SCI and their families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says","review":"I now own three of these machines.

His room is probably 150 square feet, so not very big. We have a humidity gauge in his room. When we turned the humidifier on that night, it said 24%. The next day, it said 24%.

The same in the front row at a Chris Rea show, very bad form.However, I always go back to 'Jackie Wilson said' and 'the Lion tonight' (another cd) which fall amongst a myriad of wonderful songs Van recorded and they like so many other Van tunes continue to consolidate feelings that he has evoked for me through the years. 'Caravan' in the Bands Last Waltz was a mesmerising performance. More than anything I liken his music to the ocean and my love for the sea and the sound of the sea. Seek this one out if you dont have it, enjoy every track and savour our luck in discovering such an amazing artist in our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A young person going to America discovers San Francisco","review":"Van Morrison's \\"St.Domnic's Preview\\" is an excellent example of Van's poetic abilities. This is an album for all who have emigrated to America. It recalls both the adventure and the emotional loss of friends and loved ones. In the end song, 'Independence day',Van captures almost the very sounds and images of San Francisco, but more than this, througout this album, he captures regret, love, innocence, happiness and what else, but Fog!\\"ST.DOMNIC'S PREVIEW\\" is an album that can be listened to over and over again. Each time I listen to it, it reminds me of that journey, the rolling journey of life. St.Domnic may have had the preview but Van Morrison had the know-how and experience to write about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The seventies personfied- and thats a good thing","review":"'St Dominics Preview' is a wonderful collection of seven diverse songs. Within that framework though, Van Morrison creates some of the most majestic, moving and astonishing pop music I have ever heard. The twin masterpieces of \\"Listen to the Lion\\" and \\"Almost Independence Day\\" are so daring in length and fully realised in their musical execution that listening to them simply transports you to another place and another time. The reason I love Van Morrison's music is the rewards you receive every time you listen to his amazing and diverse music and this cd is no exception. Give it time to grow on you and you will be richly rewarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lion Has Little To Say","review":"Trust me, you are not going to listen to \\"Listen to the Lion\\" and \\"Almost Indepencence Day\\" more than once. Van sings these songs and then tries to stretch them out with improvisation and \\"scat\\" singing. Believe me, Van is no scat singer. He grunts and groans as if he is turning into the lion he sings about. It is pointless and irritating. When someone becomes as respected as Van; his fans start cutting him breaks when he makes bad decisions. I think it should be just the opposite. We should hold him to a higher standard. Most of the music on the CD is either uninspired or self-indulgent. When Van sticks to songs, he's great. When he tries too self-consciously to make \\"art\\", he fails miserably. Download \\"Jackie Wilson Said\\" and skip the rest. This is Van at his worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"anything that these boys do is BEST","review":"I am a fan of David Seville and the Chipmunks now for 35 of my 38 years and the Chipmunks are on the top of my musical listening lists .

At the price listed, it is a outstanding bargain. Eclectic mix of song styles, the CD is worth buying if only for the last track, the supremely styled Pacifica.

Every track on this CD is a winner. Great back-up artists, heart-felt lyrics that have some intellect and sensitivity, and a very talented singer/songwriter to pull it all together. I play this CD like I played my old James Taylor, Tom Rush, Dan Fogelberg, and Jackson Brown albums.....into the ground. It's hard to find anyone that writes and performs music like this anymore. Buy-it, borrow-it or steal-it, but I just can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?","review":"This is one of the most sincere records I've herd come from an artists in a long time. From the heart is where any musician worth there salts will tell you songs come from. Jim Lord's album is clearly his soul beared for others to enjoy. And I believe that many shall. Not only are the songs exelent (track five is my personal fav...)but the crystal clarity of the recording itself is a testament to the labor of love that is \\"Hangdog Heaven\\".

If you got it....GOOD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe better as individual stories than as a whole","review":"The overall premise is fairly interesting: an alternate version of the world, all resulting from the assassination of Queen Elizabeth I. The book is a collection of short stories set in this world, showing how society functions within the scientific boundaries imposed by the Catholic Church. The individual stories are fairly well-written, especially the first. The big problem for me was my having settled into the premise of the book, and then getting to the end and realizing that things aren't what they seem. While I normally like surprise endings, the particular twist of this one was just too much to accept. I think readers would have a better time with the book A Canticle for Leibowitz, by Walter Miller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I was very eager to read this novel after reading numerous wonderful reviews about it in magazines and online, so when I finally bought it I was quite disappointed. Although a very dense and intricate novel, it was ultimately very boring. Even individually, the \\"measures\\" barely stood up alone as short stories, and together made a poor body of work. The \\"twist\\" in the Coda makes one wonder whether the preceding stories were a waste of time. Yes, worldbuilding is fun in science fiction, but it does not necessarily make a good novel. I am not surprised that this novel has not achieved a higher status or circulation. It doesn't even have a cult fiction quality to it. Go read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE KING...of not only POP....but MUSIC","review":"Michael Jackson has always amazed and stunned us in more ways than one. His amazing vocal talent that no one compares to, his unbeatable dance moves that no one but himself can do, his some what hectic life style, and just his pure innocence and love for life has made the whole world crazy about him since the day he was born. No one has ever compared to Michael, no does compare to Michael, and I know for a fact that no one ever WILL compare to The KING, MICHEAL JACKSON. This book, like his first autobiography,MOONWALK, will leave you in tears. Before I read MOONWALK, I was not a fan of MJJ. After I finshed the book, I could feel i had changed. This book is no different. Michael means the world to me, and I know so many others who feel the same way too.

The book is truly a beautiful collection of poetry and deeply personal essays by a man who was quite simply the greatest artist of our age. Nevertheless, the money-grubbing exhibited since his death, including by some members of the poor man's own family, has been beyond disgusting. I just bought this book (new, unread copy) from Abebooks for $21.00 plus shipping. Doubleday is re-releasing it in the U.K. for slightly more than that (you can order it from there).

The style of the top of the shoes is flattering, however, there is nothing to help keep the shoes on my feet. There is no flexability to the heel at all, so when my foot bends...the heel stays down and I walked right out of the shoes. I don't care for ankle straps, but I think this shoe needs something. I usually LOVE the comfort of Nine West shoes, so I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!","review":"Looks can be deceiving! This shoe is so cute and stylish, but it hurts my foot like crazy. I used shoe stretch, asked my daughter to walk in them, hoping for some kind of relief.

While I did not find the actual voyage into the alien that exciting, it was definitely suspenseful. What was more interesting to me was the story that was happening outside the alien among the politicians, diplomats, and the poor doctors. This was page-turning stuff! I think that the problem with the voyage inside the body was that it plays better on the big screen where one can visualize the suspense among the myriad of special effects. The narrative does just not do it justice. Great characters, a mysterious alien, and a good tale make this a four star book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really stupid ideas","review":"I am willing to believe impossible things before breakfast, but not really stupid things.All of the physical science premises of the book are ridiculous.

I do not care much for the bedroom fantasies of the author. Actually, who should really care whether Nelson and Jeanette were in love or not? I personally hate myself and my curiosity for reading it.

This book seems to belong in the FICTION part of the library, as Ms. Rich has done the unforgiveable thing: waiting until practically everyone involved is dead and then writing a trashy \\"supposed\\" biography. The only good thing I can say about the book is that it has some very nice photographs.

It was published in 1923. The setting is 1912 England. I really like the old use of wording in these books . The plot brings to mind mystery writer of an earlier period such as Sherlock Holms. We begin with a quaint little village in England and the employees in a small bank.It starts out a little boring but quickly turns into a complicated affair when the bank manager turns up missing. Scotland Yard is called in and things quickly become very complicated. I enjoyed the plot development and the way the author kept us in suspense until the very end. It becomes a page turner mystery.

(3) Recreation: Parks, outdoor sports, points of interest.DeLorme's atlases have two shortcomings: (1) Road naming is too creative. Many of the printed names bear no relation to actual road signs. (2) There's no indication of whether a road is paved, gravel, dirt or sand--every road is shown by a thin, red line.

It had the best reviews by far and with a 43% savings, I decided not to pass it by. I am so glad with my decision. It is the best method I have found for removing all those unwanted hair. There is minimal pain (it IS pulling out multiple hairs at once after all) that can be quickly gotten used to. Less pain than waxing. No mess like with shaving. The first time I used it was a little time consuming but I think that's because it is picking out every single hair, even those that might be too short to cut with a razor. But after that, the time will get shorter. I got it a week ago and my legs are still smooth. Hair removal has always been a pet peeve of mine. I have finally found a product that I can use without having to use it everyday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Great lady's shaver, the best I ever had.

Be warned, friends. . .be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb enough to try this again","review":"Well, I was dumb enough to try this epilator again. Lo and behold, after a few months, the crazy thing stopped working ... already. My friend purchased a Emjoi facial product six months ago which sounds like it is on its last leg as well. We definitely won't make the Emjoi mistake again, and we won't be lured into Emjoi again with discount coupon deals. There is a reason that manufacturers offer seemingly nice discount coupons, and the Emjoi reason is that their products just don't last. As other people have posted, Emjoi products die early deaths. It certainly is disappointing to waste so much money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emjoi AP99 Optima Epilator","review":"I have been using epilators for many years and I find this product to be very easy to use and fast with the new double heads. The only thing that would be an improvement would be a travel bag instead of the nice box in comes in. I also prefer the epilators with a cord because that last one I had the battery didn't last very long. If you haven't tried a epilator in many years you need to try it again. They are not that painful as before. I received my product in a timely manor. I only wish Amazon would take paypal. KRK"},{"rating":"1","title":"High Expectations","review":"I bought this epilator about 3 months ago and here are my thoughts on it.Pros- saves money on razors- good on large areas- entertaining if you're boredCons- no matter how many times you use it, the pain does not go away (you have to be drunk to use it on your bilini and use tranquilizers to use on your armpits)- ingrown hair can be a problem (especially in the bikini area)- hair doesn't grow back that much slower than shaving (after two day you have to shave anyway to be smooth)- the epilator doesn't pick up fine hair - if it does, it just rips it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I had an Emjoi Optima for about 5 years. It finally died on me so I bought another one exactly the same. Why change a good thing? It does exactly what it it supposed to do.

I love my Emjoi!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Last Long...","review":"I've being using Emjoi for the past 7 years and they work great at the beginning but for some reason they start loosing speed until they die completely. This is probably the reason why they only give a one year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought my Emjoi epilator two years ago, and I hardly use it. I was really thrilled about getting one at the time, but I didn't find it practical enough for me to use it on a regular basis. Other reviewers have commented on it's poor ergonomics, and they are right. I can never grip it comfortably. I do not have problems with the tweezing being too painful, but I do have to go over the same area multiple times for it to pluck all of the hairs. Sometimes I just find it easier to use my handy no frills tweezer. This isn't a product that I'd recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"works okay but not worth the money","review":"I found that the optima generally broke off the hair on my legs more often than it removed it from the root. This results in a need to either shave or use the epilator again within a short period of time. I also found that it wouldn't even pick up some hairs despite my going over the area repeatedly. Overall I had hoped that this would replace shaving which it hasn't so it was generally just a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCONSISTENT, WILL NOT BUY AGAIN","review":"While I found the device to be somewhat effective in removing hair (I did eventually grow accustomed to the sensation and it did indeed become much less painful than the first experience), I found that the rotating tweezers would break down and stop spinning after just a few months. I foolishly thought I would give it another try, so I bought another one and the same problem occurred. I might add that I noticed that the best results would occur when the product was new, and that it actually seemed to gradually spin more and more slowly over the course of use, until it actually just stopped working just a few months later. Perhaps my experience is unique, but I will certainly not buy the Optima again."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good product","review":"It works well at removing the hair. If you have a tendency to have ingrown hairs then you'll have them. If not then you'll love this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good product.","review":"i had an other emjoi epilator, but this one is more effective it hurts the first 2 to 3 uses but you get use to it.beauty does not come sheapi do recommende it to the ladies who hate the mess of waxing(the waxing is great too but a little bit messy)"},{"rating":"2","title":"best hair yanker-outer ever","review":"It hurts like the dickens, but what do you expect? It says it right in the description that it pulls the hair directly from the root. If you have thick hair, or long hair, it might be a good idea to trim it down a bit before you begin. I've always had woolly mammoth arm hair, so that hurt way worse than doing my legs. I let my leg hair grow out a week before I tried it and it worked great. Not a super smooth feel, but I figure that each hair is growing at a different stage, so it will probably take a couple of times before I get that \\"silky\\" feeling. It's been several weeks and I feel like I have the \\"day after\\" feel on my legs, but my arms are still silky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Ergonomics","review":"I've used a few other \\"epilators\\" and I liked this one least for several reasons. I found the tweezing plates revolving in 2 directions, as opposed to one, rather uncomfortable. Also, the plastic pieces at ends (bordering the tweezers) were sharp and often scratched my skin. The biggest reason that I don't care for this product is it's size and shape. It's small and thick and difficult to hold comfortably, often grazing my fingers during use. While this wasn't painful it was certainly annoying. Of the products commonly found on the market, I prefer the emjoi \\"Gold Caress.\\" It's easier to hold and use, and it's less expensive. (The Gold Caress, however, doesn't include a shaving head.)With this model you also have the choice of AC or rechargeable. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Emjoi Gold Caress instead","review":"When my Emjoi Gently Gold Caress broke (after years of use - I whole-heartedly give it five stars), I bought this, thinking more expensive means better. This was unfortunately a bad assumption and I really wish I'd just bought another Gold Caress.The Optima doesn't fit well in my hand and the cord often comes out while I'm using it on my legs since my hand is brushing up against the spot where the cord is attached to the epilator (if you're going to make a non-cordless epilator, make the cord permanently attached!!!). Also, because it's a bit uncomfortable to hold, I am not always able to hold the skin of my underarm taut and the skin gets pinched (one time it drew blood).In the end, I do still use it and it is better than the Braun I bought in between the two, but I wish I had the Gold Caress instead. It fit well in my hand and because it is cordless I could use it without an outlet nearby."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"I can say I own just about EVERY hair removal product out, and this is my all time FAV! I find the size and shape refreshing. It fits right in the palm of your hand to be held in a cupping manner rather than a traditional razor and most other electric removers. It is quick with amazing results. Though like any tweezing method it can be a lil bothersome at first. With regular use that lessons. After only using it twice for the underarms I find it painless and literally just as fast as shaving with a razor if not faster and no messy shaving cream/gel. To top it off, the hair grew back baby-soft. Since I have dark hair after shaving with razors the hair below the skin shows through the top layers of skin making a dark appearance, whlie this item leaves my pits looking clean!!! I love that it comes with changeable heads so you can clean up any hairs that you decided were too sensitive to be removed by the foil shaver head. I recommend this product highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Optima Epilator","review":"Excellent product. I would recommend it to anyone. I received it in a quick and efficient manner with no problems what so ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emjoi Optima is VERY VERY painful!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I am a 24 year old male in great shape(just so you all know im no wimp). When I used the trimmer on my Arms the pain was so bad I about passed out(not joking). This may work out better for womens legs because their legs are used to being shaved so the skin is much tougher. It will irritate your skin(similar to when you get waxed: red bumps). It for the most part removes the hair at the root. I myself am going to stick to waxing/Nair. It is much less painful and MUCH Much faster. I would recommend taking some pain pills prior to trying this it will make it much more pleasant. If you do decide to buy one then make sure that you are able to return it for a refund in case it hurts you as badly as it did me. Hope this helps you all out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emjoi AP99 Opitma Epilator - Torture Treatment","review":"This product may be exactly what it is supposed to be, however I used it for aproximately 2 minutes and could not stand it any longer. Despite the fact that I followed the directions given for maximum efficiency and for least amount of pain, it was extremely painful. The amount of hair that was removed was almost unnoticable and I was bleeding to the point that it was on the epilator. If more hair had been removed I might have suffered through but it was clear it would have taken at least an hour or more to complete the process. I was unwillingly to endure the pain for that long. My hair was not extremely long and so this could not have been the problem.Again, the product may be a good one, maybe it is supposed to hurt this much. My pain tolerance is fairly good. I have had several surgeries and managed high pain levels with minimal pain meds. I cannot imagine anyone enduring the epilator process though. Waxing never sounded so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAIN","review":"First time user, just can't stand the pain!

Great product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emjoi AP99 Optima Epilator","review":"Love, love, love this product. MUCH better than waxing. I used it on both legs and a substantial area in the bikini zone. Yes, it hurts, but not so bad that you need to stop. Also, be sure not to have the hair be too long - the length that is right for waxing is a bit too long for this IMO. Once the longest hairs are removed/thinned, the pain subsides. And, really its not what I would call \\"pain.\\" I did this Thursday night and on Monday afternoon (today) its still great! If I'd gotten waxed, I would already have regrowth.

The book takes you on a journey out to sea where Morowizt ponders some of life's deeper questions. He also gives a detailed description of various constructs of the earth such as the hydrosphere, biosphere, lithosphere, etc. and how they all interact with one another.

When I watch him paint a scene in less than 30 minutes, I was amazed. Wet on wet was a new method I never heard of. I tried it after watching his instructions and purchasing thicker oil paint, the method worked like he instructed. I was hoping one day his shows would be available to watch at home when I wanted to.

It's a modern day love story, it has mecca-driven sci-fi style, it's a story of war and of friendship, of loss and of pain... It's a little bit of everything for everybody. It's a story destined not to let you down.I say all this with a small warning for parents.

Every project begins with simple steps, but the results are polished and beautiful.Thirty projects, lots of great basic info about colors, color mixing, making shapes, combining shapes, changing expressions, etc.Everything is illustrated in imaginative ways - even the basic color wheel is a whimsical thing.The elves are adorable and the dragon beautiful - a huge range of critters and creatures in between - all appear to be quite do-able.I think this would be a great book even for an adult who wants to try sculpting/modelling - you'll get some great inspiration from this! Plus, the \\"story-process\\" in the second half of the book is terrific and all the pictures are just gorgeous! :)Elizabeth"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational pc book for kids","review":"Definitely a book to own for kids pc artist.

The directions for each character are vague and leave most of the steps in getting the design up to the sculptor.The pictures and story are cute, but I think some of the other artists write better directions for replicating their designs. Other artists include amount of clay needed, how to add character and details to the clay so the final result is more professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wowee-ed and Zowee-ed","review":"Somehow I missed the greatness of this CD when I gave it a first quick listen years ago. While Slanted & Enchanted, Crooked Rain, and Brighten the Corners always found their way into my CD player, I somehow let this one languish on the shelf virtually unlistened to. What a mistake! As a Pavement fan, it ranks only a hair below S & E, which is no small feat considering the strength of the non-stop singles worthy songs on S&E if the radio actually played Pavement songs other than Range Life and Cut Your Hair, that is (not that those aren't great tunes, I just wish they'd mix it up a bit). If you like Pavement but don't have this one, you're in for a treat. If you hate Pavement, well you're probably not reading this, so I'll leave you out of it.

I liked the fact that Pavement kept the rich sound of \\"CRCR\\" but shifted gears a little to make the songs a bit more challenging. \\"Grave Architecture\\" resembles the Smiths' \\"I Don't Owe You Anything\\" somewhat. \\"We Dance\\" and \\"Rattled By The Rush\\" are really STRONG openers, two of the best Pavement has written. But the song I keep going back to is \\"Grounded\\". It has great lyrics and a melody which while may not be \\"Top 40\\" catchy, still sticks in your head. I took off one star for some weak spots. Did we really need to hear the annoying \\"Brink Job\\"?

To bad Pavement did not do much of these type of songs the only other one i heard is Range Life from crooked rain. The one thing this cd has over there last 2 ,which are good, is that is more loose and experimental. If you are a fan of Pavement then buy this cd you would not be dispointed. It is only like 6.00 used on amazon so why not pick it up.

Novan, and have read most of their published work. They certainly do not disappoint with 'First Lady.' A fantastic follow-up novel to their collaborative work 'Madam President,' 'First Lady' ties up all the loose ends while still keeping the reader fully engaged.Presidential biographer and fiancee, Lauren Strayer, plans her wedding day with help from the President's mother and social secretary. President Devlyn Marlowe and her bride-to-be deal with family issues (i.e., Lauren's father) and new relationship woes. They learn to trust each other more fully and redefine their life goals together. They also deal with outside forces such as Dev's children and the press.This is a well-rounded story with a lot of depth and dimensionality. The characters are likable and the writing is elegant.

Touch and Feel Colors has large pictures of easily identifiable items in vibrant colors that catch our daughter's attention. While she looks at the pictures, my husband and I can point and repeat different words so that she can start to make the associations.She does not quite understand the \\"touch and feel\\" aspect of the book, but I think that will help to keep the experience fresh and engaging as she gets older. Older children would also benefit from the critical thinking opportunities for each color.

I haven't bother to check its video recording capabilities because I suppose it won't be to my expectation. What bothers me the most is that the PC-cam center software that it brings has two sample pictures that have very good resolution.

The problems embedded in stereotyping still exist. The road to productive black pride is hard and contentious and is not found in pandering to sit-n-watch entertainment escapism. The producers, directors, actors & writers of film and televised programs that make money off of scripts of this type are no different than the black-faced vaudevillians of the late early 1900s."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!","review":"This play was very disappointing to me. As a black woman, I am offended at the perception of black women at this point in his plays. I have bought his plays in the past to support him in hopes of better character development of the women. If what was displayed in this play is how he views women and the type of interaction he incurs, that is a sad circle. I have met plenty of women from various scopes of life and have never encountered a woman acting so desperate for a man. The more I watch of his plays, the more I feel he has put black women in the \\"stereotypical\\" role this society has already placed on us. This play is as predictable as the previous plays.

D'Atra Hicks (Jackie from the Family Reunion play) was in this. She was so strong and reserved and classy in Family Reunion, but I could barely watch her here. She looked terrible and she was loud and obnoxious. And maybe this was how Tyler wanted her charachter portrayed, but it only lends to my belief that black women were portrayed in a negative light.I stopped the DVD at about 15 minutes at first, and then I restarted it and just fast-forwarded through the moments D'atra Hicks was on stage.All-in-all I just hated this play."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know ppl on this site here lying..","review":"I have an seen enough Tyler Perry's plays, and I know he definitely did not produce this one.

I saw those pics beforehand so I wasn't surprised when I got my shoes, but still a little disappointed. Other than that... the fit is good, the size is standard (unlike some manufacturers), the sole is thin but surprisingly comfortable. I don't know if this shoe will actually last a year before falling apart, but whatever. Worth my $20 bucks.UPDATE: I've been walking in them every day for a year and a half, and they're in great condition. Still surprisingly comfortable, too.

And, the views in the book are just plain stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Report Card by: D4","review":"Are you looking for a great suspenseful novel? If you are, end your hunt by getting The Report Card by Andrew Clements. It's about a girl named Nora who is a genius. She doesn't care about test grades and gets Cs and Ds on purpose. Soon her secret is out. The teachers are confused about her grades while the students are leading a \\"rebellion\\" by getting zeros on tests to show they also don't care about test grades. Soon the superintendent and principal get involved and it gets bad. Read this book to find out if or why Nora pulls her grades up. I love a good suspenseful novel like this. You never know what will happen next. Will Nora pull her grades if so why? You should get this book if you are 10-12 years old and love suspense and realistic fiction. Well, what are you waiting for, get The Report Card"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS SO BAD!!!","review":"This book is so horrible it doesn't even deserve 1 star. It's about a kid named Nora who is really smart, but she hides it because she wants to have friends because being popular is the most important thing in the world, not going to a good college or getting a good job.Sometimes I think this book was written in a dumber age. I get good grades and so do many of my friends. I can't think of someone I know well who gets grades as bad as Nora when she pretends to get bad grades. You should just be yourself and not pretend something just to be popular. BEING POPULAR IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clements Writes Another Winner","review":"Fifth Grader Nora Rowley is a genius. However, she decided in kindergarten that she wished to be best friends with Stephen, a middle of the road kid, and that meant being a normal kid. Now she is in 5th Grade and dislikes what seems like many peoples obsessions over grades, and especially the way tests make Stephen feel, and so she hatches a plan to make people think twice about what they mean. This enjoyable novel carries not only Clements typical theme of the power of what kids can achieve but also a thoughtful discussion of grades and standardized testing. The ending sees Nora's opinions evolve and will leave readers with some things to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear! Pretty Disappointing!","review":"I know I will sound like an echo of the previous reviews, but I must chime in, in complete agreement. While I find the author's position on testing absolutely on target, it disturbs me that Nora ends up deciding that she will continue to hide her abilities in order to have and keep friends.I am *hoping* Mr. Clements wants us to be disturbed in this manner, that he actually is putting this sad finale in place to make teachers, librarians, and especially *parents* consider that this is what our testing community has done to children like Nora.Please, Andrew Clements! Let us know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not impressed","review":"I read this book alongside my son and wasn't impressed. Its started off very slow and I found myself quite annoyed with Nora early on. She just wasn't believable and I found it hard to connect with her because everything about her was deceitful for mostly superficial reasons. I think she could have served her \\"best friend\\" alot better by actually helping him as best she could instead of on the sly here and there. Her parents were one dimentional, no insight or plausable parenting qualities. Some of the points of view were worth discussing but the execution was poor. My son (10) thought it was ok. He said it wasn't \\"too bad\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Read!","review":"Mr. Clements hones in on some important educational issues--particularly the emphasis on test scores as measures of potential college aptitude. I know a lot of teachers who have become disenchanted with the teaching profession because of all the emphasis on standardized testing these days.Fifth-grade genius Nora is quite charismatic and her cohort Stephen is equally charming in his own way. Nora takes issue with the importance of grades and test scores in determining students' assessments of themselves and others and she is especially concerned about her friend Stephen who does not do well on standardized tests and has consequently decided that he is not very smart. I found this a delightful read and I would think it could lead to some great classroom discussions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The report card","review":"I love this book I have read it 10 times already it is grate 5 stars bravo bravo bravo bravo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book","review":"This book was really good. the end was amazing and really exciting.

The Report Card is good and funny. I would give this book four stars. A problem that happens in this book is that Nora gets bad grades on her report card.

(As an elementary school teacher myself, I abhor standardized mandated testing that attempts to assess each student regardless of their individual differences. The kids in my classes forfeit weeks of learning every year as I attend to the testing my district requires. YUCK!)The Report Card is an engaging book that will capture a lot of readers' imaginations...as long as they like the main character, Nora. Nora isn't like some of the other protagonists in Clements' books because she isn't thrust into a difficult situation with which she then has to deal; instead she makes her own life difficult by doing some very unintelligent things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauren's Review","review":"I've absolutely loved reading The Report Card, mainly because it's about school. I like school and I think it's wonderful that Andrew Clements writes about problems that take place there. Then, when people read about the problems in the book, they learn from them; as does the character. This is what I learned while reading The Report Card: Even though I'm still in elementary school and my grades don't count towards college or my future career, my actions do. For instance, if I get into a bad habit like not turning in my work on time it will be very hard to get rid of. While the reader is enjoying this book they are learning so many things.

McNamara","review":"\\"The Report Card\\" by Andrew Clements is about a girl who is a genius but hides it so she doesn't make others feel bad, especially her friend Stephen. I didn't like the book at all. I think Nora (the genius) should not hide her intelligence. She should be proud of being smart and not care about jealous others. I think that a report card is a fine way to show how a student is doing, because what else can you use. If a person is less intelligent, they should not be surprised if they get an \\"F\\" or a \\"D\\". If a person is intelligent, they should be glad when they get an \\"A\\". I think that this book COULD have a negative effect some children and even convince them to hide their intelligence to save jealousy. I don't think jealousy is worth hiding your intelligence. I don't reccommend this book. It's not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Report Card","review":"Have you ever meet someone that tried to hide there smartness?

We got in contact with the vendor - they were willing to fix the unit, but only if we paid the shipping both ways ($8 each way) which they told us we could \\"conveniently\\" charge to our credit card.

As it stands now, there is no way to remove the top of the well to clean it and as such, it was recommended by the seller to pour vinegar into it to maintain its freshness.

There is still a small amount of spin-off, but I attribute this to the Goodyear Fortera tires on my Jeep. These tires have grooves on the sidewall, which holds more gel than you really need for the tire.I recommend this product, but give it time to dry before you drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This book is a great read that took me back 40 years to the first time I read it.

The definition of a stolid Kapellmeister who leads every piece in the same lockstep of cautious conventionality, Wand does the same here. I've never heard a duller Brahms Serenade #1 -- Wand drains it entirely of sparkle and youthful energy. The Weber clarinet concerto is a winning piece, and it comes off resonably well, although the soloist is no great shakes.

I find that his plots and ideas are inventive. Even this story was inventive in many ways, like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters. However, I found this book as a whole to be very boring. Much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters.

I especially liked the assortment of paintings from Goya's Black Period; they bring a macabre element that is hard to describe.It concludes with a few chapters analyzing the modern comeback in the form of Neopaganism. I found it quite interesting to learn that Wiccans were one of the first communities to take advantage of the internet as a tool to organize and reach isolated practitioners across the globe.Overall, it is a very scholarly work with plenty of notes and comprehensive bibliography.

I, unfortunately live in Brent's hometown and his cd and message and band is just as superficial as he is. If the cover of the cd wasn't egocentrical enough, his show flyers would make any rastafarian weep. There are always great rays of light shooting from behind his head as if he is the chosen enlightened one. Truth be told, this guy wouldn't recieve such harsh reviews from reggae fans if he wasn't so arrogant. Possibly because reviewers would feel so sorry for him if he were modest because the music is AWFUL. Modesty is the first lesson of reggae.

The film doesn't display any real heart or creativity to make it stand out and I doubt this one will garner any repeat viewings. It felt like a second rate Saturday morning cartoon rather than a movie in terms of the animation and overall production quality. The story is an odd mix of wacky pratfall antics, serious subject matter like animal cruelty, and left-field songs about things like the internet (seriously, no kidding). This film just pales in comparison to releases from Pixar or most of Disney's other major movie projects, and isn't even on par with other more creative TV programs for kids like Charlie & Lola or Little Einsteins. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney's animal rights message?","review":"I was enjoying this movie until I noticed that part of the plot involves villains stealing animals to be sold to an animal research lab (that Toaster and his friends rescue). This not only perpetuates the myth that scientists walk the streets trying to steal your pet for experimentation, but conveys the message that animal experimentation is wrong. If you are are an animal rights supporter, then this movie is for you and your kid. Instead, if you support the responsible and humane use of animals in medical research avoid this movie at all cost.I can't believe Disney's writers didn't notice the underlying message in this movie. I can only conclude this represents their opinion on the subject.

I thought the movie was action-packed, fun, and interesting to watch. It contained all what you need to feel good.Jim Street (Colin Farrell) was a part of S.W.A.T. team but got degraded to the gun cage. He was still proud to be part fo the force. His friend, on the other hand, went away forever and became a gangster. With effort and courage, Jim Street becomes part of a S.W.A.T team that is commanded by Sergeant Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson). They practice their skills, and it is tested when they are taking a prisoner hostage.

Well, if you want the answer to that question, this laborious \\"action\\" thriller is for you. As with most contemporary films, check your brain at the door; in fact, the only thing you'll really need it for is ticking off all of the other movies you'd rather be watching. Of course, you could also spend the time cataloging the many films this one seems to raid for ideas . . . \\"Heat,\\" \\"Bad Boys,\\" \\"Licence to Kill,\\" \\"The Right Stuff,\\" \\"Executive Decision,\\"--not to the mention the 70s TV series upon which it is based.

Has anyone else noticed that he can't say no to a movie, even if it is a mindless action movie with little to offer in terms of plot. SWAT is just an excuse to blow things up and shoot everybody.This movie is more predictable than 80's horror movies, but despite these major problems, Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell manage to do a good job as members of SWAT. I only hope Samuel L. Jackson begins to realize that the mindless action movies he is in are awful.

Oh yeah, I have, but I don't even remember what happened in it\\", because I totally zoned out. This is not good. There was quite a bit of character development, but this went nowhere, because in the end nothing was really concluded properly. (Probably a sequel is on its way). I have never seen the 70s television show, but would definitely not watch it after seeing this movie. Talk about boring.

The film is chock full of plot holes and gaps, it's filled with characters you know extremely little about and to be honest, the action is that intense. There's nothing here we haven't sen a million times before, and there's really no unbelievable directing flare to speak of either.There are some talented actors in this one, but it feels like they're just riding the wave through it.

No really. You have. Maybe in different movies, but you have seen it. Every cheesy stereotype that typically is part of the Hollywood film experience is here and you will groan in recognition.

I like action movies, but this one didn't have enough going for it to make it worth watching again, let alone earning. Some good actors here, but ultimately, the random pacing and poor plot build up just killed it. And for action, these are unforgivable misses. The pacing was slowed down by attempts at character building that had nothing at all to do with the plot, and when the betrayal happened I couldn't help but feel that it came out of nowhere.

I thought the action scenes were wonderful, and that is what the two stars are for; but the acting just didn't impress me that much. The villain wasn't evil enough and was very weak, and we have already seen the \\"partner that turns bad act.\\" I took all the good police movies and turned it into something cheesy and mediocre.

The training sequences are spot-on if you like that kind of thing (which I do) and the good old fashioned mayhem is top-notch. There are a few good jokes that kept me laughing. I mean, come on, \\"Lakers purple\\"? That's good. And the teeny tiny hint of military humor was great fun for the Navy girl in me. (Even though Colin Farrell is waaaay to young to have retired from the SEALs.) You kind of have to be in the mood for action, humor that's clever in the way that's kind of not, and a non-existent love interest, but if you are, S.W.A.T is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"SWAT - Sorry Waste of Actors' Time","review":"There was no story here - it seems like they went through and took bits and pieces of the 70's show to come up with this film. It was a waste of some pretty good actors' time - it was just plain dumb. The writer(s) and filmmakers figured they had a prefab hit so no creativity went into its making. It's your basic - outsider is brought in to build a team of rebels who, in the end, beat the bad guys and impress the authority figure they were rebelling against.

However, the panasonic (Toshiba 1600 too) does not play music on a CD-R disk. My friend and I have dozens music CD-Rs that we burned from each others' CD collections. With many people burning music CDs these day, this is a bad omission. Also the inclusion of subwoofer jack is useless. Subwoofer should be connected to a receiver. If you connect a subwoofer to DVD player, then the subwoofer cannot be connected to other sources like CD player, VCR, etc. It's just stupid to include all these useless features.

These models were in the same price range, so I was looking for something that really stood out from the pack. I chose the Panasonic mainly because of our experience with their products (we've owned two Panasonic VCRs, which haven't broken down yet), and the fact that it's made in Japan. The only real shortcoming is the lack of coax output (I prefer optical anyway). The remote is pretty simple to use once you get the hang of everything. Also, the player hasn't skipped at all yet, which is a good sign. I use Monster cable to connect it to our projection TV, and I must say you can tell the difference.

She 5'6\\" and 130 lbs and on every run over 10 miles, the Alterra has literally rubbed the skin on her hips off leaving her a bloody mess after her run. The reason I say that it won't work for a female (unless you are a female with no hips or butt) is that it continually rides up and bounces around, no matter what adjustments you make. It is perfect for biking and hiking, but don't even think about using it if you plan on running comfortably!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for running...","review":"I bought this pack so I could run for longer periods of time without getting dehydrated, but the first time I tried my Alterra I was really disappointed. One of the zipper cords broke the first time I opened one of the pockets, and then when I went for my run I had to continually tighten the waist strap. The Alterra also bounced around a lot and was uncomfortable, and it kept hiking up my shirt.

From the beginning the seal leaked. I was also never able to completely get it filled with water, which was slightly annoying. It is very hard to clean, as the reservoir does now come off of the pack. The worst part is the seal leak, though. As I run, I can feel drops of water on my legs, which is extremely annoying and distracting. I would not suggest this pack. I recently bought a Catalyst and am much MUCH happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for price","review":"It's been a good product thus far. I have been using it strictly for running, even after a recent 14 mile run, it didn't leave any irritation on my skin. I like being able to put ice cubes in the easy open cap. I do on occasion have to tighten the main strap, however given all the movement that occurs during a run, it is to be expected on any strap system. It hasn't been loose to the point of the pack falling off. I wouldn't mind having a larger bladder, but the comparable 45oz pack didn't have an easy access cap, plus I am not sure I want 45oz of water on my waist. For long distance runs, I simply have to include a refill spot on my routes.If I was going going to get a similar product for just hiking or cycling, I would get the larger 45oz reservoir. 28oz isn't enough water for any activity when the weather is hot and trip is going to exceed a couple hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaking after first run","review":"Started leaking from the fill cap (closed as tight as possible) on my second run. Leaking as in most of the pack that holds the bladder, as well as my lower back, was soaked in less than 10 minutes of running. Afterwards I emptied it, let the entire pack dry out, (the next day) filled it again, and hung it over the shower rod in my bathroom. After a few minutes the area around the cap was soaked. After a few more the entire bag was soaked and dripping water into the tub. I see that at least one other person reports a similar problem with this model. Sent it back to amazon for a refund. Very disappointing as this would have been an excellent hydration pack.

Is that because the authors often seem to need help themselves? Or they all spout the same buzzwords and clichés? Or they are banal and boring? It sounds as if you are all self-help-manualed-out. Perhaps you need something different. Try Marcel Proust, revered master of exquisite expression and luminous prose. In Search of Lost Time, also called Remembrance of Things Past, Proust's one-and-a-quarter-million-word magnum opus, does not contain a trite sentence or conventional thought. You can learn much about living from such a profound genius, including how to spend your time, how to see and feel things, and why, sometimes, it is best just to stay in bed. Alain de Botton is your witty, often hilarious guide, providing valuable life lessons from Proust's writings and thoughts. getAbstract finds this ingenious, utterly original treatment thoroughly enjoyable.

It is on the one hand a clever subversion of the cliches and platitudes that plague most self-help books; yet it is still itself a self-help book that offers concrete and applicable advice.

You are left wondering in either case if it is just a joke that you did not get. Botton's attempt to compartmentalize Proust into a Happy Meal is certain to offend any thoughtful reader, whether he has ever read a word of Proust or not.Proust's life and his novel are worth learning about, even though it is debatable whether Proust's novel itself is worth reading. Those who have the misfortune of finding themselves trying to understand Botton's impenetrable writing might find a return to Proust easy going. Just to show us he is a regular guy, he even includes a picture of his girlfriend in his book. Issues, indeed!When others purport to explain art to you so that you can understand it, beware. If you want self-help, go read Proust himself or a diet book, or better yet, Walker Percy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very pleasant read","review":"This is a very interesting look at Proust and his way of looking at things.

Why didn't I? The title intrigued me. (This book deserves one star for its title, however disingenuous.)But how did I come to hear of the title? An acquaintance recommended this author to me.

I do love the idea of a Frenchman following in the footsteps (or ironically appearing to) of so many self-help writers. This is strictly an American genre, and it's amusing to see the European version. It's better by far, needless to say. I'll take De Botton over say, Dr. Wayne Dyer, for example.

Proust will save us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and almost insipid","review":"I realize I am in the minority but I thought this book was a very weak extraction of some of Proust's concepts that almost seemed insipid after de Botton removed them from their context. I was not impressed with the flimsy essense that de Botton derives from Proust's work. The concept that original observation requires self editing and avoiding stereotypical labeling and categorization is not new news. The concept that reading allows us to reflect on our own circumstances and experiences is also not new news. The third theme that the best artists observe the world in a unique way, allowing others to appreciate their vision and possibly develop a vision of their own was the last straw for me.

They lost my records in their new system, they said the last guy I talked to was a moron and I did not need the new batteries and that I need to send the camera in because it simply broken.I was unhappy with the expertise of customer service and am dissappointed to have the camera stop working from one second to the next after only 4 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Camera and a wonderful buy","review":"This is a great camera that is a low-cost but high quality product...This little camera holds 122 pictures at the lowest quality setting!

We have yet to read the manual for tips, no doubt the pix will be even better then. My only complaint is that Olympus and all resellers that I'm aware of advertise the camera as platform-independent. However, an 'optional' cable adaptor is required for Mac connecting, and even then only to an older (non- G4, G3, or iMac) Mac's serial port. If it doesn't plug and play for both PCs and Macs, it's not platform-independent. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Good Digital Camera","review":"I have really enjoyed this camera now that I finally can download pictures on my computer.

While \\"Give it Up\\" sounds like an outtake from the 1983 album \\"Eliminator,\\" the song \\"My Head's in Mississippi\\" attemps a hybrid of their old blues sound and their more modern synthesizer material. Little on the rest of the album resonates, however, and by the end you get the feeling that the Little Ol' Band from Texas has passed its prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst than the last.","review":"ZZ Top attempts to turn their back in the MTV that helped make them so hip just 7 years earlier. This album is probably the worst they had done up to this point. It attempts to be half old time blues and half Eliminator, but it just misses the mark both ways.The songs are simply weak and tired. This band sounds like it aged 35 years between 1983-1990. They songs just have no fire... Nothing even catchy with the exception of Doubleback, Give It Up, and My Head's In Mississippi.. Truthfully, none of these three songs would be singles on Eliminator or Tres Hombres.The weakest song on the album is probably Burger Man. Just mediocre and stale like the other 6 songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying","review":"if you like the bluesy sound of early ZZ Top...dont buy this record, its terrible....even the one ok song, my heads in miss. is a peice of crap......i mean come on, you guys cant come up with better songs than this??? if not, than break up and put out some solo albums"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never A Disappointment","review":"I give \\"Recycler\\" 4 stars, only because no band can put out absolutely great albums time after time. This album was an attempt to break away from the synthesized pop sound they had picked up in the 80's and get back to a little more of the straight-ahead, blues rock roots they are so famous for. I think they did exactly what they set out to accomplish, and the album is definitely a must for any ZZ fan. The first 4 cuts, and the slow blues number \\"2000 Blues\\" are the best cuts...the rest are okay, but more of an attempt at pop songs or songs intended for radio play. What ZZ fans will remember most about this album was that it produced the cut \\"Doubleback\\" which was on the \\"Back to the Future Part III\\" sound track...ZZ even managed a small cameo in the film. For the true ZZ fan, every album is different, and this one has its place in ZZ history just like the rest. But most importantly, ZZ releases are never a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth viewing to appreciate how far films have advanced!","review":"At the age of seven, it was the film UNKNOWN ISLAND that introduced me to prehistoric life and, consequently, the fact of evolution.

But to truly appreciate how far special effects have improved, give this film a view and you'll believe in cinematic evolution. Still, it holds a special place in my heart for, as a youngster on a farm, it took me across space and through time. Never underestimate the power of movies ... even this one! Submittted by H.

The acting and dinosaur effects were good enough for this type of movie. It was the storyline and lack of creativity with the effects that killed it for me. I also feel that this being filmed in color all but destroyed the b/w Saturday matinee atmosphere that makes these movies so fun to watch. Overall, worth a watch, but I'd recommend investing in 1957's 'The Land Unknown' with Jock Mahoney before you spent a dollar on this one.

Now granted, the monsters are pretty hokey in this one and it's clear that the \\"beach\\" is a studio one... but, somehow, I still liked it. This flick is sort of a King Kong rip-off with no central monster to love or to hate. So, the principals shoot at darn near every one that they see.

It tends to have moments of pure light-heartedness in the style of 'The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean' and also has deeper commentary about American civilization versus that of the Native American tribes. It's interesting to watch. Insightful. Hilarious in parts - especially scenes involving the egotistical General Custer.This is a classic well worth watching and remembering as it just provides not only a good story, but also perceptions of our culture and some philosophical ideals - something deeper for people to chew on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious!","review":"This movie is one of our all time favorites!

Absolutely hilarious......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent real alternative to previous historical teachings","review":"Life on the plains, with the intermixing and even greater clashing between Native Americans and the imports from Europe told in a simplistic yet panoramic style. Engaging and still entertaining. The first time I saw it was after sharing time with Indians on their reservation.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"The description on the back says that Jack Crabb may be the \\"biggest liar\\" in the old west. Maybe he was telling the truth. It should come as no surprise that the writers of history (white history written by white folks) might slant the stories to their own point of view (most writers do). This particular story gives an alternative point of view. Even if he was lying, which I doubt, it is a great story and a great movie. Its a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Big Man","review":"The DVD is not out yet, But I can't wait. This is a truely great tragicomedy rich with poignant irony.

Maybe it was a legal thing, I don't know, but if you want to watch a good movie the way movies were meant to be made, Little Big Man is a movie to watch over and over..You have to own this one.

It even teaches a little bit about strategy, math and teamwork! Now that can't be bad. It is durable enough that my 2 year old can help play (she rolls the dice for the bad guys).

It does a great job of recording home video regardless of the source input. Even though I have not figured out most of the features of this Personal Media player/recorder as of yet, it is fairly simple or not as complicated to use as some other players. As always is the case in any of these players, it lacks some features that others may have and has features that they do not. It does a good job on music playback and I have to better organize that area for myself. Its got a good \\"DAY PLANNER\\" using Microsoft's Outlook as well as its own software. Finally, You can't beat the storage capacity of this thing (60GB) as a \\"Jump drive\\" or portable \\"Hard Drive\\" and it also reads/writes to MMC/SD media cards as it is sloted to fit both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best historical fiction for children ever!","review":"This delightful mystery set in the time of ancient Rome gives in depth details of the life of a Roman without your child realizing they are reading about historical culture!! It has all the elements of a good book - suspenseful mystery, vivid imagery, intriguing characters, humor, friendship, enemies, and danger.Young students of a Greek schoolteacher have an argument that culminates with a mean statement written on a student's wax tablet. When that same statement is found written in red paint on the emperor's temple the next morning, their young friend finds himself in serious trouble. But are things as they seem?

Me and most of my friends would end up talking , eating mints, and yelling at our book by the end of class. Now I am a good student and got in A in that class. But I found the story very split. I either couldnt follow it at all or it was to predictable. Not a good read. I found myself dreading reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Mystery","review":"I loved this book.

It has very little action and even when there was action it was not very intense. People who like none violent mysteries would like this book. This book takes place in ancient Rome. Most of the action takes place at night in the soothsayers house.Rufus is convicted of a crime and sent to jail. His friends try to find some evidence that he is innocent. Their main suspect is a soothsayer. Then they find the real culprit and set Rufus free.I would not recommend this book people would be better of reading Eragon or Deltora Quest witch I read and loved but this book was rather dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money or Time","review":"My sixth grade English class read this book and it may be the worst book I've ever read. The story is boring. Except for mabye one or two, the characters seem lifeless. Three in particular seem to fade into the background. The storyline is the same of any other mystery like this: some kid gets accused of something he/she didn't do and his/her friends try to prove his innocence. It's extremely boring! This book is a waste of your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another type of Lego , an open-ended toy!","review":"This is the first Kid K'Nex toy that we bought for our 3 1/2-year-old boy and he loved it. The parts are big enough for the preschooler's hands and very easy to snap together. First he made many different designs by himself and was very proud of it. After a month, he started trying the designs in the design booklet. I was surprised to see that he was able to duplicate the models, though I prefer that he makes his own designs which he still does. I like the flexible parts and wish there were more than 2. Overall, I'm very happy with this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid K'nex are great toys!","review":"My six year old son spends hours playing with his K'nex. We have bought several sets, and he uses the pieces to make some very intentive creations. The pieces are sturdy, and bright colored, and he uses the softer rods to put around his neck and waist; he has made robot breast plates, goggles, an electric guitar, a laster blaster, and a sword and stabbard. It is amazing the things that he has come up with to make with these toys, and he plays with them for hours. It has been an excellent toy investment for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Creativity and FUN!!!","review":"My son dragged me into his preschool classroom to show me this toy and the things he could create. I decided to buy a set to have at home. I never dreamed how MUCH fun he would have playing with this toy. He literally will sit down and create things for hours. It is the most played with item of all the toys we own. It really encourages creativity and my son loves following the recommended patterns as well as coming up with his own creations. The pieces are very durable, yet flexible, and will not come apart as small legos sometimes do. The pieces fit together well enough to stay together, but yet aren't so hard to fit that a preschooler would struggle with it. The storage box is very sturdy and the hard top lid keeps pieces from getting lost. Definitely a good purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and thorough","review":"Streatfield has written a very interesting account of the history of cocaine from its use in the Andes thousands of years ago to the present day. The book is full of information, stories, personal anecdotes, and legends all interwoven in a light-hearted and humourous style.He goes in depth into the impact of the drug trade on society and politics in a number of countries as well as providing a thorough review of how cocaine emerged on the European social scene in the late nineteenth century.He writes as a fascinated observer rather than as a historian - a style which takes a bit of getting used to but overall enhances the reader's enjoyment.You might not agree with all of Streatfield's opinions but it will give you a new perspective on the cocaine trade, its impact on America, and what can be done about it. The book is fascinating and an eye opener - worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A PARTY!","review":"First and foremost- DO NOT TAKE THIS ALBUM SERIOUSLY! This is by-far the premire 2 Live Crew album to own. Almost every track is worthy of being on their greatest hits CD. Some stand-outs: Move Somethin'... is a FANTASIC song with exceptional rapping, good hooks, and great style; One and One... the catchiest and perhaps most hilarious of all the songs 2 Live has produced; S&M... the best song 2 Live has ever created, an anthem for all bachelor and frat parties for years to come. Again, this is a highly offensive, disgusting, and idiotic record... however, if you take it as it was designed to be interpreted, this album is funny-as-heck! THIS IS NOT BACH. Oh, yeah, this album would be 5 stars, although, I had to give it four so that I wouldn't consider myself completely foolish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"What a hilarious album. These guys are total goofballs. Worth it for the old school beats and the sheer silliness in these 4 songs: H-B-C; S & M; Do Wah Diddy; & One and One."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Lunacy!","review":"I was forced to listen this drivel at a party, and if I hadn't gone with a friend, I would have escaped. Instead, my ears were assaulted by this non-stop barrage of foul mouthed antics. I only gave it 1 star for the cover art (I MUST meet this woman!) and while that's extremely shallow, it's the only redeeming quality of this release. My advice: buy it, throw away the CD itself and enjoy the cover photo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rings of Intrigue","review":"A good mystery filled with twist and turns. Thought provoking as it weaves fiction and history into the search for a treasure that could unravel the Christain church. Kirkwood is a character that you will eather love or hate. It is full of Scottish history."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice concept","review":"My four age son loves it. He actually will come up with more words that could rhymes.So it help kids learn words, think of more and understand the concept of rhymes. Also it is a puzzle so he is learning how to connect them. All of the puzzles are differnt shapes so you only can fit the correct piece with each other. Still it is hard and makes kids think to get the right shapes match. I like this idea better than just reading rhymes books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coaster Contemporary Style Night Stand, Cappuccino Wood Finish: pretty furniture, ugly pulls!","review":"The pulls were wood made, painted in silver, that is why I gave a 4. The nightstand are VERY nice to me. We changed the pulls to brushed metal; difficult to find the right ones because the originals left a mark underneath that you need to hide with the new ones.

It glitches on me all the time and I can't trust it to get me out of my harbor. Stay away from it as I bought 2 of them and they both do the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is as realistic as unicorns!","review":"I had to read reviews to see what I was missing and I still don't get it. The hero is no 16 year old. He reminds me of McGiver on horseback. Descriptions are the only realistic element to the book. I'll pass on the rest of the triology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much praise","review":"The reviews of this work leads one to believe it is a great piece of fiction. How it won the National Book Award is beyond reason. Though McCarthy paints a good picture in one's mind, the content does not flow well. The story is boring and leaves one hoping the end will come soon. The love story is not believable and goes nowhere. The book moves too slowly and lacks suspense. Reading this after any great classic is a mistake for it leaves one wondering what all the praise is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"book - All the Pretty Horses","review":"Good book. Purchased for summer reading reguirement for high School. Will keep for next kids coming up through those classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"genial!!!","review":"Si vous ne connaissez pas McCarthy, sans doute que lespremieres pages vont vous nerver un petit peu, mais si vous avezla patience d'aller au-dela, ce livre vous reservera des moments comme peu d'autres peuvent pretendre le faire. L'unique point noir est que cela risque de vous couter cher puisque vous voudrez lire ensuite tout McCarthy. Si, comme moi, vous recherchez un veritable morceau de vie brute a travers des pages, n'hesitez plus. A mon avis, l'auteur americain le plus important apres Thomas Wolfe."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't as good as some people are claiming","review":"I had to read this book as one of my summer reading assignments for AP English. I doubt I would have even finished this book if I didn't have to. Personally, I was annoyed by McCarthy's style. Many of his sentences would either be really short (especially the dialouge) or a paragraph long. It seemed to me like the author would try to throw in a few really long lines once in a while just to be pretensious. Additionally, the style of the novel (especially the first 15 pages) was confusing. There were shifts in time and setting without even a break in the paragraph. I also didn't understand McCarthy's reasoning for leaving out many punctuation marks including quotation marks, some commas, and apostraphes. I may have been biased against this book from the start though because I don't like reading westerns."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Way Trip to the Glue Factory","review":"I am a big McCarthy fan but I was not engaged by this story. The writing, as always, is phenomenal. But that wasn't enough to pull the story through for me or keep me interested. It pains me to write this review because I have read some truly great work by this writer. But All the Pretty Horses is not one of his best, not by a long shot.I cannot recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowboyism and The American Frontier","review":"This novel is a gem in the shelf of Americana. It requires moderate input by the reader, but I enjoyed how McCarthy contrasts the minimalism of the American cowboy to the multiplicity of Mexicana. McCarthy deftly presents the Cowboy world as rooted in the American frontier, a place where there are few or no political boundaries and a lot of open space. Just the right amount of humor balanced out the violent descriptions of the rough cowboy life. This is a wonderful tribute to Americanism."},{"rating":"2","title":"unexpectedly mesmerizing","review":"I picked up this book, having seen it listed for readers who enjoyed \\"Cold Mountain\\". I was stunned by what I consider pretty lush prose, considering the barren landscape and lifestyle McCarthy is trying to describe. The stylistic choices in this novel (the use of Spanish, no quotations) that seem to have bothered others (and in \\"The God of Small Things\\" drove me batty) seem perfectly matched to the story itself; the starkness of the very appearance of the page matches the story. McCarthy did a wonderful job, in my opinion, of showing us people who just manage to keep going - they persever in spite of all the obstacles. I loved this book, and plan to follow up with the other two volumes in the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish 101","review":"Excellent reading. Some people complain about the use of Spanish in parts of the book. I think it ads to the realism. You can log on to cormacmccarthy.com to get the translations for all three books in the border trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a must read......","review":"If you're not into reading other languages and you can't speak Spanish then All the Pretty Horses is not for you. In the novel the author does not use the same writing techniques that we use in English. Instead he is more cultured and uses a Spanish style of writing. The book is about a young man named John Grady Cole. He travels down to Mexico to this hacienda and falls in love with the owner's daughter. He now must suffer all things that love can bring. The story is one of romance and adventure. The character is sent to a Mexican prison for killing someone in self-defense. This is just one of the many adventures that he encounters. The author has written many novels with this sort of cultured writing style. Overall the book was intriguing and exciting. It took you on a cowboy ride to Mexico and back. If you like reading about a young boy's life and like to read of love and action then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of modern fiction","review":"McCarthy is a skilled and talented linguist who knows just how to pull a reader into the world of the novel, enveloping them in a richness of language that is truly amazing.I admit, I haven't even finished this book yet, but I am so impressed by the writing that I couldn't wait. I have read two of McCarthy's other novels, Suttree and Child of God, and both demonstrated McCarthy's ability to create a vivid fictional world and characters, embuing them with such deep humanity. However, I've found that All the Pretty Horses so much wider and encompassing than the other two. Perhaps it is because the characters are young, touched with an idealism that had long escaped the characters in the other novels, they are more accessible and easier to understand. I've found this book impossible to put down, and would recommend it to anyone interested in a book that really draws the reader in...I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great literature!","review":"I read this book for summer reading for an American Lit. course in high school, and at first I found it awfully boring... so I rushed through the novel. But after reading it, I realized how great a book it is! The story is remarkable and there is so much to it. Read it, and you'll see what I mean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Horsey Book","review":"Enjoyed the book! Wanted the story to continue to see what happens. Learned many Spanish words and phrases from reading the book. It is a great adventure and love story. Read this first then go see the movie! Many descriptive, powerfull words. There is actually a good plot past the first 100 pages that is just description and setting the scene, so get past the first third and you will enjoy the book. There is a great opportunity for discussion, so read this with someone else! A supple modern western!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best =)","review":"I never expected to find deeper meaning, and i certianly never expected even a decent read based on the movie. but i was very surprised, and it is definitely my favorite book i've read. worth the time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks romance!!!","review":"This was a great book, very detailed on all aspects except on the romantic side. He used more words to describe plains and grasses than Cole and Alejandra's relationship. However, the moral lesson was very realistic and moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnificent story, poorly written.","review":"McCarthy's intentional misuse of written English is annoying and doesn't lend anything to the story. The decision to omit quotation marks is particularly perplexing since it diminishes the immediacy of the tale. The Spanish language quotes are excellent for adding flavor, but too lengthy and non-contextual for those of us who aren't bilingual. Attributes are insufficient to keep track of who is speaking. The story is one of the finest I've read- and I've read a lot of excellent books- but it's a shame the author didn't respect his readers enough to write so that his work was a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"School assignments usually bite - this one wasn't so bad","review":"I was required to read this book this past year as a school assignment. First off it's rare for such a new book (it was only published 14 years ago) to be a school assignment (well at my school it is). I suppose that says something for this book. It's the easiest read but not bad. Rather boring in places. It leaves a lot of the story up in the air a little which I didn't like so much, and I definably found the end rather rushed. All in all, not my favorite book, but a good book in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excuse for a book","review":"There are several books which I recall reading, being an english professor, none of which are this aggrivating. There are several objects of my disliking contained in the composition: nullified usage of quotations, run-on sentences, and the overwhelming ammount of conjunctions. Did this fellow fail English 101?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been better","review":"Im sorry but I cant like this book, it is full of unending sentences, bad grammar and a society domanated by men, where women rareley have name and are only used for the plesure of men. The book is unrealistic and writen like it is a common for an seventeen year old to self cauterize a bullet wound with a burning hot gun barrel. I give MaCarthy credit for trying to make a poetic book but I just dont feel that you can romantasize throwing up, or use the word \\"blood\\" so many times. Although I do admit that the book did have many thought provoking conversations between Rawlins and John Grady Cole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"This book was a waste of time to read. The boring plot along with the long-winded sentences made it absolutely trecherous to read. The lack of quotation marks, lack of character definition, and an uninteresting plot caused me to despise this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I thought the book was rather hard to understand and extremely slow-moving. The author didn't use quotation marks when characters spoke, and he used Spanish in dialogue. I think that the book was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I'm not commenting on the book, because I put this book down after the first page. Why?

How can you praise the justice system of texas and critisize the mexican System in using the death penalty by closing your eyes not to see the reality and the 470 executions that have taken place only in Texas since 1982. Only in the year 2000 40 human-beings have been executed in Texas...I am against capital punishment and that is why I appreciate the realistical scene of Blevins execution very much, nevertheless I don't understand how in the end the american judge can be showed in such a idealistic way that you might believe that the texanian system of Justice might be respecting human rights.

Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with \\"All the Pretty Horses.\\" Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought \\"What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway.\\"I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives."},{"rating":"1","title":"And... and... and... One too many!!","review":"Ugggh! This has to be one of the worst books I've ever read in all my years of reading young adult literature! For one, what's with McCarthy not putting in quotes?? I mean, I knows it's a style and all, but I never really did know what was going on!! And the ANDS... uhh, I've never seen so many in ONE book! It was absolute craziness! I wouldn't recommend this book to ANYONE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read","review":"A complete plumbing of the depths of this book has not been done. What exactly this book means is perhaps known only to the author. On the backdrop of a couple of Texas cowboys exploring Mexico, and getting into trouble in the process, there is a lot going on. At one point Alejandra's aunt delivers a long monologue in which she describes a worker at the mint placing the blank slug randomly one way or the other, so that the resulting coin, seemingly random of itself, is merely the product of an earlier random act. And so ad infinitum. True to form, McCarthy describes it all with a beautiful control of descriptive language, from the dry desert to the knifefight to the horses. If you enjoy McCarthy, this book will not disappoint you. If you have never read him before, this is as good a place as any to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hohum.","review":"I've been told that other McCarthy novels are better, but having started with this one, I have not been inspired to explore his oeuvre any further. My annoyance with this book probably has something to do with its being vastly overrated. I picked it up expecting, based on what I'd heard, to be astonished on every page, only to come away from it bored and puzzled. What is everyone so excited about? The plot is thoroughly conventional, the prose is some kind of dried-up, left-over concoction made up of one part Faulkner and two parts Hemingway, and McCarthy has a bad habit of constantly singing the praises (in his chiseled, understated way) of his insipid hero, John Grady Cole -- what a horseman! -- all based on an antiquated and irrelevant code of manhood, or something. Who cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary Literature at its Best.","review":"A western, coming of age novel, a transformation from innocence to road-worn. One quality remains unchanged throughout this story of two young men that leave their home in Texas for adventures in Mexico, friendship. McCarthy's Mexico is a vast other-world with it well described life styles of the vaqueros and the breaking of wild horses. The prose is sparse and haunting, prompting the reader to use their imagination. A refreshing approach from the contemporary American way of reveal it all in the most graphic and shocking detail. The story is intense and riveting, I couldn't put it down. All the big themes are depicted here: friendship, maturation, love, survival and family. It did remind me of Faulkner's work, in that, the story unfolds in a series of almost orchestral movements. An important author who should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully written, compelling, couldn't put it down","review":"for anyone to say that this book has too much detail (as one reviewer here did) is to say that mozart's music has too many notes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall boring; sometimes entertaining","review":"There was an insane amount of description in this book. Too much for my liking. I skipped over parts because I couldn't bear to read anymore about riding across the grassy plains. And I mean pages and pages of it. The author put in plenty of description about the surroundings, but then left out important details about the plot and conversation. Sometimes I had to read a part over several times just to find out who was talking to who, and even then I still didn't know sometimes. If you like an overload of description, then be my guest and buy this book. But if you feel that the plot deserves more attention than the grassy plains, I suggest you look elsewhere for good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...a \\"man's\\" book","review":"Wow, this book was amazing. Not sure how to describe it, but it reminds me of a true Western. Where nothing is ever easy, no matter who you are. Definitely a \\"macho\\" book about a man and his inner workings. Amazing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid for new book got a used one!","review":"I paid for a new book and received a used book. This was to be a Christmas present!Do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK book with distracting grammar","review":"I love to read, and I usually enjoy my summer reading assignments. However, I found All the Pretty Horses very hard to get into. The first few chapters are very slow, and frankly, quite boring. The rest of the book is dizzyingly action-packed. There is also a lot of dialogue in Spanish, which makes some of the story hard to follow if you don't speak Spanish.McCarthy also has some grammatical eccentricities that I found very distracting. The book begins with pronouns that lack antecedents, completely lacks quotation marks (not even dashes a la Steinbeck), and has the longest run on sentences I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blimp material, folks, blimp material","review":"There is no option for zero stars, but that is what it really deserves. Mexico is depicted as a land made up of two elements--mysticism and whorehouses. Mr. McCormick has an infallible ear for local Texas speech, but everything else is blimp material--hot air. As a resident of Mexico, I can assure you that it is inhabited by ordinary people who don't spout profundities while selling you a Coke, and the country is not made up of heart-of-gold prostitutes, knife-fighting pimps, and other very, very silly characters painted in such shallow tones that they are little more than stereotypes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, difficult to read, see the movie?","review":"I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new \\"style\\" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"All pretty horses","review":"All the pretty horsesThoughts keep peeling out.is is adventure... coming of age... but filled with data from the area and philosophical th.oughts keep peeking out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"This book was assigned reading in an English course I took about a year ago. It blew my mind. The writing style is very simplistic, even more so than Hemmingway, in that there is very little punctuation. There are no quotations, but they really aren't needed. Once the main character, John Grady Cole, finds his way to Mexico, there is some Spanish, but it isn't neccessary to know the language, as there is no exposition in it and a decent explanation is given soon after. It also helps to make you feel a stranger in this land, as Cole is. What is tragic is that Miramax has cut the original four hour film translation of this masterpiece down to a piddling hour-forty-five. Read this. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking and... breathless","review":"I can read English, French, Italian. This novel ranks with Proust's La Recherche du temps perdu, and Manzoni's Promessi sposi. Breathtaking scenes follow more breathtaking scenes and the whole leaves the reader breathless. Magnificient, none like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I don't normally read fiction, but was forced to read this book eight years ago for a college assignment. I couldn't be more delighted that my instructor forced me to read this book! My reluctance turned to joy and determination as I whiped through the pages as fast as I possibly could. This book has everything: joy, romance, action, life changing events, tragedy, unexpected twists, not to mention human loss and suffering. I found this book to be well written, and much better than the movie that attempted to capture it's essence a few years back (Matt Damon is in the movie). This book lives up to the five star votes it has received from so many readers. I hope you enjoy, I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have won the Pulitzer.","review":"I couldn't put this book down once I started it. Having grown up in West Texas close to where the story begins, it recalled many childhood memories. Mr. McCarthy's style is different, but he masters the language like no current author. This story is an emotional roller coaster, so be prepared. This author knows his subject, and the dialogue flows very smoothly indeed. I only wish that \\"THE CROSSING\\" had been a sequel, though it too, is outstanding"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story!!!","review":"It took me several tries and for me to ran out of books, to continue reading this one, mainly because the punctuation style is unfamiliar, but how I regret the delay.

The deepest community one of sorrow.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Moving","review":"When I read this book, I was completely impressed with the author's power to draw you into the scene of the story. I mean, I was seeing mountains and open grass lands and beautiful horses - and I've never seen them in real life. This book is very well-written, and the imagery is powerful and moving.The main character, Cole, is chasing after a lifestyle that has passed. A life that is no more. He wants beauty in the world; all he finds is pain and sorrow. And maybe that is the way it is for all of us. We want what he wants, but reality crushes our view that this world can be made perfect if only this could happen...if only that could happen...It cannot. This is one of the most powerful themes in the book: we are all chasing a life that in many ways cannot exist in this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulkner it Ain't","review":"What it is is a pretty good novelization of George Miller's great movie The Man from Snowy River (based on a poem by Banjo Paterson). McCarthy hasn't WF's metaphysics, these are replaced by truly brilliant descriptions of the southerwestern landscape that you need a Baedecker's to decipher. He's good at describing Marlboro Men doing Marlboro Men type things, but couldn't write a decent woman character if it meant five miles of downed fenceline. That McCarthy is so popular is less a reflection of his brilliance than the dearth of good literature out there. Then again, better read him than say, Colin Harrison. Or read Blood Meridian -- a truly brilliant work of genius., nothing like it in American Lit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad depressing story","review":"This is a rather depressing story - I don't understand why all the good reviews.

Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever ..","review":"I had to read this book for an Advanced Literature course I took last semester. If this book is any indication of how the rest of McCarthy's work is, I'd rather not read anymore. The first 100 or so pages of the book, the most exciting thing that happens is when they are riding through Texas and the tumbleweed rolls past them.

It tells of a daughter's courage in overcoming the bonds of addiction. It is a story of hope for those lost in the world of addiction - for not only is the addict lost, those who love the addict become lost as well.

I don't recommend that ball either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap cutout for a reason","review":"I bought this when it came out because I moderately like \\"Believe What You're Saying\\" and figured I would give it a try. Sadly, that was the only worthwhile or tolerable song on the album -- and even that one now doesn't do as much for me as it did when I first heard it on the radio.The main problem is that all of the songs get bogged down in that sort of white-noise mush that unfortunately many bands still think is cool. No instruments stand out -- everything is just a bunch of nondescript jet roar.This makes every song sound almost exactly alike. Most of them have no good melodies to speak of and try to survive on the \\"roar.\\" It doesn't work. The sound is WAYYYY too trebly and gets incredibly annoying after a few songs. After a while, everything just blends into one another and there ceases to be any \\"songs\\" on the album -- just noisy instruments doing, well, *something*. And that something isn't very engaging.Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre city","review":"This album is so terrible, it does not deserve the Sugar name. If you are thinking of this as your first Sugar album, I'd strongly recommend Copper Blue, and Beaster over this one. Every song sounds the same, it is poorly produced, and it is a frustratingly uninspired effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bob Being Bob","review":"No matter what he calls himself, Bob Mould pretty much sounds the same. Mould&#65533;s brand of sludgy hard rock seems to appeal to some, but I can&#65533;t imagine why. I mean sure he&#65533;s had OK tracks (not on this album though) but to me he seems more like a hack than an innovator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but nothing new","review":"This was a great album in the 90s and it holds up today. Packed with bonus material, if you were a casual fan back in the day, you'll find a ton new stuff here. Unfortunately, I purchased all the singles and the Besides CD a couple of decades ago, so I already have all of this. Nothing new...heck it's not even complete.Still, a great album, and well worth listening to again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a penny used!","review":"It's a penny! Well, that's a reason alone to buy this album, but that's beside the point. It's a good pop album with catchy songs from Bob Mould and his 90's band. Songs \\"Gee Angel\\", \\"Favorite Thing\\", \\"I Can't Help You Anymore\\", and the rest of the album are all solid rocking pop songs. If you like Husker Du or Mould's solo stuff and you don't own this. I don't know why. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD at a bargain price","review":"I bought this CD many moons ago at full price and have always felt it worthwhile. At this bargain price it's an absolute must have. Just listen to track 1 \\"Gift\\" - if your pulse isn't racing after the first go round, then you must be dead! Admittedly, the entire CD doesn't hold up to this incredible opening, but it's not for lack of trying, and it does come frickin' close in a few places. Some kind of masterwork, FU:EL is one artifact of the grunge era which still holds up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonably Priced Well Made Adapter","review":"There is not much you can say about this product other that it is made well, reasonably priced and serves the intended purpose without any problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Card Collector Review","review":"I have used two versions of the product, 6 and 7, on both with different PC's and Operating Systems my database which contains all of my inputted information became corrupted.

I made it through half way of my second honest attempt to listen all the way through before I just couldn't take listening anymore. I have no idea how Anywayawanna had more UK hits than Life and Soul, but apparently my tastes do not match the Brits (and not just my disdain for warm beer and overly fried fish sticks). This CD is a collection of songs that lack the creativity and passion of songs on Life and Soul.

That just wasn't the case here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I have twin boys who were born prematurly. I purchased this toy while one of my sons was still in the hospital. He would lay and look at himself for hours before he could make the music and lights play. Once we got home we fixed it so that they could sit in a bouncy seat and kick the roll bar and make the music and lights play. Soon they learned to use their hands to play with it. It is very durable, standing up to two infant boys kicking it heartily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy for self-soothing","review":"My 19-month-old loves to use this crib toy to soothe herself to sleep (and back to sleep if she awakens during the night). With just a slight turn of her wrist, she can start the music and lights. It's also quite durable--she's been playing with it for more than a year now. My only complaint is the music is a bit loud for us, especially magnified through a monitor, and the volume isn't adjustable. After the baby is back in dreamland, we're waiting for the music to stop so WE can go back to sleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"happy mom","review":"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY DAUGHTER.

( he didnt sleep in his crib yet hehe) now my son is 4 months old and sleeps in his crib but i never put him in his crib during the day. thus the usefulness of this toy is somewhat limited. when he can sit he will probably enjoy playing with it. i would recomend this toy for ages 6 months and up as a real great interactive toy but it is a waste for a new baby who cannot handle it and doesnt spend lots of time cooped up in his crib."},{"rating":"1","title":"We have had 2 and neither work right","review":"Well, this WOULD be a great toy if we could get one that worked. The first one we had would work ok for the first day or 2 and then would stop until we reinserted the batteries. At first i thought the batteries were dead, but we went through 3 or 4 sets. If we reinserted them the toy would work perfectly, but only for about 2 days. So i called fisher-price, who sent out a replacement and assured me it would be factory tested. Well, it does the same thing. It is too much bother to keep unscrewing the battery compartment to get it to work, so we just use it as a mirror. My son still likes to spin the toy at the bottom; too bad the thing doesn't work right. I wonder if anyone else has had this problem, or if i just happen to keep getting defective ones?"},{"rating":"2","title":"disappointed","review":"I was at first very please with the star. The music was not too loud like a other products, it is easy to spin, and the mirror is a nice size. I was VERY disappointed with the fact that I have to change batteries after a couple of days use.

It allows me to get more sleep and amuses my daughter at the same time. She has this toy since she was 2 months old and she is 7 months old right now. She wakes up and plays with it during the night and when she wakes up in the morning, she doesnt wake up crying anymore because the mirror and music amuses her. The only bad thing about it is that she kicks it in her sleep sometimes, but it doesnt wake her up, that can be solved with the off switch which is a must have on all baby toys :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"We got this toy for my daughter when she was 3 months old. Now she is almost 7 months and still loves it. It is great to entertain her while I run do something. It is also great to teach the cause and effect relationship. It is one of our favorites because the music is actually pretty nice and not annoying like some of her other toys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun toy","review":"I first saw this mirror when we were staying with family. My daughter's cousin is the same age she is and we were borrowing some of her baby stuff while visiting. My 6 1/2 month old daughter really enjoyed playing with it. Between the lights and music, it kept her occupied and content in her crib. So when we returned home, I bought one for her and she still really likes it. She will play with it before she takes her nap and after she wakes up. I love to see her \\"talk\\" to the baby in the mirror! I do turn it off at night though as she was bumping it and setting the music off and it was disturbing her sleep. (mine too! :) I didn't give it 5 stars because it is a battery eater or at least mine is! I had to change the batteries when we bought it ( a month ago) and I just had to change them again today as they were dead already. Other than that, it is a great toy and I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's out of tune.","review":"If you're looking for someting to help develop your child's musical ear, as this product's manufacturer claims it will, this product is worse than nothing because the melodies are out of tune.

My 5-month old has not been terribly interested in it as an interactive toy, and in any event, there are many others available in this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe ours just doesn't work right.","review":"We've been disappointed with this toy right from the start. The blinking lights weren't very bright -- hardly noticeable. The spinning bar wasn't anything the baby was interested in. The tunes are soft and appealing to the adult ear, so it wasn't all that bad for the parent. It just wasn't anything that appealed to our baby. Even now that she is older, there are other musical toys that she finds more appealing. Somehow, we just skipped by this one without fanfare."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun, but sometimes dangerous","review":"My daughter absolutely loves mirrors, but sometimes she baps herself in the head with it because it does not stay secure against the bottom of the crib by the mattress.

Anything that plays music has always been a favorite toy. This has an adjustment so you can play it for just one loop of music. I do this when my daughter is playing with it and I want the cause and effect approach. It also has a setting where it will play continuosly for about 5 minutes and circle through a series of songs. Music is nice, not the annoying type. There are several songs not just one of two. (five? maybe, I don't know for sure). The music playing so long and the lights flashing has calmed her to sleep on many a night. She never really noticed the mirror part of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"REMASTERING HELL!

So to sum it up, I guess they can make their music pretty, heavy, and out of control whenever they feel like it.That makes them a rather interesting art rock band that wasn't afraid to take chances, and you know, I've always admired bands that take chances because it's a gutsy move that can either make or break a band. Back in the 70's though, this kind of experimenting was considered cool and welcoming, and honestly, there's plenty of good ideas on the album, some of which are even pretty melodic.I don't know what to think- perhaps King Crimson fans would appreciate this kind of music the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismally dated","review":"1 1/2Poorly rendered goth-prog deserves to keep its sleeves in the dust of obscurity, but may hold sway for ambitious rock-organ gloomers, nostalgia grinders, and freak seekers for a few interesting instrumental interludes between convoluted choruses of darkened dreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kane Gets The Job Done!","review":"\\"Taste Of Chocolate\\" is a definite hip hop classic by BDK. Kane as usual brings the heat lyrically especially on tracks \\"Hard Being The Kane, Put Ya Weight On It & Mr. Pitiful.\\" Kane breaks it down on \\"Who Am I & Dance With The Devil\\" tracks that talk about crossing over, slavery, the drug epidemic & inner city violence. The rest of the CD rocks out in typical Kane fashion. \\"Keep 'Em On The Floor\\" even with the R&B feel has rugged rhymes laid down by yours truly (I specialize in fun/I must know what's happenin' cause ya dancin' like Rerun). The only mis-steps are \\"All Of Me\\" & \\"Kane vs. Dolemite\\" tracks that I'm sure BDK could have replaced with previous demos.

Normally if i carry stuff in it, it adds weight so it doesn't usually fall off. Another thing, since it just hooks on, anyone can steel it when I lock it - I sorta wish someone would steal it so i can buy a new one (one that needs to be mounted). Its not really level either, AND it covers up my front reflector - so it makes my bike unsafe.

Very happy I purchased this camera and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok...","review":"The camera captures very good quality images but there a few things that make it's use cumbersome. First, it takes a fairly long time to warm up (perhaps a minute or more). This makes capturing those special and fleeting moments difficult. By the time the camera is ready to photo our 18-month daughter has moved on... Second, the ability to alternate between viewing photos and taking new ones is slow and unwieldy. In order to view pictures you've already taken, you need to close the lens cover. This is slow because the zoom needs to retract. Similarly, to switch to photo mode from viewing mode, the camera needs to be reopened. Finally, the ability to delete picturs is also quirky. You need to switch to viewing mode to delete and it take a few steps. All of these features make the use of the camera really slow and annoying. I wish I had better things to say but I wouldn't recommend this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"A family treasure","review":"I liked my Olympus D-460 zoom digital camera so much that I recommended it to 2 sons and bought it for another son as a gift. I get great action shots of the grandchildren and border collies in our lives, and stunning, color-perfect close-ups of flowers--dew drops, insects, and all. It is compact and light enough to pop in my purse or jeans pocket, and the cover control makes that a safe way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little confused","review":"This camera requires two battery packs that come packaged with the unit. Each pack consists of two batteries sealed together in a plastic casing. Both casings fit in the camera in only one direction.At first glance it appears the polarity marks printed on the battery casings are incorrect and do not match polarity instructions inside the camera.Solution: Print all four polarities (rather than two) on each battery pack to eliminate the confusion.Also, the battery compartment door requires TLC to close which concerns me because it's plastic.Initial comments with regard to camera options and photo quality are very favorable......and still learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Point & Shoot Cam","review":"This is my first digital camera. I have been using this camera for nearly 5 months. The quality of prints I get are fantastic for a 1.2 megapixel camera. I am able to get prints up to 5x7 with good color tones if the correct setting is chosen. I like that the flash is manual (it doesn't automatically pop up when it detects there isn't enough light) because it gives me a little more control. I have never had a problem with the lens cover hitting the lens when closing it. The lens cover basically is a \\"two click\\" close; one to activate the lens to swivel down into the base and then the next to complete the closing of the cover. The only thing I would improve this camera with is for Olympus to add more accessories in the kit. I had to go buy batteries, battery charger, larger memory card and a camera bag, which added up very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 strikes and your out","review":"Purchased a new olympus d460 camera for xmas present. Worked good for about 30 days, then the zoom lens stopped and the motor kept running. Could not turn off so had to remove batteries and sent in for repair which will be [price]. While the camera was in for repair we bought a refurbished olympus d460 as a backup since we had all the extras. We got 20 min's of use out of that camera when it went compleatly dead, so here we are with 2 camers both of which are in for repair. In my opinion Olympus has a real problem with their zoom lens or else we were extreamly unlucky"},{"rating":"1","title":"a chain is only as strong as its weakest link","review":"After reading many customer reviews (mostly 4 stars and better) and researching dozens of other cameras, I ordered the D460, convinced I had made the best decision for the dollars spent. I've had it for about an hour and it is back in the box ready to send back. The second time I lifted the flash attachment, a small steel ball bearing fell out and the attachment would not lock into place, nor would the flash function when I attempted to test it. The flash is like something you find on a toy camera! As to the camera's other features, I can offer no opinion. I didn't get that far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design - and costly to you","review":"Many reviewers have commented on the inconvenience of the flash unit on the Olympus D460, requiring that you manually open it for flash pictures. It is also prone to breaking.On the second day I had this camera, the flash unit broke. A small ball bearing that holds the flash upright popped out of the unit. And when this cheap, poorly designed unit becomes inoperable, Olympus does not cover it under warranty. It claims you have mishandled the camera and charges you over $100 to repair it."},{"rating":"1","title":"my first digital camera","review":"brought the d460 to replace a 35mm camera. By the time I figured out how to use it properly, I was steadily getting very dissapointed with the digital zoom. When you are in an auditorium, taking pictures of your children performing, you cannot get a good close-up. Picture quality is great as long as you are taking stills, scenary, and no action. I've had it for about 3 years and I'm making a better choice next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get 'hosed' on the batteries","review":"Nice, easy to use. BUT you will never be able to find replacement batteries (lithium). I had to call Olympus direct. They want $13.95 each BUT almost $8 for S&H!! If I knew this, I never would have bought the camera. Don't make the same mistake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Digital Camera","review":"This is my first digital camera. I have had it and used it extensively since August of 2001. Sharp pictures, good color. Downloads are slow - perhaps this is a digital camera characteristic - I don't know. I bought a larger storage card for it and it works really well. I am buying a replacement and hope to find something that works as well with the movie and sound feature. No reservations in recommending this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympus 460 is a good digital camera","review":"This is my first digital camera. I am quite happy with it. I did get good technical support from Olympus. It would be perfect if the camera has USB port connection for its images download."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Camera. Wish Olympus Followed Up w/ something worthwhile","review":"This was my first digital camera. At 1.3MP, the quality of images is much better than what I achieved on modern 10MP cameras. This was absolutely fantastic camera - the sliding door cover was extremely useful and rugged, user menues were very intuitive and responsive, the focus rocker was very precise. I dragged this camera on many outdoor trips...many times it tumbled, was dropped in sand...but in the end it always came back to life. Ultimately after the camera broke I searched for a replacement, but unfortunately Olympus never followed up with anything as good. Since then I moved on to Canon, Panasonic and Nikon cameras. I briefly went returned to Olympus for the 790 series. While I liked the rugged features, the limited photo options and poor image quality didn't impress me. Hope Olympus pull their act together and brings a camera worthy of its D-460 heritage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service for this camera is lees than desirable","review":"While the camera is performing great! There were some accessories that did not work with the camera. I tried repeatedly to contact Olympus and received the runaround on numerous occasions. I will not buy an Olympus product again. Customer service and support is the focal point of any good business. The marketers at Olympus obviously missed that day of instruction when they were going through customer support training."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"I purchased my Olympus 460Z after the birth of our first grand child over 2 years ago. It was very easy to use from the start. I love the fact that I don't have to buy film and have it developed. Our youngest daughter just recently got married and it was so much fun to make thank you cards and be able to have their wedding picture on the front. I also did this with her graduation thank you cards. Everyone loved getting a picture. I have made business cards for my dad using pictures of his tow trucks as the background. I have thoroughly enjoyed all the photos I have taken. To me the quality of the photos are great. It is very user friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice camera: convenient, easy to use, great photos","review":"I'm glad I got this camera. I've been debating for a long time whether to get a digital camera. I use a variety of digital cameras at work and know how useful they are. This one had the price that I wanted to pay and the performance of $1000+ cameras from a couple of years ago. The colors look great. The software is a breeze to use. The quality of the camera seems to be very good so far.I would have scored this camera 5 out of 5 if it came with a case and a USB connector. It is slow to download with the serial cable. I still haven't been able to take any good photos at night: firework displays, city lights, full moon, etc.I'm planning on purchasing a case, a 32 MB Flash Card and a USB Reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & easy to use","review":"I just purchased this camera , my first digital. It is very easy to use and a lot of fun. A USB reader makes it all come together, which you get for free from Olympus via a mail in rebate.The 1.8\\" color LCD viewfinder is nice for taking a quick peek at the pics you just shot.So far I have only been using it as a point and shoot camera, but you can adjust the exposure to suit your needs as well as numerous other settings.The camera comes with the Olympus utility software,and photo manipulation software and it works Ok, but I can't wait to try Photoshop or paintshop pro with the Olympus.that will be awesome!Like I said, this is my first digital and I was a little nervous about spending $ on it, but I am very happy with the olympusD-460 zoom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Olympus","review":"I purchased this camera about one year ago, and already am having problems with it. First, it won't take any photos in very bright light--the photos come out horribly bleached out and grainy. So, that means no outdoor photos at all. It used to take wonderful close up shots, indoors only, with the flash, but now, on the closest settings, they are blurry. I have tried repeatedly to get Olympus to stand behind their camera and repair it, they refuse, it is almost impossible to get ANY kind of response from their Customer Service people, if you don't believe me, check out other websites where complaints against Olympus are rampant.Save your money and get a camera with a good company name and customer service department behind it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book !!! Better than Rosetta","review":"I found the book to be highly useful with the proper dialects and prononciations of the words. Keep in mind that language has three to four different dialects and this book has the main one that is used in Khandahar province. The book is also used by the military and teaches a great deal of the fundamentals to be knowledgeable of.

The sound quality is very poor, and amateurish voice-over announcements are irritating and distracting. Gid Tanner is the only member of the original Skillet Lickers on the album and his performance, never very good anyway, is very poor. The other performers are Gid's son, grandson, and local performers. The material is about the only good thing about the album ... all but, as I recall, three selections are genuine \\"old-time\\" music.

Superbly plotted and written with characters as good as only American character actors allowed to settle into their roles can be, it nevertheless paints the most hopeless picture of urban decay, the drug culture in ever-younger children, the hopelessness of inadequate city and state funding and the powerlessness, and sometimes venality, of its politicians and city officials. It's mesmerising viewing, each episode augmenting and deepening the others, which is truly admirable given the multiplicity of writers and directors. Quite why the City of Baltimore ever allowed it to be filmed, let alone co-operated in the filming, one cannot imagine. It's as though Coca-Cola ran a national campaign that said \\"Don't ever, under any circumstances, drink Coke\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, very deep!","review":"It's hard to get into it but eventually you become addict to it.

It's a great idea, but there were quirks from the beginning that bothered me and made it difficult for a 3-year-old to use it. Like when you press the \\"on\\" button, there's about a two or three-second delay before it powers on and makes its first sound. So kids (including my 4-year-old daughter) think it didn't come on the first time. So they press it again, which shuts it off. My son did enjoy using it once he got the hang of turning it on. His favorite way to play was with the alphabet games minus any book. But within about a year, it started to think you had a book in at all times. My two younger children are now old enough to play with it, but it constantly prompts them to point to items that are on pages other than the one they're on, even when pressing the green \\"go\\" cirle. I purchased this brand new three years ago, but it had a different look. Hopefully the newer version has worked these bugs out."},{"rating":"1","title":"3yo bored in 5min","review":"My 3yo, who loves his vtech whiz kid, was bored with this in no time. The dialogue moves very slow and the story lines are very basic. The child must click \\"go\\" on each page in order to activate it, very redundant. Once on a page, and they click go, they must choose a game a t the bottom of the page, after what seems like 10seconds, it spits out \\"find the red square\\", etc.. very boring. If your child knows his colors and shapes, they will not find this too challenging - aka boring. I think the whiz kid is a much better product. Hopefully he will like some of the other books for this, otherwise its going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!

When I called back, it was a 2 hour ordeal. Finally, I spoke with a supervisor who told me that despite the fact that it was their mistake, I had to pay to ship everything back to them, then they would refund my money! Not only am I upset by this treatment, but I can't believe they don't make the pens anymore. I have invested in a lot of books for this leappad and now it is useless. What a waste of money!

And in the final scene he's so angry that he's jumping up and down mad, causing his glasses to fall off his face, scaring some of the monkey children watching him. What are we teaching are kids here?

These stain an otherwise excellent album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the techno, lose the new wave","review":"Unfortunately most of the songs these guys do are in that Duran Duran new wave genre. Personally, I'd say the vocals are ok but others like Spandau Ballet are far more talented. But a couple tunes like Hack1 are really cool and innovative. If they'd just do albums with that style alone, I'd kick out the greenbacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique little cat toy.","review":"I purchased this for my 8 week old kitten who is still in his chewing-on-everything phase.

After outlining the building blocks of SEM (multiple regression, path analysis, and factor analysis), Kline gets the reader ready to tackle popular SEM software with examples for AMOS, LISREL and EQS. There is also a great chapter on what NOT to do with this often misused technique. For a preview, see Kline's article in the Journal of Clinical Psychology (1991), Latent variable path analysis: A beginner's tour guide. This book is an excellent read, and a must have for researchers and statisticians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, after a long time","review":"Listening to the compositions, I was pleasantly surprised to notice the depth of the understanding on the part of the performer. My initial reaction, when I picked the CD, was more of \\"let's see how another of those so-called Indian classical musician performs\\". Once I started listening, though, I realized that I could be listening to one of future superstars. The choice of Ragas was excellent, the accompanying beat was carefully selected and the performance was eclectic. Dr. Sharma, is not only a theoretical musician with a degree but also has magical fingers. She breathed life into a purely mathematical composition. Usually I judge a piece of music by the fact that how soon and how often does it make me close my eyes and think of those beautiful places where I want to be. This piece had an almost immediate effect on me in that regard.

Try to get it off within a day; less is better.- To reduce the chance of paint bleeding under the edge, run you fingertip or fingernail along the edge to press it down tight.- Peel it off slowly and off to one side. It's more likely to tear if pulled off fast or straight.The negatives:- it tears easier than it should because the tape is too thin.- the longer its left on, the more it sticks, and so, the more likely it will damage the surface it was stuck to. You really don't want to leave this tape on for more than a day.Summary:Blue Tape works OK if you're careful..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint Bleeds, Rough Edges and Tears on an angle.","review":"Very disappointed with this tape. I just painted a room and the tape left a rough edge not a clean line as I was expecting. 3M says this will leave a Sharp Line but I have never seen that, I always see a rough edge. The bigger problem is that I taped along an edge where the tile meets the wall and apparently the tape didn't stick real well as the paint bled underneath in spots and onto the tile/wall interface. Now I have to go back and either scrape the paint off or caulk over it. And this is supposed to be a Multi-Surface tape. I could have done a better job using a wet rag (it was latex paint) and just wiping any spots where there shouldn't have been paint.I would not recommend this tape and I have been painting for over 40 years and have used many different tapes and this is one that I regret using."},{"rating":"1","title":"old stock","review":"The tape arrived and it appears that it was older tape stock.Kind of dry and not the freshest tape stock.

Olympus branded SmartMedia allows you to take \\"panorama\\" shots. Essentially, you take multiple shots while making sure to overlap edges. You then reassemble these multiple shots using the \\"Camedia\\" software that came with your Olympus camera. The difference is that when an Olympus brand SmartMedia card is used, your digital camera keeps exposure settings constant across these multiple shots; which makes for a consistent panorama when you reassemble the individual shots via your computer.This is a nice feature, but not a feature most of us use often. If you are going to purchase multiple SmartMedia cards, you might be able to do with just one or two Olympus brand cards - especially since they cost more than other brands. I use two 32Mb other brand cards, and save my two 8Mb Olympus brand cards for when panorama shots present (since you can switch the cards out at anytime - unlike traditional camera film)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable and the prints look great","review":"I am a wedding videographer and I've been using these discs with an HP Photosmart D5360 printer for several months.

They are from Taiwan, not Japan or Singapore. I have tried four discs and three have been coasters. They record and finalize as you would expect, but freeze up on playback. They should be avoided. I suspect that Verbatim has now farmed production of them out to some inferior manufacturer and this is the result. Over the years the only disc I have found to be consistantly top of the line is TYuden from Japan.

But did they have to continually focus on the harshness of life. Thousands of elephants make it across the desert, alive. Yet they focus on the one that is killed. Same thing with the other species. More camera time seems to be devoted to showing one animal hunting and kill another than on the glory and continuance of life. The grand story is really that of survival -- not of \\"battles\\" and killing.Do animals kill other animals to survive? Of course they do. We KNOW that.

They essentially trimmed down the nature shots so it can be seen as a film, and added James Earl Jones as the narrator.Because this is a slimmer Planet Earth, the shots are still phenomenal.

I love James Earl Jones as a narrator, but the script is lame.Reasons to BUY BBC's Planet Earth instead:1. Covers much more amazing footage in addition to almost all the same footage in Disney's \\"Earth\\"2. Covers the same animal stories, just not as depressing as Disney's version (more kid friendly)3.

I also thought the narration left something to be desired.

The baby elephant is dehydrated and near dying, will he make it to the water hole?It was horrible that we watched it with my 4-year-old. The only part he liked were the amazing footage of the waterfalls where it feels like you're going over.

It took a few days to start growing (no big deal), but then it really did not grow well after that.

Now, I read almost a book a day but when I got to the end of the book I was furious with the author. I have read many of her books and I would rate most of them 5 star but this book 1 star seems to much. If she was going to have such a bad ending it seemes to me that she should write a fourth book having a happy ending. And Mrs.pierce if you ever read this its nothing personal but my opinion is this books ending was the worst ending I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the story...although a bad ending!","review":"I just read the trilogy...in a matter of days...The story was perfect...in the first two books that is. This one seemed it wasn't written as strongly because the author just wanted to dop it...and I agree with most of the reviews...this ending bites! Poor Irrylth...is that spelled right? Ahem...I like most wanted a freaking happy ending...You know a fourth book would be cool...you know...Irrylth did say she would free Ariel from her enchantment...hey why not? His turn now! Come on!

Aeriel must claim both her destiny (unraveling the Ravenna's mystery) and her husband's love or her entire world will end. Emotionally powerful as it is stunningly beautiful in its deceptively simple gothic and dream-like imagery, the conclusion to the Darkangel Trilogy is just as strong as its predecessors and cements this as one of the greatest series of the fantasy genre. Grade: A"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crestfallen","review":"I'll start out by saying the Darkangel Trilogy is fantastic.The first two had me completely entranced, as did this third one. But the first time I read the ending to this book, I cried. I hated the book, the series, everything about it. It took my a while to get over it and finally about a year later, I started thinking rationally again. Maybe I over reacted and the ending, though sad, had it's point. So I went back and read it again. To my surprise, I had the same reaction, this second time as I did the first. I was completely unsatisfied.I'm a reader who does not need a faerie tale ending to everything, but there were so many other options for the end that would have made it better, if not 'happily ever after,' that I must say it is unexcusable. It was as if the author got bored and decided to wrap things up as quickly as possible rather than think it out. It's too bad there was such an ending to a remarkable series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing ending!","review":"While I loved the first two books and waited forever for this last book, the ending absolutely ruined the book for me. Ms. Pierce seemed like she was trying to be \\"deep\\" with her ending, but it was baffling, completely unsatisfying, and very weak. She didn't have to write a 100% happy ending, but I expected some satisfaction & fulfillment and received only frustration. Aeriel completely acted out-of-character: she worked so hard to free her Dark-angel and have his love, only to nonchalantly hand him over to his annoying cousin! Though I hated the ending, Ms. Pierce did create a remarkable and inventive universe with her first 2 books (the 2 stars are for her first two books)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl of the Soul of the World","review":"A little confusing, the book starts out with a Nameless Girl suffering from chronic pain that keeps her from remembering or even speaking. There aren't many clues as to the identity of the girl, so the revelation of just who this character is, is rather pleasing.In the third installment of the Darkangel Trilogy, the readers get to see the war between the Lorelei and the mortals played out. The moment we've been waiting for. The triumph will belong to whom? There's also a special little task that the lovable heroine must undergo that will determine the success or failure of the war for the mortals.Sometimes a little hard to follow, but still very worth it in the end, even though I wasn't too satisfied with the ending, I was still content with the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"Well i agree with most of the readers out there...like others i loved the DarkAngel and Gathering of Gargoyles...how i became upon them was weird i just picked it up off the shelf in the library and read im glad i did...they were the best books i have ever read but the ending of the third one disappointed me..i want a sequel to this book because i wanna know what happens...i loved her adventures...and i want more like other readers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl of the soul of the world","review":"I loved this book.

Thing is, I wish I never did start. Okay, so she gets married, it seemed as though nothing happened at all emotionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected ending","review":"I was entranced when I first read \\"The Darkangel.\\" Just like her Firebringer Trilogy, I found M.A. Pierce's style to be delightful and engrossing. I found myself honestly caring about Aeriel, Irrylath the Darkangel, the gargoyles and even the wraiths. In \\"A Gathering of Gargolyes\\" I delighted in the knowledge that Aeriel wasn't just a lowly slave, and found myself honestly hoping Aeriel and Irrylath would find a way to work it all out. Then, in \\"The Pearl of the Soul of the World,\\" I felt it all building toward what I hoped would be a satisfying conclusion. Nope. I'm crestfallen and saddened. A beautiful series... but I think I should have stopped reading at the end of Chapter 14 (\\"Flood\\"). If M.A. Pierce was trying to impart a message (i.e. \\"We have to sacrifice for the greater good\\") she could have saved the trouble. Why not have a lon shuttle Aeriel to Avaric daily? Conjugal visits complete with saving the world. Disappointing ending to a lovely trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What? That's It? :)","review":"The ending to the spellbinding and eautifully spun Darkangel trilogy, the end left me begging for more. There were so many things that could have happened, and so many ideas that such a blunt finish sparks. It leaves me begging for more. Aeriel completes her mission, but, as Ravenna said, loses what was most precious to her. The irony of the story was so moving; I loved and hated this last book at the same time. Why? It was an ending written so wonderfully and sadly. In my opinion, I know Aeriel must stick to her decision, but... Oh! If you want a happy ending, go somewhere else. But, it's truly a beautiful and heartbreaking end to such a masterpeice by the wonderfully talented Ms. Peirce. Is it really the end of such a wonderful tale? Say it isn't so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't care that it's a trilogy","review":"I loved this book and all the other books in this trilogy. I first read this book and the other two in the trilogy when I was in seventh-grade and I adored it. Now over five years later, I reread it and I still love it. My problem with the book is that the ending left me unsatisfied. It was a very powerful ending but like all the other people out there I was hoping for a happy ending. I was upset when there was not one, but I think that a sequel for this book could be easily written furthering Aerial's adventures. She has a lot of work ahead of her and I wouldn't mind reading more of what happens to her. I believe that after all she went through she deserves to be happy. Ms. Pierce I really hope that you write a sequel to this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ADMIT IT, I CRIED SO HARD","review":"ARrrgh! This was such a good book. But the ending was too sad. I was crying. I wanted Irrylath and Aeriel to be together. I wanted Irrylath to really love Aeriel. I didn't want SAbr to have him. I will die if Ms. Pierce does not write some sequel to this. I know this is only supposed to be a trilogy, but still. Bravo on Ms. Pierce for producing a masterpiece. I've gotten my siblings to read it, and they love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, doesn't live up to the other two...","review":"I would have listed this at 1 star, but I am still fond of her writing style, even if this particular book lacked the sparkle of the first two.The conclusion was woefully unsatisfying, but not because it's sad, because it doesn't actually bring everything together. It feels rushed and there's a heavy-handed \\"be kind to the earth\\" motif that wasn't there in the first two books and the amazing mythology she'd created is tossed aside for a jumble.I do like surprises and twists in books, but not these kinds of twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautiful story with a let down ending!","review":"After reading Pierce's first two books I was enthralled beyond beliefe. It was disapointing how long it took for her to write the third book, but then reading how she ended this wonderfully written story I was sad and angry.I would be definately sugest reading the first 2 books, but unless you like horrible endings I would not suggest reading the third book.

Nothing fresh about it, just the same old \\"meet cute\\" between Annie and the cop (who is waaaayy too good for her!), with a half-million F-bombs thrown in. The women who appear in the movie are good actresses, but the all-too-predictable story stinks. I'm sorry I wasted my money buying it, but so many reviewers said it was hilarious. Very, very disappointing and I do not recommend it.

Did they write glowing reviews on the promise of getting their money back??Rather than showing that \\"women can do comedy\\", Bridesmaids instead ends up saying \\"women comedians can be as gross as men...but not as funny.\\" It was the movie let-down of 2011 for us. The unsympathetic characters leave you with no one to root for, adrift for 2 hours waiting for it to end. There were long stretches that were more painful than funny, and it jumped from storyline to storyline with little coherence at all. That said, it does have a few funny quips that I am sure can be gleaned from imdb.com without giving up $4 or 2 hours of your life.We've watched The Hangover 3 times, and laughed our butts off each time.

We couldn't stop laughing at The Hangover, with Bridesmaids, we couldn't start laughing. There were very few moments that made us actually chuckle out loud, and even fewer that were not predictable as to what the joke was, and fewer still that didn't overstay their welcome on screen.

Also hyped as a female version of the Hangover--its not even close. First all of--Hangover actually had some humor in it. For bridesmaids, I think virtually all the jokes were in the trailers. The remainder is about 1 hour and 55 minutes of torture/gross out humor. Its not a freaks and geeks vibe, despite being directed by Paul Feig.I have no idea why it was such a big hit. I am at a complete loss. I suppose seeing people have food poisoning all over themselves is not my idea of comedy. If that is appealing for you, then go for it.minor spoilersAs I said, Melissa McCarthy was great but too small of a role. Wendi McLendon-Covey was hilarious and probably was on screen for less than 10 minutes. Weird film, not as advertised, and pray for no sequel.

I decided to have a mental checklist of what disguisting things they would do in hopes to make a joke. 1. Fart Jokes 2. Butt Jokes 3. Disgusting Sex Jokes, etc...etc.Everytime they did one, I checked it off.I didn't actually laugh until the Rudolph character falls in the street in her wedding dress....That is halfway through the movie.

Perhaps if your idea of a good time is something akin to Sleepless in Seattle or Leap Year, then yes this is an excellent film. The only redeeming factor is Melissa McCarthy, however her role isn't big enough to make this a funny movie. They build up so much to this party in Vegas, and **Spoiler** they don't even get there.

But we thought the funniest person was Melissa McCarthy as Megan! Not to mention Maya Rudolph is a funny, great actress as well. Both of us honestly thought this was funnier than The Hangover.

Why any body would compare the Hangover to BridesMaids is beyond my understanding.So if you saw the Hangover, you know it's just incredible and mostly unbelievable situations that are just to funny to be real.

I had heard so much about the gross-out humor, and 'women behaving badly' themes, that I was expecting this to almost be a female Hangover. But it's not at all - the core story is much more soulful, and it's really a kind of romantic comedy, but the focus is on Kristin Wiig's character, as opposed to a man. It's a nice counterbalance to all the male-centric movies out there. There is one gross-out scene, and I did wince and cover my eyes at that, but some people like that humor, and so why not have women doing it for a change (we have bodily functions too after all!!) All of the female leads were outstanding, and the 'real-life' friendship between Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig shines through as the centerpiece of the plot in this one. And for what it's worth, my husband liked it too - it's not just a chick flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cast Turns Mediocre Film Into Exceptional Film","review":"While the film is definitely funny, it doesn't have very many memorable moments that will stay with you long after you've watched it. It also didn't live up to the crazy hype it got due to both unfleshed character subplots and unexplored setting expansion. Still a great film and deserving of a solid 4 *'s out of 5, or 8 *'s out of 10.More detailed review at [...] or [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridesmaids","review":"What a let down! This movie was so talked up but there was only 1-2 funny bits in it the rest was crap, waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make it through the first half - horrible.","review":"This was one of those rare films that made me cringe in sympathy for the actresses involved. I can think of several recent examples of over-the-top slapstick that were infinitely better than this - Elf and The Hangover come to mind. This just never attained a level of plausibility to make it worth 90+ minutes of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny? Not in my book","review":"I tried watching this, but I ended up turning it off after about halfway through. I found very little that struck me as humorous. Maybe the really good parts were still coming, but I was so bored with the storyline that I couldn't take it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't stop laughing.","review":"I saw this in the theater and couldn't stop laughing. I bought it for my mother so she could get a good laugh herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brides Maids","review":"Brides Maids is the funniest movie I've seen this year 2011 I seen it at the movie theater and laughed the whole time, so when it came on sale Black Friday I had to buy it. The movie as a whole is great and I just love Kristin Wig and Maya Rudolph from SNL, but for me Melissa McCarthy stole the show she did great work which made the movie even better. I would recomend this movie for anyone men and women alike it is not just a chick flick the movie is hilarious and would be for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Movie with a great cast","review":"This movie is very funny and somewhat naughty. To compare it to The Hangover is doing it a disservice. This movie stands on its own and I found it to be very enjoyable. Not your mothers Chick Flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for Bridesmaids!","review":"I'm surprised to find this movie not rated close to 5 stars. This is an awesome movie that proves girls can do comedy the way guys do it! I'm tired of the cliche genre of comedies that is only approved for the female gender- romantic-comedies, ones where the mom switch places with the daughter, BFFs fighting over something or other. Why is raunchy humor reserved for guys?!Anyway, I found this film to be a boundary-defying film full of hilarious, awkward moments and girl issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridesmaids (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)","review":"I heard that Bridesmaids (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging) was a very funny movie.

I couldn't say it was the best I've seen, but it sure did hit the funny bone at many points.

It really clicked with my friends. I think everyone has been in a position like that at some point in their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melissa McCarthy deserves an Oscar nomination","review":"Bridesamaids definitely does not live up to all the hype. There were a few scenes that were painful to watch: the scenes with Annie and her f-buddy, the engagement party scene where Helen and Annie were trying to \\"outfriend\\" each other, the wedding scene at the end where Wilson Phillips was singing. Lillian outgrew Annie a long time ago and I think the movie would have been more realistic if they'd realized that and Annie was not part of the wedding at the end. But Melissa McCarthy was totally awesome. Every scene that she was in was perfect. I didn't like the movie, but I watched it twice just to see Melissa in action. I would have rated this movie one star, but I gave it an extra star because of Melissa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Movie","review":"I had no idea that this movie would be so funny when I bought tickets to see it. To be honest, I thought that I was just going to see another cheesy chick flick (of the 27 Dresses, Bride Wars variety). But this movie was truly different. My stomach hurt, I laughed so much! Go see this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like Hangover for the ladies!","review":"So yeah.... this was definitely a \\"Chick-Flick\\" and of course had it's gushy, sappy, drawn out areas but there were some seriously hilarious parts as well...my boyfriend and I haven't laughed this much at a movie in a while.

It is a raunchy chick-flick that you have to love!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"With the great reviews this movie received I was so excited to see it so I pre-ordered the DVD. I was so disappointed in the entire movie... the cast (except for Melissa McCarthy) were not funny, the characters were not funny and the story was not funny! I kept thinking when is it going to get going... well it never did. The funniest lines/scenes were shown in the commercials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is most likely the least funny movie I have ever seen. Save your money. And your time.I love HUMOR. Of all types. Including modern extreme humor.This movie simply isn't funny. It relies on the \\"humor\\" of idiocy, self-indulgence, and emotional disturbance."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen","review":"And I've seen a LOT of movies. Crass, raunchy, and vulgar most of the time; bone-crushingly predictable all of the time. I actually felt sorry for the actresses in the bridesmaid roles; they want to be stars so badly they were willing to subject themselves to the humiliation of a terrible script and degrading physical stunts. Sometimes that kind of \\"humor\\" may actually be funny if it's handled skillfully and not overdone, but this movie tries way too hard, and it shows. No subtlety whatsoever. What a disappointment -- I'd heard so much about this movie and really wanted to see it. From the opening scene on, it's really nothing but meaningless sex, bodily functions, and profanity, with a few pratfalls here and there. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond bad","review":"This movie is horrible. If your idea of funny is several women in one room having noisy diarrhea, then this is your movie. Nothing saves this movie. I rented it from Redbox for a dollar and still paid too much to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did the reviewers see in this movie?","review":"I saw the reviews on Amazon, 3 of 5. But I read a several \\"best of 2011\\" articles where critics listed Bridesmaids as one of the funniest movies of the year.What kind of crack where they smoking when they watched it?There are a few funny parts but over all it's just excruciating. The main character, Annie, is not sympathetic at all and without that the movie has really nothing going for it.skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful and Unfunny","review":"I love all kinds of movies. I rarely meet a movie I don't find something I enjoy about it. Not Bridesmaids. The characters are completely unlikeable, most especially the main character. Comic moments are very few and very far between, to the point of being almost non-existent. Segments that aren't at all funny to begin with drag on and on to the point of complete embarrassment. Too many segments of this film are actually painful to watch. In the real world, when the main character gets tossed off the plane, she would end up in prison, and rightfully so. Most of her shenanigans are so mean-spirited and awful that one cannot understand how her best friend, or her potential new boyfriend, could forgive her. Ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye $3.99 - you could have been a sandwich.","review":"Bad things happening to people with no comic relief is simply bad script writing and makes for a really bad movie. It's like spending the last $3.99 I have in my pocket to see a movie and picking BRIDEMAIDS. It's bad luck but not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"-1 Star. Another awful SNL movie.","review":"Kristen Wiig simply doesn't have what it takes to be a movie actress. She was very funny in some of her earlier work with SNL, but now she's just stupid.Maya Rudolph is also really bad in this movie. Maya used to be funny, but now she acts like she's a hottie and that's very weird because she is quite ugly.I kept skipping thru it for what seemed like forever and the movie was still not even close to ending. It's over two hours long.Something that made no sense to me about this movie was all the british people or actors playing british people in the movie. Did that add anything? NO!This movie is very similar to the ones with Jason Sudeikis in them. Maybe they have fun making the movies, but I certainly had no fun watching them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Not Funny!","review":"I'm a woman and could not stop laughing at Superbad or Hangover, so it's not as if I don't have a funny bone. Unfortunately for me, this movie totally missed the marked. It was a total disappointment, especially after all the glowing reviews. There were gross moments but not funny at all and the women characters had no chemistry amongst them. I found the women characters covered the range of pathetic women stereotypes and did not seem genuine. I'd expect this kind of writing from male writers but disappointed from female writers.I know this is not Shakespeare and was not looking for that, but even as an escapist comedy, the sad fact was the movie was not funny! I had to fast forward parts of the DVD as I was so bored, but since I paid for it, felt like I should finish watching it. The best part of the movie involves the guy cop (actor from IT Crowd), he was funny and seemed a genuine character. That's the only thing I liked about this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOK ELSE WHERE FOR ENTERTAINMENT","review":"I missed this in the cinemas, just saw it on blu ray, this has had terriffic reviews in the media and from people who have seen it. I must say i dont know why, it just dragged on. I just couldnt get into it, as a chick flick is was unconvincing, sure as hell was not funny (meant to be a comedy), most of it is boring and uncomfortable to watch. save your time and money on a better film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I have to give this thing a star??","review":"I was thinking that there weren't enough truly raunchy films for women and then this gem came along. Problem solved. Not funny at all. I can't think of a single redeeming quality. I saw this in the theater and would have walked out if I hadn't been with so many friends. I still regret not leaving."},{"rating":"1","title":"People Have a Warped Sense of Funny","review":"I got Bridesmaids as a free rental from a video store. I'm glad it was free, because I would hate to have paid for this piece of tripe! I only watched the first fifteen or twenty minutes of this abomination to good comedy writing. It was all I could stand. And I'm no prude. I've seen some raunchy movies that were pretty funny, but this was so grossly over the top, it was unwatchable. I watch SNL and to me Kristen Wiig is over-rated. I just do not find her funny. And poor Jill Clayburgh, this was a terrible last memory of good actress. It's too bad this generation never got to experience the really good comedy writing of the past. If they had, I doubt there would be so many five-star reviews for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny at all","review":"This movie was terrible. I expected a group of funny women getting crazy and having an adventure, it is called Bridesmaids after all. Instead I got a movie about one pathetic unlikable woman who is too jealous and possessive of her friend and manages to act like an idiot at every turn. I can't believe people compared this to the Hangover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"I laughed throughout this hysterical movie featuring funny girl Kristin Wiig as the maid of honor struggling to support her best friend despite one debacle after another. Wiig is delightful as the sympathetic main character, Maya Rudolph is fabulous as the bride, and Rose Byrne delivers a brilliant performance as the obnoxious Miss Perfect who undermines the maid of honor, but Melissa McCarthy absolutely steals the show as the uncouth sister of the groom.There were times that the movie relied too much on crass humor for my tastes, but overall I loved this laugh out loud movie that easily made me forget all of my own petty worries for 125 whole minutes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageous and very very funny","review":"I can't remember laughing this hard during a movie in years. You will love the dialogue and crazy situations that the characters are in. Kristen Wiig is a gifted comic and carries the entire movie. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, but if your buying this blu-ray for the digital copy, dont do it.","review":"I bought this copy of bridesmaids for two reasons, for the blu-ray and for the digital copy. When i opened the package today, the digital copy was expired.Love the movie, but if part of the package doesnt work anymore, i think amazon should state that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I really enjoy this movie. My daughter and I watch it whenever we need a laugh. The movie is very quotable and perfect for a girls night! I have even made my husband watch it after he couldn't figure out what my daughter and I were quoting. He even enjoyed it though he felt it was dull in a few spots. It does have a story line which pulls away from humor, but overall a great movie!

I know she won't win one, but I will go to my grave believing that Melissa McCarthy (from Mike and Molly fame), deserves an Oscar for her performance.

Female insecurity showcased with lots, of shopping, eating, swearing and girlfriend breakups.(2.) Women pursuing the perfect marriage but ending up feeling trapped; multiple examples.(3.) Implied sex scenes revealing that it's not uncommon for it not living up to the girl fantasy.(4.) Female mutual jealousy and competitive envy cat fights.(5.) Female bipolar/manic depression alternating between hysterical and slovenly episodes.(6.) Whether showing women social drinking or individually it was all formula stereotypical.Basically, just dumb jokes and even dumber slapstick. It is a bit of a concern that a significant number of Americans look forward to these TV soap-as-film reruns. It's just another in an endless stream of LA/NY rewrites for an established audience.

Otherwise NOPE!If you don't set your expectations beyond a mid range comedy then it's ok but if you rent it with hopes to be as entertained as while watching \\"Hangover\\" then this is not even close. If you are looking for Hangover like comedy watch TOMCATS.This is written from late 20's male perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"Very, very sorry I paid good money to see this movie; the word 'stupid' is all that comes to mind. My cousin and I watched for about 30-40 minutes then couldn't take any more.

It was so bad that after the \\"funnies scene\\" I stopped watching. The scene I'm referring to is when they were on an airplane on their way to Vegas. This movie had about 1 LOL moments with about 2-3 giggles but this is through 1 1/2hrs of watching. The chemistry between the lead and others was very akward. Why people hyped this movie so much is beyond me. I love comedies and can sit through almost any of them anticipating the next laugh but it was too hard to watch this. I've even sat through movies that were bad and finished them but I couldn't pull myself to finish this. I don't recommend you even start to watch this because you'll waste time like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"This was one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.

But if you wait until everyone tells you: \\"You gotta see this move- it's hilarious!\\" you're going to be disappointed. And that was just what happened with Bridesmaids. I thought it was okay, but I didn't understand what everyone was talking about. The female version of The Hangover? I thought THAT movie was comic-gold (and that kind of proved my point- I saw it when it JUST came out in the theatres). So, if you're expecting a rip-roaring, send you into hysteric laughter...

They hype about it and the reviews all said that it was a great movie and very funny. I feel like I either saw a different movie or I saw the unfunny version, because it was far from great and not funny at all. It is being compared to the Hangover which I thought was hysterical and laughed throughout it. I just don't understand the high marks and reviews for this movie. I am usually pretty forgiving with movies as long as they entertain me, but I could not find anything worthwhile in this movie. I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone. If you are on the fence about renting it or buying it, don't do it. There are better ways to spend 2 hours and much better movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was a half star rating this is the movie for it","review":"It's a bad version or rather worse version of \\"The Hangover\\" for women...... my wife and I managed to make it to the one hour thirteen min mark and that was painful as we had hopes of it getting more funny instead of more juvenile. If your a 20 something bathroom humor kind of girl this is the movie for you. If your a guy good luck to ya buddy, BYOB. The movie suffers from a-typical humor to where you know the nextr thing that will happen like a machine gun rattling off jokes, then a total slow down where you feel the movie is supposed to generate a story, but it only does that like it generates humor - in a poorly executed way. I would rather watch Steve Martin in Father of The Bride - 500 times in a row rather than another 5 min of this uhhh movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hangover what???","review":"Hahaha...someone is really high...I mean how can you compare this to the Hangover or to anything good really!This movie was not interesting at all.

We rented this movie from Apple and downloaded it via the internet. Granted, I think we downloaded the non-rated version of this crude, crass and downright disgusting movie, but I'm not sure how much it differed from the the theater version.We watched about one-half hour of this movie, through the description of the woman's boyfriend's \\"friend\\" to the whole boring one-ups-manship of the two bridesmaids, the bridal salon where they were all picking out the bridesmaids dress, right up up to the point of the projectile vomiting and the groom's sister about to have diarrhea on the sink in the bridal salon's bathroom. Sorry, I can't critique it from there because we opted out of our $4.99 rental and said FORGET ABOUT IT.End of this story.Save your money and your sanity.

The characters were poorly developed. There was no reason for the Kristen Wiig romance side story.

I thought the writing, characters, and casting were wonderful. At the start of the movie, Kristen Wiig climbs over her friend-with-benefits electric gate. It starts to open and while straddling the top, she goes eye to eye with his rather surprised housekeeper. This sets the tone for the mishaps to come and there are many.While I liked the entire cast, Melissa McCarthy was my hands down favorite. She plays a full-figured, mega intelligent, and mighty confident woman. Her efforts to seduce the man seated next to her on a flight are unforgettable. Even in the background of other scenes, she is always engaging in some sort of funny behavior. I think she stole the movie and will look forward to seeing a lot more of her work in the future. From start to finish this movie is witty, entertaining, and upbeat. I have enjoyed watching it several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivers what it promises, but nothing more","review":"We bought this movie because we'd heard so many reviews saying it was a great comedy. Sadly, it's just a mediocre lowbrow comedy (which is fine if you know what you're getting). A few bright spots (the reconciliation cake; the TSA schtick), but most of the jokes were boringly predictable; the plot was poorly integrated and ultimately pointless. It's basically a 10 minute comedy routine padded out to movie length."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOLD!","review":"If you are a fan of Kristen Wiig's skits on SNL, you're sure to enjoy this movie. Her character as well as the rest of the cast, is hilarious. Because of some potty humor themed scenes, I would definitely consider this movie an untraditional approach to women's comedy. But don't let that scare you away! The dialog and wit of the characters more than makes up for those scenes. Besides some very silly scenes that will make you smile, there is more depth to this movie because of some honest character development in the women. One theme in particular that stood out to me, *spoiler?* was that one of the characters struggled with low self-esteem and had a tendency to be attracted to unavailable men and sabotage relationships with good men. This is a realistic situation that is not addressed in many movies, and I think it is good for young women to have some insight into this behavior if they are stuck in the same low self-esteem rut."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hour SNL skit that won't quit","review":"I'd heard such wonderful things about this movie that I jumped at the chance to rent it for only .99 through Amazon's Video on Demand. About 30 minutes into it, I started to worry. The movie was advancing so slowly that it felt like a drawn out SNL skit that wouldn't end. Things did get a little better and I smiled two or three times by the end of it. If you really like Kristen Wiig or Maya Rudolph, you might enjoy this. However, as a weekly viewer of SNL, I failed to laugh out loud even once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and poignant","review":"After all the hype, I was glad to see that the film had many funny parts. However, I did not expect the story of the main character to be so poignant. I laughed and cried throughout the film. My friend observed that this film was superior to male gross-out movies. In those movies, the characters act excessively for no reason. In this film, the main character always tried to do the kind and generous thing but due to her challenging situation, things often backfired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very funny - lots of bodily fluid humor for the modern SNL viewers","review":"Watched this as a $1 rental and wanted my money back after watching it. I am not a big fan of the current saturday night live (SNL_ TV show - I just don't find it very funny. This movie is like a giant SNL sketch but with swearing. It does have a few interesting moments but nothing made me laugh. I'd suggest avoiding this unless you are a big fan of the modern day SNL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Chick Flight. This is a Grown Woman, Life Isn't Perfect, Comedy","review":"I enjoyed this movie. It had quirky characters whose lives illustrated that life isn't perfect and the stress caused by weddings exposes our flaws, reveals the fissures in changing relationships and causes a natural (but ultimately unproductive) envy from the divergent circumstances in our lives. Nicely done and very funny. If you are struggling or have struggled and want to laugh about it, this is the film for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest movies I've ever watched.","review":"You either LOVE this movie or HATE it. I happen to love it. I think this movie was incredibly funny. it is not a chick flick if that is the kind of movie you are looking for. My boyfriend thoroughly loved this movie as well. It can be raunchy at times so I would say it is more suitable for adults only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"So SO FUNNY!!!!! Great fun to watch, not just a chick flick.

Do NOT miss this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"Uninspired and plain boring for long stretches, this movie seems to think extended vomit scenes are the pinnacle of humour. and stunt driving. and running a joke into the ground austin powers 3 style.The only good thing about it was Melissa McCarthy, she was funny and genuine. Otherwise it was a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"the movie was toooooo slow","review":"so I watched the movie and I skipped half it.

Honestly, I just don't know how anyone can find this script funny or entertaining. From the very first scene it's crude and just gets worse. I watched about 20 minutes then returned it (a rental) unfinished. The only thing worse than the fact that writers write this kind of garbage and that actors think they are doing something creative by acting in them is that people pay money to watch this stuff. No offense to those who have given this movie a higher rating, but I cannot find anything redeeming about this kind of movie. The only thing I can say in its behalf is, it isn't alone out there in the garbage heap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"It's really hard to get into a movie when the lead character has zero redeeming qualities. This whole movie was just terrible. It never even felt like it got started. Don't waist your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the trailer, it has all the good parts","review":"Cannot begin to explain how bad this movie is. What astonished me is Ebert, NY Times and so many gave it high praise. The movie plods slowly, is not that well acted and you keep waiting for it to pick up. It is nothing like the trailer makes it out to be, a Hangover movie for/about women. The puke scene is just gross and sad and on and on. I really have not come across a movie that was so well received when in fact it was really awful.If you watch the trailer and a few clips, really that is all the good parts right there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridesmaids","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie.

Totally unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"We're the minority - hubby & I barely laughed","review":"After hearing friends repeatedly gush over how hilarious this movie was, I was very excited to finally rent the movie after patiently waiting several sold-out weekends at the rental kiosk. I was sadly disappointed.We found scenes either cheesy or pitiful (granted, she was depressed, alright). Laughed at loud at the bridal store scene & speed-trapping with the cop. I found the airplane & meltdown scene very cringe-worthy, not funny at all. The best part of the movie was the cop - he was well-written, even my husband liked him as a hero.Thank goodness I rented it for $1. Had more laughs with The Change-Up, the next movie we popped in after this one. And I was disappointed that they did not wear the dresses that's on the DVD cover - at least not on the DVD (theatrical) version that we rented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Do it","review":"If you are a guy, dont let your girl talk you into this one.She said \\"it has funny parts\\" but dont get suckered in.It might be a good movie for girls but it is brutal for most guys to sit through if they are anything like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"brides maids good movie!","review":"i got this as a black friday deal so i got it really cheap! let me tell you.

We rented Bridesmaids on Comcast OnDemand, wasted $5.99 and a half an hour, before we turned it off.

Bridesmaids is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unfulfilled","review":"I was hoping that this movie would be funny as the previews had some good lines, but am disappointed. The movie does have a couple good one liners, but they are stretched between painfully whiny dialogue that goes on forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy did that suck","review":"My wife so this in the theater and walked out halfway through but figured after all the good reviews maybe she missed something so we rented it for me to see for the first time and her to give another shot. She was so right the first time. This movie is terrible. It has a few funny parts and yes Melissa McCarthy is great but the rest of the cast just isn't funny and the movie is awkward and flat for the majority of the film. I don't understand for the life of me what the hype was about. Awful, awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"I can't belive this movie got rave reviews. I kept hoping during the movie I would laugh but sadly it didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"simply put, this movie was horrible and a real chore to sit thru.

Have to say not as funny as preview leads you to believe & just so predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best parts were shown in the previews...","review":"Everyone that I knew who saw this movie said it was hilarious. The reviews compared it to The Hangover. Talk about a waste of time. This movie is not even in the same league as the Hangover. All of the funny scenes were shown in the previews. I'm glad I borrowed this movie from a friend instead of wasting $25 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude and not funny","review":"This movie is 2 hours and 40 minutes long.

You might wince once or twice. You might gasp at the burlesque. No matter. You WILL love this flick and you will laugh until you can cry no more.Spoiler; BIG GAL Molly, steals the show while Wiig RULES! This pre-marriage six-ring circus romp REALLY pleases.The Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy triple pack is a genuine bargain and offers up 4 hours of true immersion.Like the cult fav, \\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\\", this is a movie you will watch again and again and... well, a lot.Wiig has re-discovered the funny bone and made a chick flick that guys absolutely MUST see.Can hardly wait for the sequel. There WILL be one. There simply has to be one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like potty humor...","review":"If you like potty humor, bad acting and a script that sounds like it could have been written by a pubescent 12 year old, this movie is for you. We gave this half an hour and through the sex, bathroom humor (that wasn't even funny) and bad acting we could find no reason to waste any more time. Painfully bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE movie!","review":"Pretty much everyone I know raves about this movie, and after finally seeing it for myself, the only thing I can safely conclude is that pretty much everyone I know has god-awful taste in movies. \\"Bridesmaids\\" is AWFUL! There are a few...A FEW funny lines/ moments, but they are few and far between. The film is mostly gross humor, which I hate, and most of the characters are vain and self-absorbed and I absolutely hated all of them. What bothers me the most is that Melissa McCarthy received an Oscar nomination for taking a dump in a bathroom sink. That just goes to show how far the Academy's standards have fallen. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the previews","review":"I didn't like this movie. The part where the girls eat at the restaurant, go try on dresses and they all get sick wasn't funny at all. Food poisoning is serious stuff.

The pacing is off, the main character unlikeable, and the story was dull. My wife and I were disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Fell into the hype surrounding this movie and went in expecting it to be along the lines of Wedding Crashers or an instant classic like Old School. I was mistaken and there is almost nothing in this movie that is funny or that hasn't been seen on SNL. Hugely disappointing especially when they were heading to Las Vegas...at that point in the movie I had expected it would pick up and actually be worthwhile, but all we get is a somber bus trip back to Chicago...complete dud of a movie. Really? Females vomitting???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked","review":"In my opinion i think this movie sucked so bad.

Perhaps if they focused the movie on the bridesmaids (especially the great Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper, who are fantastic actresses with way too little screen time in this movie) it would've been funny. Honestly, I don't think I laughed, or at least smirked, once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Time, Money or Brain Cells","review":"I am fortunate that I neither rented nor purchased this movie. A friend lent me their DVD telling me it was hilarious. This must be why we don't go to movies together.I made it to the \\"engagement toast\\" scene about 15 minutes into the movie. Watched through the first toasts by each of the two women. Then the first headed back up to the stage clearly intending to \\"one up\\" her rival and I turned it off knowing what was coming.Its an old fashioned word, but the word that came to mind watching this movie was \\"smutty\\" so I just didn't care to go on with it. Do not waste your time - watch paint dry or grass grow or just about anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I turned it off!","review":"I enjoyed The Hangover and, despite being a 30-something woman, prefer stupid humor over romantic comedies. This film was a disappointment. Kristin Wiig's character wasn't likeable and sympathetic, just annoying.There's a scene in which they all (but one) suffer from food poisoning and need the bathroom at the same time. One woman defecates in the bathroom sink while two others tag-team vomit the toilet. It is overly graphic. I ejected the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brides Maids","review":"This is the Worst film of 2011. Why anybody would enjoy watching women defecating and vomiting is beside me.

The only part of this film that was even remotely humorous was the scene where she's cruising by the cop car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie ever","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever watched. I sat through the whole thing, for some strange reason, thinking the the humor would be just around the corner. Never happened, the whining only continued to get worse. For those who found humor in this, please tell me what part I missed!!I cannot believe this is what humor has become (please take me back to the past). I should have known that this was a real loser given that it was from the producer of Superbad, Knocked up and the 40 year old virgin. I thought about sending this back, but I was afraid someone else might end up with it.I would have given this no stars if it was available."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie","review":"good movie. only got to see some of it, but what I seen was good. it came fast with super saver shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!!","review":"This is one of the funniest movies of all time!!!

Lots of comedic talent in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward and painful!","review":"I've heard great things about this movie from friends and finally found the time to watch it. Overall, I found it awkward and painful to watch. I love a good comedy, but this was surprisingly awful. The only redeeming characters were the Irish? Scottish? (hard to place the accent) state cop and the strangely likeable sister-of-the-groom. The main character (Kristen Wiig) was overly pathetic/insecure and her bride-to-be friend (Maya Rudolph) weak and spineless with little care for her supposedly BFF's financial struggles and emotional issues. I really love Kristin Wiig and Maya Rudolph from SNL days, but this vehicle didn't do either of them justice. I see lots of positive reviews for this movie and looked forward to watching it. In hindsight, I regret the 2+ hours I will never get back. This is just a barely mediocre movie with some really awkward scenes complete with disgusting vomit, fart and poop jokes. Barely rates 1 star in my opinion. In a word - Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"Movie was not good. Stupid jokes, very little actual comedy. Don't waste precious hours of your life watching this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo funny!","review":"My husband and I saw this in the theatre and we have been waiting for it to come out on DVD. We laughed so hard tears were streaming down our faces! I always read the 1 star reviews out of curiosity. Hmmm- well, not everyone has a sense of humor. If you have a weak stomach- turn away in the bridal salon and don't drink too much while watching this movie or you might wee yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny from the start - lags a little bit but enjoyable overall","review":"As a woman with many male friends throughout my life (some with benefits) this made me laugh out loud many times. It loses its focus at some point like a winding road with a few pointless forks but it somehow manages to get you to the destination with a smile. Bring your open mind a little bit for this one, but once you do, you will def see yourself in at least one scene. Light-hearted romp with some off-beat touches, great for a date movie to see if your girl has any sense of humor at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"I heard good reviews on this movie so I did the redbox thing. What a surprize!Starts off like a chick flick but turns into a decent comedy with a strong message.This is not a slapstick comedy but has subtle humor that keeps you entertained.I also enjoyed the strenght of a \\"true friendship\\" displayed by the bride to be and her \\"best friend\\".

Judd Apatow should be put away and not be allowed to make any more movies. I only watched it to see Rose Byrne, but even she couldn't help it. Unfunny. Slow. Crass. Dimwitted. Predictable. Rude.

This movie got great reviews (Rotten Tomatoes) but in reality, it's a disconnected festival of idiotic writing and boredom. There are a few minor laughs but they don't carry the film. What's left is a trite sketch of a story involving amazingly one-dimensional characters. If you're looking for something like Knocked Up, The Hangover, or Superbad, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Sad","review":"Amazon does not give the option to give minus points. I give the movie a -5 stars. How anyone could think this film was funny should be in therapy. There was nothing funny about watching someone having a meltdown. There was no cohesive plot and the actors were horrible at their craft. Can I have my money back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"So this review is about the actual DVD I received, not the movie itself. Once I got about halfway through the movie, the picture pretty much just stopped and the audio started skipping around.

As a first-date movie, it would be disastrous. Who could possibly be the intended audience for this disappointing movie? The humor is not of the type that appeals to the women I know. The men I know would only watch it under duress, although some of them might ultimately appreciate this kind of humor.As for me, this decidedly unfunny movie was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"After reading some great reviews of this movie, I was really looking forward to watching it.

We kept waiting for it to get funny, and unfortunately it did not. There were a few scenes here and there that were moderately amusing, but for the most part, it just simply wasn't.

After 20 minutes we couldn't take it any more and turned it off. This is NOT a family movie. The first 5 minutes is a sex scene, which is not at all what we were expecting, based on the trailers. The dialog is terrible, foul, and mostly sex related. Real women don't talk that way, especially at an engagement party. Our daughter watched the whole thing, and she didn't like it either. The only thing she found funny was the wedding dress scene, where the bride looked like a puff ball. The humor, when you can find it, is the sort of stuff high-school boys find amusing, like barfing, passing gas, and diarrhea. Worst movie we've seen in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"what laughs?","review":"this movie was not funny at all. i did not laugh at alllllll. this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life. if this is the standard of todays humor, then please take me back 20 or 30 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring AND profane!","review":"I watched this over at a friend's house. They picked the movie so I politely sat through all the bad jokes, profane dialogue, and vomit-worthy scenes. I like funny movies with female characters acting how females act--The Sweetest Thing w/Christina Applegate and Selma Blair is a great example--but this was a \\"funny\\" movie that had women acting like men.

The part where the main character poos in her wedding dress in the street, watch Spud in trainspotting where he pooed on himself.

Well, having been to several weddings and close to wedding party members I can say that these aren't too far off. In fact, I could picture many of these events occurring at anyone's wedding. I guess to fully appreciate this film, you must also know about the ins and outs of wedding planning. I actually think comparisons to \\"The Hangover\\" are unfair to this one. Maybe it was inspired from it but I found the two \\"Hangover\\" movies to be boring and unimaginative unlike this one.Also, I should note that I haven't bought a DVD in like 5-6 years because I haven't wanted any thanks to Netflix streaming.

There was a lot of crude humor and after 45 minutes, I wanted to have an intervention with these ladies, they need some help.

As on SNL, she comes across as desperate and one dimensional, hardly someone who could hang with some of the female comedic legends e.g. Gilda Radner, Lily Tomlin, or even Tina Fey and Ellen. Melissa McCarthy is the one sort-of bright spot, and even she goes beyond comedy to just plain gross in too many moments. The character development overall is lacking and the plot is predictable. How so many people rated this movie so highly I cannot fathom, but there are plenty of other films out there which try half as hard and manage to produce better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing funny about this \\"comedy\\"","review":"What a waste of $4.99!

It's free and short."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT funny, just sad & misogynistic!!","review":"I rented this movie based on the good reviews I'd heard. It was NOT funny, it was pathetic and very biased against women (at least young women). I didn't mind the grossness or lewdness, but it simply wasn't funny! And the poor best friend/maid of honor, Annie, was just an idiot. She had so little self-esteem that she was sleeping with a man who wouldn't even take her out to dinner first -- she was nothing but a \\"booty call.\\" And then the bride-to-be basically sets up poor Annie to compete against the shallow rich bitch Helen.

They fell back on these concepts, which just aren't funny to me: putting themselves down, over exaggeration, and catty humor. Sadly, this is why I find most female comedians aren't funny.

When \\"Bridesmaids\\" opened, it was an instant smash hit, it was on everyone's lips and ultimately garnered some award nominations. I figured it was going to be several cuts above the others. I watched it expecting to see something really funny. Instead what I saw was more of the same lame-brained crap.

The real treat here is the inclusion of disc 2, a great live show (tracks 1-11) from 1973 and some outtakes (son of billion dollar babies is great!).

After all these years it brings back good memories and fun times with the Alice Cooper band. You listen to it and it is like listening to Jesus Christ Superstar because it is a stage play. Alice Cooper had so much theatrics and the music was almost secondary to help carry the show. I can listen to the cd and close my eyes and imagine the stage show that went with each song.

It's all here. The schlocky horror. The sleazy sex. The shock show. Even the songs written for the stage show are interesting, although the drill sound effects in Unfinished Sweet go on a bit too long. Alice would mine the themes on this album again and again and again during a long and successful career. This is not only great hard rock, but music that continues to influence musicians to this day. Believe me, nothing like this existed before it appeared and changed just about everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Reproduction!","review":"This version of the Alice Cooper band classic album, Billion Dollar Babies is simply fantastic.The gatefold cover (complete with embossed baby's head coin on the front and back,) press out wallet photos, lyrics and band photo inner sleeve plus the famous giant billion dollar bill are all exactly how they should be. This product is the same as when the album was first released back in 1973.The vynal itself is thick and the labels are excellent reproductions.

While his argument for expenditures such as education and social services are direct and emotional, the insightful reader will be able to see why they are not feasible.

I know he will disparage anybody living near a town of more than 100,000 people, big-city people are shallow and self-absorbed in his world. Sparks' world is North Carolina and everyplace else beyond that is filler.You accept that, otherwise you don't have to read his books. And usually Sparks will temper the sappiness via something in the plot. You are not looking for real sanity or plausibility in a Sparks book, jsu some touches of credibility.But not in this book. Besides it being more sappy than any other book of his (why Jeremy loses his first wife), it seems Sparks does not like any of his characters. Plus the whole main story (what causes the lights) is given a half-baked treatment.By the end of the book I was hoping Rodney (the dim-witted police officer) takes his shotgun and shoots up the town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two StarZzzzzzzz","review":"As a Nicholas Sparks fan, I expected this book to be a page-turner similar to The Notebook. But I found it to be a great cure for my insomnia as often I'd read through two paragraphs and be soundly asleep! The character development is poor, at best. You barely grasp the personality of the main character until the very end of the book. Much time is spent describing the inner 'thoughts' of the characters, but very little time is spent on what they're actually doing. Hence, the plot moves slowly. The storyline has good bones, however. If you must read it, skim the first couple chapters and then skip to the last third of the book. You truly won't miss anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the spark?","review":"I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time.

Generally, I can expect a good, heathy cry at least a couple of times during the read. I didn't get that this time.The book is about a writer who is famous for dis-proving the reality of ghosts and mindreaders and such - and reports his findings on television...etc. He goes to a small North Carolina (what else) town to prove that their \\"cemetary ghosts\\" aren't real and falls in love with the beautiful local librarian. I guess part of the dis-connect is the somewhat lack of chemistry I feel between the two lead characters. I actually felt more chemistry between him (Jeremy) and her grandmother!

Some of us barricade ourselves in endless activity; some of us do it with continual good work for others. Some may do it with scholarly work or 'business'. And there is always someone trying to 'debunk' strongly held beliefs. Getting folks to be up front with deep feelings is not so easy -- so a 'fairy grandmother' or aunt steps in and makes it easier. So many times the choices we make in our lives have 'forever' consequences; and to be led to make the best choice available requires a helping hand. And this book has it all. I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sparks' Worst","review":"I am normally a huge Sparks fan. However, this book...well, I was disappointed. I didn't buy the love story at all.

I must admit, I have never read any of Sparks novels before, but I have seen the movies Message in a Bottle and The Notebook. Both were excellent, so I had high hopes for this book.It wasn't that the book was bad, it was just I almost felt cheated regarding the main story of the book (mysterious lights in a cemetery).All in all it flows very well, but the writing style seems more in the order of a made for TV movie than a serious work of fiction.Of course, that's just my opinion--then again, I could be wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"N. Sparks latest","review":"This book starts out with a new twist to a ghost-hunt. But the romance that builds overshadows what could remain an intriguing story. He also attempts to describe life in a small but dying southern town but his description is not especially flattering to what southern life is really like.

I wish I'd waited for paperback and not spent the hardback money."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable summer read","review":"I have always been a big fan of Nicholas Sparks. However, I haven't enjoyed his last few books as some of his older novels. I bought this book several months ago just because I always buy his books. It sat on the shelf as I read other books first. Due to some bad reviews I was hesitant to read it. I finally decided last week that I was just going to read it and get it over with. Well, I was pleasantly surprised! I finished it in 4 days, I thought it was very well written and the story was very sweet. It was a perfect summer read and fans of Nicholas Sparks will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"If you are a Sparks fan, you were probably prepared for this. I was not. The PW description seduced me into thinking it was a story about journalist investigating mysterious lights. It isn't. The lights serve only to get Our Hero to the place where he meets cliched smart beautiful librarian, so that he can ultimately embrace the charms of rural life.Now, just about every romance formula is done over and over, and if it is done well, I enjoy it over and over. I did not think this was done well. The characters were all surface; there was no apparent reason for Hero to fall for this particular woman or she for him (except that pickings are slim in a very small town). And it struck me as being purely anti-moderniist/technological -- a tiny backwater town equated with all that is good. (the concomitant bad thinks about the small town did not figure in). On the whole, I would rate this similarly to a Danielle Steele, which is negative to me but of course, in the eyes of many, a high compliment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing.","review":"I see that this book is number 2 on the bestseller list and it makes me wonder if I should ever let the \\"list\\" play a role in what I choose to read.

In short a cheap paperback romance bought at a drugstore is probably more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow but characters had great potential","review":"This was my first Sparks book and I was disappointed. The description led me to believe that the story would be about the investigation of the lights with a little romance thrown in. Instead the lights seem to have been a background story to the developing relationship of the two main characters. Although easy to read it didn't keep my interest. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen but almost felt as if I was reading the condensed version of the book and in depth details had been left out.The story line had a lot of promise but didn't seem to be developed to its full potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Pity...","review":"I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and I don't usually read any reviews before buying his books...I just buy them.

I cried reading all of his books, except this.In just within the first few chapters, I was bored. Skipped all and went right to the end. His descriptions of almost everything were boring, too plain and the characters were over reacting. Lack of substance, lack of depth.In summary, this book was a total let down and disappointing.

It took me much longer to get through than the rest and it was pretty boring. When I finished it I went back and looked through it again to see if I skipped something. This book lacked in substance and plot and really went no where. I didn't even want to finish it!

I liked most of Sparks' works, particularly \\"Eight Weeks with My Brother\\" and \\"The Rescue\\". But \\"True Believer\\" is the worst he has ever written. It is almost like listening to an old man murmuring to himself. Most of Sparks' books were based on his family or personal experiences. This time he is indeed out of his element and out of style writing a subject and characters that are not based on the familiar theme.It seems to me that the author has turned himself into a machine trying to produce books by schedule. Sadly, great literary works do not come out in this fashion. Even though I still look forward to his future better works, I cannot give a passing grade to this book. Save your money, time and frustration!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not thrilled...","review":"I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan...but this book was sooo hard to get into.

The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the ending was great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously Cranked Out on an Assembly Line","review":"Hmmm....I think Nicholas Sparks cranked this one out in a paint by numbers style. Cardboard characters, predictable plot, and every cliche in the book. Ironically, the characters of this small town are very worried that the big-city reporter, Jeremy, will portray them as stereotypical southern hicks...they should have worried about Nicholas Sparks doing that instead. All of the characters are good ol' boys who like huntin' an' fishin' or sugar sweet gals with hearts of gold and heads full of air. You've got your brash small town mayor, your not too bright sheriff's deputy, your waitress from the local truck stop, and all the usual town gossips. They eat grits and say \\"LIB\\" (Well, I'll be!). The story is totally void of any emotional depth, and the writing is amateurish, at best. Shallow, insulting to the intelligence. Definitly not Mr. Sparks best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Believer","review":"There have been several Sparks books that I've enjoyed, despite the lack of character development and the often elementary grammar and storylines. I always held out hope that he would write something more \`adult' with flowing sentences and a higher level of readability. Well, he certainly tried to do that with True Believer but, failed. I'm not a believer that this was a great story; the two characters are brought together haphazardly and without a foundation of friendship and respect. They spend a majority of their time tossing insults at one another and chasing \`ghosts' that turn out to be absolutely nothing in the end. The premise is ridiculous, and I wouldn't recommend this book. Although it's far better than some of his previous books, in terms of writing ability, the storyline now suffers and the characters just don't inspire any warmth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scientific Inaccuracies in book","review":"Jeremy Marsh, who is supposed to be a debunker of scientific myths, blatantly states one of the biggest scientific misconceptions on page 251 (paper back) when discrediting the moon as a possibility of causes the mysterious lights in the cemetery. He states that the moon's light could not have been a factor because \\"...a new moon, when the moon was hidden by the earth's shadow...\\" was present when he sees the cemetery lights. A new moon is in fact when the dark or unilluminated portion of the Moon faces directly toward Earth when the illuminated half of the Moon faces directly toward the Sun and has nothing to do with the Earth's shadow (lunar eclipse).

I just didn't connect with the characters or the subject matter.....As always, though, I will continue to read (and hopefully complete next time), everything he puts out. This book, and its sequel, are the only books of his I have never made it through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great love story!","review":"One of Nicholas Sparks best books. The plot is very interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This was the first book of his I read and it's my favorite.

It brings the story full circle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read","review":"This was a nice clean book. It had romance without a lot if sex. I wish more authors would learn to write cleaner.

A surprise twist to the book too! Wow! Recommend it to any Nicholas Sparks fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Fan","review":"I recently started reading Nicholas Sparks, and I can't get enough. My first read was Safe Haven and I was instantly hooked. Then the Guardian, and again I was very pleased. The Best of Me was my next choice very touching. Then I moved on to The Choice, oh my god I found myself crying and not beinging able to put it down. Now I'm on True Believer, and I must say another amazing read. He does it again Nicholas Sparks has a way of sucking me in, I find myself relating to his characters in such a way that even when I'm not reading the book their memory seems to linger in my thoughts. I highly recommend Nicholas Sparks novels to anyone looking for a story that makes you feel a rollercoaster of emotions, yet by the of it all you just want to keep on reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to tears","review":"I kept reading only to make sure I wasn't being impatient. Turns out I should have borrowed this book instead of purchasing. This was my first Sparks book and probably my last. The character building was pretty good, the story line weak. Big let down as far as mystery goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to Tears","review":"This was my first and LAST Sparks novel. The characters had no depth and the story was flat. I have not seen any of his Novel-turned-Movies. I read this book as part of my neighborhood Book Club selections for Nov. and was excited for the pick as I had not read any of his books before. Usually, if I start a book, I like to finish it. If it weren't for my book club, I would have happily not finished the book. I felt NOTHING for the characters. Many of my book clubbers felt the same. Even the ending was dull. I can't imagine that he wrote a sequel to this story. Yawn. NO THANKS. I get the distinct feeling he wrote this book with a Movie deal in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy","review":"Very \\"cranked out\\" feel.The editors were very sloppy too...did no one even bother to fact check this book? The main character was raised by her grandmother, a woman in her 60's when the story takes place. The main character is in her 30's. Therefore, the grandmother had to have been in her 30's when her granddaughter was born.I kept waiting for this to be mentioned in the story, that the main character was born to a teen mother, or something. However, we find out later that the main character's mother grew up, became a libarian, married, and worked \\"for years\\" at the local libary before the main character was born. The grandmother's history is also mentioned...she grows up, marries, has the protagonist's mother. Neither of them was a teen mom.But if the grandmother is only in her 60's, and the main character in her 30's, this time line is technically impossible.Were both the editors and author asleep?Given the content of this book, I wouldn't doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"This book came to me by mistake, I did not order it, but have read two other Nicholas Sparks books, so I thought, why not? I wish I had sent it back. It's very predictable and could not keep my attention even on the beaches of Mexico. Do not waste your money or time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter disappointment","review":"I always have high expectations from this author, but this book was by far his worst ever. The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, The Wedding...all wonderful! In True Believer the romance was boring, and the plot to uncover the \\"mysterious lights\\" was unsuspenseful. Sorry everyone, but Nicolas has let us down this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Sparks, Hate this book","review":"I admit, I have not yet finished the book... but only because I can't seem to excited about it. The romance in it is forced and fully spelled out. Whatever happened to letting the reader discover the characters. This book tries to force them on you. The mystery... not nearly as good as in the Guardian of Bend in the Road. Please Nicholas... go back to your basics and don't feel that you need to release a book a year. We will wait for your best. It doesn't have to make a great movie... it just needs to make us love the characters and plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicholas Sparks at his worst!!!","review":"Nicholas Sparks' latest novel is a book that I am sure you will forget as soon as you finish it. Not that this is a bad thing in this case - given the undeveloped characters, the \\"twists and turns\\" that broadcast themselves from the first chapter, and the ridiculously sappy tacked-on ending.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time - read Gilead by Marilynne Robinson, or Baker Towers by Jennifer Haigh, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable drivel","review":"I chose this book from the public library because I plan on attending a luncheon later this year where Sparks will be the guest speaker, and I have never read any of his books. I was expecting something at least good, maybe great, but all I can say is, I am glad I didn't have to pay for this trite, predictable, sophomoric excuse for a novel. Dull doesn't begin to cover it. And I thought the Twilight books were bad. Any Amazon reviewer produces more interesting reading than this rubbish. I read the first few chapters, then skipped to the end. No improvement. I might still try The Notebook, but from the library because it's free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"There was a lot of damage to the cover an some pages were riped the back cover was riped as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm still waiting...","review":"for SOMETHING to happen in this book! One of the first rules of fiction writing is to start \\"in medias res\\" in the middle of things. I'm past the middle of this book and nothing has happened that makes me want to continue. Jeremy has seen the lights, but even THAT was boring. It would be more interesting if we were in on Jeremy's research, rather than just \\"didn't find anything interesting. I want to see Lexie\\". He's reading diaries, newspaper accounts, all of which would prove interesting to his ultimage findings, but we're treated to internal agonizing about what Lexie might be thinking. Or doing, or saying, or not saying. And with Lexie, what Jeremy is thinking, doing, saying or not saying. If something doesn't happen soon, I am going to quit and put it in my donate pile. I may revise my review, but I paid for the darn book and I'm going to try to stick it out. The only thing I have to add is that Lexie is rude and unlikeable in the extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The characters are not only flat, but the little development there was made me dislike them. I just cannot understand what Jeremy sees in Lexie. To me she comes off as boring, sarcastic, aloof, fickle, and arrogant. Jeremy is insipid, avoiding and cowering from the deputy marshall and taking all of Lexie's flack. Maybe that's why he was attracted to her, but c'mon, who wants to read a book about a mealy-mouthed man falling in love with a harpy?And if the focus was supposed to be plot, I'm very sorry to hear that. Because the plot was nothing to write home about either. The conflicts were mediocre at best. Sparks had a lot of opportunities with his subject matter - he could have made it much more suspenseful and spooky, he could have played up the benefits of small-town life, he could have made his characters flawed but likeable. He totally missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Read","review":"This book seemed to just drag on and on and the two main characters just never jelled in my opinion. How does one fall in love in one week? Two such different people? Not very realistic and the interaction between them always seemed more strained then loving. In the sequel, At First Sight, this smaller book was the true ending to True Believer. The sequel should never been a book alone but the way True Believer should have ended in the first place. The abrupt ending had me saying \\"huh?\\"in the first book and the second book was more of the same for me with these two characters and I won't ruin it for those who haven't read At First Sight yet by telling the ending but the ending for me just didn't sit well. It just made the both books seem pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Nicholas Sparks Excellence!","review":"I am a big follower of all Nicholas Sparks books, I have been since his first book came out.

I kept reading thinking it has to get better and it didn't Sorry Nicholas, I will sure buy any other books he writes, But I would pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much going on in this book","review":"I have to start by saying this is the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read. I have watched Message in a Bottle and The Notebook movies, and really liked both. I thought I would give one of his books a try. I apparently picked the wrong one. This book is slow, repetitive, and there is not much going on. The \\"ghost story\\" part of the story is lame. The \\"romance\\" between Jeremy and Lexie reads like a high school romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good summer read","review":"This was a good easy reading summer book. Nothing spectacular but a good book. I have read others by this author which were better. Not his best book but still OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sparks is getting boring","review":"I have read all of Nicholas Sparks and he's getting rather boring. Generally I can handle the same story told over and over again as with all Sparks' books. Small town in NC, someone is getting over another someone, stranger comes to town and falls in love with someone from NC. Said someone doesn't want to get hurt, so there is a back and forth struggle until the end when everything is peachy again.True Believer is even WORSE! There just wasn't much of a story at all. Albeit it is the same story again, but at least with most of his other books there is another back story. This one was very weak and not very interesing.

It's boring with a capital B.\\" That is my feeling about this book. I was very disappointed in this book.

(I don't like Steels' books)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholas Sparks made a \\"True Believer\\" out of me...","review":"This book takes you on a journey to a tiny town, in North Carolina called Boone Creek. Jeremy Marsh travels there to dispell the myths and legend regarding supposed ghostly lights that plauge that cemetery. During his visit there he meets many of the locals some of which are real characters. This book started off slow, but you find yourself not wanting to put it down when he meets the town librarian. Can love concur all read it and see. Also I recomend Sams letters to Jennifer by Nicholas Sparks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add my name to the list","review":"The book was a snooooooooze..... It took everything in me not to fall asleep. This is not a book that I could tell you in good conciousness to buy because I would be a liar. If you want a romance that will keep you turning the pages until you finish the book then you MUST..buy Whispers of the wicked saints. Don't be fooled there is a typo on the cover, but don't let that stop you from an awesome romance.. You won't believe the twist and turns. As for Sparks?? I just don't know what to say. I hope this is not the end for him, because I have enjoyed his work, but I have to admit I am a little worried."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers. The premise had me interested then the story did not amount to much. I was let down at the end. The problem is I finished the book because I already bought the next one At First Sight. I think Sparks really dropped the ball on this one. It was such a let down from his other novels that I was surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Turnout from Sparks","review":"Wooo! This book was a total snoozefest. The romantic connection between the two main characters is barely made by the author. The element of any suspense regarding the lights in the cemetary is not there at all. I skimmed through the majority of the book trying to sledge my way through it thinking it would pick up at some point. Unfortunately I ended up tossing it away around chapter 16. Dreadful read.I normally enjoy Sparks' tales, but this one was by far his worst book, and not worth your money. We won't be seeing this one made in to a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Nicholas Spark's, you have let me down. TRUE BELIEVER reads as if it was written by a teenager who has had little experience when it comes to love. The story is totally unrealistic and unmoving.

Those two are worthy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this???","review":"Please don't tell me that this is the new Nicholas Sparks. This new book is totally BORING. They don't even fall in love til like 9 or 10 chapters into the book!!!! The first 2/3 of the book are wasted. Goodness....I really hope Nicholas goes back to writing well-respected love stories like The Notebook"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Joke!","review":"This was the biggest waste of time I've experienced in a long while. The romance was so far-fetched and unrealistic it was laughable...like he would really be so gung ho about a girl who wouldn't give him the time of day after just meeting her. And the whole mysterious lights thing was a MAJOR letdown. I teach special education and I'm positive most of my students would be able to come up with a more creative and interesting explanation that Sparks did. Nicholas Sparks has always been one of my favorite authors but this book was just ridiculous. He better step it up for the next book or I won't be spending my cash on any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"...hello...Nicholas where are you?","review":"What happened? Where did my amazing author go? This was a disappointment for me. In every Sparks book I am SO glued to it I can't put it down. This one I bought the day it came out and FINALLY finished it a week and a half later. I couldn't absorb this story. I could read the ending right after meeting Doris and knowing about her 'power'. I NEVER guess Sparks endings. I am usually the one crying my eyes out, smiling that he blindsided me with something I did NOT expect! This was like every other romance novel. Nothing spectacular. I didn't like Jeremy. He seemed to perfect in that 'stud' way, I couldn't tell how genuine he was. Lexie just struck me as being the 'let's feel sorry for me' type. Too sappy and I just didn't get into it.

I read The Notebook and thought at that point there was some type of slant to his writing. However, the slant is now as level as the monitor of a patient whose heart no longer beats. I once interviewed a well-known writer who told me that he would quit writing before he would write just for the sake of seeing his name in print. I know Mr. Sparks has a decent track record to date, but the familiar plots and repetitious characters are beginning to tire his public. Perhaps it's time to take a respite from writing and come up with something original for a change. Just a suggestion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Sparks fan :(","review":"I was so excited about Sparks having a new book coming out.

This trite piece of \\"literature\\" was not even a good enough to classify as a \\"light summer read\\" (in my humble opinion). I mean, how many times can a writer have his character \\"roll her eyes\\" to indicate flirting, exasperation, etc.? When he had the main male character roll his eyes as well, it was simply irritating. This is so NOT the Nicholas Sparks I had come to love through his earlier works. I feel as if Mr. Sparks has sold out...is he required by his publisher to churn out a specific number of novels in a time frame? If so, he is doing this with complete disregard to substance, quality, and plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable!","review":"After reading The Notebook and The Wedding, I was an instant fan of Nicholas Sparks. However, this book was a dissappointment. The love story (and other plot lines) were completely predictable and stale. I found it hard to believe that true love was found in a matter of five days for Mr. Jeremy Marsh and that the beautiful Lexie was 30 something and happily single, living in a small town. The ending is also somewhat cheesy, but I won't ruin it for you die-hard fans that still want to read this sappy book.

Worse than Most Paperback Romances","review":"This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market. \\"True Believer\\" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches. There is no plot. No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash. The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, \\"thinking\\" to themselves.

Not much for backpackers. The writers state that if you see birds or other animals eating something, it is safe. If you follow this recommendation, make a good will first. What is poisonous to one animal is safe for another. (Like dogs are poisoned by chocolate.) Know your plants! Also, I object when they recommend burying your used cans after burning them first. Bears can still smell the food after burning the cans and will dig them up. Also frost can heave them up, ruining it for the next camper. Rule is: Pack it in, pack it out.

It also has a pleasant, light scent, and it's a good deal price-wise compared to other leave-in conditioners (many of which I've tried and not been nearly as impressed with).The only drawback is that I have very thick hair and thus go through a bottle of this in a month -- I wish it went a little further.

I've gone through two bottles of this already and it has helped greatly with protecting my hair and detangling it. I flat ironed my hair the other day and it was nice and healthy looking.

We begin this book in a very quite tone and by the time the mother has reached the elephant... she and we are shouting in exasperation for the elephant to be quiet.

Having been a home maker for 40 years some of the things outlined were familiar, however the clutter that accummulates over the years can sometimes get on top of you and the motivation to sort it out becomes too much. Once started on the process of organizing cupboards etc. and doing this methodically from room to room (only way to manage such a great task), I find that now I am in control of the situation and not overcome with wondering where I put a particular item. I have been able to discard many of the trappings that may be of some use at a later date and have never and will never be used again. I have now a fresh outlook and motivation to conquer the task at hand. This book has changed my home and I thank the Oprah show for featuring Martha Stewart along with this particular book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring photos and text!","review":"I got this book a while ago and I really love it. The suggestions are useful and very practical. Thanks to this book I now fold fitted sheets properly, which is a big drawer-space-saver. The photos are very helpful and the text is appropriate and addresses what is shown in the pictures/illustrations. I actually read the book from cover to cover, and found it very pleasant besides being informative. My mother-in-law is in the process of organizing her closets and she has asked to borrow this book again from me. I should probably get her her own copy...My final point is that this is a great buy and you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martha Stewart is the Most Amazing Woman Living.","review":"Martha has done it again. As a fellow lover of all things domestic, I am enamored by Martha Stewart's genius. She an asset to this great country of ours, an important figure and role model ranking up with Jackie Kennedy and Henry Ford. However, this book is one of the best. It deserves more than 5 stars.There is a slob in each of us, but in this book, Martha shows us how to tame this inner beast. Drawing on her previous endevors, she combines all of her best things in a wonderful book of Good Things. It is a godsend for any homeowner, large or small.A life without a cluttered mess, is a life that is lived best. Martha has given me the freedom to pursue success in all that I do.

That version of the band did rockabilly and had a female singer. The bass player in that band was Jonny Ray Bartel who would go on to play in the Knitters. When this record hit the stores I picked it up because of the name of the band and saw that Bartel was involved and decided to give it a try. I really did not know what to expect and was surprised it was a live blues record, and a damn fine one at that. This is tuff blues, not boohoo stuff. It is rough and edgy and it really is a shame this is all they really ever did. I wish more blues bands would take this road and not the keep doing the same old thing. This is a kick in the pants hard driving record that more people need to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this CD four times.","review":"I first picked up this album because I recognized the drummer from the Blasters on the record jacket. About that same time I was learning to play the harp and was totally blown away by Lester Butler. I lost my first copy and bought another. Found the first one and gave it to a friend. Bought a third copy and gave to another harp playing friend. Got my car stolen with my original copy and then bought a fourth. If I loose this one I will buy it again, it is that good. It's a shame this moment in time will never be reproduced, but then that's the magic of this album. I regret never seeing Lester Butler.

This live 2 CD set features the Grateful Dead at their peak. Some of my favorite performances on the set are Tennessee Jed, Ramblin' Rose, and Brown-Eyed Women. This CD is worth every penny. Even if you're not a diehard \\"Deadhead\\", you'll still enjoy this wonderful blend of folk and rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even the Cone-In-The-Head Kid knows this is essential Dead","review":"My CD is an older one and could benefit from a digital remaster - I'm always fussing with the equalizer when I spin this one. Even so, I spin it often, and loud. And sometimes even hit the repeat. I couldn't live with out this collection. Many of the tunes appear again in '77 on What a Long Strange Trip, another CD I feel is \\"essential Dead\\". Still, each of these tunes are worth have multiple times. The Dead are young and sound real sweet here. And Jerry shows us how good he's got that guitar down now. It is a shame that we don't hear more Pig on his last tour, but we do get some - Mr. Charlie is a McKernan orignal... And Phil recently remedied the lack of really fine Pig tunes on CD when he put together \\"Fallout\\" for us.Here's to the Bolo & Bozo boys..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, an essential for any dead head","review":"of all the cd's ive owned from the dead this set is my favorite.

However, if you are looking to get the feel of a GD live show, you may be somewhat disappointed. In fact, there is no evidence of an audience anywhere on this album and if no one told you it was a live album you would probably think it was recorded in the studio. Also missing are the between-song jams and drums usually associated with a Dead show.That said, here is a collection of tunes that feature both tight playing and a natural organic sound. All the vocals and instruments are in tune, in time, and blend perfectly with each other. An interesting fact about this live album is that many of the Dead's best loved songs first debuted on this album. This is where 'Jack Straw' first appeared, and it may be the best version of that song. Unless you only listen to live Dead to the point you don't even have American Beauty in your collection, you should probably get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"Have loved the Grateful Dead for as long as I can remember! This album is a great compilation of their songs. I also was GRATEFUL (lol) for the incredibly low price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"This is a great collection of solid (if not particularly adventuresome) live performances during a tour of Europe. Highlights include the fabulous \\"China Cat Sunflower\\" leading into \\"I know you Rider\\", as well as \\"Hurts Me Too\\", \\"Mr. Charlie\\", and \\"Morning Dew.\\" A good introduction to live Dead and an essential part of anyone's CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"The Euros don't deserve any credit for this. It's The Dead who happen to be in Europe. Awesome. Last commercial album with Pigpen.."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dead live set...","review":"but not the only one you should get. Make this a purchase, but get live/dead also because it has all different songs, and then look at other live releases. The dead have a lot of good recordings, just pick and choose among them. This one has become a staple of great dead songs in my collection. It is amazing how many good songs they have, and how intimidating it seems to get their best stuff, but you can't go wrong with this release even though some people feel it isn't up to scratch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cream of the crop","review":"I think it is proper to write a review on this 2 cd album by the Dead. It is one of the good records they did. The first disc is a true gem, w/ classic versions of Ramble on, B E Woman & J Straw. The 2nd cd is good also, but for me not as much as the 1st. If by comparison, I would say that the new 'steppin out' cd is probably more of the same material you hear on this album, but for some reason they wanted to release it 30 years later. The reason being that the material is of choice quality performance, and sound.Europe '72 the album shouldn t be an omition on your collection. If a newby to the Dead s music, this is a good start. It is strong fresh Grateful Dead that will probably get your liking for them. Either way, this album is between 4 1/ and 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Europe 72 review","review":"Europe 72 is a great Grateful Dead CD. It is not, \\"without question the finest live Dead you will ever hear.\\" That is a statement actually far from the truth. 1972 was a great year for the band, and the Europe 72 CD is well worth purchasing. They jam songs out quite well, such as China Cat Sunflower and Truckin', while incorporating their own folk tunes such as Jack Straw, Brown Eyed Woman, and Ramble on Rose. This is a great place to start because it shows how versitle the group really is. Introducing someone to this CD is a great compromise between showing them the wildly psychedelic dark star/ feedback stuff from the late 60's and the straight up folk rock from American Beauty. Pick up this CD for some solid Dead, but keep in mind that these are still fairly conservative versions of most of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book but nothing dotty about it","review":"My son really likes this book and painted a bunch of trucks with the do-a-dot markers when I gave it to him today. But it should be noted that it really is just a coloring book like any other. There is nothing particular about it in terms of dots or circles to color with the markers. The paper is nice and thick, but we also used our do-a-dot markers on some regular paper and they worked fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids really like this","review":"We had received one of these activity books before as a gift. My 3 and 1/2 yr old son loves it, so we got him another one. The pages are thick and so it works great with the do-a-dot markers. It is a bit pricey for the amt of pages that you get, but still worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real People","review":"Now I know why I read books. Books tell stories, unlike movies, which tend to portray people larger than life or some freakish caricature. This book tells a story of Dean, who views himself as an outsider looking in. But in reality, he is afraid to include anyone in his life. Dean has a group of friends always giving him advice and looking out for him, but he doesn't lean on them in times of crisis. His new love, Tony, is just opposite, laid back, and grateful for life's expereinces. When they meet, sparks fly and they fall in lust (first), then love. A love that changes Dean, but he is slow in connecting the dots and resorts to his \\"old personna\\", breaking up with Tony. Don't fret, true love does win out, and it doesn't take chapters to get them there. In the end, Dean learns to recognize his self worth and trust the comfort he needs in someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmmm...","review":"it wasn't so bad, it was actually a little far reaching, but it panned out in the end...i'm neutral on recommending this book, buy it or not...i liked it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book was very disappointing. While I've read a lot of gay romance or love stories and have learned to have low expectations (which is kind of sad in itself), this book was really a disappointment. Dean, the main character is so annoying that I started to wonder why all his friends cared about him so much. He is always such a downer. He even needs to rely on his friend dying of cancer half the country away to help pick up his spirits. Because the main character was so one-dimensional, the rest of the characters just faded into the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice story with a great ending","review":"Great story.

You can also use it on dry skin that needs extra attention. It also seems to work as a healing balm.I have one tube in every main room of my house.

You can set variable speeds by turning the red knob if you want to start your cat off slower. My 2 indoor cats like it full speed and it's great stimulation for them. (I did buy another brand's version of this toy once as a second toy for my cats and neither cat would play with it so after a year i gave it away to another cat who didn't want it either.)This one's AWESOME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Construction","review":"What a bummer. This item looked great, but it is so badly constructed. Within a few days, I had to use masking tape to make the blue wand stay on. Two days later, the spider or whatever it is came off the end, so I tied it back on with fishing line. Then, the wire clip that holds the spider came apart. The batteries wear out fast. The ball with sound is way to loud - terrified my cat. What as waste of $31 plus shipping. Worst thing is I am DESPERATE for a good automatic toy, as my kitten demands a lot of play and I need my hands to do my work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after second unit received DOA","review":"I have no idea if my cats would enjoy this.

I would have to say that this has been a waste of money and I would not recommend it to any of my friends to purchase. The most disappointing aspect I found was that the bottom has wheels on it that the manufacturer has not attempted to disguise so you can see that the puppy's fur has been put on like a dress. It is also too clucky to cuddle which my kids like to do with their toy animals, whether they move or not. Thankfully I purchased this for only $20 (including shipping), but even at that price, sadly I would still not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO-Go My So Dumb Rollin' Pup","review":"My 6.5 and 9 year old daughters each got one from their Aunt. By the end of the first day they were completely frustrated by the dumb pup. Was it because the dogs never \\"learned\\" their voices? Or the multitude of steps to TRY to get the pup to do its tricks? Was it the hard, uncuddly body on wheels? We all tried again the next day. It does LOOK cute, but less than a month after Christmas, they couldn't tell me where the No-Go Pups are. Probably hidden way back, under the bed. (PS Durability. It's sure to last a long time if nobody plays with it!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO FUR REAL WALKING PUP","review":"I had the pleasure of seeing my daughters face light up when she received her GO GO WALKING PUP on Christmas morning only to watch it turn to dissapontment because it would not work.

It is a stuffed dog on wheels (legs don't move). The head moves, it pants/barks, & walks towards any loud noise. That's it. They advertise it as \\"trainable\\" and \\"reacts to your own voice\\" which is an overstatement! It sits unattended as it has since Christmas morning and I can't say that I blame my daughter.

In my opinion, I-Cybie is much better: We have one and have had it for three years and my kids and I still play with it! Go-Go, however, is sitting and collecting dust in the toybox. It is obviously strong, though, because if it runs into walls as much as mine did, it certainly would have broken if it wasn't. But educational...emm...I suppose if you took it apart the kids could become robot brainiacs LOL! But fun is a NOOOO. I have two girls, and 11 year old and a six year old.

Now when turned on it just barks over and over like a broken record. Also, the commands are a joke, if you want the puppy to sit for grooming, stroke his head twice, his side once and then his back once. All of the commands have such rituals, too much for young kids (and I certainly couldn't remember them all) I think I will try Daisy this Christmas (as my daughter asked for a new one).

However, she was bored and frustrated with the dog about half an hour after opening it, since it does not respond like shown on TV. It is supposed to come when you call it. But first, the room has to have no other sounds. Then the dog seems to have to \\"think\\" about it a minute, and then it will move about 4 inches and stop, she calls it again, it thinks, goes 4 inches in a slightly different direction, and stops again, and this goes on and on. It took forever for the dog to find her at 4 feet away. 2 days after received, this $40 toy is sitting and collecting dust. It is also very hard, not cuddly at all.

Its ridiculous mechanical wheels get stuck and causes the thing to roll around in a circle. Notice I did not say walk around...it rolls on wheels. This makes it look even more unrealistic. It is suppose to respond to sound. Well you have about a 50/50 chance of it going in the correct direction. My kid played with this one time and now it's on the bottom of the toy box.

Mix in a few unreleased cuts and some great hits (although the major ones are missing) and you have a great retrospect. I'm glad that the big hits are not here, since we have heard them over and over again. What this set does is help you appreciate the great talent that is Tommy Dorsey. His great ability to find new talent and the mind boggling discipline of his band. If you love Tommy Dorsey, you must buy this set. It is presented and remastered superbly.

I found it very tedious, with constant repetition of events of daily lives, (how many feasts can one describe in a single book?). I think this is perhaps more of a scholars book now, i.e. one used to illustrate the chinese novel than one which holds interest, or illuminates human nature.

Out of the trilogy, Sons is my least favorite, although it is still good and gives some really good biographical information on a Chinese man of the time. Focusing mostly on Wang the Tiger, I enjoyed the second half immensely.

However, the plot is so deceptively complex, and turns back on itself so deftly, that it is impossible not to be caught up in the deceit of the characters themselves. The apparent simplicity of the characters motivations and actions lead the reader into the same state of confusion that the characters appear to be experiencing. The ambivalence and ambiguity (two things that smack of a lack of conviction on the author's part in most novels) work marvelously in getting the reader as lost as possible in this ostensibly banal domestic story.

All in all, a simple race track is what we should have gotten him, and this set was all just cool packaging... perhaps for an older child (10 or 12) who can maintain the track on their own, but not for little guys.

The arm works the first time the car goes through it (usually), but once we open the cyborg head and manually (!) push the car through, it has nowhere to go successfully.

The other track option of just the loop-to-loop worked fine. Three days later the looped-to-loop failed and hasn't worked since. The cars never got enough momentum to loop.

It always fell about a 1/2 inch short. It was EXTREMELY dissappointing to my son to say the least, and EXTREMELY frustrating to me after spending 2 hours putting it together.

It takes four D batteries, so get ready to shell out the cash for those. At first glance, I'm thinking, \\"There's no WAY this thing is going to do all it says.\\" And then we fired it up!AWESOME. I couldn't believe it. My wife and I marveled as we watched the little cars jet around the track at super hi-speeds and even navigate the tilting cyber-arm flawlessly. I was amazed.

There's a feature called the \\"attack\\" mode where you push a piece of the track down and the car is supposedly catapulted into a chamber and the arm of the track tips and is supposed to place the car in the cyborg's mouth where it continues to run on the track. THIS FEATURE DOESN'T WORK. We tried at least 20 times but could not get it to work once. The car travels too fast and hits the shield over the track and is thrown off the track. We were hit by this flying car several times. It's dangerous and hurts when you're hit. The creators could not have possibly thought this design would work. It's fundamentally flawed. DON'T PURCHASE THIS ONE!!

Also, a particular piece of the plastic track kept coming apart and I kept having to snap it back into place. After doing this about 5 times the cheap plastic gave and broke off completely. My son was very disappointed. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"Hot Wheels has done a nice job with this toy and it doesn't cost a great deal of money!

Fun, fun, fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A feat of engineering!","review":"This is an amazing track! I bought it based on reviews I read on this site. My 5 yr old wanted the Lava Slime track thingy and I was reluctant. After reading reviews on that (not good) and then this one (his 2nd choice), I purchased the Cyborg for Christmas. It took me about 3 hours to assemble (I had some distractions along the way) and I'm a bit rusty at toy assembly.Overall, directions were very clear, but it's still a bit complicated and requires some focus and space. My son and my husband have been enjoying it for about 3 hours now. It's remarkably sturdy, both cars are functioning great, and if all remains steady, the Cyborg pivot-to-mouth operates consistently. The vibration of the motor (it's setup on low pile carpet right now)sometimes jostles the track loose in various places. My kid and my husband enjoy troubleshooting the problem when this happens.Based on price (I spent 20 bucks) and considering assembly time we are very satisfied with the value."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"At the risk of stating the obvious like a darn fool, it is a dictionary in every sense of the word. Arranged in alphabetical order, this book contains encyclopaedic entries on famous dancers, choreographers, dance companies from around the world, dance terminology and even composers like Charles Ives and Richard Strauss (whose music were used in miscellaneous dances). From Alvin Ailey to the Zurich Ballet, it serves as a quick reference for seasoned followers of dance, while pure beginners might get lost in the mass of text. Those into visual aids will also be utterly disappointed for there's none here. But on the whole, it's still worth the space on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of them broke","review":"Today I was using the #00 Philips head screwdriver from the set for only the second time--to fix an iPod. As I was pressing it into the screw, the shaft receded a bit into the handle and then started rotating as I was trying to turn the screw. I couldn't get any toque out of it anymore. Luckily I had an eyeglass type screwdriver around to finish the job I was in the middle of. I guess these are poor quality and will have to become my throw-away set for jobs that might damage things. I'll have to look in to getting higher quality ones here on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ministry Vision Made Simple","review":"Like most ministers, I have read several books on vision. Some titles were very inspiring, other titles were very confusing. The vast majority however, were not very enlightening. This book by Malphurs moves beyond establishing the need for vision and helps the reader grasp, communicate, and implement a vision.Malphurs follows an easy-to-understand process beginning with the definition of a ministry vision and ending with the preservation of that vision. I recommend this book highly to all ministry professionals, especially pastors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive for the adult learner","review":"I have considerable musical background (I have played trumpet for 15 years, guitar for 6, and numerous other instruments) but never really sat down to master the mechanics of keyboard playing. This book was exactly what I was looking for because it starts from the basics of two-handed fingerings, and takes the player all the way to chord playing, etc., which is what I will focus on as a worship leader and musician. While this book moves quickly through theory and does not hand-hold, it does still cover a lot of ground from the basics to more complex concepts in music. The complete novice will probably not feel comfortable with this, but I still have to say that I am pleased and impressed with the scope of this book. If you have some musical background and are looking to cross over into piano as a second (or third or more) instrument, you will most likely appreciate this book because it does not dwell on the elementary concepts you are already familiar with."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal","review":"Well, overall this is a good book. Mostly it lets you practice and has tons of great material to play but it lacks showing detailed instructions for begining players. You will want to get another book on music first to learn the basics. Like notes, time signagatures, and every thing else. Once you have mastered the basic skills of music this book is excellent for carrying on your music skills in the piano."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexy Wedge For Sitting","review":"I ordered these shoes for a girlfriend as I prefer stilettos and heels over wedges.

I would recommend these shoes for a dinner date or to just sit and look pretty but not for dancing or events where you must stand and walk a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Way Ahead of It's Time","review":"J. Beez Wit the Remedy is an incredibly interesting mosiac of samples, ryhmes, and styles. This record was originally produced by Bill Laswell, however the initial recordings were so experimental and off-kilter that Warner Brothers felt the need to re-record some of the tracks. I have heard some of the unreleased recordings on the 10\\" 'Crazy Wisdom Masters' which is totally sick, but this final version of the record is still amazing. Brooklyn MC, Sensational, even appears on the record under his original moniker, Torture. This is one of the most entertaining records I have ever heard...even though it is missing some of the orginal tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining book, whether you're doing a resto or just learning","review":"I am currently shopping for a charger to restore, and ran across this book, while this book is written about a charger, this is a great book for almost any auto restoration I can think of. I am currently restoring an 81 land cruiser and this book covers everything you'd need to restore that vehicle as well since it's written to cover the topic of auto body restoration and repair and that really covers most cars.I find the book very helpful and enormously entertaining.

I keep it next to the bird cages to keep the feather dust down. The 10 year warranty is a plus. I had to send for a gear part twice on my old one in the last 8 years. The company promptly sent me the replacement part at no charge. It takes a little mechanical ability to install the part. The only down side is having to fill it with water about every other day and then cleaning it about every 2 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Air O Swiss unit it replaced","review":"About a month ago I bought Air O Swiss 7144 Ultrasonic. First, it left white dust everywhere. I live in the Southwest which is known for having hard water but the level of dust in itself would make me return in. The Air O Swiss also had an issue regulating humidity. The air felt humid, not clean. So I returned it and bought this. What a difference! The build quality on the Venta is notably better. Seems much more solid and I like the fact that it can be left on the floor (sorry Air O Swiss, but I don't have any spare 3 foot tables around my house to elevate your unit). It is somewhat annoying that the Venta doesnt have a way to view the water level without opening the unit but once you get the hang of it you'll know when it needs water. The air feels notably cleaner and more fresh. Dry skin is gone. Very please with it and plan to buy another unit soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corelle Callaway","review":"These are good sized bowls so don't hesitate to puchase.

I found this book to be a step back for me in knowledge. I knew probably 85% of this material but it did show me a couple cool licks so it's worth keeping.

This book has not been helpful to me in any way. The other reviews about needing about 1 year of is experience are wrong, I could have pulled this off easily right away, because the book moves at such a slow pace anyway. This book will only teach you the basic pentatonic and minor scales, I wouldn't recommend it for a player with a lot of experience, but it would be a great book for beginners! *Note: Do not get this book if you have an acoustic guitar, and not an electric!*"},{"rating":"1","title":"After the Dawn","review":"We wanted this movie because it was filmed in our hometown.

There's little action or suspense along the way, the use of voice-over narration becomes a bit grating, and the occasionally surreal touches create more muddle than interest.

Bein' Green and the rest also slide down deceptively easy; there's a lot of emotional and musical depth on quiet display here, and Van's voice reaches its mellow peak, and never really gets much sweeter than this as his recording career goes on.Some great lyrics, too; Snow In San Anselmo is both beautiful and funny---the string bit illustrating the speeders is always a smile.

Their are a few down sides: we can not get the item to stand up on its own, so half the battle is simply keeping the stage upright, it is expensive for what it actually is, its not sold in any of the stores near me so I am hardly ever able to purchase new sets of finger puppets, and I have never been able to figure out a good place to store it.

It is ghastly.Teachers should teach. Let kids form their own opinions when they are ready. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"More evidence of the deterioration of our educational system","review":"An example of the author's ignorance and the questionable authenticity of the anecdotes is found in the \\"Blue Angels\\" story. Supposedly, the kids admonish the Angels not to bomb their library.The Blue Angels fly fighter planes, not bombers. And, the planes are not armed anyway, as they are part of an acrobatic and demonstration team.A nitpick? Perhaps. But, just as one's body temperature is an indication of one's health, such poorly-constructed stories are an indication of how our educational system has strayed from the track of education."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"This is drivel of the first degree, a political agenda thinly disguised (and not very cleverly) as something worthwhile with which to indoctrinate teachers and eventually children, with the author's liberal political bias. That it is recommended to teachers is beyond astounding, especially if they are paid and employed to teach in the United States and have any professed understanding of what their native country represents in the world community. This tome does not even represent a fine line between propaganda and education - it tramples any such finesse with the author's blatant leftist opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard of it through Goldberg's new book","review":"Every time I hear the term \\"free thinker\\" the immediate image, which comes to mind is just the opposite. Letting young kids react to supposed injustices without being old enough to understand them is not \\"teaching\\" it is called \\"bad parenting\\". Forming a child's mind to think that the Blue Angels would blow up their town is absolutely repulsive, and the author should be ashamed of herself no matter what her rationalization may be. What does she have them do for field trips, attend gay pride rallies with grown men dry humping each other while wearing nothing but underwear and bondage? Let them be kids for Pete's sake. They'll have plenty of time to grow cynical and hate values in high school and college."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure peacenik propaganda","review":"This book is simply a tool to indoctinate our youth into hating their own country. War is always bad, according to these authors, even when war is brought to you. The chapter on the Blue Angels is simply mind-boggling: a teacher's preschool class witnessed a Blue Angels demonstration, and she encourages them to write about the experience...albeit after she lectures them about war and killing. In essence, the children are taught to believe that the Blue Angels will bomb their own people!Ridiculous material like this should be recognized for what it is: pure propaganda from the extreme left wing. As a teacher myself, I will certainly encourage my contemporaries to avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supporting our children's sense of fairness and citizenship","review":"This book, although trashed by the right (see reviews, above) is a respectful, thoughtful way of helping young children DO SOMETHING when they think what they see or hear is unfair.Pelo and Davidson have listened carefully to children and empowered them to work toward a more just world.

There is a very extensive plant glossary, but you better know Latin to use it. All the plants are listed by the Latin name. Also, in order to put plants into your garden layout, there must be a 3-D view of that particular plant/flower. You'd think you would be able to do that from the name of the program. Well, there is such a small percentage of plants with 3-D views, that I just gave up trying to use the program. One good thing about the plant glossary if you can figure out all the Latin, is that you can choose plants by color, height, blooming time, etc. That's about the only good thing about the program.

We forgot about it and had it in the closet and just took it out. He is now 2 and can easily shape sort, but he hates this toy. The shapes are so close to the size of the openings that they must fit exactly. He has very good motor skills and can do it, but looses interest fast. Also, I must say, the voice is horrible. It's a womans voice, and honestly, I hate to be crude, but the voice sounds very provocative. I am not the only one who feels this way, as a matter of fact it's a joke with my friends. When she talks she sounds very sexy....too weird for us. We are getting rid of this toy. I'm sorry but its true. Skip this toy, there are much better shape sorters out there. Do a search on amazon.com and you'll find some great shape sorters. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a bad toy","review":"This is not my 13 month old son's favorite toy, but he does play with it some. I think when he gets big enough to understand how to use the shape sorter better he will like it more, but for now he just chews on the blocks, makes the music play, and takes the lid on and off.

She loved to remove the lid and pick the blocks out and put them back in. Putting the blocks in on the sides took longer, but she tried early on around 9-10 mos. to do so. This was her favorite toy by far. I think the fact that it has a lid that comes off is what did it for her. She likes to take stuff out and put stuff in. She's now 15 mos. and is just now starting to grow out of this jar, but still pulls it out every now and then. You can't beat the price either!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Educational toy that grows with your child","review":"My daughter received this toy when she was 6 months old. She is now 2 1/2 and is still having loads of fun with it. This is a toy that will grow with your child because at the baby stage they will be fascinated with the lights and music. The lights and music are very simple for the baby to activate because all it requires is sticking their hand in the cookie jar, or pressing the nose of the jar. Once your baby grows to a toddler/child and are learning their shapes and colors the toy becomes not only fun but educational. This toy teaches colors, shapes and phrases such as \\"I love you\\", \\"Yummy\\" & \\"Mmmmmm\\".Excellent toy that will be in your child's toy box for years and years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shape Choice","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas when she was 6 mos old. She liked the sounds it made and would bang the different shapes together which coordinated with her motor skills for that age and a little later she would put the shapes in and take them out. She didn't started REALLY trying to put the shapes into the openings until she was about 10 mos old. When she started putting the shapes thru the openings, she began holding them by the 'open end' of the shape and pushing them in. She was able to do each one but has trouble with the heart. The star for some reason seems to be her favorite. Each time she would get one in she would laugh and clap her hands. I like this toy because it teaches a variety of themes. The voice is cute and lyrical. Not robotic like a lot of toys. I would recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all...","review":"I bought this toy for my son for Christmas and at 9 months, it really has been an educatiional yet entertaining toy. Jaden actually gets that he has to put the blocks in the corresponding holes, he will clap when he does it. The key to this toy is to actually sit with your child and show him what it does. The first few times I would put the blocks in and clap my hands. Now my little boy has to do it or he will throw a fit. I always take time to show Jaden what the toys do. The toy itself is very durable, except I can't find the lid!

However once the title track kicks in it's all good. Jesse Johnson is especially good on this album. Just listen to the solo on Skillet and you'll see what I mean. I wish this record had been a bigger hit for them.It might have persuaded them to keep the reunion going longer if it had been a bigger seller.

While the shape sorter is a good tool and she loves to grab and chew on the shapes, it makes the most annoying sound and it NEVER stops! The song was cute, but only about the first 20 times in 5 minutes! The button to make it sing is on the bottom so anytime your baby, or you move it it goes off. There's no way to turn it off and no volume. (it's very loud). We end up taking the batteries out. I don't recommend this unless you just happen to love the noise makers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snail Pail","review":"We got this to go with a few other toys my daughter got for Christmas.

But it is still one of his favorites"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Annoying!","review":"The same short tune plays over and over, even when you don't want it to---the button for the music is on the bottom part of the toy, so even if the top is bumped it starts up. No off button and no volume.

There can't be a more obnoxious toy!","review":"This has got to be the most obnoxious \\"noisy\\" toy my son has! There's no on/off switch and the slightest movement sends it off into it's annoying little diddy that you will not be able to get out of your head. It will drive you crazy.However, the worse thing is that the lid to the box is a thin piece of hard plastic. My son fell on the lid (as toddlers will do) when it was open, and ended up with a giant nasty welt on his leg! He cried more from that than any of his immunizations or his circumcision!As a shape/color sorter I suppose it's OK, but I'm sure that there are better, safer, and more quiet ones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son is 10 now","review":"Cool toy. My son must have been around 6 months when he was given this toy, probably for Christmas 2001. My kids have always been hard on toys, so you can be sure it has been abused and probably stepped on many times. He loved the music, but I found it annoying as I am noise sensitive. I have never changed the batteries, and every time I come across it again, it is still going strong (unfortunately! :)). It was put away so I can be sure all the parts were there before I gave it away. Guess it's time to finish that and pass it on to someone else! This toy is definitely durable, and I wish we could find such good batteries for our other electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't stand the noise","review":"This toy has the most annoying habit of cutting itself on. Quite frequently it would turn on even in the middle of the night. We finally had to take the batteries out of it so we could sleep through the night. Not a toy I would recommend if you do not want to be woken at 3 a.m. but its \\"cutsie\\" song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Price, but not worth it!","review":"I bought this for my 1 year old. The music is very loud, annoying and turns on at the slightest touch (the button is on the bottom of the snail). There is no way to turn it off unless you remove the batteries. The blocks are not standard shapes(star, triangle, flower). It opens up very easily to get the blocks back out, but my daughter gets so frustrated trying to put the blocks in that she just opens it up and places them in it. So it looses a lot of its educational value. My daughter has had very little interest in this toy. I don't have anything good to say about this it and wish I would have saved the $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy and no volume control","review":"My sons never had much of a chance to play with this toy because I found it too loud, and the song very annoying.

My daughter loved it so much, I just had one sent to someone as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Thing is annoying","review":"I agree with a previous customer that this thing needs an \\"off\\" button. Anytime it's touched, it goes off and my daughter is really not interested in it.

It was not worth it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big hit with the baby","review":"This is probably one of our daughter's favorite toys, and she's been playing with it for months and months. I love how the whole snail comes apart in different pieces. It's definitely a learning experience when baby tries to put it back together. Our daughter also loves the little song that the snail plays (she always dances to it), though Daddy says he could do without it after having heard it hundreds of times! The blocks that they come with are great for stacking and for learning different shapes, but our little girl still thinks they are best for hurling across the room. If you don't mind finding little blocks all over your house, then this is definitely the toy for your baby! Good luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying toy alert","review":"This is probably the toy I like the least out of all my daughter's toys. It plays an anoying song- frequently and loudly and because of it's tall slim design and heavy base it is hard for her to handle.

(Maybe whispering \\"hush.\\") The teeny, fur- covered edition is the one to have, in my view. When it was reissued (I think around 1985) and I spied it in a bookshop, I instantly was transported back to my childhood. I bought it and kept it in a safe place for nearly 12 years, until I first read it to my baby daughter. I keep it in her her room, in its box. After we read it, she cuddles it until she falls asleep. Every page is a delight, from the hollow tree the family lives in, to the teeny tiny fur animal who gets kissed on his little fur nose, to the wonderful supper and lullaby the fur child receives from his parents at the end of a day in the wild wood. I wish that this book (and Goodnight Moon) were issued to every child upon birth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Little Fur Family","review":"Initially put off by the miniature edition I'd ordered by mistake, I now must recommend it.

My 15 month old loves to hold a little book in her hands that feels 'all soft and all warm'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me, but my daughter likes it okay","review":"I really like Margaret Wise Brown's other books, so I was excited to receive this one as a gift. I'd never heard of it before, and now I kind of see why. The writing and story are quite different than Runaway Bunny or Goodnight Moon. Like another reviewer, I found the repetition of the \\"fur\\" theme to be a bit much. Also, the story is rather random and weird, with the child wandering \\"dark and sunny woods,\\" grabbing various creatures and examining them or \\"kissing them on their little fur nose.\\" I also find the illustrations, while well done, to be slightly sinister and creepy, with the forbidding-appearing woods, the red and wind-whipped depiction of evening, and the odd-looking \\"fur father.\\" I hate to rain on everyone's childhood memories, but there you have it. Our two-year-old daughter likes it okay, and it's slowly making its way into regular circulation in her library."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may be a classic, but it doesn't interest everyone...","review":"We received this as a present for our daughter, and our first thought was \\"How adorable!\\" The box set is very cute, and the brown fur covered book is certainly attractive to a child's curious little fingers, but that is where it ends for us.Our daughter enjoys petting and pulling the fur, but the story and illustrations do not hold her attention. Even the sounds (kerchoo, thump, kerplunk, ssip, etc.) didn't catch her attention as they usually do. The illustrations are softer than most children's books and are not eye catching.Plus, my husband and I found the story to be a bit weird. The \\"fur child,\\" \\"fur world,\\" \\"fur mother,\\" \\"fur grandson\\" and other \\"fur\\" references were a little much. The fact that this \\"Fur Family\\" wears fur coats was also a tad unsettling.Does this mean the book isn't worth buying? For us it's not worth it since my daughter doesn't enjoy it and neither do we, but I'm sure others would appreciate the classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had in mind","review":"No where on the amazon page did it mention that this book is mini-sized.

It should be in the hands of every Lawyer, Guardian ad Litem, Psychologist and any one working with children. It, also, is very beneficial for parents to read, who are suffering from this disorder.

Again I've enjoyed reading about this incredible woman torn between two cultures. She gives a remarkable view into the lives and feelings of Japanese people that few Westerners know. The story was fantastic and reading about the places in Japan I have visited gave me back wonderful memories. Her characters are believable and likeable. Sujata Massey has obviously done her homework!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese tradition with an 'attitude'","review":"After discovering Sujata Massey with 'The Salaryman's Wife', and being captivated by it's shadow's edge world of traditional Japan and the fringe-culture inhabited by 'gaijins' and the other foreign born, I couldn't wait to get my hands on 'Zen Attitude'. Massey doesn't let the reader down. Rei Shimura remains as prickly-yet-likeable as in 'Salaryman' and swims through the same sea of proper Japanese and eclectic outsiders.While I enjoyed the mystery and found it compelling, the real treat for me was the semi-insider's peek of Japan and Japanese culture. Despite her attempts at traditional ettiquette Rei is a modern woman and her PG-13 exploits made a sensitive guy like me blush a few times.Sujata Massey is a writer with a real appreciation for the beauty and tradition that her characters experience. It's nice to see that those things can co-exist with a little attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy story wrapped in a furoshiki","review":"There are some nice Japanese culture tidbits in this book but overall there's not much going on here....Weak, cardboard like secondary characters, wildly erratic behavior by main character. The plot bounces around too much and since you don't have too much attachment to the characters, you really don't care where they end up. Character dialogue is weak at times and jerky...I frequently felt like I had missed a sentence or two but it was just poor dialogue. It's been a long time since I've read a book that I thought it better to throw out than to possible burden another human being with a story of such lacking. You'd be better off to read some real Japanese mysteries by Miyuki Miyabe or Akimitsu Takagi than this Gaijin-lite stuff. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ring of truth missing","review":"This book doesn't work for me, and I have read a few. Probably would have been a great Mills & Boon had it not been so gratuitously violent. The contrived violence is a mask used in an attempt to validate what is most obviously fiction. There is no credibility. Nothing is delivered in this novel that cannot be garnered in the public domain or with a little research. It sits on my shelf alongside another book that defies all reality, i.e. OPJB, a work of complete and utter nonsense. A total waste of time for anyone interested in the real world. It is a fantasy probably perfect for lower end television grist-mill."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"The writing is fairly pedestrian and the author fails to really capture the reader. The book deals more with the number of times the two characters got together than with the politics of N.

It purports to be a true story about a British commando's grand passion for an IRA woman.I could go for great lengths about this, but I won't. Violent Delights is just not believable. There are a lot of good books about the British SAS (the commando unit referred to in this book).

It is mostly hardcore/punk mixed with metal. That's really about it, c'mon it's 12 years after the album came out. Use your common sense to buy this album..... ok it's awesome, sorry I had to tell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body Count","review":"To my finely tuned ears, this album of rap/metal by Ice-T and his cohorts is no less credible than the majority of product issued by most posers today. While the playing is rudimentary at best, Body Count gets extra points for understanding that rock n roll is truly Black music. The prime influence here is the heavy, thundering riffage of Black Sabbath, the dark, cartoonish antics of Slayer and the horrorcore rap that Ice himself had been perfecting since his 1987 debut \\"Rhyme Pays\\". Since rock music has always been for and about sex, my favorite moment on this joyous LP is when the band simulates violent intercourse on the thrashing breakdown of \\"Evil Dick\\", heavy metal has always sounded like sex to me so it's fitting that a band finally treats it's music like the act itself; brilliant! While the whole \\"Cop Killer\\" controversy has long since faded (thankfully) all that's left is the music and it still stands as quite entertaining and enjoyable.

Their age does not override the young voices in this case. They may try to emulate the energy of years gone by, but it's in the music. It's just not the same. For the first time, Scorsese disapointed me, as he's pretty good in his filming. I go for the music.

Mick Jagger was born the same year I was, and he has ten times the energy I do, but I have to say their act is getting a bit tired.

This DVD is so well done, I'm converted. I just loved the vignettes at the beginning, the patience in which Scorcese waits for the set list is commendable and offers some wry humor right from the start.

The Stones were in fine form at this concert - showing unflagging energy and spirit. My problem with the Blu-Ray is quality control - my copy (not from Amazon, but a respectable source) had a defect in Faraway Eyes, which caused it to stop and fail to play the following track at all (with Buddy Guy). Two subsequent exchanges both had exactly the same problem, both on my Oppo player and the store's PS3, indicating a pressing defect not visible to the eye. After the third try, I gave up and bought something else. My review is an average of 4 stars for the film and none for the pressing.
