It's up to YOU to fold each crease to make the stackers into a round shape, which takes a great deal of time and still doesn't seem to come out right.

And while I'm sure that the Hubals are wonderful people, this book is unbelievably trite and oozes with over-the-top sentimentality. For example, #88 titled Cry or #93, \\"Make a wish and write in the sand with a feather.\\" Entries also lean to the bizzare: #87 \\"Let a child take pictures of you\\"--the Hubals suggest \\"borrowing a child from a friendly family\\" if you don't have a child of your own. And #83--I agree watching dogs play at the beach is entertaining, but the mention that your dog will be delighted that there are \\"dead things to smell\\"is just too too much. And #79: \\"Give some money away\\" never even mentions the beach or the ocean--were editors sleeping during this tangent? For those of you who are Saturday Night Live fans, this book puts \\"Deep Thoughts\\" to shame. Unless you're looking for a good laugh or enjoy the sappiest of sappy books, pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Week at the beach?? or a week anywhere?","review":"First, I am fiftyish and intend to retire in northern Minnesota where summer is short and winter is deep and long. Still the message here is applicable to that environment. Beaches have the reputation for soulful activities outlined in this book, but the lessons can be applied anywhere you feel comfortable with the nature around you. I found the trivia informative and the thought behind the activities to be provoking. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lovely and fun book","review":"This book isn't going to change your life.. but it really is a nice, light, fun book. It's a nice book for families or anyone heading for the beach.

He questioned us about it and of course we were embarrassed. We are Christians who desire to live for the Lord and wish we never bought this book because we certainly would never advocate that. That was just one page. I was afraid to look and see what the others contained. It doesn't matter, we apologized and will definitely learn from that lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past page 50","review":"I love Julia Alvarez's novels, so I couldn't wait to dig into Geographies of Home -- especially since Alvarez herself recommends it on the back cover. What a disappointment! The characters are two-dimensional and inconsistently drawn, the dialogue is stilted, and the language is way overblown. There's very little to like about this family: The author paints their moments of happiness so falsely that it's impossible not to focus completely on how bizarre and screwed up they are. Although I could not get past the first few chapters, I can't imagine that the novel offers anything more than a long list of Latin-sounding names (lovely though they are) attached to unappealing characters, stiff dialogue, and dreary imagery."},{"rating":"2","title":"It explores relationship of one daughter to her family.","review":"It explores relationship of one daughter to her family. Iliana has gone away to school only to feel responsible for the problem facing her family back home in New York. She quits school to go back to her family and she realizes that some of the problems can not be so easily overcomed. Her father is one of the few male characters in the recent past to be a strong family man and not the typically portrayed latin macho that has no interest in their own family. It is a very fresh view at mental illness, family togetherness, and the need to be your own person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geographies of Home","review":"This novel is so beautifully layered with the struggles of adjustment...the meaning of home and how immigrants adjust, successfully and unsuccessfully.

It is more like a little green house."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cooler they sent me looks differently than this one I ordered!","review":"The one I received is the same concept and function, but is a solid white with some blue lettering on it, not this cute looking clear plastic with blue and pink lettering, so that was disappointing, and I'm not going to go to the trouble to send back an item like this, so beware, they may not send you exactly the product you think you are ordering!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful convenient product","review":"Went on a river trip a few weekends back and got to bring this along. I was skeptical at first based off of never seeing or hearing about one of these before. At the end of the trip, I couldn't be happier about it. I brought four camelbaks filled with some beverages so I cannot comment on how many beers you can fit it but we had ice and the camelbaks in there the whole trip and they fit perfectly. I also had no issues with the thing getting a rip or tear in it and it went over its fair share of rocks. Very satisfied with the tube and look forward to using it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me tell you a story (This rating may not be completely fair)","review":"I received this item, and inflated it.

But this one-this one I relished. Why? Because it is unparalleled in this world. It is one of the greatest books ever written that is not in Oprah's book club. I shall now use the thesaurus. It is recherche. It is worth its weight in gold. It is a giltedged, exquisite, in seipso totus teres atque rotundus!

I like the supersampler better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly made rubbish","review":"When I bought one of these I knew that it was a plastic toy type camera, but I was suprised at exactley how plasticy and cheap it was, especially for its not cheap price.I tried one roll of film in it - the results were so bad, the lab didn't bother printing it and just gave me the negs and a contact print; the last lens in sequence jammed open and the film transport was so terrible that everything overlapped resulting in mostly nothing on the negatives. I took it back to where I got it for a full refund.Yes I expected blur, I expected vignetting, I expected suprises. What I did not expect was such terrible build quality and results.This camera is a nice idea, if they were actually made well, it would be great - but it is mass produced plastic junk. Buying one is a lottery - you may be lucky, you might not. I'm sad to say, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far to simplistic an approach to contracting","review":"Although this book is the most readily available book containing standard boiler-plate contracts, most of the forms just do not have what it takes. In today's litigious climate it is necessary to spell out every detail, possible eventuality, and its remedy in a construction contract. If that is what you are looking for then don't buy this one. These contracts are about as simplistic and remedial as something that you would come up with yourself after about thirty seconds thought, and that's it. If you want a good, thorough exhaustive contract (like I do) keep looking. Sorry Craig and Karen, but look at a real estate contract used by your local board of realtors. That is what you need to strive for in your contracts; all of the lawsuits against contractors attest to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR THE HOMEOWNER","review":"I purchased this book to help build my house. I am the general contactor for the job and I thought I would be able to find some form for the sub contractors to sign. This was not the case and it really wasn't any help to me at all. It might help someone who is starting their own business but not for someone building their own house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Forms that are just plain Dumb!!!","review":"One reviewer wrote that the form's are simplistic, he was nice they are useless, I thought i would take a look at the book myself, thinking that maybe i could edit and revise some of the forms in order to better suit my needs. Not a chance, these things are worthless and you can find the same type of forms floating all over the net - google for free..

It's way to basic to protect anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"A long waited classical piece, but the release is a bit disappointing. The ochestra was scaled-down, and the piano soloist was the conductor himself. Wood pipes sounded a bit weak, certain camera appeared a bit out of focus, there was some ghost images throughout. Clearly there was audience coughing in the second movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parrots for dummies","review":"This book was too basic to be useful.

It's well written and covers the subject very well. Once you get into parrot care there are a variety of books that specialize in different aspects of parrots. The books does have a section on different parrot species and their characteristics. Read this before you buy a parrot. Consider adoption. Make sure you know the characteristics of the bird you want. Birds are a lot more work than a dog or cat. Being a non-mammal they just think differently and you will have to also. Make sure your bird will fit in with your household and family.

If you enjoy Rick Estrin in Little Charlie and the Nightcats you will love Jerry Portnoy\`s home run hitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truly phenomenal effort on the part of Portnoy","review":"When I first heard this album, I was floored. I thought that the harmonica mastery behind it was some of the best I've heard in the past decade. I mean Jerry Portnoy is definitely one of the best in the business. The singer that Jerry uses on some of the tracks is also an amazing talent. The tracks that particularly stand out as masterpieces are Black Tear Drops, Home Run Hitter, Misty, and Poison Kisses. However, all of the tracks hold their own as great blues songs. Not only does Portnoy prove his talent as a harmonica player but also as a songwriter. The lyrics from Charge It are a notable exam... I cannot recommend it enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerry Strikes Out!","review":"After 6 years with the Muddy Waters Band I expected a CD in that same vein, Delta Blues, similar to what other former Muddy Water's musicians such as Bob Margolin, Willie Smith and Pinetop Perkins to name a few have produced. This CD shows potential on 2 or possibly 3 of the 15 songs. Otherwise, it seems to start but not run, percolate but never boil, and strikes out rather than hits a home run. I think that the song \\"Shoulda Coulda Woulda\\" more aptly describes this disk and should have been its title. if you like blues harp, I would recommend that you try RJ MISCHO instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's that country and that ghetto","review":"Swamp Boogie is a lot like King himself unassuming, not terribly ambitious , yet Soulful and Playful.

I can't quite recommend it to beginners (the author's \\"Sea Monsters\\" is a better pick for neophytes), as there is significant discussion of skeletal details and of the long, often tortuous process that went into describing type specimens; that said, the text is well-leavened by beautiful illustrations, photos and drawings, personal anecdotes, and discussion of the latest theories of how these creatures lived, all of which is accessible.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed enough but approachable","review":"The \\"Oceans of Kansas\\" has turned out be that rare item, something that accurately lives up to it's advertisement.

When May arrived, I knew that I was in trouble, and I borrowed this book from my library, and I absolutely attribute my 5 on the exam to it. The practice questions are extremely similar to the real thing, and the explanations are in the right line of thinking that you have to bring the exam in order to do well, and that's all that this exam is about, just how you think. The essay samples are also really well evaluated, and the book offers a glossary on literary terms that you'll have to know. The book is good for quick preparation (I literally had a little over a week with this book) and long-term practice (which is what I wish I had done instead of freaking out a week beforehand).

Iowans do not go to bed after the 9 o'clock news. The local news is at 10pm. The streets aren't rolled up after the news is over. Yes, farmers work long hours, but they do managed to stay up for the 10 o'clock news. Two opposing views of the town of Newsome are given. One is a small rural town. In the next breath it is large enough for a community college and a tv station? Come on, please paint a realistic picture here. I'd challenge the author to show me a place like this, not just in Iowa, but anywhere in the country. Coaches for athletic teams aren't chosen by a town meeting. Iowa has an excellant educational system, that extends down to the athletic programs. I feel a story that had such potential was wasted by an old, distorted view of the people and places of Iowa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fun","review":"Good movie. Don't look to much into plot.

There is enough T&A; in this film to more than satisfy any adolescent boy's needs for a good long time.Lots of girls on roller skates in high-cut jazzercize-style, one-piece leotards, all with come-hither looks at fortunate Scotty and his carrot top geek sidekick.Lots of out and out toplessness, not to mention full frontal in several scenes.This film should be put in an '80s time capsule for future generations to see just how good we young boys had it during that time.

I saw this movie back in 1984, and countless times on TV and still really enjoy it. I bought a VHS copy of this movie 2 years ago, and it's been replayed on a regular basis. The California sunshine, the beach, lots of bikinis and the funny characters make this a memorable movie. Basically the plot consists of 3 middle-aged men renting a beach house, and the local dude shows them how to \\"dialogue\\" bikini-clad babes known as \\"hardbodies\\" on the beach. It's not a serious movie, just lots of fun. It's a movie that you can watch over & over again which makes it a great choice for buying.

Do not buy these if you have oval ear pieces on your headphones that are 2 1/2 x 2 inches. Very disappointing. Again, not the seller fault. They actually arrived very quickly.

Teresa is often misunderstood, even caricatured, but Medwick strives to show us a clear picture of this woman who was both extremely simple and wondrously complex. Teresa was well acquainted with the world, yet fell passionately in love with her Lord, who called her to look beyond the world into an eternal relationship with Him. Hers was the ancient and ever-new Carmelite experience. I somewhat expected a kind of sneering irony in tone, but, thankfully, I never encountered it, as Medwick did a scholarly and earnest job throughout. Kudos to her, whose account is well researched and compelling, a real-page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver","review":"The progress of St. Teresa's soul is glossed over despite the subtitle. The book effectively describes her progress in establishing convents and monasteries against rather formidable political oppostion but does little to illuminate the nature of her mysticsm. In addition the constant introduction of Spanish phrases seems gratuitous at times as does the introduction of new personalities with little or no background on their connection to Teresa. I found myself thumbing back to see if there was a previous reference to an individual several times. Overall I felt less than enthusiastic about the approach here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a gripping read, really.","review":"Aside from the title of my review, an appealing aspect of this book is that is not simply a hagiography.

There is a sensitivity here, a strange, weighty slowness. One gets the impression that you're not looking at a still picture at all, but a few moments blending into one another, less an instant than idea, a feeling. Grecco captures a complete world; he manages to make a several-hundred year-old, highly public tradition seem private, quiet and secluded.The wrestlers are all men, of course, but the pictures are often disturbingly intimate, delicate, and emotional. Perhaps what has really been captured is the athlete's love for their history and culture -- respect, essentially.The book's text offers a short history of the origins of the sport as well as a subtle and honest look into Grecco's personal experiences during the years spent documenting the event. No doubt, it is the same way that readers will view the photographs."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the fringe, or product weakness?","review":"I am located about 30 miles away from two public radio stations each offering alternative content on one of their HD subchannels.

I enjoy the HD format and a home reciever is much better at reproducing the HD signals that the mobile reciever. It is attractive and easy to set up. Searching for only HD stations in easy. When you shut the Sangean off while listening to an HD channel, it comes back on on the HD channel, most often; twice it has tuned away to another station. Overall, this is almost a great product.But, I could have used a wider angle on the IR remote, instead I had to turn the unit. Pressing preset, then selecting the preset is annoying. One touch would have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, Cheap","review":"The local AM station simulcasts on one of its FM sister's subchannels so I got the tuner to get pre-sunrise reception of that. That worked fine.It doesn't cost too much.I notice on AM that sometimes, with a really good antenna system by the way, I can get AM HD at 500 miles range, around sunrise. It's pretty astounding when the usual distant radio noises are replaced by FM quality sound, albeit only for a few minutes at a time.It's also interesting on AM in thunderstorms. The encoding manages to work right through some static crashes without indicating any hint of them being there, and not others.I'm not an audiophile so have no opinion on the FM HD quality. The programming on FM is awful so I can't get worked up about it in any case.The AM is sort of cute, but since its being there puts out god-awful amounts of noise on AM channels on either side of the station for non-HD receivers, it's very likely that the whole AM scheme will be abandoned sooner or later, or anyway it ought to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Hd Tuner Best Purchased On Sale At 149.99 or Less.","review":"An excellent tuner for picking up Hd channels..The fm quality is very good with excellent selectivity and sensitivity.I picked up 40+fm Stations and 10 hd channels.I payed 129.99 +tax at a local nyc retailer.This unit would fly of the shelves if the unit sold for a lower price point.A best buy when purchased at 149.99 or less Thank You."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"It's refreshing to use a product that works right out of the box; as simple as hooking up a CD player. Two down sides: the LED scroll of the artist/title is painfully slow. Also, if the power fails, the clock and all the presets are wiped out.

We have been using the tuner since December of 2009. It was easy to install and operate. We have not used any station presets because the only station we listen to on the tuner is the public radio classical station. It has a lot of features that would be convenient if we chose to use them. The only downside is that it is made in China. One expects a high end device to be made in the United States, Germany or Japan, otherwise we are completely satisified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disapointment","review":"Along with reception of new HD stations I expected high quality FM & AM to go with my complete top line stereo system. Instead, the HDT-1 gives me very poor quality, even less than a table-top clock radio. Very high output - can only turn amp up to lowest level - and painful to listen to. No response to inquiries from Sangean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads Between the Lines","review":"The Sangean HDT-1 does a good job picking up the few HD stations there are around. I was kind of disappointed with the number HD stations I could tune in to. I live about 20 miles out of Charlotte, NC and I get about 4 HD stations. One is classic rock, one is all comedy cuts, another is classic country and the other is \\"lite\\" music. The ones I've listened to were commercial free though. I know HD radio is fairly new so I think it is a good investment as more stations come around. Excellent product for an excellent price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HD RADIO","review":"Product was delivered before promised time and checked out fine. I was surprised at the number of HD Radio stations available in the area. Why is this not being advertised?? In this area there are 24 hour classical, blues and hip hop stations with no ads. This is the way to listen to radio - no static and no ads. This tuner works great hooked up to my existing stereo and sounds much better than more expensive desk top models. I don't get why this is not catching on. One year ago I walked into the Bose store in downtown Chicago and the people working there had no idea what HD radio was. Oh well - eventually it will catch on and then these stations will have ads so enjoy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HD Radio easy to use","review":"This Sangean HD tuner came as advertised. Easy to hook up to existing system and simple enough to use. As with all tuners, the reception is limited by where the antennae are placed - reception never seems to be where we house our stereo - but on a good day, with the right station, it's a beautiful thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fully pleased","review":"I bought this HR radio tuner for use on my traditional receiver, but decided to use it with my big HDTV. The outputs work fine in the TV audio inputs, and with proper setting the TV screen goes off except to show volume changes or audio adjustments. So I have HDTV and radio together, using the surround sound of the TV. The stereo system remains in another room.The performance startled me when it first came on--I was not used to such sound. The absence of any humming, hissing, or static was breathtaking. The antennae included work great for me--I just listen to local stations and they come in at optimal strength. The only reason for four stars instead of five is the lack of more in the way of outputs--a digital out, for instance, that might carry the station information data out as well as just audio. Also, a secondary output to the CD/DVD/VCR might allow recording a radio program without going back and unplugging things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Davinci disappointment","review":"Davinci tool is way too soft.

You don't need a [price] camera to do that. Buy a Holga for [price] and save some money.My biggest pet peeve about these reviews is that they all talk about low light non-flash photography like it is a new party drug. Hello, you can turn the flash off on your point-and-shoot to get the same effect (the camera will adjust exposure time) and you still have a zoom and fill flash if you want it for the same money.Bottom line is I have about 10 camera and I use the Lomo for very specific photos. If you can only have 2 or 3 cameras, this should not be one of them. Hats off to the Lomo marketing team."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera for the self conscious","review":"These cameras are fun, but they are not great. They're the photographic equivalent of a mono tape recorder that takes 4 big batteries.They may be good for a high school art project but they are not equal to taking good pictures.

The results from using open flash or long exposure soon become boring.However, a good camera if you're trying to chat-up an art school chick.

It is possible to Bracket exposure by changing the light meter settings. Use the \\"A\\" - Auto for all you work.

It was hard at first trying to figure out how to use it, with the steady-handness that you need and the timing that requires a little knowledge about what the light is like, but nail those two things and you're ready to take some awesome pictures.A point and shoot camera is a good thing, but there is something more fun about a Lomo. I took my P/S and the Lomo to Barcelona and took some great pictures with both. I appreciate the encouragement of the spontaneous nature that the Lomo brings out, and I'm guessing you will too.

The overall impression is of a man desperate to impress upon his reader the extent to which he contemplates the minutiae of everyday life. There are some enjoyable interludes in which he entertainingly digresses on the importance of footnotes and ponders the possibility of urinating on someone's head but, sadly, much of this novel is simply stultifyingly tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such Brilliant Description, but to What End?","review":"Baker's \\"Mezzanine\\" came to me highly reccommended by a trusted source, someone with whom I have shared my enjoyment of Delillo and Will Self. I approached Baker's novel optimistically, and was sorely disappointed. Baker's style is indeed unique and his diction is flawless. For this, he is to be commended. What \\"The Mezzanine\\" lacked, however, is anything transcendent. Though, as other reviewers noted, Baker does describe the minutae of our lives in unique ways, he still describes minutae. Perhaps this novel is a postmodern examination of the emptiness of corporate life--postmodern in own emptiness. If so, a short story would have sufficed. After about forty pages, this novel begins to feel tedious. Eventually, one begins to wonder if anything apart from a neurotic impulse was propelling Baker to lengthen this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME ALBUM!!","review":"This album is great!

For starters, this isn't a book. It's a broadside. It's no shorter than 8 pages (if memory serves) but not longer than twenty. It's a chimeral analysis of polarities and dependencies, systems that are flawed at their very core but wouldn't exist in any other state (viz. without Laurel, Hardy would never find himself if the \\"fixes\\" he does and Hardy would have no 'life' without Laurel...) Ultimately, this is a funny little tome with an almost reluctantly serious edge; well worth owning for the sheer delight of pulling it off your bookshelf in the company of a group of Colin Wilson fans who are \\"absolutely\\" certain they're familiar with all his writings.

I had a pair of the black plastic rock 'n roll series plugs. They are made of a thin plastic/rubber compound, which makes them washable and thus reusable. Except for one problem. There is a stem in the middle of the plugs to help insert them into and pull them out of the ear. That stem broke on my other plug the second time I ever used it, rendering the plug unusable. I also found that the plugs were difficult to \\"balance\\", that is, get the same amount of sound filtering in each ear. That could, of course, be an anatomical issue.

Storm Surge has very strong female characters...whether they are strong heroes or villainesses that is for you to find out. No whining here!

The characters are unbelievable, and the plot of revenge just falls flat on the floor with failure. I seriously doubt this wanttabe writer has even been in a police station, and doesn't even know the proper language. I read this on the internet for free, and should never have spent money on it, because not only is is unbelievable, but D2D does lousy editing for their writers. Recommend you buy Peggy J.

She is smart, sexy, and daring, but not necessarily tough.FBI Agent Alex Montgomery is really a pussy cat in disguise, but she is on a mission to avenge her previous lover's murder.These two come together under intense circumstances and hit it off immediately. The story focuses mostly on their romance and includes almost too many sex scenes. There is not a good balance between their relationship and the investigation. However, it is well written and kept my attention (I read it in one night). I didn't understand the need for the predictable plot twist at the end, but I would still recommend the book to anyone looking for a good first novel.

It is a shame she has not been recognized at awards ceremonies. Beth is fun to watch. She's light hearted, quirky and care-free. Seth had a demanding presence when he was in a scene. He is truly a great actor. Trevor was simply awesome. He's very good for being so young!This movie leaves you feeling good when it ends. Even if you ONLY love the breathtaking, panoramic vistas of Sedona, you owe it to yourself to get this movie...on Blu-Ray!

'In Case We Die' combines the rhythmic theatrics of The Fiery Furnaces with a sound that falls somewhere between Frank Zappa/Can-like (you can even throw-in early Beta Band) experimental noodling with the neo-psychadelia of The Flaming Lips or Mercury Rev. There's alot of other subtle stuff thrown in there, NEU, Cornelius, early High Llamas, Apples In Stereo, Belle and Sebastian, Captain Beefheart, Stereolab, a bit of J Rock. I probably missed-out on a few, which I can only pick-up if I listened to it 50 more times.

In the Series, the demons, have a more Futureistic type power. They seem to have a more Alien and Robotic power than the historic type abilities. I won't go into very many detail's, simplely because any true Anime fan will purchase this anyway. I will admit the Artistic value of the series is excellent, Although some charecters seem younger while others seem older. I suggest a try it before you buy it.

Also the plastic wrap around the product was intact but opened at the bottom. Basically it looked like someone bought it, opened it very carefully so they could watch it and put it back together and then resell it.

Not even 2 years old and it no longer worked...wow!

This toaster seemed OK at first... but... the wire connections were not good. After a couple of months the toaster setting stopped working and we had to use the timed bake element, which resulted in lots of burned toast. We were out of the warranty time line for a free replacement. The cost of repair was more than the cost of replacement. I finally gave in and got a new (different brand)toaster oven. After less than 6 months, I am very disappointed with the TRo700S."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible oven","review":"There are many negatives about this oven!1. It is a strange size so many baking dishes that are suppose to fit toaster ovens do not fit this one! I still have not found a good baking dish to fit it.2. The metal rack that is in it does not work well: every time I pull out a pan on the rack, the rack slips out from one side so basically, you have to take your pan out put it somewhere, fix the rack, and then put the pan back in. Very frustrating!3. It burns everything. I have to cover everything I bake so that the top will not burn, including biscuits which is really frustrating because it greatly alters the cooking.I am looking for a different toaster oven now and I suggest you look somewhere else too."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST TOASTER OVEN EVER!!!","review":"Within a week the toast knob broke, then the timer knob got loose. The loudest timer you'll ever hear - sounds like a loud time bomb about the go off, which is appropriate actually. The entire housing is made from metal (nice job, Chinese engineers) so you burn yourself very easily if you're anywhere around it while it's on. Finally, the grounding went out so the entire unit becomes one big current flow, so now you get burned AND shocked when touching it. I'll be calling B&D shortly!!

The toaster oven lasted close to a year. First the oven and oven dial stopped working and within a couple of days the toaster stopped working.It wasn't the greatest to begin with. It toasted the top, but barely the bottom. You had to turn the toast over by hand to get it evenly done, and it had to be set to the max to toast bread at all. The oven temperature was a guess.It was a challenge trying to even contact someone regarding repair/replacement. Black & Decker no longer owns/services their appliances. We spoke to someone at Fox International Ltd who basically said - too bad. Without a receipt (which I didn't have - it was a gift) we were out of luck.I would stay away from any Black & Decker appliances since they aren't really \\"Black & Decker\\" anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hot - dangerous for family use","review":"I purchased this unit from a local retailer.

Well, how many people have counter space, with an electrical outlet, which is not under a counter? I sure don't. Once I turned it on I quickly found out why they recommend this. The unit gets dangerously hot on the outside. So much so, that I returned the unit.If a child placed something on top of the unit, I am quite certain it would catch fire.

Of those two cards, one can no longer can be read on my XP box (coinsidence?).

Add a couple more fine westerns, The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez and The Hanging Tree to the same VHS back-of-beyond..Farnsworth's portrayal of an old ex-con stage-robber turned train-robber is engaging, charming and brilliant. Unforgettable.One of the finest of the fine westerns.

I rented this years ago on VHS and have admired it ever since. My mom and I both were very impressed with it when we saw it in the early 80s. This movie is one of those classics that shows you another perspective about a time in our history. This was the movie that really made me respect Richard Farnsworth's talents. It has superb acting, detailed sets, breathtaking scenery and music, and old trains that are filmed with expert care. It will make you feel as if you have been dropped into a bygone era. This is suited for the whole family. Although Farnsworth's character is a robber, he is a gentleman. An interesting perspective on an older man coming out of prison and finding a new world around him and trying to adjust to it. If you enjoy this be sure to catch Farnsworth in \\"The Straight Story\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent family movie and very enjoyable to watch","review":"I am disapointed that I cannot order this excellent movie.

She describes anguish and dark violence from a remarkably intimate position, almost as if Pilare (the title character and anti-heroine)had sat and whispered her story herself. It is an enchanting and frightening experience, to delve so deeply into the conscience of a beautiful killer through painful nightmare prose.

I have to say I was very impressed. It is uniquely written and does not fall in the norm of old vampire novel's I have read in the past. The combat and battles in the book are magnificent. When I heard first about the wolf scene, which was friend could not stop talking about it seemed that it would not be so real and kind of too supernatural for this young girl to do what she did. But I was greatly surprised. That scene deserves a 10 alone. I was caught from the scene with her sister. Did not expect that in a vampire novel. This book is full of surprises and twists and seductive, and impressive characters. I highly recommend anyone that loves a great story backed up with intersting characters, especially Pilare. you will love you,and at moments hate her. It caught my attention from start to finish.

His insights are trivial and most of the times far from the actual facts; his knowledge of italian society is faulty (at least) and sometimes rather absurd: supermarkets that don't change money and other fantasies prove that Epstein don't know much of this city. I bought this book full of hopes and enthusiasm but in the end I was really disappointed by it. As a roman (a really one, not a pretended one as Epstein) who lives in Rome I found the book and his author quite annoying.Alessandro Cantonetti"},{"rating":"1","title":"If only life for most people was so easy.....","review":"Mr. Epstein obviously has bushels of cash, and plenty of connections with the glitterati. His descriptions of buying a place in Rome, going to dinner parties with his famous personal friends, and his perceptions of la bella figura, etc. are all rather patronizing. While I did enjoy a couple of the chapters, I found that Mr. Epstein's reality in the USA was obviously far different from mine, and so is his reality in Italy. Must be nice to have it all so easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"the same old tired starry-eyed cliches","review":"sorry to demur from the outpouring of unfocused affection, but this book is awful. For anyone who has been for more than a casual trip to Rome, the author disappoints. Every old cliche is dutifully trotted out and dusted off. The language is uninspired, the insights pedestrian and lacking in flair, the egocentricity rampant. A banal addition to the travel bookshelf, fit mainly for those intrepid armchair travellers who prefer their fare pre-chewed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pedestrian effort","review":"I found this book very disappointing - trite, cliched \\"insights\\" into Rome and the Romans. Also, it was quite repetitive, in the manner of the self-help books he writes. He also has that self-help authorial style in that he believes all his observations have the force of revelation. The only good point is that he didn't seem as condescending to \\"the Italians\\" as Frances Mayes.Like another reviewer here, I had many questions that were left unanswered.

Epstein takes you around Rome and Italy as if you were his best friend and he wanted to give you the most memorable experience possible. He reveals the differences between the Italians and the Americans in a very humorous manner, and lets us in on his life and that of his wife and two young sons who attend Italian public school. Alan Epstein is a great storyteller, a gifted writer and has given me a new, refreshing perspective on the Italians. Now I can't wait to go back to Rome and have Alan Epstein escort me around the Eternal City in person.

After reading it, I was left with a strong feeling of dislike for the author's viewpoint. Stale and predictable emotions and unsympathetically told.

Whether on his weekly jog through the centro storico, his discovery of some of the city's hidden treasures, his confrontations with the Roman way of doing business, how his family has adapted to this different lifestyle, you sense his infectious enthusiasm, his passion and joy of just being there.\\" When I return to Roma, Epstein will be there with me.

For about 5+ minutes in the film, there are a couple SWAT officers doing a ridiculous song and dance that makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. What is that about?

If you get this book you will not find out how to read a book, you will not find out why to read a book, you will learn more than you want to know about the random blathering of an outdated, self-absorbed, academic eunich. The book appears to be Professor Bloom's chance to espouse every opinion he ever had and espouse them as gospel requiring no proof or support. He tells me that I should read to discover myself, then he gives a bunch of plot summaries and oblique references to Chekov or Borges. I don't know if I found myself in this book, but I came to my senses after about 80 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's certainly how I read and why","review":"It's not that I think the arguements of those who hate this book are wrong, it's just that I drew something entirely different, and valuable, from this book. I'm thrilled when Bloom expresses more exactly than I can why I read. He champions the aesthetic appreciation of literature, a search for \\"transcendence of limits\\" (Western Canon), rather than treating literature as of value only as an ideological tool or a self-help program. The second reason I appreciate this book is because Bloom inspired me to read several works I wouldn't have read otherwise. For an introduction to The Crying of Lot 49, Miss Lonelyhearts, and the astounding Blood Meridian, I will always thank him."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Brontosaurus Bardolater","review":"If you wake up every morning to lethargy, being unsure whether or not your day will include the latest Survivor or Must See TV, its time you did yourself the favor and purchased How to Read and Why by the fabulous Sterling Professor of Humanites at Yale, Harold Bloom. Bloom's premise is simple, in this new technological era, information is endlessly available to us, but not necessarily wisdom. He proposes a sort of guide book to help us find true wisdom amongst all of the fluff we're regularly exposed to in modern times. The wisdom is found in wisdom literature amongst a genre he refers to as imaginative. The book weaves a tremendous path featuring Shakespeare, Hemingway, Dostoevsky, Faulkner, Keats, Shelley, Dickinson, Stendhal and on and on and on. Naturally, Bloom breathes most life into his beloved Bard from Stratford. The chapter about Hamlet steals the show most magnificently urging you to read once again the greatest story of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master at Work...","review":"Good book, if I had written it - it would have been a great book. But the expectations for Bloom are so high. Everything he writes is worth the effort. It is a better outline of what to read, than how or why. Shakespeare is in a dimension beyond the rest of us, if you realize that now, then some of the book will be redundant. I've read this book twice and got those books he recommended that I didn't have, so that is the finest compliment you can give any book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I expected something akin to Mortimer Adler's How to Read and Why. Instead I found myself dragged into a solipsistic rant of Mr. Bloom's favorite books. To be sure, some may enjoy his discussion of how Cervantes is instrumental to modern literature however this book did not meet my expectations. Instead I got the impression that this is more of a 'vanity' book than anything. Not only is the book mislabeled, it is an irritating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why you can read Shakespeare and skip the rest","review":"This book is a prime example of the Emperor not having any clothes. If you read this book not knowing who the author was, you would throw it across the room in irritation: enough about Shakespeare, when are you going to talk about the novel (play, poem, etc) under discussion. When are you going to stop making emphatic superlative statements and then refuse to back them up with any evidence? When are you going to supply some evidence for any of your opinions and not expect the reader to take it on faith because so august a critic is saying it? (For this part, I guess you WOULD have to know the author).Probably the most annoying and egocentric book of lit crit I have ever read, saved somewhat by its brevity. Only the section on the Romantic poets was useful. As for the rest, might as well take Bloom's advice and read Shakespeare instead. Reading this book is a waste of time (and money)."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Read and Why","review":"Please do not waste your money on this book. Each section is devoted ostensibly to a \\"critique\\" of a work that Mr. Bloom recommends to his unwashed readers. The sections are actually synopses posing as critiques. Furthermore, any critical comments Mr. Bloom does offer are sufficiently esoteric to be useful only to those already tutored in the study of literature. A better title for this book would have been How Best to Earn Money While Resting on Your Laurels."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Critic - same old song and dance.","review":"As America's major 'bookchat' academics, Bloom's latest, 'How to Read and Why', is disturbing and disapointing. If I can be so bold, the book is also hypocritical, stating to leave 'ideology' out of one's reading of literature, by and while pushing the stance that all modern works inevitably lead back to Rome; in this case, William Shakespeare. The curious Kabalist treatise at the end, an ideology in and of itself, is quite disturbing. He damns ideology while pushing his own. Literary criticism has moved on Mr. Bloom. We've discovered it is worthwhile analysing historical context as well as irony, paradox, etc. One can study outside the text as well as the text itself and still enjoy or be inspired or change one's view of existence for the better. Interestingly, I had thought the 'New Critic' school was long gone, or at least incorporated into criticism overall, only to find the old boy's still around.

Steamboat vs. Flair(Wrestle War '89) is a must for any fan. It even shows HHH's debut match where he beats Buck Zumhoff with a Diamond Cutter????(the only time you'll ever see him do that; he was using the Pedigree in WCW and then started doing it in the WWF after his debut match). There's also an easter egg; go the the chapter list and highlight \\"Working Heel\\" and press the right or left arrow button and it shows Hunter talking about the time he put Rocky in a casket and beat him with a sledgehammer.

The main character, Priscilla, is a complex woman, wife and mother whose behavior leaves the reader stunned and saddened. How could a mother commit such a crime? Did this mother in fact commit a crime? Where does the truth lie? Nancy Wright presents the complicated medical and legal facts so clearly that a lay person can grasp the issues and understand the evidence. A decision is rendered in court but the reader must come to his or her own conclusion about Priscilla's guilt, weighing the fascinating, often conflicting information Ms. Wright so effectively presents. Not only is the subject matter compelling, the prose is powerful.

At least your goalkeeper is good enough to keep the score down. The only problem is, your opponent's goalie is equally good.

To make it worse, they failed halfway there and wound up on a larger cruise ship the rest of the way to South Georgia, bemoaning their disappointment the whole way. After reading the account of the Shackleton expedition, I was hungry to see Hurley's film of that amazing journey. Imagine my disappointment to find out this video was, despite what the cover sleeve promised, nothing more than film of a relatively uneventful personal adventure which uses Shackleton's expedition more as an outline for the video's storyline than a reason to produce it in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent thriller!!!","review":"Greg Iles delivers one of the best thrillers I've ever read, if not the best.

It strained credibility from time to time and I took off a star because I found the ending a bit difficult to swallow, but it has enough twists and turns to keep the mind engaged.

It was a puzzler/thriller with the heroine and her FBI sidekick trying to find out who was painting the women and were the subjects really dead. The heroine is likeable and I enjoyed following her exploits.However, the second part of the the plotline devolves to your basic serial/psychotic killer story (I won't get anymore definite to avoid spoilers). I found the very end to be rather sickening and I was left with some images I would rather not have in my head.To sum up - a promising thriller with an interesting female protagonist becomes a horror novel with a creepy violence-against-women ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book PUT Me To Sleep","review":"I tried and tried, but just could not finish this book.

I enjoyed the plotline and it kept me somewhat interested, but the main character, Jordan, was kind of annoying. The author should have let the actions of the character lead us to discovering the character traits of Jordan. It seems the flow of the story slowed as we had to read speeches about what a strong, tough independent woman she was; how she had been in so many dire situations, etc. This could have been done more subtlely in my opinion, not hammered home at every instance. Some of the reviews here say Iles other books are good, so maybe I give his new release a read based on the clever plot here that kind of fell apart at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Read","review":"This was the typical great Iles reading experience.

An absolute must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch story, well read, emotional ending","review":"This story by Greg Iles, as read by Ms. Susie Breck (very attractive, according to the photo on the back of the audio version [abridged]) is a compelling story, well read, and has a very emotional ending. The characters are strong, especially Jordan Glass, as she searches for her sister. The Wheaton character is dark, chilling, and creepy, with a disturbing past.The story moves along at a fairly nice pace. I would also recommend 24 Hours (filmed as \\"Trapped\\" with Charlize Theron) and the Quiet Game. Excellent idea for a movie (better than most out there now)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead and Disappointing","review":"\\"Dead Sleep\\" is a gripping murder-suspense-thriller that leaves you disappointed at the end. While I was addicted throughout the book to the story of the heroine, I was embarassed and mad at Mr. Iles for feeling like he had to tie up every loose-end possible at the end of the book. The story would have ended just fine with the heroine being saved. It's almost as if the ending was tacked-on at the last minute to satisfy the comments from a screening of the novel. I highly recommend buying this book used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill slide for Iles","review":"Greg Iles first few books were well-researched, thought-out, and overall good reads.

I opened this one thinking it would be good. I'm one of those people that gives every book a chance. So i started reading this and i couldnt even get to page 100. I was falling asleep. And i was also annoyed. I didnt like the Jordan Glass character at all. She tries to pull off this tough, gritty persona, and she pretends that she doesnt think she's attractive. Ii'm aware that she is attractive from the beginning, but it keeps going on about it.And she has this habit of thinking that every man she meets is going to make a pass at her. Even when he's not making a pass, she thinks he is. I was just so fed up with this character that I closed the book and put it on my bookshelf for decorative reasons. Hey, its a nice looking book, you know? why not. anyways, i guess I'm looking for something a little more tough and a little more thrilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I found the book to be very gruesome, the main characters not developed at all, except to say she is 40 - if he said that once, he said it 25 times - and the whole plot outlandish.

Aiding the film is its hero Blackheart is still mentally in the 1940s, so a lot of his one liners and asides are made even more humorous in that context.Robert Bogue as the titular character has a smooth delivery, a rugged handsomeness, and a commanding presence. His loyalty and patriotism to the American way of life is admirable considering the lack of such in today's cinema. Christopher Heyerdahl (Habitat) is a fitting villain, reminiscent of Max Von Sydow in Flash Gordon. The monster effects, for a low budget movie, are impressive, and the movie's atmopsheric decadence is commendable. It's an entertaining, sleight of hand movie that bears viewing. It's a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Those Who Find 'Evil Dead' Too High-Concept...","review":"Erik Canuel, who directed (the quite good) \\"Bon Cop, Bad Cop\\", directs this TV pilot, masquerading as a feature film. As a film, it is GOD-AWFUL. As a TV pilot, it is slightly less than mediocre. The lead actor, Robert Bogue, seems to be attempting to channel Bruce Campbell with a raspy voice and dry wit. Unfortunately, he fails miserably, though to be fair, there is only one Bruce Campbell. One redeeming quality is the makeup effects. They are very well-done. Nearly everything else here is soggy and stale. The story is a hybrid of 'Constantine' and 'Captain America', featuring a government-designed, monster-hunting super-soldier frozen in time by his enemies for 50 years. If only this DVD had suffered the same fate..."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Wander!!!!","review":"A story of friendship and love, and how they can both intertwin. Mary Stuart Masterson (Somekind of wonderful) and Mary louise-Parker (Boy's on the side) Displaying fabulous performance's along with Jessica Tandy (Driving miss Daisy) and Cathy Bates (Misery). The whole story surrounding a relationship that can not be defined. My Favourite film ever! However i think some people are wrong with one aspect surrounding Ninny and Idgie. That they are one and the same! Best Quote- \\" Face it girl's.... I'm older and have more insurance\\"A film for any Mary Stuart masterson Fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"an incredible classic","review":"One of the best classics ever from the 90s. Emotional, heart breaking, encouraging and amazingly funny. It can touch your heart so deep and you go from an emotion to another over and over. When you have a teardpop on your cheek, you can find yourself laughing. It is also a great pleasue to watch all of the 4 leading ladies. They are unbeliable! Especially Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy.I've seen this movie many times and will see lots more because time to time, I know I'll feel like to see and hear Idgie's story again.It just captures you and hold you there. You should have it!TOWANDA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece.","review":"I can't believe some people have this movie a negative review. How can you hate this movie? I love it, regardless of how many times I've seen it. The story itself is beautifully told. Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, and the two Marys are perfect in these roles. I grew up watching this movie and it only gets better. I wish I had a friendship like these women.I like this DVD, too. I'm a sucker for special features, and this DVD is packed with them. The featurettes and cast interviews were very enlightening and I enjoyed learning more about the production. Fannie Flagg should be very proud of what her book turned into."},{"rating":"1","title":"After all the great reviews I was disappointed","review":"After reading all the great reviews about this movie I was disappointed to see what I saw. Don't take me wrong. I love chick flicks, but this one in particular just does not seem to be right.Although the problems (like the racism and the domestic abuse) touched upon in this movie are real, their depiction in the movie is weak and forced and somehow lifeless. I understood that the creators of this movie wanted to say but they did not persuade me.Maybe this movie just did not age gracefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending rings false.","review":"This movie was entertaining up until the end, which I felt was totally unbelievable. It ruined the whole thing. I hate movies that let you down at the conclusion. It makes for a rotten feeling, like you've been betrayed. This, and another movie I can think of, \\"Two Mules for Sister Sara\\", left me with the same bad vibe. Lousy."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many emotions","review":"This movie evokes so many different emotions.

It is the only movie to make me cry,(in some parts) It also had me laghing.I would recomend this movie to anyone. An all time favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Solid , Excellent Performance By Mary Stuart Masterson!!!","review":"This is kind of a \\"movie within a movie \\" as Jessica Tandy relates her early years to Kathy Bates who is in a troubled and sad marriage. A murder occured years ago in a small Southern Town and Ms. Masterson plays Idgie Threadgood , a strong willed young woman with a keen sense of Justice.This movie is very engrossing thanks to the performances of all of the actors and I think it is a real shame that Ms. Masterson never got to achieve Major Movie Stardom which she most certainly deserved . It seems that the Movie Going Public only feels comfortable with the \\"girl next door \\" types such as Sandra Bullock and Meg Ryan whereas talented and beautiful actresses such as Ms. Masterson and Catherine Mary Stewart never get the acclaim that they deserve.I guess that just about sums up Tinseltown where everything is an Illusion and nothing is really what it appears to be. 5 stars for this movie ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Movie","review":"Heartfelt and Lovely, this movie is a fistful of emotions for you.

Without getting long winded like some of the other way too long reviews, I can sum it up in a couple sentences: If you like a combination Drama, Comedy, Suspense & even Thriller, you will like Fried Green Tomatoes. If you don't mind watching a movie that takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride than you will like Fried Green Tomatoes. I will watch this movie over an over again the rest of my life, most likely, you will too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Acting Is Terrific","review":"I think this is a wonderful movie. Jessica Tandy's acting got better with age. Kathy Bates is such a versatile actress. Her performance in this movie is outstanding. A movie to be watched over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOWANDA!","review":"I've read Fannie Flagg's book which eventually became this movie. The book was very good and this video is even better. It brings to life this small sleepy town and its characters. The acting was fantastic.Better yet is the opportunity to visit the small community where the film was made. That's right--go to Juliette, Georgia to see Smokey Lonesome's shack. See that fabulous barbeque pit where Frank Bennett became so tasty even though he was a dispicable man. See the headstone of Buddy Jrs arm. Tour Ruth & Idgy's home. Look at the spillway where Idgy fished and the railroad tracks that took Buddy's life and Buddy Jrs arm. BUT most importantly--enter The Whistlestop Cafe and sit down for an order of Fried Green Tomatoes. That's right--the cafe is there and open to the public. You'll never forget your visit to this little community. AND it will help even more to bring to life this wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classis","review":"I have given this movie many times as gift ( you only gift movies you love to friends) this movie is a classic - I lived in the South and loved the culture, the people and the food - if you want to sit back and watch a remarkable movie - choose this one - the lives of women you can't help but admire.

Jessica Tandy, Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Mary-Louise Parker carry the wonderful story by Fannie Flagg to perfection..it is SOUTHERN, beautifully shot, of a lost time when character was KING and people rose to the occasion. Jessica Tandy shines...what a pleasure to watch her interact with Kathy Bates, narrating the long ago story of the Whistle Stop Cafe which became the heart of a tiny town. Charming and compelling, always a trip to a better time...nostalgic and true. You will never tire of watching it.The Secret is in the Sauce...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, Charming, Funny -- super great fluff movie","review":"If you're looking for an evening of great entertainment that will make you laugh and cry, this is the movie for you. As many times as I have seen this movie, I still find it as fresh, funny, warm, and yet just enough suspense to make it interesting. What a rare mix of emotions. Finally a movie out of Hollywood that isn't blood, gore, sex, sex, and more sex. Pur entertainment. A movie that when it's over, you feel like you have definitely been enterained!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent portrait of the novel","review":"fried green tomatoes is a wonderful and touching film about life in the south during the 30's and 40's.

A very well formulated story line is accentuated by superb acting - particularly by the main characters.Placing anything in order of merit is a mugs game - so much is variable. However, in my estimation 'Fried Green Tomatoes' comes in the top 10% of movies ever made in the English speaking world - to date.It is most enjoyable, if one likes fine acting and a rollicking good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome movie!!!","review":"this was an awsome movie but the ending was way different in the book ninny died and idgie lived a few miles away and sold honey with julian.I also wish they would have gone into more depth in Idgie and Ruths relationship because in the book it was way more obvious that Idgie and Ruth loved each other for real even though in the book they had no intimicy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've seen it several times and I love it more each time","review":"I love movies with a historical theme and this movie shows life in the early years of the 1900's and through the depression era.The two main characters - Ruth and Idgy (sp?)are very strong women who have hard lives but continue to rise above their challenges and not lose their humanity and compassion. These woman are interesting because they show their willingness and ability to take a strong moral stand and not back down - even when their very lives are threatened.And the characters are all so interesting and believable. It is quite an intense little movie.Leaves you thinking about the characters, long after the movie has ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! The Collector's Edition with extra footage!","review":"It's about time that the studio put out this movie in it's extended version. There are several scenes that help to flesh out the friendship between Evelyn and Ninny, and bring the movie to a much more completeness, that were not seen in the theater-released version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and entertaining","review":"There is some questionable material but...over all it was entertaining. My wife enjoyed it more then I did. It was ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Fried Green Tomatoes","review":"One of my favorite movies of all time. Love it and highly recommend it!

Even if you've seen the movie several times before!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational...TOWANDA!","review":"I filled my lap with sodden Kleenex the first (and the second, and the third...) time I entered the world of this magical story.

One of the very best of its time staring the award winning Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates. Watch as an unhappy house wife played by Bates befriends Tandy in a nursing home. Tandy tells her of a tell of laughter, devotion and a frienship that defies all obstacles. Bates becomes addicted to the story and returns time after time to find out what happens. As the story is told it helps bates to become a stronger woman and to stand up for herself.Tandy spins the tale well and draws you in to al the lies, the murder and cover up at the Whistle Stop.This is a movie you will watch again and again.The acting id superb!

Unfortunately, watching it was an endurance challenge. The movie lacks any sort of compelling story line. It essentially drives home the message that Robinson (aka Bojangles) was a gambling, womanizing s.o.b. I don't expect the film makers to rewrite history, but as presented the story didn't take us anywhere. Yes, the tap sequences by Hines and Glover are great, but they would have been greater without the packaging of the \\"story.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Call that man Bojangles","review":"This movie was awsome.

Even though magic was rasied by his uncle Benny, Clear's ideologies superseded everything he had been taught. Which is how it is in real life.

Love it more every time I see it. Would watch it if only for the stunning John Barry score. I think he stole most of it from his Out of Africa score, but, in fact, I like this one better. There's a story that Selleck didn't really like this film, but I don't understand why. The flying, the action and the characters are irresistible! Just let me join the chorus that can't understand why this great family friendly film is not available on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"high road to china","review":"one of the best movie experiences I have had. Good story line wonderful actors. Tom Selleck and Bess Armstrong have that presence on the screen that I last saw and enjoyed with Gable and Colbert when I was a kid.

The rich spoiled heiress (Bess Armstrong) hires Patrick O'Malley (Tom Selleck), a washed-up former World War I aviator with an alcohol problem, to take her to China. Of course, nothing will be easy for these two misfits...including getting along with each other.Such is the premise of \\"High Road to China\\", one of Tom Selleck's rare forays onto the big screen. The movie didn't get much attention during its original theatrical release, but it is a fun movie that deserves a second look. There are some great flying sequences featuring World War I bi-planes, lots of action in China, a 1920's setting with all the trimmings, and a predictable but family-safe romance. Veteran character actor Jack Weston does a great job as O'Malley's faithful aircraft mechanic. \\"High Road to China\\" is recommended to Tom Selleck fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"high road to china","review":"Very entertaining.

Reds are too intense, especially for Tom Sellack's face. The biggest disappointment though is the musical score. In the VHS version the score is one of the great strengths of the movie, hauntingly beautiful. It is flat in this DVD version. The last scene and the credits sound positively \\"fuzzy\\". Since our old VHS tape is terribly worn, we have ordered a new tape and will never watch this miserable effort again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"First, I love the movie itself. The reason for the bad rating is that I have received two copies of the blu-ray version and the sound does not work on either of them.

The duo Amstrong/Selleck works very well and the photography is superb. With all due respect to \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", the plot of \\"High Road to China\\" is much more credible; it was the 1920's and there was truly a war between British India and Afghan chieftains. There were also warlords ravaging China as the movie depicts. And any woman has to love the ending - \\"I should have sold you while I could\\".Although \\"High Road to China\\" has not been produced by the major studios, it is available in a \\"universal\\" DVD format which works in Region 1 DVD players. I can atest to that as I bought one from Animefirst.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring It Back on Widescreen DVD","review":"Enough said about this movie.

The sound quality is so bad that at times it is difficult to recognize the voices of Tom Selleck and Bess Armstrong.

It does give you the 1920s feel, however, and that was, I believe, the point.The thing I always like about Tom Selleck movies is he's believable in the part, and doesn't over-act. It's never about him, personally, but about in keeping within the character and the period. I have watched him in everything from cowboy movies (Crossfire Trail) to \\"Magnum PI\\" and the Jesse Stone movies, and he's always realistic within the confines of the character and the period.I love watching this movie at night when I'm looking for something to cuddle up and enjoy. It's about the time, and the characters and the adventure.

The story is fun and while I am not a film critic, I do know what I like. I looked a LONG time to find this movie and that is not something I do often. For me to take time to SEARCH for a movie and then to buy it in VCR version when I already have 2 perfectly good DVD players and am already considering a BluRay player is unheard of.

This is the way they should make movies. Also starring Jack Weston as an Ace Mechanic and Wilford Brimley, Robert Morley, Brian Blessed, Cassandra Gava, and Peter Llewellyn Williams.

It's the only case I could find with that feature. It saves so much room. The case could stand to be a little larger but otherwise this thing is the best you'll find. Actually, it's practically the only thing you'll find specifically for transporting the PS2 other than the more expensive hard case units (which IMO don't hold any more gear.) You can fit the slimline PS2 console, two controllers and all power and A/V cables in the main compartment. There is a mesh pocket in the lid that will store at least 4 memory cards. The front pocket will hold 16 game disks and several manuals. The case seems to be very well made and comes with a carrying strap.

Both did the exact same thing. After using it for a very short time (once or twice for a few minutes each time), it stops working properly. The brush barely moves as if it's stuck. There was hardly any pet hair in it, but I cleaned it out and had the same problem. Even when it worked, it didn't work great. Makes a lot of noise but doesn't do a whole lot. It does not work well when used on bedding, as there is no way for air to flow, so it locks up the brush. It worked better on furniture that was a more rigid construction. As soon as their is looser fabric, it loses power. I have yet to find one of these things that work well. Years ago I had one that looked very much like the Rug Rat but it was made by Kirby. It also had a vent slide on the side to control air flow. It was awesome! I had it for many, many years.

The only option is to turn off the phone, but it does not turn back on until she removes the battery which is really a pain.I have contacted Cingular but so far dissapointed with customer service as the person answers the phone takes all the information and then promises a call back.

After one days use, I went home, put it in the box, called cingular to tell them I was returning it and haven't regreted it since. I kept hitting the camera button, it did not feel comfortable on my face when I was talking on the phone and the 'new age' antenna is a load of you know what. After I got it in the mail, I realized how ugly of a phone it was and the technology aspect never really won me over.

This phone sucked. It looks good but the design has a fatal flaw. The camera button is located at such a spot that when you pick up the phone and open up the flip, you will touch it. You will touch it even when you are on the phone talking. My husband once used my phone to make a call and took more than 10 photos when holding the phone talking. His hand is too big for this phone to avoid touching the phone. It became very annoying.Also, I had dropped calls often with this phone, but I was not sure it was the phone's problem or the service problem. By the way, Cingular's customer service sucks too. They close on Sundays and also close after 9pm on weekdays. On Saturdays they are on a shortened schedule.

Needless to say we are both disappointed with the poor quality. The main problems we encountered are:1) The phones will go into a weird state at random; The phone appears to be working but will not receive calls or make calls. The only way to get the phone to work again is to physically remove the battery and then replace it. When the phone reboots it will work.2) The camera quality is poor and the images are compressed too much. Plus, because of where the camera button is located, it is fairly easy to unknowingly take dozens of pictures of the inside of your pocket or purse.3) One of the phones died after 11 months. The inside screen was toast.I am surprised that some people actually like this phone.

To my dismay, I wish I would have gotten a razr.I am extremely careful with my phones and I've never dropped it until a couple weeks ago. Regardless, this phone started giving me trouble after having it for only 2 months. I live in an AT&T; coverare area, yet it frequently drops calls or I couldn't connect to the person I was calling. The biggest problem I had was that it would constantly freeze and I'd have to take out the battery to reset the phone. Additionally, for those concerned with pictures, the quality of pictures on this phone are terrible.I did, however, like the bluetooth capabilities with the phone, as well as the arm support that the intenna provided.All in all, I would not recommend this phone to anyone at all - the Razr, although over-hyped, is much better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Phone","review":"I actually got this phone at the Cingular store. It has been the worst phone I've ever owned in my life. I read somewhere that the software that runs this phone has memory leak issues, and I am here to say IT DOES. After the phone has been on for a day or so without being shut off and turned back on, the ring tone starts to skip like a record with a scratch in it, then when I go to my menu of items, black squares appear where the icons should be, the games won't load up and there have been many times when I couldn't hear the caller, etc.Please buy another phone. I still trust the Sony name, but I am weary of their phones after this experience. Can't wait to get another phone. The Nokias and Motorolas I had in the past never had issues like this piece of s**t."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice, poor software and connections...","review":"For a relatively basic flip, this phone has been an absolute disaster. Call quality is great, yet for some reason at around 20 minutes, it loses its connection to the towers, the bars drop to zero, and I get disconnected. Every time.It will often display 5 bars of coverage, drop to zero the moment you dial out and not connect, and then go back to 5 bars.Basically the phone is useless on Cingular unless you have perfect coverage. Perhaps I have older firmware or something, but it is not like I should have to worry about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"I loved my T616 for years and was looking forward to the upgrade, but the Z520a is not the phone to get. The problem is the stupid camera button the left side near the hinge is just to easy to activate (pressed for more than a second) with the phone open or closed. I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift, but I will be returning it for a RAZR. At least the RAZR opens much easier and the buttons are on the side of the screen and not the keypad so you don't haved to worry about where your fingers are while opening the phone or during the call. You also can't change the menu layout on the Z520a so all the Cingular pay services are only one click away ($'s). The RAZR at least lets you view menu in list form and change the order so useful and free items are first like calendar and contacts. Like on the S/E W600i, Cingular only gives you useless demo games. Signing up for a 2yr contact is not good enogh for a free game I guess from Cingular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phone .... highly recomended","review":"After reading the reviews here on Amazon I had mixed feelings on whether to get this phone or not. There are some very positive reviews and some strongly negative ones. I went ahead and got it and I LOVE THIS PHONE. Its just pefect. Small and light and easy to use and lots of features.

The phone has everything we wanted, quad band, blue tooth and a camera. My biggest problem is the continual inactive smart chip errors that occur. I need to reboot the phone several times a day. Neither Cingular nor Sony knows what is going on. My second problem, which others have noted, is the poor location of the camra button. The software needs to be changed, so that the camera can only work after activation through the menu. (This is an easy firmware fix for Sony, if enough people complain about it. )"},{"rating":"1","title":"I dropped this phone ONE TIME","review":"Even if you're careful, you might occasionally drop your phone.

The real photographs of tracks, scat, den sites, and kill sites of mammals (and birds) are second to none.I reference this book often in the field while hiking. I live in New Jersey where the bobcat is an endangered species, and thanks to this book, I was able to accurately identify both a bobcat's den and a recent kill site on a rocky ridge in a nearby state park. It was quite an exciting find.I would recommend this book time and time again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great illustrations and descriptions","review":"This book has very clear pictures and descriptions.

It is a great resource to use when you see tracks or scat and want to know what animal left them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tracking Guide Available","review":"This guide is without a doubt, the most comprehensive and scientifically accurate of any guide currently available for mammal tracks in North America. It is an amazing piece of work that will be a valuable addition to any naturalists bookshelf. I have read this book cover to cover several times and am always revisiting it as a reference and still I find new jewels of information buried in its pages. I disagree with the reviews that this book should have photos of the animals. With nearly 800 pages, this book is already pushing its binding to the limit. The limited space is better served being dedicated to tracks and sign as there are numerous other guides to mammals that have photos.Great book... buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Guide to Mammal Sign Out There","review":"While this isn't always that convenient as a \\"field guide\\" because of its size, I still take it out with me all the time.

Indeed,... it is really sticky and the use of some powder helps very little, because the \\"stickiness\\" remains and it is imposible to get a good setting for your mold. Even worst, when you want to separate the Master from the mold, if it comes off without a part of your new mold would be a miracle!. Another thing, they say that the mold will remain flexible after cooking at the right time and temperature, something wich I did- and this is not true at all,....in my case, after the third use I did of the mold made with this product it was alrady brittle and useless.

What I saw in this movie was probably the most weakest willed man in the entire history of France, a nation known for being weak willed.

I knew of a few Killers songs but after I saw a couple of sets from this show on TV next thing you know I'm on here and have bought the Blu Ray disc and a player to go with it. Have been absolutely cranking this repeatedly the last few nights straight. Brandon Flowers is such a presence on stage and the show just absolutely rocks. Could be the best concert I've ever seen, especially when I didn't know 90% of the songs.Solid recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!!","review":"I do not consider myself as a die hard Killers fan but after watching this DVD, I am now a true Victim! I saw snippets of this video in VH1 as a 30 minute teaser. Comparing that to the Blu-Ray version, Blu ray was definitely superior with the clarity of the images. I could literally count the beads of sweat running of Flower's brow. Audio quality was good but I think I need to upgrade my soundsystem to fully appreciate the music.A wonderful musical experience. Can't wait for the Killers to come back home and see them live.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocking Killers!","review":"The Killers Live from Royal Albert Hall is pure rocking from start to finish. No fanciful sets or costume changes but Brandon Flowers and band mates are full of energy and the setlist is extremely tight, alternating between their big hits and eclectic tracks. Rock to Human, Somebody Told Me, Mr. Brightside, When You Were Young, Smile Like You Mean It and much more. At the end of it, you will find yourself exhausted, jumping and singing along with them, right in the comfort of your home.The disc itself plays hi-def quality crystal clear on your HDTV and the sound is impeccable as you blast it through the speakers. And I must say whoever designed the interactive menu has created one of the best and most appealing navigation experience ever on a blu ray disc. Would have wished that they included all their videos to date as extras. Still, this is nothing less than the best!

It's clear they made an investment in producing a state of the art concert film here, and in effect have set a high bar for other bands to reproduce. The visuals are stunning within Royal Albert Hall, with the cameras taking you on a journey from an empty venue to them taking the stage. The sound is amazing, and if you have a surround system, THIS IS the benchmark for testing out your system. Their body of work holds up well over the whole concert. No duds, but for me, some new thoughtfully written songs that I now know!One review I read online by a music critic compared this to Elvis Presley's Hawaii concert film. A very good comparison. However, The Killers, benefit from digital technology that perfects the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy","review":"This cd/dvd combo is exactly what I had hoped it would be. The live concert dvd is really amazing and the cd was a nice perk, I wasnt even aware the two were included together.

I suggest this cd/dvd to anyone was has yet to see a Killer's live show and is searching for the next best thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concert","review":"I've never seen the Killers live but really loved this dvd.

But my sub-woofer stay quiet, and it works perfectly with another shows I have. Even raising the sub channel level of my receiver, the bass sound makes almost no vibration in my room. When I change the soundtrack to stereo PCM, everything sounds normal like a real The Killers' show, but in DTS-MA the bass is a problem, don't expect much more than a whisper from your sub..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are you waiting on?","review":"Going in, I could only name about four songs that the Killers sang. I bought the blu ray concert because I read the audio and video were top notch. I wasn't disappointed. The last song, When You Were Young, by itself, is worth the price of admission. Incredible performance in an amazing concert hall. The DTS audio is clean enough to enjoy at concert-like volume and makes it easy to believe you are actually there in person. What are you waiting on? Add this to your collection, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I ordered this DVD based on the rave reviews.

One day, she finds upon a deserted cottage in the woods. As she secretly repairs the cottage and garden, it almost seems like having a place to call her own may fill the emptiness inside of her--even though she sometimes has to lie and steal to keep her project a secret. But when she gets seriously ill with no one to find her, Mandy discovers that a house isn't a home without people who love you.Mandy is a lovely story about one girl's search for love and family. Edwards' descriptions of Mandy's hard work and the beauty of the outdoors set the scene for a simple story about how things--even very special ones--just aren't enough without a clear conscience and people we care about. Readers may be delighted to know that Julie Edwards is a pen name for Academy-Award-winning actress Julie Andrews."},{"rating":"2","title":"My name is also Mandy, and I am 10 years old.

The story of how it came to be is almost as good a story as the book itself.Long available in paperback, this new edition of MANDY is part of The Julie Andrews Collection. It is a beautiful presentation with updated illustrations.The book is a wonderful read. I read it when I was a child, and I recommend it to others. Julie's other book from the '70's THE LAST OF THE REALLY GREAT WHANGDOODLES is also delightful.This book is perfect for a read aloud if your child is smaller, but it's also great if they are an independent reader. As an adult, I still enjoy reading it myself -- I've read it several times over the years, and it just keeps getting better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure found","review":"I read this book when I was in elementary school and have been looking for it ever since.

Now, I will finally be able to share this book with my daughters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandy","review":"I am a student at Waldron Mercy Academy. (ADH)The story takes place in a stone orphanage close to the woods. In the orphanage lives a 10-year-old girl named Mandy. Secretly Mandy's heart pounds for a family and a place to call home. One day Mandy follows her heart and travels in the woods. There in the woods she finds a cottage and a little garden. Mandy loves it so much that she dreads leaving. When she gets back to the orphanage she swore herself to secrecy. Soon Mandy falls terribly ill and is forbidden to leave the orphanage. Whenno one was around Mandy sprints towards the cottage. Outside Mandy hears loud crashing thunder and is so sick she can't even move. The only person who can reach her is a secret admirer.This book kept me reading from page 1 to end. You should defiantly read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dull","review":"I read this book to my 10 year old and found it to be DULL.

Andrews-Edwards' writing style is stilted, unnatural, and boring. The plot is almost non-existant and ridiculously predictable. There are no issues explored or presented in this book. There are so many wonderful children's authors out there - Jerry Spinelli, Kathryn Zeatley Snyder, Sharon Creech, Gary Paulsen, Lois Lowry, David Almond, Louis Sachar, and many, many others. Mandy is nothing more than airy cotton candy for the reader. Let's give our children more nutritious reading matter than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap-Dirty-Falling apart","review":"I bought this book for a girlfriend of mines gift.

Great value for money as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"From The Golden Age Of British Dance Bands","review":"This 2-CD set comprises 50 tracks and delivers over two-and-a-half hours of music for half the price of one normal CD. It sounds too good to be true, and has been achieved by combining two earlier separate CDs, AVC 539 and AVC 632. The track listing omits personnel and recording dates, and the liner note is minimal, but sound quality is excellent and some of these tracks have not been reissued since their original release. It could be argued that others are too familiar, and that a few do not merit \\"essential\\" status, but that would be to look a gift horse in the mouth, because overall this is an excellent compilation. Whether or not to buy it must depend partly on how many of these tracks you own already, but with that small proviso it is heartily recommended.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hi Leweez10, Its ME again!","review":"O.K.

Microsoft actually got it right with Internet Explorer, capturing circa 90% share because it was a better browser than netscape and the like. However, instead of keeping up that way, they wanted to rule the internet with monopolistic tricks, boycotting other products and Front Page was not an insignificant element in this strategy as in those days the way you built a website was seen as another (or \\"the\\") way to force users to use internet explorer. Again...no push, no services, no embedded java, nothing like that, therefore you couldn't use the very basic internet features of the day. I remember having gone to flash and dreamweaver because of that.

Many of the options that supposedly work for an IBM are not available or don't work for the Mac user, which further frustrates those who are new to Front Page 98.

If you are in a situation where it is impossible to watch TV due to the glare then this product will make it possible to watch without glare. If your intent is to reduce the glare during daylight TV watching then I suggest find other means to filter the light. We scraped the coating off the first night due to the degraded picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works.","review":"It does work. I would only use it on an older TV. I used on my old Sony 32\\" Trinitron. That's an easy TV to do because, while it is curved, it is only curved in one direction.Be prepared -- you're picture will be fuzzed. But, if you are just trying to make an old glass screen TV work for you in a room with a lot of glare... it works great. Increase the sharpness and brightness. It will seem odd at first but live with it a while before scraping off. There isn't a lot of detail in a regular TV anyway and you'll see that you are just losing the illusion of detail.Do not use this product indoors! My TV is heavy and I opened all windows for ventilation and had to evacuate the house the rest of the day! It is nasty stuff. :-(I recommend putting marks along the tape (you tape off around the screen) to guide the spraying back and forth.

The book was full of day-to-day techniques that you and I are using everyday in our lives, though without being aware so.I give it four stars since the auditor was able to structure those common techniques into a framework, a clear and concise one. The framework itself is interesting too. The auditor considered that our choice of speech was related to power situation. The power network and stiuation shaped our speech style and our style would at the same time impact the situation. Thus, an intentional carefully chosen style of speech might help to change the situation in the way we want.This is perhaps the most insightful and useful idea of this book.Not a classic book on communication skills but still worth reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"This book was full of everyday scenarios, which were interpreted in a very narrow way to show the author's point.

Amir works his g-synth amazingly, twisting the sounds to create a new feel. Although not as finely manicured as VT, I must say, I like Candyass better. One thing I really like is that Jay actually USES his voice, instead of just screaming into the mic, it ads a melodic catch to the CD. I must say, I think the weakest point of the CD is Blue Monday, mostly because it's Orgy playing it, but it isn't ORGY, if anybody understands that.

If any of you who marvel at the originality of Orgy's sound are at all interested in seeing where this comes from, try some of these bands: KMFDM, Crocodile Shop, The Sisters of Mercy, Ministry (early), Front Line Assembly, Alien Sex Fiend, NIN, etc. I'm not saying Orgy is terrible, but it is very obviously a corporate construct designed to make Jonathan Davis rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard rock for candyasses","review":"Wow, gotta love their cover of New Order's Blue Monday, with its pulsing super-distorted guitars joining the synthesizer lines. Unfortunately, the songs that the band wrote for themselves don't fare as well. The album doesn't start off too shabbily, with Social Enemies and Stitches being quite listenable. It also finishes off well with the sparsely written but undeniably catchy Dizzy. The majority of the tracks in the middle, however, are so boring and uninteresting that you find yourself just staring into space and not even listening. I can't listen all the way through about half of these songs. The ones I can aren't terribly special anyway. Best songs - Blue Monday, Platinum, Stitches, Dizzy. Worst Songs - Dissention, Revival, the 10th one (so forgettable I don't even know the name), I'm too lazt to write the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's alright","review":"Well I bought this CD at a garage sale for 1$ because I liked Blue Monday and well for 1$ I'll buy pretty much anything.

For a band with so much emphasis on synths and electronics, the vast majority of Candyass is not danceable or catchy; instead it seems as though they've tried to carve out a niche for themselves by attempting to create \\"artsy\\" synth-rock instead of an accessible product. As a result, most of this album is discordant and jarring. I give it two stars for being pretty unique and having a number of good ideas; but overall, this cd rarely receives any play time from me.

Their guitars sound just as bad as someone scratching their nails on a chalkboard, so can you imagine them going on and on in all twelve songs? Plus the beat to many of these songs are just plain bad and amplify the grotesqueness of their horrid guitar sound. The lyrics aren't bad, I guess, but I think if Orgy wants to stay in the game, they need to change their sound (probably with different guitars) and make some better songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Great tracks but thats about it!","review":"Orgy is a very impressive group and they have a few songs to prove it. Stitches and Blue Monday are great songs, but the other songs aren't all that great. If your a big fan of Korn you may wanna look into this cd, i did. There isn't much to say about the cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Death Pop is here to stay!","review":"I must admit that the only reason I purchased the Cd is for the \\"Blue Monday\\" cover. After actually listening to the other songs on the CD, I soon found other songs to love. The sound of every track on Candyass offer something fresh and new, but I do agree that some of the lyrics sound kind of pointless and odd. I for one do like \\"Social Enemies\\" even though the lyrics are weird as hell. Other cool tracks are Stitches, Fetisha, Revival and Dizzy. Most of the other tracks are forgettable. This Cd is a must have for anyone tired of mainstream alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a must have","review":"I think that this CD is a nessecity for everyone. The WHOLE CD was exellent; not a bad or mediocre song on there. I actually listen to all the songs on there, which is a rarity for me. To everyone who hates Orgy: You obviously have no taste AT ALL. They're the first original band to come out; not at all like all the KoRn wannabes & such. Anyhoo, I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is awesome!","review":"this cd sounded great! i love orgy's unique style and jay gordon's vocals are great! his voice is hipnotizing. the guitar players also sound great with their unique sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for stirring up the blood.","review":"ORGY has definitely put together an album which breathes life into your body. A great album to drive to, the original riffs and beats on each track stay far from monotonous and keep the flow fresh. ORGY does not sound anything like NIN or KORN, so I don't know why people keep on comparing them. ORGY is one-of-a-kind and should appeal to those who are into techno, hard electronic rock, or just wish for a gust of fresh air. Now get in your car and start driving!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD NO DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST EVER!","review":"ORGY'S CD CANDYASS, is one of the best CD's I have ever bought. It is a great and intelligent CD, I love KoRn but I gotta say ORGY is better. I love the mix of Techno and Metal present in most tracks(Social Enemies, Pantomime to name a few)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks my Socks","review":"This cd is one of the best i own... Orgy is tallented and actually says intelligent things. They arent all like \\"die die die i hate you\\" so thats kool with me... although i do like bands like that.... they are rock/techno/metal every thing i freakin love them.... ... that would be so awsome... so what im trying to say is that Candy ass is a ...cd so go out and buy it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revival","review":"This is a great album with the exception towards the end the songs sound the same, but it is a very cool sound. Anybody who likes techno will enjoy this album no doubt about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff rocks!","review":"Orgy is probbably the most unique band there is. All the people I know who have heard of them, describe them as unique. The name can definately turn you off, but once you find out their meaning you understand they're style a little better. with their unique look and style, it gets you curious and then you get hooked! They are definately starting a good thing. I hope they have a long, successful life of music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"orgy rules","review":"although this cd box set was only sold in europe and other countries outside of the US i think that it is a fine piece of guitar work and you've gotta love orgy for that. the only thing wrong with it is the fact that the songs not at the beggining or end of the cds are really boring but other than that id reccomend this to anyone.it may be expensive but trust me....BUY THIS NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"With huge expectations, I purchased this CD and was dissapointed to find it bland and sorry. The only winner on the entire album is \\"Stitches\\", a soulful, strangely sexy and seductive number. The rest of the CD is too metalic, venturing into \\"cheese goth\\". Don't get me wrong, I respect Orgy and believe their hearts are in the right place, but comparing them to Depeche Mode or Nine Inch Nails? I'm sorry...maybe their next album will have the sexy venom of \\"Stitches\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is definitely great but it could be better. . . . .","review":"when i first heard orgy's first release off the album \\"blue monday\\" it was 1 of my all time favorite songs. the beat was GREAT and vocals were also. when i bought the cd i was a little disapointed at how a lot of the songs sounded the same. however i do recommend it because hearing the songs \\"dizzy\\" and \\"social enemies\\" and a few others makes it completely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this album is knu wave music that everyone will love","review":"this album is kutting edge metal/electronica that all fans will absolutly adore. from full feeling balads such as Stitches...to upbeat dance classics like Blue monday, and deep, thoughtful lyrics as in Revival, theese guys have it all covered. buy the cd and check it out for yourself. youll soon find out that you love them just as much as we do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New band hits big with \\"Candyass\\"","review":"Techno-Metal has a new name on the list: Orgy; and with their albumn \\"Candyass\\", get themselves a high spot in the world of Metal. This cd features several diffrent styles of music, ranging from straight Heavy-Metal to Punk/Techno. An excellent buy for anyone who likes either of the above."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD ROCKS!!!!!!!!","review":"i absolutly LOVE this CD. it rocks so much. Jay Gordon is so hot, i also love how he holds his microphone with the cord around his neck. I really love the Blue Monday song...I love the video too, yeah BABY yeah!! p.s. I am going to see Orgy on the MTV campus invasion, oh yeah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a couple of listenings to appreciate.","review":"I first came across Orgy when I heard Jay Gordon singing Slept So Long for the Queen of the Damned Soundtrack. His voice intrigued me. It's beautiful and sexy, as well as arrogant at certain times.Anyhow, their first album didn't disappoint me at all. Almost all of their songs have some merit to them. Contrary to most, I don't really care for Blue Monday. It's a great cover, but I just don't like 80s music that much...Don't discard this album after the first listen if you find you're not drawn to it. If I did that with most of the albums I bought, I'd be missing out on a lot of great music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW...modern NIN.........and still a great time!!!","review":"I was very apprehensive about getting this CD. I really love the cover of \\"Blue Monday\\". My wife picked it up for me and I was impressed. This is not for everyone, but still good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"I had this album when it came out and never appreciated it back in 98, but now 15 years later I put it in and realized what a great album this really is. Every song is solid and the whole record really meshes well together, so glad that I took that little stroll down memory lane the other day."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD AT ALLLLLLLLL","review":"Okay, I really liked Blue monday but..this whole CD is horrible. The only good song really is \\"blue monday\\" and maybe stiches but I didn't even really like that song.

I really like that song. I'm out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Download Blue Monday","review":"I bought this CD a few years ago because I liked the cover of New Order's Blue Monday. It had a very aggressive, hard-hitting feel that was already behind the theme of the original song but not as forcefully in the original, synthesized delivery.Imagine my surprise and dismay, then, when I discovered that, with the exception of that one recognizable track used to get people interested in Orgy, this CD serves best as a coaster on your coffee table. Track after track was just the same unmemorable garbage. The only good song was nestled in the middle of the junk, and it wasn't even Orgy's song! Don't get me wrong -- I like a lot of 90s synth-metal such as Ministry, Machines of Loving Grace, and NIN. But this CD was a total waste of (...) bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad.","review":"I heard Orgy's cover of \\"Blue Monday\\" a long time ago, but at the time, I was about 7 or 8 and I didn't really like music. A few months ago, about 4 years later than that time, I bought this CD because I remembered the song from my youth and it was only $0.50 used, so I thought, \\"what the hell!\\" I wasted 50 cents. I could've bought 2 gumballs instead! \\"Blue Monday\\" is not near as great as I remembered it to be, and the rest of the songs are just awful. Their singer has no talent, and you get so sick of hearing his awful voice. The guitars are pretty bad, too. They sound like fricking keyboards!!! The only good musicians in this band are the drummer and the bassist. And another complaint:the lyrics. Their awful, and they make no sense, and they just sound STUPID!! Just listen to \\"Gender\\"'s choruses' lyrics! What they should do is kick out Jay Gordon, or just make him a keyboardist (because he does play keyboards) and get their guitarists to buy some different sounding guitars! GOD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No fun at this Orgy!","review":"While never being a fan of their cover of Blue Monday, I was skeptical concerning the quality of their own songs. After listening to this CD I know why they released Blue Monday as the first single. Social Enemies = crap; Stitches = crap, Dissention = crap, etc. Stay far away from Candyass!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's New Order?","review":"this album actually gets 1/4 star. this type of music is just more of the mallternative scene. the shame of it is, most people who like this think Blue Monday is their song. ha ha!! it's pretty bad to WANT to copy NIN, but I guess with music in the state that it is in, nothing is suprising. the 2nd song on the radio sounds like a bad depeche mode. Who's depeche mode? let me guess, next album, they'll sound like the cure, the smiths, and maybe some erasure. pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"orgy sucks!","review":"I bought this CD cause I loved Blue Monday and was hoping that maybe Orgy would sound different and origional.WRONG! Orgy sounds EXACTLY like what I have heard of Korn.I recommend this CD if you like Korn, Marilyn Manson, and Nine Inch Nails.But, DON'T buy it if you have good taste in real industrial rock, as in: you don't listen to the above! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"uggggh!","review":"i went to the korn concert in houston a few months ago, and orgy sounded pretty cool(they opened for korn) so i bought the cd, and it sucked. the guitars are all airy, instead of sounding just good and solid, and all the songs sound the same. the worst bucks ive ever spent. Korn should kick em off their label coz they are s**t!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 good song","review":"man...what a disapointment. listening to stitches, you can see that they could have been a good industrial/punk band...but with MTV and the radio's constant overplaying of blue monday, it just gets on my nerves. stitches=good, orgy=overplayed crap"},{"rating":"1","title":"No-talent hacks!","review":"Whenever I think about Orgy, I just get angry. Seriously, these guys just got a lucky break when they hooked up with Korn (whose musical tastes I now question) It's not that Orgy are particularly offensive; I just find it infuriating that when millions of talented bands out there are toiling in obscurity, bands like Orgy become nationally known by covering (note-for-note, no less) a song by another artist (\\"Blue Monday,\\" New Order) And the rest of the CD is just filled with NIN clones like \\"Stitches\\" and \\"Dizzy\\" just not as good. I don't know if anyone out here (L.A.) listened to the KROQ Top 100 bands of all time countdown, but I find it ludicrous that Orgy (#71) a band who have been together for about a year, was picked ahead of widely respected, ORIGINAL bands such as the Pixies and the Dead Kennedys."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is extremely overrated.","review":"This cd has one good song on it. Blue Monday. That's all. The rest of the cd (including stitches) sounds like noise. In fact, it reminds me of a bunch of 6 year-olds hammering on their big brother's musical instruments. Unless you're in to ear wrenching noise, don't purchase this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cd's i've bought in a while.","review":"This cd rules. The last cd i bought that was this good was Soulfly. You know a cd is good when you can't stop listening to it. That's what happens with this one. It's so cool how they use all kinds of sounds it stops the music from getting boring. Even now three weeks after I bought it I still find things that I never realized were there when I listened to it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro-riffic","review":"This cd takes me back to the days of New Order, the Cure, and early Nine Inch Nails.

I've heard people complain that tis is not like korn, and that's a bad thing? I'm glad they don't sound like korn.So, all in all it's a great CD, but u might want to skip #11 (Revival)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awseome music to the extreme","review":"I never thought that a CD like this would come out. You can put it in the player and listen to every track for ever. Each song is cool in its own way. If you get this, expect sweet head-banging action, and good head ache to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok to listen to, but not a masterpeace.","review":"This cd is ok to listen to, but it's nothing to get really excited about. Their remake of Blue Monday is their big hit from this cd and I hate to say it but probably their only hit. They'll probably one day be a One Hit Wonder.....But fans of weird stuff or the underground I think will love the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much from too many, but good.","review":"All in all, Candyass is an great album. BUT, they might be trying to put too many different styles of music together. Blue Monday sounds sooooo good because the song was already there, they just covered it. The rest of the album is nowhere near what its reputaion puts it. It's a lot of what they tried for, they managed the 80's sound, but they missed the bill for most of todays music fans. It's good, but don't buy it if you've only herd Blue Monday, get a single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thiz cd kikz azz","review":"Im really into thiz type of music I thunkz that Blue Monday iz the bezt 80z cover up even though they are too technoie the only kik azz zong iz Blue Monday LONG LIVE KORN LIMP BIZKIT ORGY AND RAMMSTIEN"},{"rating":"2","title":"ORGY KICKS A**","review":"I recently got this cd and I have to say that it is my favorite now. I like every single track. Lets quash a criticism right here. The lyrics are not just thrown together to go with the music. They are actually pretty good. I racked my brain to name a single track that was my favorite. I suppose it would have to be \\"Blue Monday\\" But you know, \\"Stiches\\", \\"Platnium\\", \\"Pantomime\\",\\"Say Nothing\\", and \\"All the Same\\" are good too......."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD That I Own!!!","review":"When I first heard the cover of \\"Blue Monday\\", I immediately wanted to know who the artist was that did it. After finding out, I drove right down to the record store and purchased it. I am so glad that I bought \\"Candyass\\" because it truely is the best CD that I own. It's one of those discs that will never leave your CD player and is in constant repeat! Every song has something new in store, a new story, new hard-hitting sounds that by far don't sound like guitars and drums! The guys in Orgy have done an excellent job on their debut album, and I know for sure they will go far! The next best thing to listening to Orgy on the radio or on CD, is seeing them do it all live in concert...which I highly recommend! They make great music and put on great shows, so check them out, you won't be disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY WERE HIDING","review":"I bought Orgy because of Blue Monday, I liked Stiches as soon as I bought it.

GREAT GREAT CD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NEATO!","review":"This is a really good album music-wise. The lyrics are kind of questionable when it comes to content; it sounds like Orgy just chose random words from the dictionary for lyrics. You will notice that their songs often don't make sense; they will jump from one idea to another totally unrelated idea. Musically, they are kind of gothic metal. It is pretty cool, like Nine Inch Nails or Marilyn Manson. If you like Orgy, you will also like Fluorescein (nobody has ever heard of Fluorescein, but they are so good...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"half and half, pretty good","review":"This Candyass cd has 6 good songs and 6 terrible songs. i wish the whole cd was good so i wouldn't have to keep frowarding to a better song every time one i don't like comes on.

I also like 'Fiction (Dreams In Digital)' on their newer CD. However, this band just isn't all that good, it's mostly like a spoken-word, Stream-of-Consciousness record, with some instrumentals. The singles are very different from what you get on the CD, and I can't embrace what's given. J. Davis is featured on a track. They could/should be much better and I hope to see them become better at what they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a great debut, but there's no way in hell it's bad...","review":"either. I remember when they had been very popular on TRL on MTV for the cover of New Order's \\"Blue Monday\\". I also love \\"Stithes\\" very much. But those however, are the 2 best singles on the album. It isn't nearly as close as The Fragile by NIN is to the best gothic album. Platinum is also another great song by them. This album wasn't as good as the sophomore, though Jay Gordon & Co. weren't at a peak. Gender is very repetitive is one of my examples for not liking this album as much as Stabbing Westward, Tool, or even ex-NIN guitarist Richard Patrick with Filter. This is definitely no NIN rip off band though. It also isn't pop to me, though electronic, techno, and gothic. I have to say it also isn't any rap rock loop where the first album is good, then it goes to a downward spiral. It is actually like Korn, the band who had them signed to Elementree records.

To me the only tracks that really stand out are \\"Revival\\", \\"Blue Monday\\", and \\"Dissention\\" - other than that the rest of the album pretty much sounds the same, with a singer who interestingly enough sounds a lot like Marilyn Manson.

A must for anyone who listens to Tricky, Portishead, Korn, the evil pop of the 90's. The whole album is great from start to finish. They even cover Blue Monday, New Order's original synth pop masterpiece, Don't listen to the other reviews cause most of them are wrong. This is not a Manson wannabe, or a Rob Zombie inspired band.

I had looked at the square one in the stores but found that the oval was priced 40% less. I'm so glad I have the oval shape as I think it holds more.These are amazing pans, I'm finding that I use it everyday. Chicken has never tasted as good or cooked so easily and vegtables are fabulous.Cleaning the pan is more time consumming than I would like but I think it's worth the effort given the ease and quality of the cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skillet Grill Rocks","review":"I am building up my collection of Le Creuset since it lasts longer, performs better and has a great look. The skillet grill that I purchased a while ago is one of the coolest pieces around. I read all the other reviews and noted the warnings about cleaning, etc. But I find it to be the very best way to cook meat indoors. Cleaning only requires an overnight soaking - so easy - followed by a simple brushing or sponging. The meat comes out fantastic and the grill lines are exquisite. I highly recommend this product. The size also is perfect for kitchen use and a family dinner. I am so glad I purchased it. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"boat","review":"Have not taken this boat out on the lake yet.

And stealing the ball is just a matter of running towards the player with it. Passing is a joke, the goals are too big and the computers AI is terrible.

I can't imagine there will be too many better novels published in 2002. Definitely worth checking out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't pass this one by!","review":"A paradise free from conflict, suffering, and death-that's what we all want, isn't it? Well, isn't it? This is a question central to O'Leary's thoughtful and accomplished new novel, which pulls off the seemingly impossible feat of merging an sf thriller with an insightful meditation on the meaning of suffering and the nature of love. The plot moves through some very strange imaginative territory, but O'Leary focuses on aspects of our humanity that are all too familiar: longing, jealousy, grief, joy. An exceptional novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Accidental Treasure of a Find!","review":"This writer is a treasure. What a book! I stumbled upon it, purely by accident.This work is not a frolic in an easy alternate reality, but disturbing and thoughtful and very original. It was hard to read before sleeping and affected my predream thoughts. Even my brain waves felt altered by the existential repatterning in this science fiction.I never, never knew what would come next. I couldn't outguess him.And, to my utter astonishment, he made me weep, scooped up the jewels of what is most precious in our lives and spoon fed them to us in his last poetic pages. I could feel my own heart beating in his hand.A beautiful and profound story. Thank you and I bow deeply to Mr. Patrick O'Leary.This is possibly the most profound author of poetic science fiction I have discovered in a long time and a rare compliment to my library.

While I am not as completely blown away by this as some of the other reviewers here are, I am still quite impressed.The entire album is incredible and all of the songs are just as fabulous as \\"Underwater Love\\", some even better I dare say. Sexy, smoky, sophisticated, and completely lounge-worthy. The vocals are incredible, and are delivered in a multiple of languages.So go ahead, don't be afraid to take a chance on this.

However......was hugely disappointed with the lasted DVD, Let'Go to School. The characters looked different and format changed where did Mr. Websley and Professor Quigley go? When did Tad and Lily become twins? Try and explain that to your child after watching the previous Leap Frog DVDs. Why in the world would they change such an outstanding format. My child learned all of his ABC's from the Letter Factory DVD and the other videos in the series....I recommended the Leap Frog DVD series to other parents. But I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DVD...save your money. This DVD will collect DUST because my child wasn't interested with it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful back to school DVD","review":"Kiwi Magazine Review:Let's face it: parents and kids both have jitters about starting school.

Apparently they are now twins. In addition to the unnecessary change in the birth order, the singing in this video is absolutely horrible - Off key, hard to hear, and just plain bad. The content is decent with numbers and days of the week presented but it is difficult for anyone to hear and difficult for an adult to watch, unlike the Sony produced videos which were enjoyable for adults as well as children. I could have sung better than these characters . . . which is not saying much. Additionally, all the characters sound like their noses are clogged. The whole sound track is unpleasant. I am giving it two stars only because the content is decent and my daughter did not walk out of the room while the video was playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 year old's verdict: \\"It's weird.\\"","review":"My two year old is obsessed with the Letter Factory and Word Factory Leap Frog DVD's.

This one diverges from the rest with poor writing and poor computer animation (the facial expressions are frozen in place). They repeat over and over that everyone is nervous on their first day of school - good luck NOT being nervous after hearing that over and over! Overall, this one is complete crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"We bought this for our daughter because she is about to enter kindergarten, and because the other leap frog videos we have purchased were awesome. This one however, is just ridiculous. The content and the animation have really gone down hill. There is no character continuity between this video and the rest. The First 5 have Tad learning his alphabet and numbers with Lilly and Leap (his older siblings) helping him. Then in this one he magically forgot everything he's learned at the Letter Factory. Plus Lily is no longer his older sister, but is now his twin. This one just seems really dumbed down compared to the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"My triplets love it!","review":"My triplets will soon be 5 and this is great! They didn't make the cut off date for kindergarten so they'll be going to preschool, but this still gives them a great idea of what to expect and will help for next year as well!Things are explained great! It briefly describes things like the globe, chalkboard, ABC list, book center, clock, calendar, dates and weather, school bell, recess, lining up, raising your hand, etc. It's all done with songs, of course, but is done simply and efficiently so things will not be a surprise when they go to school.

We have the others and my kids love them.When I bought this one I was excited as my oldest was getting ready to go to preschool.After watching this with them I am disappointed to see that time was spent on already covered topics (letters) and topics that add a minor value when just starting school (animal groupings).They could have spent more time on time/calender, math.If they were going to do a section on letters then it would be appropriate to talk about how to write them and not going through sounds again with different symbols compared to the earlier DVD. I liked the counting with the small section on numbers larger/smaller in comparison with the building blocks. The math topics do not need to be advanced to be valuable.Also, Leap and Lilly were different ages in previous videos and now they are the same age.If you create a series of videos, please stay consistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Praise on the Market","review":"I bought this CD on the basis of the favorable reviews it had received here.

I'm just glad that it arrived too late for me to give it to my secret sister at work (the original intended recipient). I love the Lord, and I love enthusiastic worship.

I sleep with the 2nd CD \\"Holy of Holies\\" playing. It is a \\"Word from the Lord\\" to me, a \\"Word in Season,\\" Rhema.If you are ready to be transported to a new place in your walk in Christ, a deeper level of committment, and a new level of authority I recommend this CD. The peace of God will overshadow you, the blessings of the Lord will come upon you, and the healing oil of the Comforter will soothe and heal every wound. -- Shalom"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRUE CHURCH EXPERIENCE!!","review":"The first time I listen to the cd I notice something different that you don't get from most cds you purchase now a days, a worship experience that you usually only get in a church. After listening for a while, I realize what was being done with this cd......a mixture of ministery and songs of worship.Most people may have not gotten the clear view of what this cd was about because all they wanted was some good songs and leave the praise of God in the church. Well Shekinah Glory decided that was not to be the case!So...before you buy this cd you should know this, along with great Musicial song selections, you will be hearing Praises for what God had done for You..which can be lost when listening to some gospel cds. But the Praise(aka.talking) is not over done so you can enjoy this cd to fullest.So if you want to experience a blessing, please check this cd out!

It is such innocent worship, and allows the listener to eavesdrop and enter in. Without a doubt, you will experience an amazing visitation of the Lord's Presence. This not entertainment, but rather true worship obviously aimed at the heart of God. Hence, it leaves you with a sense of being privileged to experience such a genuine worship atmosphere.

I have never, EVER felt completely enveloped by the Spirit in the way I was when I listened to it. You just don't want it to end.

Plus the time limitation and the number of places to look, and the number of items to look for = a hair pulling time. I like a challange, but not to the point where I want to throw my computer away, forever. I prefer to have a good time, a time where I can't wait to play again, this was not the game for it.

Why is this so atrociously expensive? It is not a re-conditioned version, like Pride and Prejudice is - and who would ever ask so much money? Unless we get an explanation for the price, why should anyone buy it when the previous dvd is still available? I am still incensed that this is costing so much - the quality if is no different to the other one on Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Entertainment","review":"This is an expensively made, poorly written, and well-acted soap opera. It's the basic poor boy goes on tour with the vaudeville plot. And all the thrills of show business from the inside...the heartaches, the bad breaks, the freaks, the mean comedians, the tart girls, etc. etc. And it seems never to end: three discs worth of pathos. Olivier, by the way, was inserted into the film briefly in order for him to play a one-dimensionsal drunken old comic and get his name on the marquee.It is all so breathtakingly superficial and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"you have got to be kidding!!!!!","review":"this is a very good series, however i would not pay over $25 for it. this is not rare or even hard to find! go order it from your local video store it cost $30 from them. but profitering on an item that is not even the least bit difficult to obtain you have got to be kidding!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It!!!","review":"I just recently took the Suffolk County Exam last Saturday on the 9th of June, and this book was not at all helpful.

This book was a waste of my money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Woman Needs a Club Like This","review":"What a fun novel; I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of reading it. Typical of Joni Hilton's style, the characters have laugh-out-loud funny experiences you can actually imagine you or your friends sharing. But there are also sweet, sad, romantic, difficult, and very very wise moments. The characters love and support each other through all their joys and trials and make you wish you had a group of life-long friends this great.An added bonus: The author also includes a recipe at the end of every chapter featuring a dish involved in the Club's meeting(what would a gathering of women do without food?). I'm looking forward to trying them since I found out that Joni Hilton is an award-winning chef and cookbook author as well as a great writer.A light read but very fun. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK book","review":"Not my favorite Joni Hilton book, but it was OK. Good storyline and not boring, just not as interesting as some of her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe my favorite game ever","review":"I love these games so much. In my humble opinion, Age of Empires II comes as close to perfection as any game I've ever played. It is definitely in my top 5, with Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Elder Scrolls III Morrowind, the original Pokemon, and Dark Age of Camelot. Age of Empires II is the best AoE title (including Age of Mythology) because it incorporates nearly all the good elements of the future titles (excepting God powers and Home Cities), but allows ridiculously huge armies that are not allowed in the two later titles. There is nothing better than bursting into an enemy settlement with 200 Tarkans. I cannot add very much that hasn't been said, as there have been well over 100 reviews, but I wanted to add my voice to the chorus in case there is someone on the fence about trying this game out. Get it. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work Well With Windows 7","review":"I bought this at a Best Buy some time ago. It worked on my old XP computer.

The only problem is I can't seem to stop playing this game,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, print your own manual","review":"Here's a helpful note on the packaging: This set doesn't include the manual or technology tree fold-out. That's probaably why it costs less than the AoE 2 Gold Edition. If you like to have the tech tree (building and unit upgrades reference sheet) next to you when you play, you'll need to print your own. Just search online for \\"Age of Empires II manual\\" without the quotes and you'll find the PDF to download from Microsoft or you can look for a one-sheet PDF tech tree by someone named Nethog. Or you can fork out double the amount for the Gold edition, which has less software but printed manuals included.Other reviewers have said everything that needs to be said about the game itself.

I HATE this box set due to one reason:This CANNOT be used for Online play. It comes literally on 1 disk, and the disk doesn't count as any of the games alone. If you try to connect with a friend, it keeps asking for the disk to be inserted when it already is.As long as you have no friends to play this game with, go for it. Good deal for just playing I guess, but I admit that playing online is the main feature people should love (Seeing as how the computers literally suicide on missions without warning sometimes, and the difficulty only goes so high)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great deal for 4 games","review":"I've always loved AOE and for good reason!!

If you have never played the game before and are thinking of buying, don't expect command and conquer sort of graphics, because this game is now fairly old. If you have an appreciation for RTS and want to play where it all started, then give this game a go. The game play is addictive and fun and the scenario editor is really easy to use and top notch. The game is super easy to pick up and play and there are many different fun factions to play as. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xp and Above, it will not work!","review":"This product will not, I repeat, will not work on windows xp or above, waste of money unlessyou have an old 95 computer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Age of Empires game","review":"I have a windows 7 computer that is one year old and the game I got wouldn't work because it was too old.

Homeless, starving and ill they struggle to survive but never lose their humanity.An excellent book for children and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympus 14-42mm Lens","review":"This is one of the best kit lenses made by any manufacturer. It is very sharp and optically superior to the Canon and Nikon equivalent kit lenses. It is also very small and works great with one of Olympus' small form factor cameras such as the E-420. The combination is about as small as it gets in the dslr world and makes it a great traveling companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good kit lens but not perfect especially in low light","review":"I bought the Olympus 14-42mm lens as part of the Olympus E-620 kit. Overall I am quite happy with the 14-42mm as a general-purpose lens, particularly for outdoor, daytime use. It is light weight and the zoom range is useful for landscapes at the wide end and portraits and closeups at full zoom. In good light this lens is capable of producing clear and crisp pictures that are not noticeably less clear at the edges than in the center (as expected given the four-thirds crop). Focusing is reasonably fast though I have been unable to get the lens to focus in some conditions, particularly in low light. The aperture range is fine for outdoor shooting though often not bright enough for indoor/low light conditions. Also, it is hard to achieve a shallow depth of field with this lens though it is possible at full zoom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Court Martialed","review":"I looked up Rockie Blunt because I saw his name on the History Channel's fabulous program World War II in HD. I recognized Mr. Blunt's name but couldn't put my finger on it.Of course! He was our local reporter and a jazz musician. Then I remembered this book and all the complaints.Well, I googled Roscoe Cosby Blunt and found that President Clinton pardoned him. Apparently, he was court martialed in 1945 for fraternization. I can't believe that after all these years of his reporting, writing books and now being featured on the History Channel that this has never been discovered. And yes, it is the same Roscoe Crosby Blunt from Shrewsbury, Mass.I haven't seen the episodes that he is in, but I am just stunned. I hope this doesn't ruin my viewing of this documentary event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did he find the time?","review":"As personal memoirs go, you have to give them a lot of slack but this one pushes the limits. The reader is challenged to swallow the author's story that in a little more than six months he single-handedly killed the enemy (occasionally in hand-to-hand), captured large scores of Germans, shot down aircraft, knocked-out tanks, and most importantly looted his way across war-torn Europe. I was left wondering if I had somehow missed his personal discovery of Hitler's bunker. Small wonder there was no other collaboration with anyone else in the 84th."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very doubtful","review":"I was in a rifle platoon in the ETO at the same tome as the author. Nobody left his squad to loot at any time. Nobody was able to mail packages home. Mail, yes, but not packages. His self described exploits should have earned him three CMH's and a few Silver Stars thrown in. Nobody turned down a Purple Heart when it was legitimately earned. And I really began to doubt his story when he mentions on page 288 that his Mothers birthday was St Patricks Day and on page 291 says it was on Easter. Something does not ring true."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Rocky\\" Blunt writes fiction","review":"Reading \\"Foot Soldier\\" would be a laughing matter if it did not insult the guys who really fought WW11.

In my years of researching what the 84th did, specifically the 2nd Btn 333 in which my dad was a 1st Sgt I have not been as disappointed as when I read this book. To all those who thought it was so inspiring, wouldn't the truth be more inspiring? Mr Blunt did serve with the 84th. It would have been nice to find out what he really did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Believe","review":"I have read many books on fighting in the European theater in WWII. I have also heard first hand accounts from my uncles who fought in Europe including one who was a tank driver under Gen. Patton. I must say I found Roscoe Blunt's book hard to believe. He states he received special training to defuse landmines and bombs. But after being in combat for serveral months he never was called upon to use his special training. At one point during the Battle of the Bulge he mentions he leaves his foxhole alone, at night to reconoiter thru a minefield toward German lines then becomes disoriented and lost. If that is an example of how a \\"battle tested\\" soldier acts then it's amazing he lived to tell the tale.I have to believe most of what is written in this book is highly embellished to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book - Give this guy a break","review":"This book is a great read, and we are all indebted to Mr. Blunt for what he did for this country.Regarding some of the earlier reviews -- walk a mile in the author's shoes before making disparaging remarks. If you've read any of Stephen Ambrose's works, you'd know that looting and souvenir hunting is very common during war. Even on D-Day, Ambrose describes a paratrooper running into a field of fire to retrieve what he thought was a German Luger. It's easy to sit in your easy chair and criticize Blunt, but get out there yourself and see how you would behave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finished it in three days.","review":"This is one of those books you can't put down.Mr. Blunt hits the nail on the head with the way he tells it.The way he tells about the mud, going with out food and sleep, this is how it was. I had an Uncle who was with the 30th inf and fought at St. Lo and into Germany, he offten would talk about the same things as Mr. Blunt did; mud, hunger, no sleep and Officers that took all the credit. So I know that this book is for real, unlike other authors that spit out books on WWII(no names)and put polish on them.If you want a Soldiers view on things, this is the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock","review":"What a crock. Pure fiction. Hard to believe that at a time when there are so many fine accounts of WWII coming into print that this found the light of day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great man","review":"This book is great. I have known Roscoe for several years now and he is a great guy. The implication of another reviewer saying Roscoe is a lier is rediculous. I have seen some of his diaries from the war and letters home stating things that are included in the book. And if it was not true why would two different publishers choose to publish his memoirs of the war?? Tom Brokaw even chose to interview Rocky. While in office i believe even President Clinton read the book. It is a hard hitting day to day memoir of a decorated, wounded combat vet leaving in many of the major and minor details that others choose to leave out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood relived.","review":"I'm still bummed that they don't air this show on cartoon network anymore.

Well worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus Episode Seen Before","review":"Just a warning that the DVD doesn't contain much \\"never before seen\\" material. The Bonus Episode is number XI, the first appearance of the Scotsman. (The box doesn't claim this is \\"Never before seen\\"; that seems to be Amazon's mistake.)I think the documentary is the same one which ran after the Movie on Cartoon Network. The PowerPuff Girls Movie sneak peek is the same as on the \\"Meet the Beat Alls\\" DVD. It seems the only new material is an archive of line drawings.

This is one of the most original shows to come out in a long time. The mix of mythology, science fiction, sword play, as well as the unique animation style and wide screen/split screen presentation make every episode an enjoyable experience. Genndy Tartartkovsky has surpassed all of his work with this show. As the DVD has not been released, I don't own this item yet, but I will be receiving it as soon as it is released, if for nothing but the bonus episode.

I was like ''this must that samuri cartoon'' I wacthed it and I fell in love with it. It was the premier of SJ that night and i watched the encor presentation. It was the best cartoon I had seen in a long time. I like DBZ but I have lost interest in it basically. Samuri Jack is naive but not as much of an airhead as Goku, Gohan or Vegeta can be on DBZ. Don't get me wrong. Last year's season of DBZ with Cell was great but this year's seaon was pretty slow. They could have gone without Goten( Gohan's little bro) who was as annoying as heck. This season was fine but Samuri Jack is the best! Justic League (the remake of the Super Friends) is great too. Also SJ is played by a guy named by Phil, which is my name. SHweet! My mom saw this show and she liked it! I hope this is a many episode series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samurai Jack","review":"Samurai Jack is the most touching cartoon i've ever watched. He is so pure in heart i cry every time i watch the movie and episodes. I always wish i could reach out and hug him. I want the creators to know they make me have a permanent smile every time i watch Samurai Jack. I am so impressed i'm going to buy everything i can relating to Samurai Jack.

When I received this game, the cover had ducks on the front, not what the cover shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I only had a few minutes to evaluate this product before giving it as a gift, so take this with a grain of salt. Pros: cute characters, bright colors, cute songs, seemed to be a good variety of activities for learning numbers, letters, colors, etc., and basic dexterity skills. I was pleasantly surprised. Cons: the only thing I noticed was that there were no \\"menus\\" per se - it wasn't easy to figure out how to exit a section or skip to another one, or skip over the opening song and get right to the game. I did figure it out, eventually. This product is certainly worth the under-$10 price tag. Seems like quality went into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I\\"d hoped","review":"We had this CD for my 9yr old when he was little. Ended up throwing it away because it kept getting stuck in the middle of play. We liked some of the games in it, so I purchased this again for my 2yr old in the newer updated version thinking it would be better. The reviews I read stated that even if your little one cant use a mouse, just the keyboard will make things work. Well, dont know about anyone elses 2yr old, but mine is punch happy on the keyboard and kept locking things up and exiting the game if he hit any other key besides an alphabet letter. So once again, disappointed in this software. Also purchased the Reader Rabbit and am very happy with that one.

The pink is a great shade, neither too dull nor too bright. The leather has both quality and character. It fits perfectly and protects well without adding bulk, and the magnetic clasp is secure. The belt clip that came included is small, sturdy, and unobtrusive.This case also comes in black, white, and deep red, and in a flip style as well as this book style. I chose the book because it feels more natural to me and I like that I can charge my Palm with the case closed, but if you're worried about your USB port getting damaged or your stylus getting lost the flip case might be better for you. Orion Gadgets, who shipped my order very quickly, supply all four colors in both styles here on Amazon.A great value. You'll love this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I purchased this product about a year ago for my Palm Z22 and its awesome!

It was hard not to be struck not only by the warmth of Mr. Bell's playing but also by his phrasing. He is almost never flashy, but his nuances made me find new musical possibilities which I hope -- but somehow doubt -- Gershwin intended. This is Gershwin as you have never heard him before, and it desires a place in anyone's classical or jazz collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magellan mapsend Garbage","review":"Although being sold on amazon this product has been discontinued by magellan and offers no support.

Even though they say you can activate over the internet the website only provides a tech support number which is only available M-F 6 - 5 Pacific. (Very bad for a product used primarily on the weekends). They say it has tides/currents. (This is a blatant lie). They unlock code works only with one GPS/SD card combo AND only ONE map on an SD card at a time. Meaning your 128 Meg SD card is a waste of money as most maps are only 8-10 Meg. Does not coexist with Mapsend Topo maps either. This product should still be in Beta. Detail does seem to be there after activating and viewing the product. Uploading and activating are very tedious and time consuming tasks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally dissatisfied with the product","review":"Lost my Color Merridian overboard and had to replace the GPS. When I recieved the new GPS I called Magellan to get a new unlock code so I could load the charts on my replacement GPS. I was informed I would have to purchase a new bluenav CD since they only issue one unlock code with no exceptions. Well my exception is I will never buy another Magellan product Hardware / Software. As for the replacement Color Merridian it is being returned today. In the future I will purchase Garmin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward and out of date","review":"The map is old and there is no way to update the information annually with published changes.

Not only can I not down load more than 1 map, I cannot get an access code for additional cards.

Unfortunately, they did not. The biggest problem is the limitation of one map at a time!!! You can only use one SD card (the one you activate) and can only have one map on it at a time. You can change maps, but need a laptop and a lot of time for this. I'm a kayaker (and don't generally carry a laptop in the boat with me), so this product is totally useless for me in any but the most limited circumstances.Bad, Magellan!!! Bad!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a Garmin","review":"I just bought a Magellan SporTrak PRO Marine and the MapSend Blue Nav software.

First of all, if you are looking for your standard Christmas songs, don't look here. Up tempo, thumping rhythms, r&b wannabes, you get the picture? Second, Ms. Aguilera's singing is simply atrocious. She tries to get as many syllables out of a word that she can, and she whines, wails, and screams in the process. I defy anyone to find any Christmas cheer or spirit in this music. And finally, I can think of only one other diva who could have probably done a worse job, and that is Christina's obvious idol Mariah Carey."},{"rating":"1","title":"blasphemous","review":"this cd is pure trash, just look at the name, and shes practically naked on the cover. It disgusts me that the tramp she is would actually go after something like x-mas, i mean come on she just made this cd to get people mad at her again. This is dirty ol' man music."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad","review":"My mom got this album for me because I loved Christina Aguilera's \\"Genie in a bottle\\" album. She thought I would love this one and she bought this for me without either of us having heard any of the music. I was surprised by how terrible it was. Christina can sing very well when she doesn't oversing. Here, she makes the mistake of oversinging every song and trying to hold the notes too long as though doing a bad Mariah Carey impersonation. It was an awful effect. Instead of singing the songs correctly like a melody, she is pratically singing every little word in the song as though that was an entire song itself. The cd is so bad that that I only listened to this album twice and then it has been sitting there ever sicne, gathering up dust. I should just throw it away. It is truly horrible. I can see why none of Christina's songs get played during the holidays on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE how she did it!!","review":"I read some reviews saying she's overdone with melisma and shouting..... But, WHO ELSE DID THE CHRISTMAS SONGS THIS WAY???? :) The title is \\"My kind of Christmas\\", meaning Christina's kind of Christmas.It may not be suited for those Christians who celebrate as family holiday; HOWEVER, if you celebrate Christmas Vegas-style (a.k.a. big party time), this is DA CD to get !!!! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! What a voice...","review":"I didn't think Christina could top Mi Reflejo, her Spanish CD, but this CD definitely does. Her voice is so unbelieveably beautiful, that her renditions of holiday classics are chilling. She even brings some youth and funk to the table with her new dancy additions to the mix. \\"Christmas Time,\\" the first track, is catchy as hell, and even features a holiday rap (get it? holiday wrap :)My only complain, if any, is that she is starting to overdo the vocal acrobatics. Although I thoroughly enjoy this disc, by the end, I'm almost tired.All in all, it's a welcome addition to my Christmas collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Y'all cant possibly be complaining, are ya ?","review":"I have never liked Christmas music from any artist. Something about the overall mood never appealed to me. This is the first Christmas CD that I actually love to listen to all night. She gives Christmas a more modern beat, that finally gets us away from the senior boom 50's feel. Its about time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled With Christmas Spirit","review":"At first I was reluctant to purchase this CD, but now I am very glad I did. This album includes a great mixture of remade traditional Christmas favorites and original Christina style pop songs. Listening to the CD will send shivers down your spine, there is so much energy put into the music. Christina's voice really rocks these Chritmas songs the way they were meant to be. I highly recommend the album for those of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"strictly for teenyboppers","review":"This is a typical Christina CD...same beat as her other records just Christmas lyrics. Should be a wonderful seller for the 13-14 year olds, but not worth listening to if you truly want some traditional Christmas musc. Christina has an amazing vocal range as evidenced by her blues rendition of an Etta James song in her concert. One of these years she will grow up and use the full potential of her voice. This was NOT it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I was disappointed with this Christmas album. Christina Aguilera has such a beautiful and powerful voice, but she messed up so many songs by doing and endless amount of runs/malissmas. Usually it's very good for vocalists to show off their talents, but Christina Aguilera took it to a point with this album where it just became annoying. You could not sing along with any of the traditional Christmas tunes because Christina was all over the board while singing them. I just wish that she would have just used her great voice to just sing instead of trying to blow everyone way with how many malissmas she can create. We all know she's a good singer, but in this case, she didn't sound good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her kind of Christmas is not my kind","review":"Christina's Christmas CD was quite a disapointment to me.I got it expecting a great CD for Christmas and what I got was over-produced R+B pop.Christina did not put the effort she ususally puts into her music.The classic Christmas songs were good,but the rest was pure crap.Some I don't think should be considered Christmas songs.Christina needs some lesons from Mariah on how to make an excelent Christmas CD,then hers would have been way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH, no, no, no!","review":"Boy, do I hate this album. I like Christina OK, but I completely agree with some of the other reviewers. She just couldn't seem to forego the opportunity to try and showcase her vocal range and etc., but it really is at the cost of the music in this case.If you are looking for a good contemporary holiday CD, don't buy this one...it stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not Like","review":"I was really anticipating listening to this CD when I ordered it. I love Christina's voice and I thought that this would be a great addition to my Christmas collection. It fell short of my expectations. She sings traditional Christmas music but it almost feels \\"choppy\\". She adds extra \\"la, la, la\\" sounds throughout, which wouldn't be that bad, but it feels like an interruption to the music. She also adds a lot to the lyrics. For example, during \\"O Holy Night\\", she recites the Lord's Prayer. I did not care for such additions to the music. It is her interpretation of the songs and I guess I just did not care for that interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptionally Bad","review":"I really hate most Xmas albums, I think that they are responsible for alot of the holiday mayhem and murders. But this CD is remarkably awful. I have to be honest, I did not listen to the entire CD, it probably would have killed me! This \\"artist's\\" meager singing ability coupled with Xmas-themed material makes for a very unpleasant experience. To quote one reviewer: \\"You go girl!\\". Yes, please go, now."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"Do not waste your money on this CD if you want a good christmas album buy Mariah Carey's \\"Merry christmas"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get This Girl A Songwriter Fer Gods' Sakes","review":"I bought this in a haze of holiday optimism, having heard Ms. Aguilera knock my socks off dueting with Tony Bennett on a television tribute show. There is no denying that the girl can sing. Unfortunately, what she sings here is banal at best, and downright irritating at worst--lots of gratuitous squealing. It's a real shame to see a talent like hers drowned by the tide of pop mediocrity. I reluctantly gave this two stars rather than one in recognition of my age. Maybe I just don't get it. Then again, maybe it's just not there for me to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone.","review":"I purchased this CD from Amazon[.com] as soon as it came out. Having it around for 3 Christmases now, I forgot how bad I thought it was until I popped it in one evening just before Christmas (this year) and listened all the way through.Some reviewers are praising this CD, and if their ears are pleased by it I respect that. I found it very hard to listen to. In other reviews, you will hear words like \\"overdone\\" and \\"excessive trilling\\" and these are understatements. Most of the songs are butchered almost beyond recognition, and this is disappointing because I find this artist talented and with much potential (though her image has been compromised recently).For the layman...say there were a few bars with 10 notes written. Christina will instead sing 40 notes from squeaky high to tenor range. If you like this sort of thing, buy it. If you like things more traditional or just a little creativity, you won't like it. There is too much \\"creativity\\" here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noooo!","review":"This is a terrible album! Do not buy it. I LOVE Christina, I have all her CDs. But this is a mess. I was so mad the first time I heard this, she butchers every song on it. If you want to hear the classics done right, don't buy this CD. It may be her kind of Christmas, but It's definitely not mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"she should be in the movie \\" scream\\"","review":"She should have been in the movie \\" Scream\\" since she love to scream so much in every songs. i mean , if you really want to scream, at least do it like Mariah carey. this album is good but too much of Christina showing off.

Every song in this album sounds like she's more concerned with the notes she's singing rather than what she is singing about. There is no feeling anywhere in here. I looked. It's all about her voice which, albeit good, ruins every song by making it oh so terribly heavy. Go get Jewel's Christmas CD...that's how it should be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh - I'll pass next time","review":"I'm a huge Christina fan. There's no arguing this girl's got talent. So I was sadly disappointed when her Christmas album was just filled with \\"bee bops\\" and \\"skee dos\\" - completely over the top, unwarranted. She doesn't sing any of the songs, but rather \\"ooohs\\" and \\"ahhhs\\" through them all. By the time I got to the third track (I tried to sit through each song, really I did! I WANTED TO LOVE this album), I just couldn't stand it anymore. I had to take it out of my CD player. Disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Christmas in this one at all......","review":"but sounding more like \\"I can do better (worse) than Mariah Carey\\". Like no old classic Christmas song (that I enjoy thouroughly) goes to extremes like this. On the bright side however, my hometown's Christmas station, I would somtimes hear \\"This Christmas\\" which sounds like the most decent sounding one (cause there is no harsh screeching).The best covers on \\"Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire\\"1. Nat King Cole - A timeless classic, play it every Christmas!2. Al Jarreau3. Gloria Estefan4. Luther Vandross...Dead Last. Christina Aguilera - what's up with the screeching!I wish these now-a-day pop stars who sing Christmas songs sing it with their heart, as opposed to just doing it for just the money. Christmas is a time for giving and celebrating Jesus's birth, not showing off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Holy Night says it all","review":"I know that I used to have a great respect for Christina. Hey, the girl can sing. But this Christmas CD is the most self-glorifying, insincere and irreverend one I have ever heard. You'd think that, ya know, the girl can sing, she'll hit the high note in Oh Holy Night and it will be all pretty. I reccommend downloading the MP3 first, ladies and gents. It's convoluted, strange and painful to listen to. It starts off with the \\"ooooo oh yeah\\"s. It takes a million years for her to sing the first verse because of all the oo-ing. She hits the high note and all is happy. Then comes the strangest rendition of The Lords Prayer. It sounds so insincere and awful with her oo-ing and ah-ing in the background. After that, it's a huge ballad. Then this strange Gospel/Jazz piano comes in and Christina starts to scream. It sounds like it should be played in Las Vegas or something. She's basically saying \\"Look at me! I can sing! Oh yeah, Christmas is...good. But I can sing!\\" DON'T BUY IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not Christmassy...","review":"Though Christina has once again proved her superior vocal style and talent, she has not pleased me in the Christmas department. Her vocals are absolutely amazing, but honestly, think...could you picture listening to her wail at the top of her lungs on \\"This Year\\", or \\"Christmas Time\\", or how she literally butchers such classics as \\"Angels We Have Heard on High\\" and \\"O Holy Night\\" on Christmas morning during gift exchange? Sorry, but I can't. The best song in my opinion on this CD is \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.\\" It's more simple than the other tracks on this album, though she does modernize it a bit with her wide voice range and wonderfully frilly slurs and trills. Bottom Line: Good for the pop genre, not Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I am a christmas album collector and i must say Christina has a great voice but she doesn't know how to use it. She wails when the song is supposed to be soft and is soft when she should be louder. She goes from high to low voices to often. Plus the arrangements of the songs are so boring. I think the producer was depending a little to much on christina's voice to carry the album and decided to blow off the background music. If you want a great christmas CD check out JEWEL's Joy: a Holiday Colection. It is my favorite of all time. Not only is Jewel's voice beautiful but the arrangements by producer Arif Marden are amazing as well. Sorry to all the Cristina fans but she needs to stick to regular pop albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Mariah","review":"Move over Mariah. There is a new soulful sister in town. This is far better than any other chrismas cd that I have heard in a long time. Christina has took the classsic songs and made them her own. My favorite is \\"O holy night\\", which starts off slow but ends in a pure gospel sound. Next comes \\"This christmas\\". What a song. It is an original,and is sure to become a classic. All of her songs brings the joy of christmas. Get it and enjoy. Also, merry christmas, and God bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"After reading alot of the reviews on this board I am convinced that most of the people writing reviews are Christina's die hard fans. I personally have never bought any of her other cds and after having heard this will never buy another cd of hers again. It is the least sincere christmas album I have ever heard. I have heard Christina say many times how she wants everybody to know that she has true talent and can sing.First of all I think one of the things she has forgotten is that songwriters have written these songs. The songs have lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst ever.","review":"This one is truly bad. If this is her kind of Christmas, I'll take Hannukah instead. Might be OK if you are having a holiday dance party, but CDs produced on the cheap really annoy me. Even the jacket is but one page, with neither credits nor production notes (Which only serves to protect the guilty.) Thankfully, I wrote this review a year ago and saved it, so I would not have to listen to this screeching again. (Review of the CD, not the cassette.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasal Braying","review":"I never did like her voice. It's quite nasal and annoying. She has this off key nasal braying voice. I didn't like this cd at all. It's trying to be something it's not, and it doesn't work very well with the R&B christmas rhythms. Not very Christmasy. Also I don't respect her for stealing Celine Dion's song, These are Special Times which incidentally happens to be the title of Celine Dion's christmas album."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"this album is horrible.

We need to stop this whoremusic genre. I admit that I liked the \\"Beautiful\\" single but only because it wasn't forced. I was in a Walgreens and someone triggered the singing Santa in order to drown out her craperversion of The Christmas Song.I have heard better singing/moaning in porno movies. The only thing worse would be if Nelson, NKOTB, Menudo, and the Great-Great Grandchildren of the Osmonds got together for a day long Christmas benefit in my basement while dwarfs forced broken glass shards into my hindquarters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasting Talent","review":"It's too bad that Christina Aguilera is wasting her considerable talent on mediocre arrangements and superfluous vocal histrionics such as are displayed on this album. The sense of the songs are lost and musical line is sacrificed for vocal fireworks that are not in keeping with the style or mood. It's frustrating to hear such a good voice not being used to its maximum potential. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruins the Joy Of Christmas Songs","review":"In the spirit of POP singers exploiting Christmas, we now may add Christina Aguilera to this list. Once again, she sacrifices great songs to play vocal gymnastics. She ruins such great songs as \\"Silent Night\\" by running through the lyrics just to jump up and down her vocal chords. This CD is not very good. It is best to buy the old Christmas CD's like Nate King Cole or Hank Williams. If you like Christmas songs being yelled into your ears, then this is the CD for you. If you're not a fan of hers, then don't buy it cause you won't like it. Christina should have left this CD in the bottle. This CD is up there with other great popstars Christmas CD's like N Sync and 98 Degrees. They just shouldn't make Holiday CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on Christina...","review":"First, let me just start off by saying that Christina Aguilera possesses a beautiful voice. Whether she knows how to use it is another matter. Some of the songs on this album are startlingly beautiful. Those being the simpler tunes. The ones she goes insane on, riffing her voice for all it's worth, are the ones that drag it down. Her voice would be SO much better suited to a simpler style. Playing tricks with your voice does not make you a good singer. Apparently no one has taught her this. So all in all...a poor album, with massive potential. Come on Christina we all know you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Songs were pretty good, others were simply ruined.","review":"Christina Aguilera has a beautiful voice, one of the most talented ones I've ever heard. Have a Merry Little Christmas sounded very nice. It had an Aguilera touch to it and yet still kept the base song. But 'O Holy Night' was terrible. I've never heard a song sound that bad. When she should have belted it, she whispered it, when she should have whispered it, she belted it. O Holy Night was disastrous. BUT the other songs weren't too bad on the ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Christina is good when she sings regular (unseasonal) pop songs. She is tolerable when she sings in Spanish. But when she gets a Christmas album out--she starts to get annoying. Now...if people actually buy this album for the songs it is understandable...but if they buy it just because it is Christina, thats dumb. She's so annoying and self-obsessed and all she talks about is herself and her \\"Ecuadorian\\" roots. Anybody like this should not be supported."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christina Christmas","review":"I have been big fan of Christina's voice (and looks) for years. I purchased the CD before, but lost it and did not have it backed up.

I listen to it numerous times every holiday season and I buy copies to give as presents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beauiful sound for the holiday ears, Aguilera shines!!!!","review":"Maybe one of the best Christmas Albums of all time. Christina Aguilera lets her voice shine without any limit or hesitation as she puts her magic touch on some Christmas Classics and some new Christmas Songs as well - This was beautifully done and is brillant from beginning to end. This is a must have for the holiday season collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"Easily my favorite Christmas album. To the other reviewers who trashed it: you just don't get it. To the Osbornes: your show is funny, but you are wrong about this album. This girl can sing, and the combination of pop/jazz/blues works wonderful. Do yourself a favor and buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Kind of Christmas","review":"If it was possible to give this CD no stars, I would have. I am not a fan of Ms Aguilera. I don't like her voice and the way she uses it nor do I care for her image. She ruined the Diane Warren song, \\"These Are The Special Times\\". Celine's version is much better. Christina is a white singer trying to sound black with all of those endless and needless emblishments and constant trilling. Nothing is more annoying. Can't she sing any song normally? I wouldn't describe her voice as beautiful...all she does is scream. She is a teeny bopper pop tart just like Britney Spears, whom I equally despise. If you want to hear a good Christmas album, buy Celine's \\"These Special Times\\", Mariah's \\"Merry Christmas\\" or Jewel's holiday CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS! XMAS? REALLY?!?","review":"The most horrible Xmas album I've ever bought! Doesn't even make you think of Xmas AT ALL. Felt like I was in a Speakeasy listening to a lounge singer. She should be ashamed to even put the word Christmas on this album. All the good reviews here MUST be from DIE-HARD Christina fans - or they've been drinking. Try Mariah's album, it's not a 'classic' as some say, but it's much better and actually has REAL Xmas music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great Christmas Album","review":"She does a great job on the traditonal songs. The highlight is definitely Oh Holy Night. It has a great gospel vibe at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Christmas CD","review":"I think this is a very good Christmas album from Christina Aguilera. I really loved track 10: The Christmas Song (Holiday Remix). No, this is not exactly your parents' Christmas album. That being said I think the work is sincere from Christina and should be given a chance. I like this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"She can have her Christmas.....","review":"This cd is nothing more than more product of a singer who wants to have more exposure than Britney and fails!

Grow up!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst album I've ever heard","review":"I can say with all confidence that this is the worst album I have ever heard in all my life. Every time I hear this I strangely get a headache out of nowhere. I was watching the Osbornes the other day and they were talking about how horrible this album was. I couldn't agree more. This is the album for you if you want to take the Christmas time warmth out of Christmas.When you listen to this it is as if Christina is screaming at you. You forget what the lyrics are to Oh holy night, because it's supposedly all about her voice and how many notes she can sing. I will always remember this album for the worst album ever created.If you like this then the Osbornes and me feel bad for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I Never Want for Christmas!","review":"Thank you Miss Aguilera for creating the worst Christmas album ever. Apparently you can play this one during the Halloween season as well, because it is the most sacriligious piece of [singing] I've ever heard. The irony of hearing [her] sing \\"Oh, Holy Night\\" does have it's momentary guilty pleasure, but after that it's all down hill. Yes, we do know you can sing Christina, so stop trilling every note. Perhaps you were never taught that it's those that sing the most purely and with simplicity that truly take away our breath. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"She can do better. YOU can do better (in buying another album)","review":"I'm going to echo one of the popular complaints about this album. As fantastic as her voice is (and she really was \\"the best\\" of that group that came up from the Mickey Mouse Club), Christina seems to always be trying to prove that she can sing. On her original albums, it's not AS big of a problem for me (do you, Christina), but on a Christmas album, it's just unnecessary. The over-the-top runs kill most of the songs that should be pleasant to listen to. O Holy Night is my absolute favorite Christmas carol and I couldn't sit through her version. I had high expectations of it. She is a BIG voice, but she doesn't seem to reign it in for these songs. Same for The Christmas Song. I can deal with changing the arrangements, those can be nice changes sometimes. But I can't take the oversinging. The only song that is \\"reasonable\\" for me is Hark the Herald Angels Sing. Everything else is really forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a Christmas Feel","review":"I would like to start off saying I am truly an admirer of Christina. There has never been a singer who has WOW'd me with the depth of their voice, nor the beauty of their face as much as Christina has done over the years. She is truly a powerhouse. Unfortunately, because of the power of her voice, it just doesn't seem like a Christmas Album(or rather the Christmas I am use to anyways). Her version of \\"This Christmas\\" is the reason I purchased this album and I have to say I love that track but the majority of the other songs are really over the top and just leave me feeling as though I am listening to the R&B radio station, not a Christmas Album. A great singer, a great beauty but she really needs to tone it down in the proper places. I believe this girl could become the next Barbara Steisand of this generation. If you like traditional Christmas music, this album is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like nails on a chalkboard","review":"This album is over-the-top Christina Aguilera. If you're looking for beautifully sung holiday classics, look elsewhere. Her vocal gymnastics come across as WAY too much, and at times even un-melodic and screechy. The Mel Torme classic The Christmas Song is just butchered with long unnecessary runs that are all over the place and hard to listen to. If you enjoy the sound of cats fighting you may enjoy this album. My advice: save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can review this album with 2 words:","review":"Self-Indulgent. Okay, Simon Cowell is someone who uses that phrase a lot, but I always agree with him when he does. This time I'm using it because I simply hate to see the waste of a set of pipes like Christina's but the girl needs to be taken down a few notches. I saw her sing a duet with Brian McKnight where she completely showboated the entire song and the poor guy had to grab her hand to get her to calm the freak down. Nope. I'm done with her for at least a decade. Maybe some maturity with bring her down to earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT My Kind of Christmas at all","review":"First off, let me say that I am a HUGE fan of Christina Aguilera and I think that she has one of the best voices of the last few years but I can't lie to yall and say that this album is good. It ain't. Point blank. Of course the album has its high points (Angels We Have Heard On High, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, The Christmas Song, and These Are Special Times) but these moments are few and far between.The main problem is that between her recording her album \\"Mi Reflejo\\" and this one she somehow forgot how to \\"sing\\". Instead of singing she just yells at the top of her lungs and never holds a note longer than 3 seconds before she begins riffing uncontrollably. I don't want to go any further because, like I said, I am a HUGE fan of Ms. Aguilera so I KNOW she can do better.I recommend this to FANS ONLY. If you're just looking for a good Christmas album I would suggest you go with \\"Merry Christmas\\" by Mariah Carey instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not that I need traditional versions","review":"I have Jewel's Christmas CD (thanks to a review I found here on Christina's CD) I also have Reba's and other less conventional interpetations of old classics, but I must say this is the first time I have received a CD and tried to rid myself of it on the same day. (...)Ms Aguilera has a beautiful voice and I could invision her singing O HOly Night in my mind's ear as being something special, but it seems she was to involved in vocal exercises to give the songs their much needed attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETLY FALSE","review":"Christina Aguilera is a very false girl. She does not have her own sound, particulary on this album. Christina TRIES to over sing every one in the industry. She obviously thinks she on a scale with Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, ETC. The girl should steer clear from the extremly high octaves (sounds awful), and hit high notes occasionally (when her troat is not strained.) I for one, think she should stick to her pop (white) roots and, leave the classic christmas songs where they belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds more like Mariah's Kind of Christmas","review":"I like Christina's other songs, but this CD is a blatant rip-off of Mariah Carey's 1994 Christmas CD. If you already own the Mariah CD, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Since Christina has an excellent voice, I was expecting a mature Christmas album from her. However, although her voice still sounds excellent, every song has a fast pop or hip hop background to it. There is pretty much nothing on the album that has a real Christmas feel, and you would think everything is just average pop music unless you listened to the lyrics and realized they were about Christmas. I still respect Christina's vocals, but I was expecting something more grown up."},{"rating":"1","title":"indescribable.","review":"First, if you would like to hear the equivalent of Christina Aguilera's Christmas collection, I suggest you listen to the last 20 minutes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Pure SCREAMING. Second, if you purchase this for your kid for Xmas, I suggest you pick up a nice pair of new eardrums to go along with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for True Fans!","review":"Christina's light comes shining through right from the first few bars. If you're thinking about getting this, you KNOW you LOVE her and you know she LOVES you and you also know she's an angel from heaven in a little human body so who better to liven up your Christmastime? She's not gonna bore you with flat old arrangements off the shelf. No! The songs and charts are well-chosen and, as always, the ultimate style-perfectionist with the dynamic pipes that is Christina hits the center of the target on every cut. What else would you expect from our girl? It will last you a lifetime of very cool Decembers! Get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christina's Celebration Of Self","review":"I own all 3 of Christina's major CD releases, and really enjoy Mi Reflejo & the self-titled one, but this is an awful attempt to cash in on the most beloved of holidays. She sings here with a screech that insults her material, and material that insults her usual standards (Xtina's Xmas? Totally awful). I do enjoy her Christmas Time, and her interpretations of The Christmas Song and This Christmas, but only these 3 songs really bring out the holiday spirit for me, and leave the album feeling more fabricated than festive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I Didn't Buy This Crap","review":"I'm so happy I didn't buy this album. I was over my friends house, and he purchase this cd. He was telling me how AWFUL this album was. I just couldnt believe it, so I told him let me listen to it. I played \\"My Kind Of Christmas\\" and to sum it up in one word. It's TERRIBLE, total waste of money. There is no reason to buy this christmas cd. I wouldnt recommend it its CRAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stretch That Fails","review":"What on earth is this collection!?! Aguilera's \\"My Kind of Christmas\\" fails horribly with a voice and arrangements that are neither pleasant to listen to nor successful in their attempts to instill the spirit of the season. It's a complete rip-off. You'd be better off listening to a cat in heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"We know you can sing Christina,but Sometimes Less is More","review":"Like Barbra Streisand says about singing,sometimes Less Is More,and Christina puts too much on everyone of these Christmas Classic's.\\"Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\"and \\"The Christmas song\\" is ruined by so many cord changes on every line.Just sing the song Christina the way it was written.Even the album cover.This looks like a cover Madonna used in the early 90's in her wild days.I could just picture Christina singing \\"O Holy Night,\\" in church wearing this outfit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas CD Ever!","review":"This Christmas Album is one of my all-time favorites. Christina gives you Christmas classics with all sorts of twists. R&B, Pop, Jazz, Blues and Gospel. It's all there."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites!","review":"This CD is one of my favorite Christmas CDs. Christina does a really great job creating new Christmas songs while combining old songs with a new twist. I will be listening to this CD from years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina Calm Down!","review":"The most gifted singer to come along in a long time is obviously Christina Aguilera. She ahs proven she can sing anything with that powerful belt. On her Christmas CD she chooses christmas favorites and a few original songs. Her rendition of Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas will blow everyone away. Other highlight include The Christmas Song and This Christmas. One thing she needs to do is calm down a bit. Her version of O Holy Night is a vocal rollercoaster which easily could have been the highlight of this album, but she feels the need to prove that she really can sing. She already has and I'm sure alot of people would agree with me when I say she should just hit the high note and hold it, that would send shivers up and down my spine. To me it is not appropriate to do vocal acrobatics on standard Christmas songs, but she has an amazing voice and she sings her heart out. I just wish she would calm down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of Christmas","review":"I've been very impressed with Ms. Aguilera's vocal talents since I first heard them on The Mickey Mouse Club years ago, however this CD is ridiculously overdone. While I am all for artists making song their own, this just seems a way for her and her producers to show off vocal talents while butchering classic Christmas songs. After listening to the first five tracks in complete disapointment I had hoped Oh Holy Night would be of some quality. The beginning was lovely. Using her wondrous voice to accent this songs wonderful writing. Then ruining this beautifully haunting piece with what seems to be becomming her trademark 5 million unneccesary vocal slides. Hopefully she will grow out of this need as Mariah Carey has seemed to do since her first three Albums or so. Bottom line is I would return this CD if the store would let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I first saw this album in the store, I was very excited to hear what Christina could do with these Christmas works. I am a classical singer, and Christina is one of the few pop singers I can stand because I think her talent and musicicality are very impressive. Upon finally listening to the album, I became very frustrated. She has a beautiful voice and I found myself shouting at the speakers, \\"stop that!\\" She would never hold a note out past a beat and a half in the beautiful \\"Oh Holy Night.\\" Instead she had to improvise runs for every single note. She never paid any attention to line or the beauty of the actual written music. She just tore through it without really singing the songs. For me, this was very disappointing and frustrating from a singer, who I feel, is better. If you're looking for a Christmas album of beauty and enjoyment of holiday music, I suggest Barbra Streisand's classic one and Jewel's collection. Very artistic, moving and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of the vocal gymnastics","review":"Christmas music should be many things: happy, simple, somber, reflective, beautiful, and above all, singable. Every song has its own character. But I found her renditions of the songs on this CD nothing short of a root canal without anesthesia. The music was so irritating to me that I turned it off and gave the CD to my niece. Christina Aguilera definitely has a great vocal talent, but it increasingly seems that artists like this are constantly trying to see who can hit more notes in a three-second sequence than they are interested in trying to put their heart into the music they're singing. I call it \\"vocal gymnastics.\\" Another reviewer mentions \\"less is more\\" and in this case, I wholeheartedly agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caught up in celebrity, instead of music.","review":"I will be the first to say that Christina Aguilera has a gift. Her voice is quite powerful and very versatile. However, this album is a blatant example of how she can take a standard song and transform it into something that leaves me unable to comprehend the words. I have always thought that the biggest reason that Christina sings, is to hear herself. This album does not invite nor invoke any spirit of Christmas or the frame of mind that is associated with it. It is basically a 'look what I can do that you can't' album that fails in every aspect. Whitney Houston is known to do the same kind of thing during her performances, but her albums tone that down enough for the listener to enjoy and revel in her mastery. This album makes no attempt to do that. It is an album that Christina made for Christina, and not one that is meant to be 'shared' as Christmas albums with standards should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchered Kind of Christmas","review":"THis has to be the first CHristmas album which won't put anyone in the Christmas spirit. If this is Christina's kind of CHristmas, I want no part in it. Christmas is supposed to be about nice, warm, cozy feelings, which she butchers with her vocal over-emoting, Mariah-Carey screeching, and over-extending of syllables in every possible part of a song (and in some impossible parts too). Unfortunately from everything I have seen, this is her trend, so I am sure her next English album will be as heavy as a 10-ton brick because of her oversinging. Christina, ever heard of the saying \\"Less is more\\"? You haven't have you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"4.1, 3.3, 3.9, 3.9, 3.7","review":"This album is a big disappointment, as if somebody set the switch on \\"Whitney\\" and just left it there, results be damned.It's one thing when vocal flourishes add to the emotion of a song; it's another when they're just there. There are so many vocal gymnastics on this record that I'd guess Christina had to visit a chiropractor when the recording sessions were finished.That said, there are three songs on this album that turned out reasonably well. \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\" has some of the gymnastics, but it does have the benefit of Dr. John, so it is an entertaining reading of the song. \\"This Christmas\\" is given a relatively straightforward reading, though Alexander O'Neal's 1988 version (from his \\"My Gift To You\\" album) is still the best. \\"The Christmas Song\\" appears in two versions - a straight rendering of the song, and a remix featuring a pleasing 70's-style disco groove.The rest of the album is superfluous; it really would have made a better EP."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was so excited when I heard Christina Aguilera was releasing a Christmas CD! I own her debut album, and I was impressed with her singing abilities, so I decided to try her Christmas CD. I looked at the track listing on this site, where I purchased the CD, and it looked quite promising, so I purchased it.The disapointment began when I realized the tracks posted do not match up to those on the actual CD (for example, I was expecting \\"Silent Night,\\" because it was listed on the website, but somehow is not on the CD itself.)I decided to listen to it anyway, and was shocked to hear how much pop was incorperated into the traditional Christmas carols! As a teenager, I do like pop in certain contexts, but Christmas carols such as \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\" are not not, in my opinion, an appropriate context. I believe this could have been a much better CD, given Ms. Aguilera's obvious talent, and it was a sore disappointment to me.My advice: save your money. It's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"my kind of christmas","review":"one of my most favorite christmas cds. this purchase was for a gift i have mine over 10 years and still love it .."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice for the holidays","review":"After hearing this all throughout the holidays I bought one myself.

I'm glad that I listened to her Christmas album before I purchased, which I did not. Could hardly recognize the songs as Christmas songs. Too much roller coaster of her voice. The music was definitely wrong. Sorry Christina, stick to your kind of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"I listened to 5 of her songs on Pandora radio from this album - its truly awful. Completely overdone and super-saturated with impossible notes and rifts. I think Christmas songs should be able to be sung along with...forget it with this album...its not about the Christmas Season, but about Christina. Completely over indulgent, I couldn't event hum along to these melodies. I hope she matures out of the \\"give-em-all-I-got\\" stage soon - I love her smooth tones and clear voice, but its not present on this album. She screeches, rifts, and gravelly moans her way through the ruination of every Christmas song I love - Just a bad album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad...","review":"Let me just say that this is a very un-original and boring Christmas album. There are just two songs on here that I really enjoy, but the rest are over-produced and sound horrible. A much better choice for a holiday album would be Mariah Carey's beautiful and stunning \\"Merry Christmas.\\" Don't waste your money on \\"My Kind of Christmas.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and overwhelming","review":"I deeply enjoyed the first album but it had a number of catchy tracks (Hitler in my Heart, The Rapture, Blue Angel) that pulled me in. As previous reviews have mentioned, \\"I am a Bird Now\\" takes a turn to the low-key, but the album more than surpasses his first effort. A skeleton of song and voice, this album is powerful, disturbing and incredibly overwhelming. One listen will not suffice, give it some time, you'll fall in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender, beautiful, heart-breaking","review":"Antony has the most unique and touching voice I've heard in years.

Put this band out its misery.The singer's voice is too affected/self-indulgent to be interesting. It is just annoying. Perhaps, not boring, just painful offkey melodrama. Off key is okay. Melodrama can be good. But, damn, the lyrics and music are awful and witless. The singer may want to be the Greta Garbo of the transgendered. But, he (at least as he postures on this album)... he isn't intriguing.He seems like a dope. You want to avoid him because you feel humilated for him. At first one may listen to and smile indulgently at him because one thinks he isn't a very bright seventh grader and you assume he is oblivious to a world outside of himself.I keep trying to listen to this album. If I change my mind and like Antony and the Johnsons, I will write another. (But... I think I would require extensive brain damage and near deafness. So far I haven't managed to listen to the entire thing at one time. )"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can fool some of the people some of the time","review":"Thank goodness Red Star \\"Macca\\" from Yarmouth has pointed out that this album is terrible, I was beginning to think that I was the only one. It's awful, it really is. People, get a grip on reality - no, it's not what you watch on TV - and listen to this away from the hype.

I usually do not enter my opinion, but I do feel this album has compelled me into a short rant. I love Rufus (Wainwright)so much and love every one of his songs( well almost, read on...)I own every album and my hard drive is filled with unreleased bootlegs and live performances, but you know what? When I heard the last track on his CD \\"Want Two\\", I could not believe that there was actually a Rufus song I could'nt stand...The reason? I could not bare to hear \\"Antony\\" \\"sing\\". See, Antony does guest vocals on the track, and he killed any chance of me enjoying the song. I like to think of myself as a humble and well rounded musician, but how this guy can be so adored boggles my mind.

Well, I've tried and tried... if it ain't love at first sight, just move on.Hey, personally call it a phase but I'd much rather put on some music where it sounds like the band members have grown a pair, Boris?

Boredoms? hell, even Xiu Xiu manages to prove engaging AND emotionally genuine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bryan Ferry did it before and much better","review":"I was taken aback hearing this for the first time. Judging from the voice, I thought he was black - it is a soulful croon. The album has its moments, but the vibrato gets old after awhile and most of the cuts sound alike. Boy George sounds awful - a far, far shadow of his former self. He sounds like he fell out of bed after a binge of drugs and booze. This \\"sensitive\\" singer should have thanked Bryan Ferry in the credits b'cos that's who he's bloody ripping off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anthony and the Johnsons","review":"I guess what really kept me from ever truly enjoying this albums was the lead singer's positively bizarre voice.

It's pretty different, and yes blue and glum at times, and definitely unconventional sounding. But I like piano music, and this guys voice is captivating I thought, heck I bought the album after trying it out that same day at Tower. It's cool, makes me think about things I dont often think about, death, heart wrenching need for forgiveness, honest sadness truth and emotion. This guys sincere, and I respect him for that. Looking forward to seeing more productions. Fistfull of love is cool, sort of a different take from most the other songs, Lou Reed gets up on there; I love the horns. Basically this album provides for me a good emotional template which I am able to insert many of my life experiences in (recently a tough breakup) thus allowing me to relate to his music. Take a shot, try it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a find!!!","review":"Antony & The Johnsons!!! Don't hesitate buying music by this group.

DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!!My take on Antony's latest \\"For I am a bird Nnow\\": his monstrous singing(it hurts to call it singing) will either scare new comers or make them laugh at this joke of an artist you call Antony and the Johnsons.Note: the only highlight song in this album is sung, not surprisingly, by guest singer Rufus Wainwright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"After cruising many of the respected top of 2005 lists I came across this record and a few others of a similar style.

Antony and the Johnsons, Sufjan Stevens, Devendra Banhart? What is this stuff?

Not for everyone, but that might be why it's so special."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFULLY FORLORN, A UNIQUE JOURNEY.","review":"\\"I Am a Bird Now\\" is very much eclectic instrumentally. I was instantly drawn in by how well used the instruments are, & how well they go with Antony's voice, which is like a hollow but hopeful exile. The casual listener may be turned off by it, but what matters to me is execution. I feel every single word he's saying as if he were heaving them at me like knives. The record begins with the devastating piano lament of \\"Hope There's Someone\\" & from there the journey begins, with many unexpected twists & turns along the way. On many of these songs, Antony tries to annihilate himself from the borderlines of gender, & at times, humanity. & with the grace & beauty of birds chevron in the sky, he soars."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"This cd is unlike any I've ever heard.

This album is a slap in the face to all the fans (myself included) who have supported Triple Six since their Prophet days. Three 6 Mafia is Lord Infamous, Crunchy Black, Koopsta Knicca, and Gangsta Boo--not just Paul & J. The album itself is filled with one boring track after another, and it lacks any type of originality. The skits and Outro are no longer funny, as both of the two remaining members of Three 6 Mafia seem tired and bored. The lead singles \\"I'd Rather\\" and \\"Lolli Lolli\\" are nothing special, with the former being an inferior rehash of \\"Slob On My Knob.\\" I thought Most Known Unknowns was whack, but this album is even worse than that.

This album was clearly not their best effort and sounds like it should've been released in 2005.

However, it falls down as it continually condemns Zionist and later Israeli actions with little mention of Arab activities. A major case in point is the frequent use of the term \\"Palestinian rage\\" in reaction to Israeli incursions in and occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Nothing is mentioned about any \\"Israeli rage\\" after such actions as the murder of the olympic athletes in Munich in 1972. Arab rage is apparently fomented every time Israel beats them in a war (perhaps they should stop trying to fight Israel?), but the result of an Israeli loss would be the total destruction of the nation (as well as a likely repeat holocaust for the jews there). Smith does not acknowledge this state of affairs.Unfortunately, I have not found a truly balanced book on this subject. Always one side decrying the other.

The author has the right to draw his own conclusions, but like any non-fiction book, readers must use their own judgement to evaluate those conclusions carefully. I don't know if there is an author without bias on this topic due to its sensitivity.It is also horribly dry in my opinion. I know it's supposed to be, but certain sections just drag on and on, it seems, uneccessarily.Read critically, not literally.

Yet, I felt encouraged to answer Mr ML/NJ and throw some comments on his review. I would like to start by saying that finally we see a book that depcits the truth.

We have always read many books that were completely biased towards the Israeli side. There has always been the double standard, not only in politics, but even in book pages and what is supposed to be free speach. Now, I am happy to see that the sitiuation is changing.

Essentially, Smith tries to give the flavor of how each side sees events, rather than doing all the interpretation for you. While more entrtaining, David Fromkin's 'A Peace to End all Peace' in no way treats the Palestinians as having legitimate interests, while Noam Chomsky's books have no empathy for the Israeli position.

I read one review in a magazine and the amazon.com reviews. I cannot agree with any of them.

Gabriela's voice and accompanying musicians (read the credits---some big names back her on these tunes!) blend so well and so effortlessly, it's easy to get lost in the rhythms and melodies. She even found a way to cover 'The Girl from Ipanema' in a manner that oozes sex appeal instead of rehashing what is usually a tired lounge rendition. 'Fire of Love' and 'Wanting' are especially provocative, with memorable lyrics and sensual vocal tones. If you're in the market for some solid mood music to carry you through a romantic evening, this is one lady who delivers and leaves the listener 'wanting' more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the Soul!!","review":"If you do nothing for the rest of your life, the one thing you must do before that period is to purchase this cd!

In fact, it's the only book that I ever began re-reading seconds after I turned over the last page.Shea's prose is spare and evocative; her story is both beautiful and frightening. I've never read a novel before that seemed so much like a poem.

One thing that I did like, was how Shea displays and deploys a very descriptive writing style that I had never seen before in a novel. The writing is similar to something like detailed poetry, that's to the point; however due to the depictive nature, some of this could be offensive or disturbing to the readers in certain scenes, such as the sexual ones and scenes with the girls' father. I can appreciate the book for the way and style it was written in. But overall, like I said, \\"Hula\\" was just to me, nothing more than an easy read that was definitely lacking substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Hula","review":"I bought this on the recommendation from a couple of writers.

In HULA, while Lisa Shea captures a child's voice with excellence, there is just no point to this book in the end. Rather, it is just a descriptive piece, and the reader learns nothing more from having read this book.I think Shea is big on style and short on substance. I found this book simply a display of Shea's writing skills, rather than anything monumental. There are so many fantastic books about childhood, such as LIAR'S CLUB and THE MONKEY KING (Patricia Chao) that this little book did nothing at all for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shea, Lisa","review":"Well Even Though This Book Was Easy To Read And Hard To Let Go I Thought It Was Very Hard To Understand, It Was Very Fragmented And Needed More Clearifaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all related to Hawaii.

So, I got me one at Gaiam at a great price.However I was very dissapointed with the performance of it.It comes with batteries included (2 AA), disc for on/off and volume, and a tiny toggle button. Its speaker is small.This little \\"radio\\" has 9 different music loops ranging from 5 to 40 seconds each, which are supposed to play randomly.The problem is you have a five second loop playing over and over and over... until you hit the toggle button. And for a unit made to create an ambiance of relaxation, that's a huge flaw. You cannot relax and enjoy if you have to think about going to \\"change the channel\\" continually, unless you want to hear the same five second sound 120 times in a ten minute period.If you are really interested in the machine, go to fm3 website and download the loops, listen and decide if you want to have one of those loops playing over and over.

I'd like to see him do a joint with J-5's Chali Tuna."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS JOINT IS A MONSTER!!!!!!!!","review":"I thought when I got when disaster strikes that that was the best busta could come out with cause I aint think a CD could ever get no better then that but he did most every song on the CD is tight The beats has got some bomb basslines and the lyrics is smooth unlike some fakeass rapers AKA MASE SILK THE SHOCKER AND CAMRON just to name a few. But man flipmode got the most energy in there music than any other rappers in the game This album is a MUST HAVE. Each time busta makes a cut it just gets better each time. I cant wait till his next album comes out"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Da Phattest Pig at the Phat Pharm","review":"With beats like those in Gimme Some More,Tear Da Roof Off and This Means War, this CD is constantly on my rotation. Definitely Busta's best collection, it's a hip-hop must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Imperial is Superial!","review":"The Flipmode Squad pull out a stunning debut record. Led by lyrically acclaimed Busta Rhymes the Flimode Squad show you that they are not to be messed with. Although Busta is not at his peak, others shine through like Lord Have Mercy, Spliff Star, and Rah Digga. This album is well balanced with songs like \\" run for cover \\" which come at ya, and songs like \\" money talks \\" that have a catchy melody to them. The best song on this album is probably \\" cha cha cha \\" which makes you wanna jump, but \\" everybody on the line outside \\" is solid as well. This is deffenitly a must buy rap album. With funky beats and Busta's Rhymes you can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"RHYMES GALORE","review":"Busta Rhymes, in my opinion, is the best rapper/performer ever. His rhymes galore blow away the competition. When Disaster Strikes is the coolest CD ever. I love every song on the CD. I know all the words to Put Your Hands, Dangerous, Rhymes Galore, So Hardcore, and Woo-Hah. The new Flipmode CD (The Imperial) was somewhat of a dissapointment because it wasn't just Busta. I like when Busta goes solo. Flipmode iz da squad (which is what my necklace that i made says), but Busta got madd rhymes. He can't be touched. He relies on his own philosophy which is \\"There is no time to be takin' time for granted.\\" Words to live by. You can't beat the lyrical player pros! FLIPMODE IZ DA SQUAD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Album","review":"This Album is one of the best that Busta Buss Ever did.

And my husband will agree to that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad!","review":"I enjoyed the movie. Alot. It is just not the typical comedy out there because you have to pay attention to a lot of the backstory that helps to define the Jolie character. Once you get past that hair and why she is the person she is, it makes the story engaging and well worth a viewing.As always, Jolie is BRILLIANT."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Made This Movie Great?","review":"Angelina Jolie of course!! First of all, I have to admit I am one of the biggest Angie fans in the world. :-) So obviously, I think she excelled in this movie. But even non-Angie people (if there are any) have to admit that she made this movie exhilarating and fun to watch. She literally took this average movie that was going nowhere and brought it to life. She made it exceptional. Way to go Angie!! Her talent and love for life definitely shows on the big screen. Not to mention the fact that Angie's heart is always in the right place when it comes to helping others. She is an outstanding individual who should be an example to us all. Although I usually enjoy Angie's darker movies, this one was a great new change!! I loved the whole Satisfaction scene. Plus Angie was in great shape and actually made me think she was truly this character. She is a great actress and inspiration to us all. Thank you Angie for your breath taking performance. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"for angelina jolie fans","review":"The plot: Sappy movie where Angelina Jolie learns she has two weeks to live and goes through a midlife crisis because of it.

Everyone in this movie looks like they were ready to play in a porn flick, and it comes off as porn, even though they still keep their clothes on. Jolie shows of her looks, her lack of acting ability clearly evident, and shows that this is a stupid production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this a drama or comedy?","review":"The trailer for \\"Life...\\" kinda got me puzzled. Angelina Jolie who is noooo Michelle Pfeiffer who did \\"Up Close And Personal\\" plays a Seattle News Reporter Personality is given disturbing news about what is going to happen to her in the future. Jolie takes a look at her and makes a few changes If it is going to happen...Hey! she'll do it with a BANG! The look and vibe of the movie looks appealing and despite its odd twist I will definitely check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED","review":"Jolie is so talented. This isn't really one of her \\"typical\\" roles. She reminded me of Michelle Pfeiffer for some reason. The movie is entertaining and Tony Shalhoub gives it just the right spark. The plot has a great twist as she's trying to \\"cheat\\" her fate. But her character realizes how shallow she is and well.........you'll have to see it to find out how she changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD blows away Alanis","review":"This Cd isn't just another female artist of the 90's like the amazon critic suggests.

So even lame ones are a little cool.","review":"These dragons look pretty cool (not as cool as one of McFarlanes STATUES, eh, but still...). They each come with 2 helmets. Each helmet activates one of the two LEDs hidden in it's chest so they light up with one of two colors depending on which helmet they use. The reason these dragons get only 2 stars is that they are not very poseable at all and I am all about poseability. The bottom jaws moves up and down a bit. The head pivots on one axis where it connects to the body. The hind legs have two axes of movement where they meet the body (like the shoulders of a 3.75\\" G.I.Joe). The front legs are the same with an added one axis of movement reverse (bends forward) knee. The wings are on ball joints where they attach to the body, but the shape of the wings and the body prevent you from being able to move them much at all. The tail is completely static. For a construction kit toy, these things should have A LOT more joints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three excellent films","review":"... I agree that both CRUSH and CONFESSION are wonderful films. However, THE MOUNTAIN KING, ..., is their equal in every respect. It's the slyest, sexiest, most suggestive and sophisticated film in the collection. I enjoyed it, and related to it, thoroughly.

Sounds quit a bit like Laibach's Kapital album. Laibach's influence in this side project shows through with scary random satanic sounding vocalizations and industrial thunderclaps as well as interesting bass beats. Well done in general even though it has a slightly faster techno-ish sound more than a lot of Laibach's music.

The DVD quality isn't the greatest, and this song isn't one of Depeche Mode's better tracks. However, I spent my 19th birthday at the show where these live recordings were made (I can even catch a glimpse of myself in the crowd in one shot), so this DVD has a special sentimental value for me. The Bottom Line: If you're looking for a live recording to add to your collection, purchase the Live in Paris DVD from this same tour. If you were at the Philadelphia Show in 2001 and want an inexpensive memento of the night, get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootleg not actual video!","review":"I don't fault DM for this underwhelming DVD. As other reviewers noted, the song live is interspersed with other live clips. I associate certain images (fish & shark IYR, falling water/raindrop WFTNTF, diner scene ING, etc) from the Exciter tour with specific songs, so I was shocked to see those images used throughout the bootleg \\"Freelove\\" live video. Even the current tour uses specific images from tour and videos for specific songs. It can't be possible that Anton would have agreed with that thoughtless \\"artistic\\" decision! While this DVD is relatively inexpensive, I'd rather not have this in my collection. I was also disturbed the bootleg contained a shot of \\"fans\\" SITTING DOWN. Disrepectful! The one worthwhile piece of content was the clip of Dave. It captures his comic side and wonderful laugh.

He's able to make himself the two-legged equivalent of a grizzly while participating in their never-ending rough-and-tumble play and maintaining control. The death of Bart is a sad moment; fortunately the Seuss' also obtain two new grizzly cubs at about the same time, and this video documents their growing up and learning to be movie actors. A side impact is that it destroys any belief that grizzlies are uncaring, unthinking and beastly.Brad Pitt's narration was also impressive - not some dry, condescending reading, but that of a person who is also quite impressed with the Seuss's and their bears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining, poorly written mystery.","review":"As someone who works in Boston, I really enjoyed the setting of Peale's book. Also, the character of Addington Ames and his sister Carolyn are fairly well drawn. It is too bad then that the mystery itself isn't more intriguing or the writing better conceived. Although Peale has clearly done some research on 1890s Boston Brahmin social and city life, it almost seems as if she never completely integrated the information into the mystery, making it little more than just a superficial, guided tour of Victorian Boston. The writing was frequently awkward and some of the dialogue jarring. Also, there are many scenes where the POV shifts from one character to the next; something that I have been told by a writing instructor is a definite \\"no-no\\" in fiction writing. All in all, I really did want to like this book and it is still diverting enough to be read quickly. However, it does seem to me that it could have been a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Death of Colonel Mann: A Beacon Hill Mystery","review":"A great read! The characters are well developed, the setting is perfect, and Peale makes Boston come alive. The best part is, I had no idea who did it until the very end! I would highly recommend this book to people who love a good mystery. Can't wait for the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"1891 Beacon Hill Brahmin Mystery","review":"I love reading books set in places I know well, especially when the author makes those places so much part of the story. There were also lots of great characters, a feminist perspective, and a depressing view of how vital social respectability was to the upperclass women of that era, and how vulnerable that made them to blackmail and gossip. There were moments of excitement as the hard-to-care-about murder was solved. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Victorian mysteries. There is certainly potential for the series to develop into a five-star one if the actual murder plot can be more involving."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Compilation of Shows!","review":"For any child that enjoys Thomas the Train, Fireman Sam or Bob the Builder, this is a great compilation of Halloween/spooky themed episodes that all will enjoy.

Anne Rice seemed to keep her readers reading the same historical fact about this witch family over and over again, until the reader just feels as if it will never end. At first I read the brief summary of the history of the family, and then we go on and on and on about the same thing except in boring detail, and then the end was just as bad. It left me wondering if there was anything else. I was left with nothing but some historical detail, and an ending without substance. If this is to make me want to buy the sequel, I will say, \\"no, thanks.\\" That will be the last one for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sluggish and boring","review":"My expectations were high after reading all the positive reviews for this book, but I was disappointed.

I might try the Vampire Chronicles and see if they are any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good introduction to Rice","review":"My first Rice book. The writing style, character development, and idea were so impressive that it had the pontential to join the list of books I consider masterful. I was majorly let down by two shortcomings. The first was the length of the documentary-style writing. The history was great but it became tedious when presented in documentary form for extended time. The other thing, and it's hard to explain without spoiling anything, was the ending. The ending isn't satisfactory because it leads into the next book, but the next book seems to be an entirely different type of tale - a type I find too 'way out' for my liking. Shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing story","review":"Pretty fanciful, but a good read. So good that I am going on to read Lasher and looking forward to Taltos, the next books in the series.

The detail Anne Rice goes into is just amazing, it made me feel as if I was there.

And who can forget Julien, the true \\"father\\" of the family (although I did find the whole incest thing a little disturbing), and of course Lasher, the unforgettable, evil but incredibly seductive daemon.

I really liked the history of the Mayfair witches. I wouldn't give this book a full 10 since there was so much nudity, as well as the characters rarely talking, but a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich, Beautifully Written and Ambitious","review":"Anne Rice's Mayfair Family Chronicles are thrilling, and The Witching Hour is an amazing book.....not always easy to get through, and some will become impatient with all of the family history, but without that history, much of the book would be far less effective. Anne Rice has a rare luxury, she has a strong fan base that is willing to buy and read a book entirely of background for another book. The Witching Hour is not that, but the History of the family is intensive. It is a thrilling, wonderful book, rich in detail, lyricisim, sensuality and character"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rice badly in need of an editor!","review":"<I>The Witching Hour</I> could have been cut into a novel of 300 or so pages and suffered no ill effects. There are pages and pages of repetitive description and dialogue. The ending is pathetic. To her credit, the book does have some interesting portions, particularly the early part of the \\"book-within-a-book\\" history section. If you read <I>The Witching Hour</I>, be prepared to skim large sections of it. All in all, and ignoring the weak ending, it would have been quite a good book if cut to a third of it's current length."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow start and a dissapointing ending.","review":"This book would have been great if Anne Rice had cut out 500 pages from this 1,000 page book. She tells the reader the same information over and over again. The Vampire Chronicles were great and I was looking for the same kind of action and romance. What I got was a fictional book that read like non-fiction. If you like that sort of thing you will love this book. Just don't read it with the attitude: I'm just trying to get to the good stuff. It will never come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Predictable","review":"from the start to the finish, I read, earnestly hoping that the book wouldn't turn out the way it seemed destined to. I was disappointed by the bland turns of plot blatantly spelled out chapters before any real action happened. The only thing I was surprised about was Mrs. Rice's lack of integrity in dealing with the character of Rowan Mayfair. Throughout the book, she kept it alive in spite of the bland world she was moving through, then at the end, betrayed everything it seemed she was and had been fighting for. Perhaps I just didn't get it, but it seems the whole series could have ended at book one quite plausibly. Dragging through another novel, simply to see if Mrs. Rice had enough sense to allow Rowan the completion she should have had in book one, is too masochistic for my tastes, I don't care if I'm missing out, count me out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Epic","review":"This tale reminds me a bit of Clive Barker, as it is woven within itself to provide a voice to many individual stories.I really enjoyed going through the years with Aaron Lightner, as he studied the family and worked for the Talamasca.I felt a strong connection of sympathy and fascination for the Mayfair witches.What a wonderful journey this novel takes its readers on.Thank you for that, Ms. Rice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This is a compelling history of the Mayfair Witch clan. It is an intriguing look at how the Mayfair's made their fortune, and where their powers originate.Having read a number of Mrs. Rice's other books, Taltos, The Vampire Chronicles, etc, I found this book to be far less materialistic than some of her other books. She spends less time dealing with the description of aesthetics than in any of the stories of Lestat.Overall I found this book to be very good and would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting tale...","review":"\\"The Witching Hour\\" is the story of the Mayfair Witches, beginning in the present, then shifting to the past through the unique device of a historical record gathered and maintained by the mysterious Talamasca. The Talamasca is an organization who studies the supernatural and has since before the time of the Templars. The Mayfairs are powerful witches, attended by a spirit by the name of Lasher who both controls and is controlled by the witches. The narrative finally finds its way back to the present for the final confrontation with Lasher, which doesn't actually go the way the reader would expect. There is plenty of story left for several sequels, which are already in print. Though it takes some amount of pages for one to become really engaged in this story, once it happens, one is loathe to quit reading. I quite look forward to the continuing tale of this enthralling family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long","review":"The Witching Hour is a book that is 300 pages too long. Two people before me attempted to read it, and they bowed out. I guess they were swamped with the completely unnecessarily long-winded descriptions which made the \\"good parts\\" extremely tedious to read. Towards the end I found myself skipping pages until I saw Rowan or Lasher somewhere. Finally, at the end of the book I wish I hadn't even wasted the energy turning the pages. Completely dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did Rice ever become popular?","review":"Out of all of Rice's books that I have read, only one was actually worth the time (that one being INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE). Everything else of her's that I have read, including WITCHING HOUR, is just total trash. Like the last few books of hers I tried to read (including the rest of the vampire Chronicles after the third book), I was unable to finish this piece of garbage. The worst part of not finishing this one is that I was reading it for a class, and I am to be tested on it. Too bad the book wasn;t good enough to actually finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read This, Real Review","review":"This book was toooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooong, and it told you nothing, way toooooo much detail, and history, and not enough story, no real ending and all she did was set up for a sequel(which is already out). i could have wrote both books in about 500 pages and made it good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisted sick minds!","review":"OMG! What kind of sick mind? Incest and inbreeding!If you like reading about fathers, daughters, and 10 fold inbreeding, this book is for you. I need to go bleach my eyes now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Humm...","review":"I'm not crazy about her writing style. With all of those flowery descriptions she seems to be trying to hard and I catch myself rolling my eyes.I was expecting so much more.I think Anne Rice is off my read list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely over rated","review":"The Mayfair Witches isn't what I would call an enthralling book. Nor would I call it exciting or captivating. There are pages that I was able to skip because the story went no where and ended the same way. Rowan wasn't a captivating character, she was the typical female, the quiet loner with the hot rack. Of course she falls in love with the next main character and they try to live happily ever after. In come in an even better penis and she's all over him. Witchcraft has nothing to do with this series, just a bunch of silly girls/women who fall in love with a spirit wanting to live. Don't waste your time buying all three books like I did, they get worse as you read along."},{"rating":"1","title":"700 pages too long","review":"This book actually has an ok story, but Rice gets way too caught up with descriptions of every minor event in it. The history of the family was written like a real history, which may sound interesting, but in reality is just plain annoying. After wading through 250 agonizingly slow pages I did something I've never done before; I skipped to the end. And I'm a person who has read Stephen King's longest books in one sitting. If you like Anne Rice dont read this, it'll just upset you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic reading!","review":"I think this is one of Anne Rice's best novels. It is a fastpaced, dynamic book. I couldn't put it down. This is such abelievable story that it is scary. It must have takenher years to do all the research! Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Powers that be","review":"Anne Rice has managed to write a novel that is so voluminous and wonderful that you really feel as though these women are real and that witchcraft may truly exist. Rice paints a vivid picture of New Orleans grandeur that is so detailed it reminded me of my Spring vacation. When ones reads a novel such as this, one begins to wonder how she kept all of her facts straight, it is absolutely astounding. I would recommend this book for anyone who is in desperate need of mystery, or romance, and suspense. I love how she is able to parlay beautiful love in with the haunting fate of witch burnings. This is a refreshment from some of her other dulling novels. Happy Reading!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, Morbid... Rice","review":"A long read, but worth it in the end, somewhere along the middle Rice over does the details and slows down the story's pace to a snail's crawl, but she picks the pace up after a bit and takes a hold of your will to sleep, it's really difficult to put down this book before reading it whole and even then the only real problem I see with \\"The Witching Hour\\" is that once you're trough with it you just crave for the next book of the series... remember the feeling? If you recall the ending on book two of Rice's Vampire Chronicles you'll sure know what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ANNE RICE BOOK I EVER READ!","review":"What can I say about this book. This is positevly, absoloutly the best book I ever read! It was so enthralling! I loved what Aaron wrote on the Mayfair witches. From Petre to Mary Beth to Stella to Deidra up to Rowan. All had their lives contolled by Lasher! I loved Michael also. Kudos to Anne Rice for writing such a GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is an amazing epic tale. I adored the section on the Talamasca file. The only reason it didn't recieve five stars from me is because the ending was a little to sci-fi for me. Absolutly worth the time taken to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are these five star reviews coming from?","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. Reading it from one end to the other becomes a quest. The whole time, you will repeat to yourself, \\"she's leading up to something, she's leading up to something...\\" but she's not. There is no point to this book! Look at the majority of five star reviews, even they complain about the ending of this book. Watching paint flake or metal rust is more compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother?","review":"This book makes me question why I read books in the first place. Do I want to be bored as I read wordy descriptions of pointless characters, who's every life detail is laid before me - or do I read books to be lost in a good story, care about well-written characters, and flip page after page of fine prose?THIS BOOK OBVIOUSLY NEVER SAW AN EDITOR. And if it were 10 pages long, it still might be kind of boring.If you want cheap porn, excessive descriptions and a pile of pages to make you feel smart, take it out, by all means. If you want a good story, stick to Rice's vampire works, or just find a half-decent author elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say Boring?!","review":"I have read the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice and loved them, so I thought I would give the Witching Hour a try. I took it on vacation with me and could only get through the first 300 pages. Too long, way too much detail, not enough action and way too many people, places and things that you have to remember. I decided to give it another try about 6 months later and this time only made it through the first 500 pages. I just couldn't get into it. Lately, most of Anne Rice's books I can't get into. I think she has just become too discriptive in her writting and I no longer enjoy reading her work. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it","review":"I'm sorry, but I hated it. After all the fascination of The Vampire Chronicles I found The Witching Hour to be a horrible disappointment. It's not that the book was wholly bad. The descriptions of New Orleans were darkly beautiful and fascinating. The descent into the Mayfair Witch family was chilling. The problem was the ending. At the end of the novel I could be no less than disgusted. I was left dissatisfied and quite frankly almost angry with the characters in the book. While the prose in the novel is as seductive as The Vampire Chronicles there is just something in Witching Hour that left this reader dissatisfied and slightly nauseated by the book. Then I made the mistake of thinking the book Lasher could make up for the horrible ending of Witching Hour -- it didn't. If anything, the sequel to Witching Hour made the characters even more unpalatable. For myself, Rice veered off course near the end of this novel and that mistake was enough to ruin an otherwise interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick a Plot","review":"I enjoyed the first hundred pages of the book. I especially enjoyed the character development. But then without warning the main character acts in a way that seems to contradict the developement of the first several hunderd pages. To make matters worse the book ends without explaining this enough. I never read the next book, if that was Anne Rice's intent to catch my interest she should have done it with less of a time investment. I have better things to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rice's Best Book","review":"I have read the entire Vampire Chronicles, The Lives of the Mayfair Witches and a few of her newer books. I have to say that this her best book, after reading this novel, composed of so many mysterious ficticious historical compilations I was lead to finish the series and read more of her books. It gets no better from here on. If you don't like this book, think it is too involved in plot and mystery, read her other books, but beware, they aren't half as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre, little better than dirt","review":"Hundreds of pages filled with dry prose makes this book no better than any of the timeless classics nobody wants to read. I picked this book up at the airport in August of 2002 and I still haven't finished reading it. I wish I could say Rice could have cut out a few hundred pages, but sadly, they are all necessary, as she has successfully created an over-elaborate mess of history that noone really cares about. If you like books that drag on and on, by all means, get this in both hardcover and paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious call for editing","review":"I thought that the history of the family was interesting, but that it became too cumbersome to keep the story moving. There was far too much repition of information we the reader had already received. Rice tries to keep the reader interested with incest and detailed settings, but overall there just wasn't enough action to hold my own interest. If you are looking for a detailed biography of a family of witches, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truly extravagant book!!","review":"being a witch myself, i found this book truly hipnotizing. though the she does not portray witches as they really are it is a good fantasy book. it has a exotic, sensual story. i did not find it to have much truth in it and it reminds me of a good faery tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good way to kill time","review":"Anne rice tells a good story. It takes about 300+ pages of family history to get to it but once you get past the constant repeating of the families incentious familly tree it is basiclly a story of good and evil. You really become attach to the main characters, Rowan Mayfair and Michael Curry the ending is preety much a cliff hanger to get youto read the next book Lasher which is not recomened"},{"rating":"2","title":"Devouringly Sinful","review":"This book will seduce you into not putting it down untill your eyes can no longer take the pain from keeping them open to read ever single little tidbit of this tale. It is so enthrawling you will almost feel the moist heat in the Louisiana South. You will just keep wanting more. Until your desire for more with time subsides. A must read for fans of southern spun tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I have read this book before, and it is a great book. You can't put it down, Anne Rice keeps you enthralled."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Witching Hour","review":"Riveting. I hated to put it down when I couldn't keep my eyes open. As soon as I finished, I ordered the sequels -- Lasher and Taltos -- after reading the first pages on line at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"My title says it all ...the most tedious and uninteresting book i have ever had the displeasure to pick up and i loved rices vampire books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Witching Hour","review":"Great book. Anne Rice takes you to New Orleans and although it is fiction, you get to know the city. Explicit detail of the Garden District."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice twist","review":"It took me a very long time to actually get through this novel. It is extremely long, in my opinion. But once I was able to stick with it and read past the first 100 pages or so, I was hooked. This book is intertwined with Ms Rice's Vampire Chronicles nicely. I just love Anne Rice's discriptive writing style and totally gobble them up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rice's best work yet!","review":"This is my favorite series by Anne Rice, who happens to be my favorite author. The story of the Mayfair witches is hypnotic and engrossing and a fantastic read! Lasher and Taltos are equally as captivating. I am a huge fan of the vampire chronicles, however, this series was just as wonderful to read. The characters just draw you into their lives until you feel as though you can't put the book down. I hope that Anne Rice will continue the saga of the Mayfair family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, for the love of <deleted>","review":"Reading this book was an act of faith on my part. That faith was very poorly placed. First, you get maybe 300 pages of actual plot and current-day character development. Then (@!*%#), you are subjected to another 300+ pages of a historical narrative that *never seems to end.* When the story resumes, you are dragged along as characters act in a \\"most unseemly\\" way. Finally, the ending is the worst I have ever seen in a book this long. After having read (and suffered) so long, to make the ending essentially a \\"stay-tuned-for-our-next-book\\" finish is like pouring acid in the already festering reading wounds of those who somehow managed to make it that far to the end of the book. Ann Rice? Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!!","review":"I am a fan of Anne Rice's vampire chronicles. But I found this book to be incredibly long (I usually love long books), drawn out, boring, ect... I felt like I was reading a history book in school. It was hard to remember who was whose mom and dad. And what uncle slept with what neice or father with daughter. I found myself very tempted several times to just put it down. After about 500 pages it starts to get mildly interesting. But it still seemed like it went on forever. Even during the climax and at the very end I found myself skipping entire paragraphs at a time just to finish it.I DO NOT recommend anyone buy this book unless they are just really bored and have nothing else to read. Read her vampire chronicles instead, especially Memnoch the Devil and Queen of the Damned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but too long","review":"This book is longer than Stephen King's the Stand. I can't believe it is the beginning of a trilogy. If Rice hadn't rambled on so much about all the history of the Mayfairs, especially the secret life of Julien and all the intermarriage, I would give it a nine. All and all a good subject, and not too far from being a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tedious but worth the time and effort.","review":"While it took me almost two months to complete this book, I was glad I did. The family history was tedious but it draws on your empathy for the family for what they have gone through in ages past. Anyone who loves historical romances will love this book for its detail and emotion. I admit to skipping parts, but I always returned to read them later. The entire series is a must-read for any aspiring witch. Waiting for the Taltos Chronicles......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this book seemed like work.","review":"I found this book to be very frustrating. I felt like I was in a rat maze at times. The ending really stinks. Would have rather spent time washing socks."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A CHORE!!!","review":"Dry,boring, and long-winded describe this horrible book. Maybe if I actually made it to the end I would have realized the point of the story, but I could only suffer through half of it. I quit during the reading of the \\"book within a book\\" in the middle of this sleep inducing creation. Absolutely painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Anne Rice book I ever read","review":"Sometimes the values your parents instill in you backfire. Like always seeing a task through to the end. I wish I had given up on this book after the first hundred pages. The story could be told in approximately that many if Ms. Rice could have eliminated half of the lurid sex scenes and the self-indulgent, tiresome descriptions of her home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless fluff at its finest","review":"This was my second try at reading a book by Anne Rice (the first being \\"An interview with a vampire\\"). I'm sure there was a plot buried somewhere in her meaningless fluff and run on sentences, but I couldn't find it. I read about 100 pages and decided I should stop wasting my time and do something worthwhile. Good luck if you decide to try and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"She could have cut the volume in half and still said everything she wanted to, which was apparently very little.

I think it was due to the size of the book, with my Kindle you just kept going. It was a great read in the beginning and I couldn\`t wait to see what happened, but then we got into all the names of relatives, where they lived, etc. ( a geneology tree would have helped...maybe in the back of the book ) However toward the end it got really goofy. Conversations with Lasher, affairs with Lasher, Baby with Lasher....or rather Lasher as baby (sorry, don\`t mean to spoil it) It turned into a wichcraft version of \\"Alien\\" Half way through I thought \\"I can\`t wait to read \\"Lasher\\"--but after toiling through the end of this one, I need a vacation....maybe another time!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent, until the end...","review":"This book was written wonderfully, full of detail and charactor development, until the end where I was totally disheartened, with the feeling of this being it? For me, the reader, to have become so familiar with the charactors, including Rowan, Michael and Aaron, and then the ending left me w/nothing. Again, the book was one that I could not put down throughout the entire reading (even with the slow-reading chronicles), but the ending was just so quick and incomplete. I've began reading Lasher, and hope that this will tie up the many loose ends and questions that I have. I rate this book with a '1' because although well written 'til the end, I fear that I invested much time in 1038 pages only to be letdown with an incomplete end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"The book is well written except that certain parts go on and on with superflous detail. But the climax is so ridiculous, I stopped reading to say \\"Are you kidding me?!\\" What a disappointment after wadding through all the history and detail, I felt cheated out of a couple days of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witching Hour","review":"I picked up this book to get into another Anne Rice series. It was really well written, but not what I had hoped for. I gave it a four out of five because it is really well written and it kept my interest till the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This was a book I couldn't put down. But I don't find all of Anne Rice books of this calibre, unfortunately! While The Witching Hour is quite wordy, still it is remarkable and rich in its details of loss, old-time living and the suspense of what is to become of the characters. Rice weaves great tales and expectations of each Mayfair witch and makes you wonder how she does with such graceful ease. Carlotta is the center of all loathing and contempt. I find I had to have comfort food: a bagel w/cream cheese and a steaming cappucino, to read all the installments of wickedness she wreaked upon the house of Mayfair.What a great let down it was to find the next book 'Lasher' to be so endlessly tiring and tedious. I couldn't finish it. And I never bothered with Taltos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but good","review":"Large book. Gets a little boring a parts, but definately worth it. I would recommend this book to anyone ecept those with short attension spans. You have to pay attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rice at Her Best !","review":"This massive novel is a wonder to behold.Even those who don't like this genre of books, just might become a fan if they dare to read it. Basically, it tells the sory of the New Orleans's Mayfair family, who are decended from several generations of witches. The effort Ms. Rice put into making this a believable and thoroughly entertaining tale is outstanding. Certainly, she must have been exhausted upon completion, for it truly left no stone unturned. Her amazing gift of weaving a fictional story with real facts and events are incomparable. I highly reccommend this novel to horror fans, as well as to all readers. Enjoy the fine writing skills of a wonderful author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Witching Hour","review":"I'd be the first to say Anne Rice is capable of interesting, creative work, but this one I wish I'd left on the shelf. Among the turn-offs, frequent regression into an earlier prose style... ...Art, truly. It's no shame, her starting out as a romance novelist, but by 1990 she really was well beyond this sort of silliness. You'll also be treated to page upon tedious page of somniferous family history, most of it inconsequential. This is an unimaginative 500 pager distended to an almost unendurable 1000. The topper is a clumsy, dissatisfying non-ending calculated to sell the next book. My advice, give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"People this this? Wow?!","review":"I'm sorry but I usually don't like to bash books or authors but this was completely unreadable to me. 150 pages took me a lifetime to get through and I had no interest in the supposedly connected threads of this story. The book darts back and forth between characters and time periods without mention and following it isn't worth the time. I haven't read any other Rice novels but have heard good things so I'll still try them but this was dreadful."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"Liked the first hundred pages. Then the book became extremely repetitive. The ending was no reward for sticking it out through the entire the witch genealogy. The strong female character set up in the beginning was irrelevant in the ending. As far as I could see it could have been anyone with a womb."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"How many times in one book do we need to hear the same story? This was so V.C. Andrews! Every Andrews book is the same story about a child escaping an abusive, incestuous upbringing. The Witching Hour is the same characters, over and over through the generations having the same thing happen to them that happened to Great Aunt So-AND-So, or Grandma or whomever. And Rice needs to include a timeline/family tree to keep these people straight. Oh, but then again, it doesn't really matter....the same thing that just happened to Betsy in 1695 will be happening to her great-great niece who is also named Betsy, who also happens to look and act like Betsy #1. WTH?2 words: Bo Ring....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much like a history book","review":"I am a big fantasy lover, so I thought I'd give this book a try. The story seemed promising and started off as a great book. But then it went downhill. It felt like I was back in history class. I know some stories need some back ground, but come on. Way too wordy, I just could not finish it. I've been told that Anne Rice is an aquired taste, and I guess I just don't have that kind of taste. Nice plot line but just couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Frisbee","review":"This was one of those books I absolutely had to throw across the room when I came to the end. It's incredibly, unnecessarily long to begin with, taking forever to get started, but once it does, I admit, it has lots of interesting places. (The reason I gave it two stars instead of one). However, after spending a VAST amount of time reading it, IT DOESN'T END. There is no resolution to the story w/o reading her next book. That made me so angry that despite the fact that I read all of Anne Rice's vampire chronicles up to Armand, I refused to read the next novel. Not only did I refuse to read the next novel, but after some thought, I refused to read ANY of her next novels. Waste your time if you like, but I like stories that end."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is too long!","review":"It would be ok if something new and interesting happened frequently, but I only got halfway into the book before i stopped, because I was sick of reading all those files on the Mayfair Witches! I wanted to know what was happening THEN. I didn't care what happened a long time ago. It would have been more interesting if everything was a mystery instead of a sequence of events, because then it wasn't so surprising since the family had a long history of \\"accidents\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"Maybe I should't be reviewing this book at all. Technically, I did not even finish it due to the fact that it was so boring I decided to give it a rest. Rambling on and on for atleast 500 pages about a bunch of witches and some Rowan girl,and then complicating it by jumping back and forth trying to fit in every character's perspective into one book. I honestly don't know what Rice was trying to prove. I was not impressed by this book whatsoever and I definitely won't stick around to read the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Witching Hour","review":"You're watching two people both at a life changing place in life. A romance blooms. It is obvious they are not normal people. They don't know that they are both witches, but they soon will. The supernatural parts are unsettling and getting worse. The sex is hot, and getting hotter. They are both tied to a covenant/curse that will haunt them. You will discover some of the history of witches. The legacy, of the witches, that drives the story, will not be fully unveiled until the shocking end. The writing is first rate. The story draws you in and keeps you wanting to read more. I found myself wanting to reread the book again and did. There are clues, in the story, about the rest of the story. These gave me that feeling of d��j��, but there were enough surprises to keep me wondering. There is something here for everybody, unless you don't believe in ghosts. Beware the story is not over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst book I have ever read.","review":"While I have enjoyed other works by Anne Rice, this story was really rough sledding. Boring, overly long, and, to add insult to injury, the story has no ending. Really, none at all. After the intrepid reader has fought through all this needless grot, he is expected to buy another book to see how the story ends. Sorry, but this was the last time I will purchase Rice's work. The Witching hour is strictly for masochists."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just keeps dragging on!!!","review":"I can't believe all the great reviews on this book! That is the main reason I bought the book! The story just drags on and on!! The same old information is repeated and repeated. With all the incest and other gross things happening in the story it makes me thing that the author is a little strange and I don't mean it in a good way. I don't know if I will finish the story because I see very little of any kind of witch craft stuff at all. And I've really grown to hate the characters, and to be honest with you, don't care what happens to them!!. It has taken me 6 weeks to get through 3/4 of the book because I literally have to talk myself into reading a little more hoping something will finally happen it this long, long, boring story. Wish me luck! If I get to the end and by some miracle actually start liking this book, I'll leave another review, but right now I don't want anyone else to waste their money.

I read this book four years ago and I still think about it. For some reason I felt pretty lonely when it was all over. What can I say except that Anne's the best. For her fans I would strongly urge you to read a very different novel by her called \\"Cry To Heaven\\". It's also amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel, but way too long.","review":"I think this book is potentially great if it was about half as long. Now I love a good long read, but there was too much detail in the history of the Mayfair witches and I found it to become quite boring at times. I feel she should have expanded the storyline of the characters in the present--Rowan, Michael, Aaron, Lasher, etc. It took forever to get to the climax of those characters and then the ending just leaves you hanging. I was sooo disappointed in the ending--it took so long to get to it and then what a let down! I guess there is a sequel to this, but I just don't know if I can put myself through this again. I give this book a 7--but somewhere in all the pages and pages of words there's a great story that could have been a 10++!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt as though I were part of \\"the family\\".","review":"I read the Witching Hour, about 3 years ago. During the time I was reading this book, I realized that I had become a part of it. I could never stop thinking about it, and I fell in love with the characters. None were alike. They were all beautiful in their own way. The power of this book has caused me to read the rest of the chronicles and to begin new ones. Because of this book, I have set myself a goal to read all of the novels written by Ann Rice. I pray they are all as good as The Witching Hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting","review":"first timer on anne rice books. its heavy yet unputdownable. Like a snake, it dragged me into the witche's lives langorously and seductively.but its got lots of unexplained stuff, all shrouded in heavy mystery plus i hated the way anne rice described the surrounding....almost a whole page of it. one or two words suffice for that.

Highly recommended for those who love good writing. I am not a fan of vampires, which is why I chose this series, and I was not disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Larger than life experience\\"","review":"I read this book four years ago and the story is still fresh in my mind. Anne Rice makes you want to be a part of this amazing literary world. The Mayfair Witches definitely deserve a series on HBO, CAN YOU IMAGINE!! I'm sick and tired of scoffing at these unsatisfactory television shows. Anyway...I read fiction to experience the impossible, the fantastic that does not exist in the real world. Anne Rice thank you for your writing. New readers will find this book, along with many of Anne Rice's other works, to be an unforgettable story from a supreme storyteller.

I play it over and over. They have a variety of styles of songs and anyone who loves southern gospel quartet singing must have this DVD. The harmony is fantastic. The songs have a fresh feel to them even though many of them are old classics. There are several new songs also. The humor performed is very tasteful and well timed. The personality of this group really comes through in their performance. If you want to be throughly entertained as well as receive the message of God's love and forgiveness, THIS IS THE DVD for you. I can not say enough positive about this group. They put their hearts and souls into their music. I only hope you enjoy this DVD as much as I have. When I am feeling down or in a lot of pain, I put this DVD in and play it over and over. It always lifts me up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signature Sound","review":"For anyone who loves quartet music and enjoys entertainment with a Christian focus, this is fun, wholesome family entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High energy and great vocals","review":"Wow, these guys really bring a lot of energy and fun to the stage. Combine their enthusiasm with beautiful vocals backed up by a great band, and this is a southern-gospel quartet concert very much worth watching. (Well, except for those ties.)I wasn't familiar with this group until I saw a Gaither promo, but after hearing them sing I was hooked. Not only can they sing, they seem to have a blast doing it. You'll catch yourself smiling a lot while you watch this excellent concert, which is very much worth the price of admission. The Gaither Vocal Band also makes a cameo appearance. Great show, guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I planned to like it","review":"This probably isn't a fair review since i didn't finish the book. It just didn't resonate with me. I found the main characters a bit silly and light weight, the dialogue stilted, and the premise too far fetched even for fiction. Sorry, since I really wanted to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Georgette Heyer!","review":"This is one of my favorite stories. Of course, I would say that about most of Heyer's books! Her deft mix of ironic and sympathetic humor makes me laugh, her appealing characters draw me in, and her entertaining plots satisfy. Friday's Child is your quintessential Cinderella tale, but Hero touches my heart in a way that the traditional heroine cannot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to my taste","review":"I usually love historical romances but this one is not going to make my list of good books. This book moves slowly and is filled with slang that makes the dialogue very difficult to understand. I like sharp, witty repartee rather than long, involved passages that just drag on and on.If you understand the slang and don't mind dialogue that just drags out seemingly forever, then you may enjoy this book.I prefer a book that moves and this one, for lack of a better term, languishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jam packed!","review":"With lots of characters and action. Sherry gets turned down by the most beautiful girl, only to state the next one he comes upon he was going to marry. That happened to be Hero. Not even 17, he decides they would fit perfectly. However, Hero doesn't have the social graces of the time, and gets into a bunch of scrapes.Famously lots of fun. You will enjoy this book and wish it didn't end so soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Recording review","review":"I loved this BOOK and would give it 5 stars.The audio book, though, is very disappointing. The reader uses voices for the characters that are silly. The voice she uses for Hero Wantage, the woman protagonist, is high and squeaky, and the voice she uses for the male protagonist, Lord Sherringham, is loud and affected. Also, the narration bits are rather low volume, where the conversational bits are very loud. It's hard to get the volume set right to get both parts without getting a headache.Too bad the Audio Edition is so poor, since it's a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Understand the Praise","review":"I can't understand why so many people love this book. While I like Georgette Heyer, this book was too long, contrived, and boring. The hero both hits and slaps his wife, which is disgusting, and the heroine is not just inexperienced, she's willfully stupid. I found myself skimming the last third of this book, because it was so boring and plodding. I will definitely not be keeping it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite","review":"Of course, most of Georgette Heyer's Regencies are favorites of mine, or close to it. I love the stories she tells, the British humor; I love the way she uses \\"types\\" in different roles...for instance, while the dark, dashing, handsome hero is to be expected, Ms. Heyer would offer one with a secondary, less appealing, character as hero and then proceed to make him one of your all-time favorites too, when you were sure you'd be bored out of your mind. Friday's Child is not of that type, tho, here she's got an appealing, if a tad selfish (that changes), hero.Friday's Child is a sprightly story, as well crafted as her others. The thing I absolutely cherish about her books is the accuracy of her detail. From the expressions used in speech of various classes, to the clothing, the carriages, every historical detail in her books is correct, and that alone makes her books stand out as excellent, Friday's Child is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Love Story","review":"This was the first book by Georgette Heyer that I ever read--over 40 years ago, and it hooked me on her writing. The story of Lord Sherringham (\\"Sherry\\"), spurned by his love, his rebound marriage to Hero, the penniless orphan,and the inevitable culture clash that ensues, as he introduces his naive bride to the world of London society. Sherry is experienced, and attempts to continue his carefree bachelor lifestyle after marriage. To the innocent Hero, having had no opportunity to learn the social mores of the class she has been dropped into, everything he does is appropriate, including drinking, gambling, and bad language, and she attempts to imitate him, with comic--but (to him)--ruinous results. This is a delightful book, a terrific story, written by a master of the Regency Romance genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantically uplifting","review":"This book is just right for your I-need-her/him-but-she/he-doesn't-need-me blues because it contains the tears and fear women have been feeling for centuries, and the guilt that men have known for as long a period of time. When you pick it up for the first time it may be because of a feeling of nothing else to do, but that is not the reason for reading it the third or fourth time, take it from someone who knows"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and romantic","review":"I don't know why or how, but somehow I managed to go 27 years without reading Georgette Heyer. Thankfully, that has been remedied. Friday's Child was the first book of Heyer's that I picked up, and it sold me on all of her others.Heyer's writing is so much fun. There were times when I laughed outloud. The book is obviously well-researched and manages to pull off the jargon of the time-period without it sounding forced. The characters are really well-done. It is amazing how much emotion they illicited from me. First I hated them for being dumb, then I pitied them, then I loved them. Heyer was a true story-teller. I am in awe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and delightful!","review":"This was quite an unexpected treasure of a novel! The characters were so absolutely real they felt like they leapt off the page into breathing, and the dialogue and events were so amusing I found myself constantly laughing aloud- so much so that my husband would stop his online RPG to ask me what was so funny. (And now he plans to read it!) I was delighted by this tale and consider it one of Heyer's very best- along with the aforementioned booksThese Old ShadesandThe Masqueraders."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of heyer's most amusing","review":"A very original and endearing story.Amusing throughout,and with the selfish hero finally getting his hilarious (and touching) comeuppance at the most original ending.

But, a \\"accident\\" occurs to one of the group which leads The Brain, basically the leader, to suspect that they are being targeted by similar assassins.What did I like? It shows you detailed planning of their hits; and these hits are unique and often violent. They feel so real and definitely possible. Watching The Brain spiral into a world of paranoia was interesting and entertaining. The last 15 minutes or so, the ending, was unexpected and great. I enjoyed the ending and the music was great.What did I dislike? The slow pace was effective at times, but didn't work during some scenes. Not a big issues, but worth noting.Overall, I highly recommend Accident. As of 7/29/12, it is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is recommended.This movie has strong blood and violence, and a brief sex scene (no nudity)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was side struck.

Dolan, by the Scout Snipers themselves. It is a chilling, realistic account which forever changes the reader's preception of War. It becomes clear that these men actually enjoyed the stalking and the pursuit of their fellow men; they thought of them as \\"fair game.\\" They even competed to see who could rack up the most kills. The deprivation they were forced to endure was horrible. They were \\"starving to death\\" and covered with blood, mud and fleas. This account is clear, honest and was the result of extensive research. If you have never fought in a War, you will experience it as if you were there. If you are a History buff, you will enjoy the detailed account of all the action. if you want to read about real heros, read \\"A Handsome Guy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A book ruined by silly names: General Jinnah, Orissa, Gamelan the Wizard","review":"This book has a \\"general Jinnah\\" and a wizard called \\"Gamelan\\" in a town called \\"Orissa\\", so if you know anything at all about the world, you will probably not be able to appreaciate it or even get through it.It's like reading about \\"President George Bush\\" and the wizard \\"Trumpet\\" battling it out in the town of \\"Scotland\\". It reads like a bad joke. Regardless of what happens on the page, it's impossible to take it seriously with all these silly names drawn from real life. I suspect the book is better than these three names - in fact it pretty much has to be - so it's too bad that no editor stepped in to fix this MAJOR FLAW; sadly, I couldn't keep reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong size sent","review":"Although not Amazon's fault, the costume delivered was not the correct size.

Susan Weitzman's discussion of the abuse in up-scale marriages was exactly what I needed to help me cope and understand what was happening in my divorce to a multimillionaire. After 16 years of abuse, my decision to leave my husband was only the beginning of a nightmare. His threats to ruin me, take our child, destroy my life, were combined with illegal wiretapping of my computer and legal maneuvering to ensure I could not leave. Added to this were multiple mistresses and hidden bank accounts. Susan's book is excellent reading for anyone going through a divorce to a wealthy emotional/physically abusive man. It should be required reading for divorce lawyers and judges."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU ARE NOT ALONE","review":"I have just finished the book \\"Not to People Like Us\\".

Now I can understand why I made the choices and decisions I did before and during the marriage,and how I finally go out of an abusive relationship.

To me they sound like The Format and Queen fuzed together with some bluegrass influence. Although I can listen to this whole album on repeat for hours, Live and Learn, the title track, was the song I originally fell in love with. Live and Learn starts out soft and slow with piano and eventually swells into this epic rock opus the likes of which i haven't heard since Led Zeppelin and Queen.

The minute details, instead of enlightening, cause one to find it hard not to fall asleep - much less make any sense out of what the authors are trying to relate. The 344 pages of text could have been easily reduced by 50%, thus making the book much easier to read & understand. The authors swamp the reader with so many useless insignificant details that it is almost impossible to glean any useful information from this tediously long book. Given the fact that this gobbledygook is a 2nd edition, the first having been written 20 years ago, it is hard to believe that there could have been much demand for a revised look at Malaysia's history.

The binding is decently strong, and there are virtually no questionable fingerings. A thin, light, convenient book containing piano virtuosity.Liszt is not for beginners, however.

While these two are quite different on the surface (as the progenitors of phenomenology and Thomism, respectively), Stein manages to place them in immediate confrontation and display an amazingly keen understanding of both. This is, in some ways, not surprising since she was both a student of Husserl (who deserves the credit for actually saving much of his work) and a follower of the Catholic Church of which Thomas Aquinas is a \\"doctor\\".There is also an essay on Pseudo-Dionysius included, but I recommend this book primarily as a must-read for those who wish to understand the intersection of Thomism and phenomenology)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Car port","review":"Not as sturdy as I would like but protects wife's car adequately.

It was an overall poor portrayal of black relationships and the interactions between both male and female roles. As if we didn't have enough trouble out here trying to keep each other on the straight and narrow path of positive thinking and hopeful intuition, we have this piece of trash that is not even of the calibre to be called a \\"movie\\", being supported and produced.

The men were suffering from so much fustration, anger and agression that you could not understand what they were saying half of the time.You had to watch the film about 3 times just to understand it (and that's if you could stay awake for long enough).It was lucky to even get one star in the rating and I think that I did you all a favour by watching it and reviewing it so you wouldn't have to.To summarise,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME. getting this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beating myself for buying this travesty of a film","review":"I have a enormous black movie collection and I have never seen an urban film so awful in all my life.

The first being those who grew up with the comics and the second, the younger generation of movie goers that Hollywood is desperate to grab.For some reason, Stan Lee of Marvel comics fame, seems to want to re-engineer all the old classic comic stories to gain a young audience, while at the same time just throwing tid-bits to the older generation.So, you have a Reed Richards that becomes the stereotypical \\"nerdy scientist\\", an endlessy and tiring cocky Human Torch and a Victor VonDoom who is so miscast that none of the fans like him.That being said, I am grateful they got the Silver Surfer somewhat on par as to what he was in the original comic.If you know nothing about this movie and dont mind a comic book story made somewhat silly, then you might enjoy it.If your an older fan of the comic...you will be shaking your head in disappointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya had high hopes for Spider-Man 3 but.....","review":"it seemed that Rise Of The Silver Surfer was the better movie this past summer.Maybe because of the major disappointment of the first Fantastic Four.Anyone who saw this ended up being very surprised how this one was better and better than Spider-Man 3.Silver Surfer was definately the main attraction and you have to understand comic fanboys that in order for spin-offs to happen,Marvel has to cut/slice alot the straight from comics storylines either in half,sped up or incomplete.There's no more X-Men but Wolverine is coming,can't count on Spidey unless Stan Lee decides to use some other characters like Black Cat hell even FireStar to spice some things up a bit.Hulk is going to be a \\"do-over\\",Iron-Man,Punisher II.If you look at the big picture Marvel better start rounding up the less known characters Black Panther,Capt America and Submariner or we'll end up with Spider-Man The Musical and Fantastic Four VII."},{"rating":"1","title":"atrocious","review":"I'm guessing the actors couldn't have gotten that much worse, so I guess it was the writing; the plot was weak, trying to be character-driven and epic at the same time, but failing entirely with the characters.

The most redeeming quality of the first movie, its humor, was also sorely lacking--or just not hitting the right notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic 4 Rise of the Silver Surfer","review":"I don't usually enjoy movie sequels, but the entire family enjoyed this one.

Please don't steal from your own ejoyment by seeing in DVD the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Sell-out","review":"First you take a good idea for a movie, then you add two good actors and a bunch of mediocre actors, then you stuff as many product placements in to the movie as humanly possible, then add 1000% more product placement. Next, because your from hollywood, you depict the US government as evil torture-happy war mongers who can and do send troops to any country in the world including Russia and there you are. You have Fantastic Four II.Im surprised in the movie poster Jessica Alba isnt holding a Pepsi while the Silver Surfer is wearing Reeboks.

The way the Surfer's \\"suit\\" reflects his surroundings is well rendered. The character is enigmatic and has great screen presence.Don't heed the newspaper reviews; for example, the _Boston Globe_ reviewer panned this as \\"unnecessary\\" but of course did not mention the Surfer's transition from 2D comics to film (because he obviously never picked up the comic in his life).I DO have a question about this DVD version compared with the two-disc version (both to be released on October 2, 2007). What extras come with the two-disc versions?Thanks in advance for any helpful comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multi-million dollar bad tv episode","review":"Easily the worst movie I've seen this year, maybe this decade, definitely the worst comicbook movie since Batman & Robin. The cliches come so fast and furious that my wife and I were predicting the next lines with terrible accuracy. The dialogue, direction and acting are on the level of a bad tv episode of a bad soap opera. I know that's part of the fundamental F4 concept, but it's as almost as badly handled here as the Adam West Batman TV show. No point in beating a dead horse - this is a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did they do?","review":"One of the most convoluted plots ever documented, I fail to see what makes this small group of superheroes so special. This movie should have been named Torch-since he was the only one that did anything. Other than the silver surfer developing a crush and then doing, I know not to defeat the destroyer-I'm left shaking my head at this. I mean there are better plots and acting on the Scifi channel. Alba is still too painful to watch, but she does know how to just stand and look pretty. Please, please-say this is the end to the franchise"},{"rating":"2","title":"this movie rocks","review":"this movie is the bomb. there was one sad moment in it and that was when the Silver Surfer sacrificed himself to save Earth from Galactus.

I recommend this movie to super hero fans everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thing is not Jar Jar Binks","review":"The fan base of the FF cannot show up in numbers to support the special effects budget so again the Hollywood formula is applied. The gratuitous product placement is an inside joke as Johnny is behind it. Here are our new uniforms sponsored by the Keebler Elves!!!This movie has no idea who or what it is trying to appeal to. Part action, part slapstick, part grossout (burp jokes etc) even a wedding for the girls...Dr Dumb is no better in this one, only the surfer is well done. I thought Galactus would show up with a Taco Bell sign for a hat, but he is not shown.The Dodge logo on the Fantasticar was pretty much the low point of the film, that the 'Stretchdance' and bad actress Alba catching fire and burning off her clothes.Thanks for renting this for only 99c Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing. Sucks.","review":"This movie pretty much sucks. Taking the stories of Galactus, the Silver Surfer, and Dr. Doom... and ending up with this? Epic fail. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Surfer","review":"I don't like the surfer here. His design is overdone (a wildly, monsterlike screaming surfer?) and he lost his noble and deep-thinking attitude. I always thought that this character was so far ahead of all other superheroes, because of his selfreflecting, balanced being, intellect, heart, (plus, of course: his superpowers). I prefer the older stuff you can get on utube to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Super Nerds","review":"After watching the first film, I dared to hope that the second would be more impressive. Alas, I hoped in vain. Apparently the filmmakers' goal was to produce a film that just wasn't spectacular, as almost every action sequence fell just short of WOW!. Also, I didn't care about the relationship between Mr. Fantastic and Susan Storm, and frankly, the age difference between them is more than a little creepy. What really ruined this film for me was the LAUGHABLE special effects. I can't recall the last time I saw a film with such poor special effects. The most interesting character in the story was the Silver Surfer. The whole plot line of the Von Doom was ridiculously predictable. I think this film would be most enjoyable to its obvious target audience of 12-14 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could unwatch it I would","review":"They should really decide whether they want to produce dramatic sitcoms or faithful action comic movies. Stop trying to split the difference to please the lowest common denominator of society. I can't believe anyone would be so shallow as to be pleased by this movie. Please make it into a half hour action special and cut out all the shallow \\"Bridzilla\\" Sue and \\"Jersey Shore\\" Johnny drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"God awful movie. If it was not for all the special effects it would be one of those B movies in the clearance ben.","review":"I do not see how this could be considered a good movie.

Obviously this movie was made for little kids to sell toy merchandising(SEE STUPID BEAR SEEN WHICH IS AN OLD CLICHE WHICH USUALLY INVOLVES A DOG AND SOMEONE GROWLS AT IT THEN IT RUNS SCARED, BAD BAD BAD). It is the worst super hero movie I have ever seen. The only cool part was the Silver Surfer character and his abilities. Lets hope they do not make a sequel.

Some incredible cosmic surfer is going around the Earth destroying. Then a villain so easily gets into the good books of the US military. They accept him and with the fantastic four quickly overpower the surfer. Then this villain becomes the surfer and so on till finally the beautiful sweet Jessica Alba convinces the surfer to change sides and save the Earth. Maybe a kid would make sense of it. I did not.None of the characters were interesting. None acted well.Quite surprising for a big budget US movie the actual special effects were nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid $0.99 for it and couldn't watch more than 15 minutes","review":"OMG, this is one of those movies that I rented because I was curious to see if it was as bad as I thought it would be.

Horrible writing. Horrible. All the good action scenes were in the trailer. Watch the trailer on youtube and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Opportunity","review":"I have in a box in my garage all the Fantastic Four comics that have the Silver Surfer in them and issues 1-15 of the Surfer comics themselves. I was really ready for this movie.What a disappointment! 90% of the movie is banal, uninteresting dialogue. The acting is weak. The sequences with the Surfer are stunning and the movie begs for more interaction with his character and more action between the FF and him.The end is simply a colossal disappointment. I can only guess they ran out of special effects funding before the movie was over and had to end quickly and without a grand battle. As you see the Surfer floating is space, you can almost imagine him saying \\"I can't believe I let them blow this movie like this.\\"Two stars for the Surfer sequences, nothing for the rest. Save your money. Move along. Nothing to see here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALMOST ON PAR WITH THE FIRST FILM! EXCITING AND DRAMATIC!","review":"\\"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\\" is another great film in the pantheon of superhero films. While not as good as the first one, this one still delivers the good. The cast and crew do a fantastic job of creating the film.

Not a good comic book movie or adventure movie by any standards (even the lowest standards). It's painful to watch. The acting is horrible and there is really no action. It's just dumb bickering and stupid jokes. The Thing costume looks absolutely horrible. Jessica Alba's hair looks faker than Pam Anderson's headlights. Avoid at all costs.The Stan Lee & Jack Kirby comics that the movies are based on are much more entertaining and considered part of the classic codex of comics history. Why not read those?

When I heard they were making a sequel, I just chuckled. I thought, who the hell saw the first one and wanted more?My buddy decided to get it and pretty much forced me to watch it. I would like those 2 hours of my life back. Quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantstic 4 not that fantastic.","review":"Though Marvel has hit recent home runs with Iron Man and Incredible Hulk, their Fantastic 4 movies have a lot to be desired for. The Silver Surfer just looks to CGI and there just doesn't seem to be anything worth while going on in the movie. There doesn't seem to be any chemistry between Sue Storm and Mr. Fantastic, mostly due to no real characterization in this or the first movie. They intend to get married through out the film,which just doesn't work for a this second film. Maybe if there would be a third movie, do it there, but with no chemistry between the actors and actresses, no great action sequences, the film seems to fall flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good show","review":"I personally loved this show. I watched spiderman-3 the week before and it felt so long and boring where as this show kept a good flow and had the same humor as the first one. Also I have small children who love comic book hero movies and they by far thought this one was the best of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Better than Expected!","review":"Reading all the critics' reviews I was thinking that this was a bomb worse than The Incredible Hulk. I don't know what movie they were watching. This movie was very enjoyable and fun. The special effects are decent and the acting was just what it should be. Jessica Alba never looked more gorgeous and they did an excellent job of portraying the Silver Surfer.There are some hilarious parts - Stan Lee's cameo is priceless and also some of the scenes at Reed's bachelor party. The Fantastic Four hover car was great and it had a few surprises that I can't remember from the comic book.As the original story in the comic entailled The Watcher, it would have been overblown if he were present. Galactus is nothing like the comic version and for all you comic fans, there was no ultimate nullifier copout in the movie.Well worth seeing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic shipping","review":"Good quality item.

The actors have a better performance and the story is excellent .No doubt about the DVD, full of features! My best recomendation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Fantastic","review":"What a terrible movie. Aside from the poor acting, even basic editing was lacking in this comic movie. Even if the story was acceptable and not a rip off of old Superman movie themes, the directors couldn't even get basic editing accurate. For instance, when the four star general first makes his appearance, aside from the fact that they couldn't get his shoulder straps to lay down, we expect that he and his staff will perform their roles with some basic respect for the military. So when the general shows up later with a measley two stars on his beret flash, it is apparent no one cares about detail in this comical farce.

Jessica Alba looks like a 13 year old in her mommy's makeup; a really awkward choice. Introduces the FF flying fortress: nice work for a classic bit of comic history.

Latch/locking mech operated as expected. When separated The Bottom half stacked and aligned perfectly. Rolling wheels were present and like most cases the wheels are small but better than none. With 2 V7's Mixer and C D controller installed the case was very heavy, requiring 2 person to place on table. The case does come with 2 metal handles for a 2 person setup. The case lacks provisions for laptop so an external mount is needed for PC musicians. This coffin is stylish, professional and protects your DJ gear well. The downside is weight but that is to be expected of all large flight case."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these","review":"Being French, these have always been one of my favorites. The reviewer before me obviously didn't know how to cook these, so hear: You must bake them in the oven until they crack open, and even then, let them get slightly burnt. The crispy, blackened parts are always everyone's favorites!These sausages are very tasty and highly nutritious, while low-fat (compared to regular sausages), so give them a try!!The best side dish to go with these is either mashed potatoes, or un-sweetened fresh applesauce (delicieux!).Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood Sausage","review":"We received the Sausage it was warm and very displeased with the quality of meat.

I should have bought one for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bank robbery gone melodramtic","review":"Although a must for Goldie fans, this 1973 film does little to arouse the senses. Even this well-planned bank robbery is much too light-headed to offset the serious acting talent of Gert Frobe (of Goldfinger fame).More power to Goldie for the leg up this flick provided. Otherwise, there is little else to say, except that if not a Goldie fan, the film can be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longest Chase Scene Ever?","review":"The best part of this bank heist flick is the final third with one of the longest chase scenes I've ever seen on film. In fact, Warren Beatty and the two guys chasing him must have been Olympic marathon runners to keep up that pace for so long, racing through Germany.This is a mixture of lighthearted and gritty material about an international robbery.Joining Beatty (\\"Joe Collins\\") in the hijinks is a young Goldie Hawn (\\"Dawn Divine\\") and Gerte Frobe, of \\"Goldfinger\\" James Bond fame.I had given up on ever seeing this out on DVD, so I am pleasantly surprised to find out it finally has, in December of 2008. I'll definitely consider picking this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it.","review":"I really enjoyed this book - characters, setting, and plot.

I am very dissapointed. I mostly bought it for the live concert video footage, but it seemed so fake. I think the video is real concert footage, but the music is studio! What a ripoff. Also, its stupid to buy it just for the music videos cuz you can find that online for free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it was my birthday gift","review":"i am the recipient of this dvd as a birthday gift from the previous reviewer. it was ablast seeing quite a few of those videos again and some of them for the first time. anything that can help you see the pretty fly for a white guy dance anytime you want has to be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Enjoyable","review":"I'm not the world's biggest Offspring fan and actually purchased this DVD as a birthday gift.

It's not a \\"dance\\" video, the music is boring and the exercise doesn't resemble dance at all (I didn't look at the entire DVD). I got smart and went to the library and checked out some DVDs to try before I buy anymore. I also bought Jennifer Garaldi's Hip Hop Party (also says \\"dance\\" on it). I'm keeping it but couldn't say it was a favorite either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance Off the Inches: Cardio Hip Hop","review":"If you really want to sweat it out, this is the DVD you should purchase.

I thought I could tone up and learn some fun dance moves. The first thing I will say is this is very fast paced, even the teaching section is fast paced. In my opinion many of the dance moves are very complex, at least for a person that only has one year of dance experience in hip hop and jazz. Another thing I did not like about this video is that the music is very bland and repetitive, like something you would hear in an old school 70's work out video, it is not modern and fun to dance too. If you are looking to a fun work out video, with music that makes you want to work out, and easy moves to learn, this is NOT the video for you and if you have no dance experience this also is NOT the video for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult moves...","review":"I bought this DVD a month ago and tried it just a few times...but I didn't like it! I have many dvds at home like zumba, tae bo and was just trying to give this a try but I find the steps on this video very hard to follow. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD IF YOU ARE NOT A DANCE...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"This was a fun workout that got my heartrate up, and contained enough variety to keep me interested for many workouts. The steps only took a couple of times to learn, yet will probably take weeks to really master. The music was pleasant and the instructor is fabulous. This is probably the best, most enthusiastic instructor I've experienced on a DVD. She seems genuine, and her timing and cues are spot on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun but definitely difficult!","review":"I bought this for my daughter and I to work out together (she is a young teen and I am early thirties). The steps take a while to learn, which makes this really hard to follow. My daughter still gives up part way through because it's just too tough for her to get all the steps down, but I still do my best and can at least get through most of it (with some moves that I skip). About 3/4 of the way through, I always quit because it's just too difficult to learn. I'm hoping I will be able to get the whole thing down eventually because it really is a fun video. I would recommend this to someone who is already a hip-hop dancer, but if you aren't, it is going to be challenging for you and may not be worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring~~~","review":"40 min seems forever.. Music is so slow... I do not like it at all... I expected this dvd will motivate me to workout, but I was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"Easy instrutions for dance moves. The workout is not to complicated. It is fun, so it is not hard to be motivated to do it everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancing, drug of choice","review":"Dancing is the best way to alleviate stress. Jennifer has super fun routines that build off of very simple steps. The more you learn them, the more of your own style can be added in. Within a few times of doing the videos, you dont have to think about the steps, youre just dancing and it is really fun. I have been known to do 3-4 of Jennifer's dance videos in succession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Workout","review":"I have the Hip Hop Cardio Party too - and was easy enough choreography to not watch the tutorial and just jump right in without any issues. This workout is a little more tricky and the transitions are faster paced. Still fun, but I need to work at this one a little. The music isn't great - but the moves are fun and it's a nice change from traditional cardio workouts.Short enough that I can fit in an ab or weight workout afterwards.If you are looking for a high intensity workout, you might not enjoy this. However, once you know it, you can just increase your intensity and really get into it.I really enjoyed the Dance off the Inches Bellydance (Bollywood) workout too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A top pick","review":"DANCE OFF THE INCHES: CARDIO HIP HOP comes from Jennifer Galardi, who offers fresh new dance steps for both fans of her original DVD and those new to the series.

A top pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book holds the key to success plain and simple.","review":"I liked this book so much I often buy it for friends and associates and recommend they read it. Action is the key to success and the lack of it is the number one factor I see why people never reach their goals or attain what they really want in life.There's no denying that Ringer's sound advice and straight to the point methods work. I found this book an easy read and extremely motivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Moving and Make Something Happen","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. The title alone is motivating and is in fact a quote from Albert Einstein. The author makes a strong case for making bold moves to get change in your life. It is written in an easy to read format, yet has deep content with spirituality and some science. This is different type of book from his first one \\"Winning Through Intimidation\\" now called \\"To Be or Not to Be Intimidated\\". This book shares the author's years of experience about what it really takes to be successful. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disapointing","review":"the first 50 pages are good and explore interesting philosophical concepts, based upon Robert Ringer's life.

We do live in a different world indeed, and its seems that the \\"turtoise\\" has a hard time dealing with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a nasty mix of poison and medicine","review":"This book's low rating is owed to its being filled with hatred, bitterness, bias, and a hypocrisy that mars what otherwise would have been an OK offering of common sense and wisdom. Some reviewers state the core ideas of this book are copied from his previous books. If the information in those books isn't infused with similar cultural venom and ignorance (where he lauds \\"western virtues\\" but does not employ them), they would be greatly recommended as an alternative to this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Antidote to Action","review":"This tome should inspire. Unfortunately, it serves as a sedative. It has been years since I last tossed a book only partially read.

He said this book was very informative and well put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME Read!","review":"I have read all of Robert Ringer's books and gave ACTION! a thorough read over the Thanksgiving weekend. At this time in my life I am going through a very challenging and difficult divorce and ACTION! allowed me to not only clear my mind of mental blocks, it also challenged me to move forward with my plans on a mental, spiritual, financial, and personal level now.

My one complaint is that too much time elapses between his works. His latest book, \\"Action!\\" is filled with incredible tidbits of wisdom, profound insights, sage advice, and the kind of fascinating, humorous anecdotes and stories that have always been Ringer's trademark.I always knew that action was important to success, but I didn't really have an in-depth understanding of why until I read \\"Action!\\" Ringer has a gift for explaining complex ideas in a way that makes them both easy to understand and enjoyable to read.This book is Ringer's best in a long line of great books...I couldn't put it down once I started reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Replacement.","review":"Very happy with the replacement.

The DVD movie that intertwines with the cd is corny and wack and no one really needs to see it. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it contains the first cd, and it tight, and the bouns disc which has my boy Brother Ali (although amazon has shock G but whatever) is pretty sick too.

Economy version I'm sure. The plot was nice, interesting, but the characters and descriptions of daily life...very dissapointing. I usually get into books like these, but found it impossible with this one. Very repetitive language, the characters were lacking \\"character\\". The person who wrote it didn't know how to put the whole together, for the descriptions seemed to jump from one pharagraph to the next. There are many books of this type and much more satisfying so think twice before you buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for our times","review":"This is a great book we really need today, and it deserves many readers worldwide.Although it is written in North America, it applies well to the situation in Norway and Scandinavia, and I guess most(all) other countries.The book deals with the relationship between doctrine and practise. The ancient law of \\"LEX ORANDI LEX CREDENDI\\" seems lost in much of today's Lutheran Christianity. This book shows us the dramatic consequences.All who are occupied with worship practices, music, the church growth movement etc. will find Biblical guidance in this book.The book is most readable for laymen (as my self)and I strongly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent review of Lutheran Doctrine and Liturgy","review":"This book is both informative and accessible. Preus does a good job explaining the conflicts between traditional Lutheran Christianity and contemporary Evangelical Protestantism. He can be a little repetitive at times, but that is due to the fact that in theology everything builds off of and refers back to what came before. Preus' discussion of vocation was also very helpful, as the contemporary views of discipleship often achieve nothing more than create stress-everything carries with it a significance that it just does not deserve. The emotional aspect of contemporary worship has also always bothered me. Preus does a great job illustrating the problems with basing one's faith off of transient sentiments. This book deserves a close reading and serious thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"I read this book after Pastor Preus was a speaker at our district pastor's conference. I found it to be a very good read and recommend it to parishioners. I even bought a copy for my son-in-law who recently finished catechism instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A model of clarity","review":"You don't need to be a Lutheran to benefit greatly from this book. Klemet Preus has a gift as a theological communicator. I found myself arguing with him at points but he exposed more than one weak spot in my thinking. I must have talked to my wife about it quite a bit as she kept pushing me to finish so she could read it! And she is glad she did.

It has many interesting, intreguing, and sometimes sad parts to it. First off, the drugs most athletes used. Most used Anabolic Steroids to up their strength. Some others used cocaine and marijuana to ease the pain of modern sports injuries, mostly life or carreer threatening injuries. The drugs do eventually ware off, but while they are in affect, they do cause many troubles in the sports they're in. They do cause more bad than good, in most cases. In a select few, nothing happens but the best, like the abuser becoming better at most all catagories for athletic play. They become faster, stronger, and sometimes, even smarter.

His deep passion for the Gospel and seeking the Lord, even as a young man, amazes me and convicts my heart. He refused to fall into the \\"norm\\" and closely tested every tradition that everyone else took for granted.Jim was so earnest to have God's best that he willingly gave up any hope of continuing a relationship with Elisabeth. Instead of being sidetracked by courtship and marriage, his surrender to the will of God made him spirtiually stronger and paved the way for a Godly marriage.Jim's vivid descriptions and powerful language in his letters and journals make this book a very enjoyable read.At the age of 20, Jim wrote, \\"Father, make of me a crisis man. Bring those I contact to decision. Let me not be a milepost on a single road; make me a fork, that men must turn one way or another on facing Christ in me.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"As Real as it Gets.","review":"Some books entertain, this book inspires change.

My parents spent 30 years through Brazil, starting in the Amazon Valley. Jim Elliot was a model missionary to my folks as they tried to do God's will in this remote area.Ms. Elisabeth writes from her heart as you read each word penned while thinking of her husband who paid the ultimate price.

I was homeschooled at the time and this book was one of the requirements. My dad had just finished and loved it so I was quite excited about it. Unfortunately, there is no actual story that had been added to these diary entries so there was no context to help me connect with them. I'm glad that so many people have found this book helpful, but I wish that these entries had been sprinkled through a biography. Context would have helped me profit from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous book for everyone but especially for young men","review":"Without hesitation I concluded, upon finishing reading Shadow of the Almighty, that this book has impacted me in a greater way than any other book I have yet read outside the Bible. In what way has it impacted me? The book has done several things. It has given me motivation to know God--to walk with Him, to seek Him and His will with the whole heart, to not just do things for God but with God, to endeavor to allow my God to consume my thoughts and actions and motives. It has helped me see that it is time that I grow up and develop a bit of holy sober-mindedness, redeeming the time. Jim's journal is not an idol; neither is Jim's person a god. However, both his journal and his life can be used of God to point people to Him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super little travel book","review":"with everything you need to know about traveling solo, packing light, preplanning for smooth traveling, dressing, budgeting, and security.

It was very easy to identify with Mr. Fussell throughout most of the text, as I have shared the same thoughts, goals, and pain as the author many times. Mr. Fussell's intense motivation and complete dedication to this sport are indeed very inspiring. The end of this book is a bit disheartening though, as I wish the author could have somehow found the means to continue in the sport he obviously loved so well.

Over time, however, his goal became an unhealthy obsession, that overtook his life at the expense of all else. Fussell is bright and articulate, telling his story in a manner that lets the reader experience the highs and lows of one man's emotional journey into the world of bodybuilding. NOTE: His addiction could have been alcohol, cocaine, or sex--it happened to be iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and provoking","review":"Kudos to Mr Fussel for sharing his tragic yet comical story. This book takes the reader into the seedier side of bodybuilding as well as the intellectual side of the culture that reads more than just the labels of protein powders and supplements. I'm a little suspicious of his \\"the names of some individuals have been changed to protect the innocent\\" and how outlandishly cartoonish some of the characters are I applaud his honesty and his ability to point the finger at himself.The ending could be a little more detailed and less rushed, but all in all this is a very good book for those in and outside of the world of bodybuilding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bodybuilding fun","review":"We know the author, are bodybuilders and just had to read the book.

If you are a bodybuilder, which I am, several of his accounts can be related to. There are several parts where I do believe he exaggerated a bit. I have been around the bodybuilding game for years and have not seen some of the things, nor experienced some of the things he claims to have experienced. taken with a grain of salt the book is worth reading. taken as 100% factual would be a mistake.

As a person who has \\"been there and done that,\\" I can honestly say that this book captures the reality of bodybuilding better than any other book I've read (for you non-believers).

Fussell's account of the sport's \\"win at all costs\\" attitude is right on, from my limited exposure to friends who are \\"diseased\\" (as Sam describes it). The reader can sense the palpable anger, anxiety, frustration and disappointment which Fussell so capably describes with the written word.It is clear that this is not the product of a ghost writer.

The most annoying is his incessent usage of verbose vocabulary, he used to big of words. Being a graduate of Oxford University and the son of two english professors, this is understandable, however, Mr. Fussell should have realized that the great majority of the population would have no idea what he was talking about in many cases unless they wanted to carry a dictionary with them as they read. Another problem I had was the portrayal of the various character in the book. They seem to be very \\"cartoonish\\" - with behaviors and mannorisms one would only find in some make-believe land.

The pen/stylus combo was obviously a pen/pencil in a previous life -- there's a pencil eraser under the top cap, and if you push the cap (in stylus mode) the stylus pokes way out and you have to push it back in. It's obvious that they just replaced the lead-advance mechanism with a stylus tip.

What I really wanted was a stylus that was better than the plastic junk that came with my Cassiopeia. And, I thought that this peice of junk would actually fit into my PDA. This is what I was led to belive according to the Casio web site and this site. Well, it doesn't fit, and it won't fit into any PDA, unless you have a PDA the size of you head. It's a complete waste of money. It's cheaply made, and cumbersome. A wooden stick would do better, for writing on paper or your PDA.

Shot in London's Royal Albert Hall, It features Brian Wilson accompanied by a large backing band playing a note for note rendition of Pet Sounds. To the band's credit, they faithfully transfer the impossible task of the album's harmonies and instrumental nuances to a live setting. I must say the Wondermints and crew do an amazing job vocally. The big problem lies with Wilson himself: HE CAN'T SING ANYMORE. Gone is his chilling falsetto of the 60s, replaced with some haggard elderly man trying to save face. Maybe a DVD with the full backing orchestra would have been more appropriate, as they could hide his own voice. The orchestra would also help in some of the band's more hollow moments, such as the opener \\"Wouldnt It Be Nice\\" and \\"God Only Knows\\" I can't see how the DVD would appeal to Wilson's hardcore fans, as this performance is just pitiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly produced concert video","review":"This DVD is absolutely unwatchable because of the way it is edited. There are cuts from shot to shot just about every 3-5 seconds and it will make you dizzy to watch it. To me, the director/editing of this thing completely ruined Brian Wilson's performance. Any director/producer/editor of concert videos needs to study The Last Waltz to see how it's done. Fewer cuts, fewer close ups, etc. Too bad this performance is ruined by a bad video document such as this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting wildlife pictures","review":"You may get some funny looks as you stick your head into this book to look through the 3-D glasses, but it is well worth it! There are some remarkable photos; my favorites include the Marine Iguana, the Galapagos shark, and the Stone Scorpionfish (which looks like something from Star Wars). Mark Blum specializes in underwater stereo photography, and some of the underwater photos such as the seahare or spotted moray eel really pop out. There are also the Galapagos favorites such as Sally Light-Foot Crabs and Sea Lions. Only a few of the pictures did not work that well in 3-D, such as the brown pelican, or some of the habitat photos, but provided for well-rounded text. Associated with each of the 44 pictures is a useful paragraph that introduces the species or habitat. For example, I did not know that the sex of the Giant Tortoise offspring depended upon the temperature of the nest. A fun book for any age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Bought this book for an essay I had to write in school. For anyone who has read Zizek before - this book is classic Zizek. Love it or hate it, his style is provocative and incredibly insightful. As he admits in the first few pages, this book is not exactly about Iraq. Rather, it is about everything that happened around Iraq. Expect a lot of psychoanalysis, Hegelese, and and Zizek's jokes from the Soviet era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well meaning but not tasty","review":"There are very good things to say about these licorice bears: the ingredients are all organic, there are no animal ingredients like gelatin, and no wheat gluten. And each 3.5oz box contains four smaller pouches, making it easier to give kids small treats.Unfortunately, there's also a huge downside: they're not tasty. While there's no arguing over taste, I've tried lots and lots of licorice candies, and these rank way at the bottom. The main problem is actually the texture: they're very gritty. Unlike chewier licorice, these are like a gummy bear without the 'bounce', and with a granular texture added.I recommend trying Gustav's brand licorice instead. Drops if you like soft, and Cats or Coins if you like chewier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious book!","review":"This is the first book in a series of four about a girl, named Rilla, who recieves a mysterious present in the mail announcing that someone has bought her a year-long subscription to the Monster of the Month Club.

This is not a book that discusses the DMAIC model or the actual statisitics involved in Six Sigma in any great length so if that is what you're looking for you need to look elsewhere.

They also failed to represent the ammount of collaboration and experimentation between the acts and artists in attendance. It seems that the main purpose of the DVD is to target people who were interested, but did not attend, and give them a popish, hollywood style 2 hour commercial about why they should buy tickets next year.

But given the expensive ticket price in the first place, you probably don't need to buy it. Oh by the way, still no moe.

The green cabbage, for example, has a rough, wrinkly spot to touch that feels like cabbage! The added bonus is the illustrations throughout the book. They are bright, bold, and pleasantly simple.

For many people who was already a DBA with a good Knowledge of SQL language , the book is more dispersive, and it's not focused on the basics information that a DBA want to know like users administration, backups and so on Finally it is a good book, for all novice people of oracle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be better","review":"As with most other books from Oracle Press, this reference is incomplete and poorly organized. There's quite a bit of useful stuff in here, but most of the topics discussed are never delved into great detail--so it's very good for an overview, but if you actually want to get things working, you'll need to go elsewhere. I find the organization to be very strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"As it says, it is a reference book. I use it often.

It is a bit problematic though that it does not cover OCI or Pro*C as mentioned in another review.However, the money is still well spent as is the money you would spend on buying Oracle vs SQL Server 7.0. Oracle provides better cost of ownership and is infinitely more scaleable than SQL Svr 7.0 could ever hope to be so in the long run you get what you pay for. The cost in downtime alone of SQL Srvr will make up that price difference in no time and eventually cost you more to have gone with the \\"cheaper\\" solution. Besides, 9 out of 10 of the biggest web sites (including this one!) can't be wrong. Go with Oracle or be left in the dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broad but Shallow","review":"This book is very broad and covers a LOT of material. Unfortunately, unless it was about 8,000 pages long, it wouldn't be a perfect reference. I DO use it when my other Oracle books don't give me enough information (i.e. DBA Handbook and ORA8 PL/SQL). I think this one also comes with a CD of the contents in digital form. VERY handy reference material."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just too big to lift","review":"If you're doing Oracle programming, you probably need a complete reference.

He was delighted for all the obvious reasons - it's a fun, rideable gigantic Thomas that plays all the fun songs. He ignored all other gifts for this one.However, I agree with everyone else's review...the black handle is absolutely ineffective. My husband even tried glueing it to make it work...it now lies on the floor in a corner of our dining room. The red handle is also very poor quality...turns in it's hole and comes out entirely. My son likes this, but I know it's not supposed to work that way. Lastly, the fun buttons that played the cute music have stopped working one by one. I haven't totally minded this, but it's been disappointing.If you're looking for a push toy, go elsewhere! I had no idea this toy was so expensive, and sincerely hope my mother in law paid less for such a poor quality item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Like others have said, the black handle/back comes off too easily and it winds up sitting in a corner somewhere. My 2 year-old who has never broken a toy or ripped a page in a book managed to break the button that plays the song - in just one month after receiving this toy.

Fine, I brought it back and bought another one because this toy is so darn cute. Well, it has been one week and the same problem has occurred. The buttons that play the sounds have \\"collapsed\\" again! I can assure you my son has not abused the toy in any way and this defect is manufacturer fault. For such an expensive toy, I am very disappointed. Should I try and get a third one? I highly doubt I want to go through this trouble again.

It falls into that category of mid-budget live action Disney films from the early 1970's. Most of them are forgettable although they were fun at the time. I like to think that \\"Snowball Express\\" is a little big funnier than the standard fare. There are some clever jokes, and some truly funny slapstick here, all with a nice Winter theme.Disney stand-by Dean Jones does his usual work here, as a city man who inherits a big bunch of mountain, and decides to move his family and open a ski lodge. Harry Morgan (Col. Potter from M.A.S.H.) adds a bit more fun as Jesse McCord the two-bit mountain man leading him a hand.There are the usual hijinks; someone wants to buy the property, there is a snowmobile race, some backwards skiing. All in all this is an easy, fun movie to watch around Christmas time."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't stop laughing","review":"This movie is hysterical. My 13-year-old niece even loved it.

This cable however had speckles on the xmedia bar screen whenever there was black and during movie trailers in darker scenes and it made a popping noise when the ps3 was turned off (I believe this was mentioned in another review). I know this because when switching to the expensive cable it had outstanding picture and doesn't miss any details, including dark scenes or black.

To my disappointment, I learned from the booklet inside that the clarinet performers are the mediocre Gervase de Peyer and Keith Puddy. de Peyer's playing in the Brahms quintet is rather disturbing with his sloppy phrasing and tasteless vibrato. The Melos Ensemble surely deserves a better clarinet soloist, but then at the time of this Brahms recording (1964), there were maybe not too many good clarinetists around."},{"rating":"2","title":"liricas","review":"this guy can out rap nas kool g anybody when it comes to droping knowledge this guy is the best the only reson he isint the biggest is because los gueros ae scared of nuestra raza if u are latino buy this dxont bootleg support la razaLATINO PRIDE WORLD WIDE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous photos, and excellent information.","review":"I wish I found this book when I first arrived in New Delhi two years ago.

I'm not going to say his point of view was wrnog, but the film is so over the top biased that it gets a little insulting. I did find parts of it interesting but as I said, it sort of loses any credibility along the way when you can see the bias in pretty much every scene.

I know that cinema v��rite films are traditionally shot hand-held in an informal style, but this film was shot so poorly that you could actually get motion sickness watching it on a large screen. It literally looks like it was shot by a child with a short attention span. The shots are filled with gratuitous zooms, shaky long shots, and close-ups that are too close.

If you think the wine world is absent the kind of treachery or price manipulation that you associate with Exxon, you are much mistaken. This film is beautiful and fascinating to watch.

The power of the press - at last someone has pricked the bubble that is the unholy alliance of journalists and big business, no where more devious than in the drinks trade.A delightful film for allwine professionals and consumers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very engaging.","review":"This movie is a disappointment considering it was made at a time when so many of the survivors were still alive and recently freed from Russian captivity. The film covers the experiences of a veteran German officer assigned as an advisor to a Rumanian Army Corps on the eve of the Stalingrad encirclement. The film does not go into any kind of depth either in terms of character development or story line to explain the importance and tragedy of Stalingrad. One must think that it even disappointed it's original German viewers of the 1950's who probably desired some kind of explanation for the disaster of Stalingrad and the Nazi era.As an anti-war film this film is a failure; as a shoot 'em up action war film it is droll.

This book, however, will turn people off Chaucer. It seems to have been written from a 1950s perspective, and so is 50 years out of date. The author seems very pleased with his own ideas, but manages to ignore the wealth of good scholarship that would show his ideas to be outmoded at best, and just plain wrong at worst.

I have noticed some unusual side effects taking it, one being the need to make a bowel movement frequently. I researched this on google and glutamine should not do that, in fact it should ease your bowels. Others in my house who had trouble with constipation tried this for other issues and they had the same side effect. I continue to take it knowing that because it does work. I purchased this because it was half the cost of the powder and should last much longer as you take capsules as needed.

And now my 2 favorite Sondheim shows are on DVD! (Into the Woods being my second favorite). I too saw this show on Broadway in 1979 at the, then named, Uris Theatre. Staggering is a very good word for this show. A MUST have for anyone who even remotely likes Sondheim. I can clearly remember sitting in the theatre at the end of the show just stunned by what I had just seen and not realizing that the theatre had emptied!!! An usher had to snap me out of it!!!

Long vibratos as if it were a competition of who had the loudest and most obnoxious one. You couldn't even hear the pitch they were trying to \\"sing\\".

Production on LaserDisc and alas, both of my LaserDisc players bit the dust! I've been emailing Image Entertainment for months begging them to issue this on DVD. (...)I just viewed the San Francisco Symphony \\"Concert Production\\" (with the participation of Sondheim and George Hearn) and it, too, is excellent, thought the theatricality on a symphony stage cannot match the staging even as done in the Los Angeles \\"road company\\". And THIS version has a true treasure of Sondheim -- for which he tailored the vocal role down to the NOTE, we hear -- the marvelous Angela Lansbury!I'm pre-ordering mine right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show, Lousy Recording","review":"I first saw Sweeney Todd on Broadway over 20 years ago, and was thrilled to be given the chance to revisit it now on DVD. If you love the dark comedy/thriller genre and are prepared to find cannibalism amusing at times, this one is for you. (Decades after seeing it I still announce to my family on the rare occasion that I make shepherd's pie that we're having \\"Shepherd's pie peppered with actual shepherd on top!\\") The music is FANTASTIC and creepy and Angela Lansbury is absolutely in top form. The problem is this; The recording was made as a low quality, live recording for PBS TV over twenty years ago. As a result, you will see the colors are less vivd than they should be, the picture quality is a little shabby and the show sounds like a flat, worn out tape recording. Still, this is a great performance of a Broadway classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweeney magic","review":"this is by far my favorite stage musical. george hern captures sweeney todd like no other and it was quite refreshing to see angela lansbury not on murder she wrote this was instead numerous murders that she endorsed. the singing, the acting, the writing - all pure genius!!

In comparison to this version of Sweeney, Pippin has amazing cinematography.Now yes this is a good musical, yes this is the version with Lansbury and the first version with Hearn. But cinematography wise, this version is a complete train wreck. For one there's too many closeups during the drama scenes, not allowing us to see the rest of the set. As for the far shots and shots from above, they become more of a distraction than anything else. The editing is quite bad too- constant jump cutting, which makes ruins the \\"filmed at one show\\" thing. I wish my hair could randomly fix itself without me touching it like Hearn's in \\"A Little Priest\\"! Actors' poses change positions, not to mention some songs looked lip synched due to bad production.In short, steer clear of this horrid video, look for a bootleg of the same tour, or get the concert version with Neil Patrick Harris and Patti LuPone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good service.","review":"The DVD arrived incredibly quickly. I have yet to watch it, but I love SWEENEY TODD, so I know it will be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Toss Your VHS!","review":"Thanks to some nameless technician somewhere in DVDland who doesn't understand \\"live\\" theatre, we have one of the worst transfers in DVD history. \\"Sweeney Todd\\" depends upon the audience interactions with the cast; otherwise the actors/singers look ridiculous and mere cartoons. While the sound from the stage is wonderfully clear, the audience reactions are so muted and remote that, even with the sound amplified, they are in the next county. What a poor decision! What a waste of a wonderful performance! And I saw this production live two weeks before it was videotaped. (I can only hope that someone with surround-sound will let us know that one can actually hear the audience around you!) Otherwise, it's a poor investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the musical, but...","review":"I love the musical. My favorite. However, this isn't a very nice version of it. It's a bit blury and the camera is at times unsteady. Also not my favorite cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Excitement!","review":"Words cannot express how excited I am that this version is finally coming out! I bought Sweeny Todd Live in Concert on DVD, and was dissapointed in it. There was something missing and that thing was Angela!(...)I am so exicted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Sweeney Todd is a musical masterpiece. From its ingenious use of motives to its dark story, Sondheim and Wheeler have crafted a brilliant show. Every performance in this version is note-perfect, especially George Hearn as Sweeney. Some people may find the idea of revenge, murder and cannibalism to be too dark for musical theater, but Sondheim tempers them with show-stoppingly funny musical sequences and some of the most gorgeous music ever written for the stage. There is not a single misstep in this production. Worth a look for any fan of musical theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"missing this is missing life","review":"a stunning musical. brilliant in this execution, missing seeing this is not something you want to do. the music producers thought you'd be too stupid to understand this - watch this and prove them wrong. The word's \\"no ones going to harm you\\" will never mean the same to you again. because it is about england's boogyman, I highly recommend watching this on a cold fall evening just before halloween!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Demon barber becomes victim of demon editor","review":"I love Sweeney. Hate the re edit. Whats with all the TV style closeups? Loses a lot of the original stageplay feel that gives this production its charm. Who's idea was it to messwith near perfection...sigh. My tape finally broke so I got this and was initially very excited until I saw what they had done to it. Better than nothing but I wish I still had the orginal VHS. Worth watching, yes, marginally. Taking the audience out as one other person put it does kill the \\"LIVE\\" ambiance(sp). Quality marginally better than the tape. So many sighs, so little time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The not-such-a-demon barber of fleet street","review":"It is easy to see why Angela Lansbury won a Tony for this peformance. The sets, scenery and costumes are wonderful. The cast is quite effective, but at times it is very hard to distinguish some of the lyrics in the larger production numbers. A must see for anyone that is aware that Tim Burton is going to bring his own unique take on this story to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I remembered.","review":"When I bought the Sweeney Todd in Concert DVD, I reviewed that it was a good place-holder until this DVD came along. I was wrong. Except for Lansbury's performance, there's entirely too much about this production that makes the more recent concert version more recommendable. For starters, the camerawork doesn't age well, with cheesy closeup shots that steal thunder from the hugeness of the staging. This is hardly a deal-breaker though; however the supporting performances are. Hearn and Lansbury are great. Lyndeck is good. The young lovers on the other hand are wretched. The actress who plays Johanna makes this DVD nearly impossible for me to watch.Of course those are personal problems; your mileage may vary. The transfer is decent, preserving the quality of the '82 video. I'm glad to own this for archival purposes. It's nice to see the original set and some of the original performances. Those make this DVD worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"SweeneyToddRocks!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love Sweeney Todd.

If you like morbid humor, you will greatly enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent show, DVD could be better","review":"I'm a huge fan of Sweeney Todd, having seen the original Broadway cast as well as the concert version and the latest minimalist revival (both starring Patty Lupone). It was great to see the release of this version of the show, and the editing and sound are excellent. The show was apprently taped \\"live\\" in front of an audience at least once, and then probably performed once or twice more to capture the additional camera angles. Some of these additional camera angles are lip-synched, but it's done well and not distracting.I would have given the DVD five stars if the image quality had been better and if there had been some bonus features on the DVD. As it is now, it's a basic recording of a great performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome...Wonderfully Blessed!","review":"This album further compliments the astonishing work the artist has done along with the spectacular singing of The Love Fellowship Choir!

Much of this journal consists of accounts of which drugs Aiden did in which nightclub in the company of which people. It quickly becomes repetitious and a but dull. Perhaps the private life of a porn star is better left to the imagination because in this account, Aiden's life seems shallow and limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting personal perspective","review":"This is a most interesting, personal account of \\"how\\", \\"what\\", and some \\"why\\" a person has become what he is in the moment. The perspective is intensely genuine, as much as the author is capable. I found this a fascinating view into the life of a physical, although necessarily remote, personality and his attempts to deal with his own evolution. It seems that many of the other reviews(printed here) have approached the writing from their OWN perspective. I do not feel that that is valid and appreciate Mr. Shaw's revelations and insight into a whole world that is both limited and international. How delightful to find that these fantasy figures are also real people and have distinct and impressive talents beyond what most perceive as their \\"genre\\". Thank you Mr. Shaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and clueless","review":"Presumably this was written because Mr. Shaw needed money. If he actually intended to share something with a reader - a not unjustifiable expectation on the part of a prospective reader - he failed incredibly well. The title leads one to think that love may actually be part of what is presented and hopefully some insight into that elusive and very pervasive human emotion. However, Mr. Shaw gives the reader neither insight, nor even the occasionally well written sentence. At best this reads like the narcissistic memoir of an inflatable doll. Scratch beneath the handsome picture of Mr. Shaw on the cover and you'll find that there is no there there, as Gertrude Stein once said. And that's the kindest thing that can be said on the basis of what's presented as his life in this book. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This is the most BORING autobiography ever written. Nothing exciting nothing revealing,NOT A SINGLE PHOTO.

However Aiden Shaw is known for being \\"not bright\\" so I expect like all his writings it will be appalling which makes it amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Sad","review":"I couldn't put this book down, because I was anticipating the turning point, where Mr. Shaw realized that his life of sex and party drugs was ruining his life. Shockingly, that time never arrived. Shaw is against taking a prescribed anti-depressant because it interferes with his sexual potency, but he has not hesitation taking cocaine, crystal meth, and LSD on a regular basis, which can't help his HIV status too much. He does a lot of crying and very little introspection. There are numerous relationships with toxic people, most of whom he thinks are his friends.I am curious as to what the author thinks his \\"undoing\\" really is. In my opinion, his undoing is the fact that he is totally unable to realize how dysfunctional his life is and how much he needs to change it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improving the On-Q Enclosure","review":"For those who have the On-Q Enclosure installed, the extender is an excellent way to provide more depth and contribute to better control of wiring, plugs and receptacles contained in the basic box.

A quirky, winning comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like Elling","review":"Sorry but this movie was not my style.

After years of therapy (it's not clear how long they're institutionalized), they're released to try to make it on their own, with occasional checkups from a halfway-house sort of social worker who tries to help ease their transition back into society.Watching these two fellows cope with a ringing phone, feeding themselves, the big bad world outside their apartment, traffic, a pregnant neighbor, and an old poet with a broken car is heartwarming, a little sad at times - but always you find yourself rooting for them to find happiness.Their small triumphs, larger setbacks, and overall progress make for a touching, unbeat, and absolutely hilarious movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"tempered inspiration","review":"You won't cry.

I laughed so hard I really did fall off the sofa.Elling is such a very humane exploration of mental illness and recovery, with that special Norwegian sense of constant self-deprication. Yes, it's a Nordic \\"Odd Couple\\" for sure, but Elling is bigger and far more courageous than the TV sitcom ever was. Nothing is ever played for a cheap laugh. And, I found myself cheering for Elling and Kjell Bjarne as each of them took baby steps toward wholeness and independence.Elling's discovery of himself as a poet, and his guerilla poetry expeditions--leaving poems inside containers of sauerkraut--was so touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie.","review":"We saw this one on IFC once and I was hooked.

If the photo writes to your card in 2.5 seconds instead of 3.0, will it change your life? Also, the read speed (for viewing and downloading) is all about the same. There are three good reasons to buy this card:1. Lexar is a very reliable name brand.2. Price.3. WA technology may be good to have in the future.The card-reader bundled with this card works, but is cheap and not 100% reliable. Better to buy a nice multiple format card-reader if you want one.

You feel like you're really there traveling with the author when you read it.The only bad things about the book are McCarthy's negative stereotyping of Americans and his apparent belief that people whose ancestors came from Ireland generations ago have no right to 'claim' Ireland, while he does because he's only one generation removed.But, all in all, definitely a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent portrayal of true Irish life!","review":"As an Irishwoman myself, more than used to typical 'Oirish' stereotyping, this book is a real - and most welcome - gem.

Unfortunately, and somebody please tell him, so is Pete McCarthy. I never read an author who seemed as pathetically desperate to be Irish. Expecting good humor, interesting tales, and at the least well written prose, I was dissappointed to discover in the pages of this book perhaps the worst travel prose I have ever come across. It is completely lacking in depth, humor (it is touted as a humorous peice), insight, or even decent observation. It is one of the worst books I have read in years. Pete McCarthy, congrats on landing a book deal, as you certainly did not deserve it. Sorry Pete, spendng summers there as a kid makes you about as Irish as the typical fat American tourist. Not at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very dissappointing book","review":"This book was recommended by a friend (not Irish) who thought it was hilarious.

After traveling much of Ireland myself and being especially interested in antiquities I was looking forward to a wonderful read. One wonders what actually motivated him to write. I do not appreciate the humor of ridicule and cultural profiling. At the risk of doing what he has done to so many others in his book, I won't comment further. I only hope that Mr. McCarthy finds some serious help with the unhappiness in his life so that he may channel his sense of humor to enhance rather than debase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crock of gold??????","review":"I am not going to win any friends with this review. The people who buy this book are people buying into the whole Ireland myth of everyone being friendly and the craic being great.

Clich��d, blinkered and tired. (And Pete, you aren't Irish, much as you'd like to be: - you're English-Get over it!)And in case anyone thinks this is a knock the Irish review, I live here and holiday exclusively around Ireland every year- but this is written with such unimaginative broad strokes that it deserves to have criticism heaped upon it... watch out for the Leprechauns there Pete, you Guinness drinking wild man you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rest in Peace, Mr. McCarthy!","review":"We were living in Scotland when we both read this book. We had been to the re-enactment of the Battle of Ballinamuck in County Longford in 1998 a year before or so. It was where my husband's Grandfather came from and left in 1914. Immediately after reading it, he wanted to go back. Pete McCarthy captures it all too well, especially the genetic memory. One other reviewer stated that Americans go there to get cheap real estate.I suggest you try it and see that there is NO cheap property going for sale in Ireland anymore!Pete McCarthy did not use a computer to write. Everything was hand written or typed first before he handed it over to someone. Perhaps that is why we got so little from him in. Also read his other book, The Road to McCarthy. Brilliant, as well. McCarthy's Bar, however, will be the one that we will read for a third time. His passing is a great loss to Britain and Ireland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the experience of a trip around the West","review":"When I saw the two miserable reviews below from Irish readers I had to counter with a positive one. This is an hilarious read. Yes, he's got his tongue firmly in cheek and plays up the drinking a bit much, but a book is a performance every bit as much as a play or a stand-up routine. McCarthy's true to the spirit of the place and this was never intended as a dry guide book to Ireland. If you want to relive a vacation you enjoyed years ago or have been dreaming of taking a first trip, this book will bring back good memories or inspire you to book your tickets."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"An Irish Bill Bryson\\"","review":"McCarthy, son of an English father and and Irish mom, decides to travel to Ireland to search out his roots.

I really enjoyed the author's comments on the country. He spends most of his time in the western part of the Ireland and it directly related to my trip.

Pete McCarthy is just Irish enough to be fascinated with the Irish, and just distant enough to see their whimsical nature.

I wish I had known him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful entertainment","review":"This is one of the funniest and most entertaining books I have read. I have bought copies for more than a dozen of my friends who visited Ireland or intend to or claim the nationality. Pete McCarthy comes through a lovely man and a clever observer of human behavior with an abundant ability to see the fun in people and to join in their enjoyment himself. I wish I could have met him in a McCarthy's bar somewhere but alas he passed much too young. If you are one of Ireland's potential visitors, this book will speed up your plans. Even if you are not, this book is a great experience; a great laugh. I read a chapter again now and then if I have a sit down day.

Interesting to contrast with Lloyd-Weber's theatrical Requiem, composed at about the same time, and more reminiscent of the Verdi. The other selections on the CD were equally rewarding.

Though I would think that if someone were as silly to state that the holocaust never occured she would be among the first to write to the contrary.

I say myths come in all shades...just because the author regurgitates a bunch of \\"alleged facts\\" doesn't make her factoids truth no more than the other authors she wishes to defame in her book. Basically, it is all a matter of opinion...and it is difficult to trust the facts of a profoundy dishonest ethnic group who has sought to mitigate or reduce to no value at all every other ethnic group that God created, as absolute truth seekers or speakers, especially when they have never been forthcoming and non-biased with regards to historical facts.

It only points out that yes, the people of Africa were influential to much of the world. How can it be explained that Greek philosophers could acknowledge this fact yet this author cannot?

She mentioned that one could say that Kemet is source of all the religious systems...duah...my point is if you are going to set out to crush an argument crush the some of the earliest writing about the topic. She also makes claims about Socrates being black...nobody says that...what we say is the his term \\"Know Thy Self\\" was around thousands of years before he existed.

(My father was sent to boarding school in Italy during the 1930s, and was taught that the Italians had won the 1st world war single-handedly.) Nonetheless, this was a great and illuminating read. My copy made the rounds of many of my friends and family and everyone liked it, including my dad.

This is a track you'll have stuck in your head all day.On the harder side, Ghetto E comes through with tracks like Ball Like Dat (featuring Shoestring and MC Breed), Playa Hatta (featuring Bootleg and Swift D), and Resume Of A Killa (featuring Bootleg, Esham, and Streetlife).The album falters on only a few out-of-place and misguided tracks, but overall, Ghetto Theater is the perfect snack to hold you over until the next Dayton Family album."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly respectful and highly effective","review":"This is a wonderful book about Solution Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT), an approach to helping troubled people which might revolutionize psychotherapy.

Although \\"Zia Summer\\" was a good \\"long-plane-ride\\" book, the other two got extremely involved in Sonny's spiritual side and became increasingly \\"hocus-pocus\\"; they didn't spend enough time developing the now flaky mystery with Sonny and his nemesis, Raven. The problems Sonny got himself into seemed misplaced and didn't move the mystery along very well and the ending, especially in \\"Shaman Winter,\\" seemed too make-believe.

It's not all rainbows and reggae beats. There's a helluva lot more soul, pain, rhythm, and intensity combined with a political consciousness than the majority of fluff that most people have access to. Unfortunately, not many people have heard about Big Island Conspiracy because their unrepentant, searing critique of the effects Christianity, colonization, and oppression is conveyed with humor and musical stylings whose effectiveness I haven't seen since the Clash and Bob Marley. The basic reason they were blacklisted from the radio stations is that it goes against the bubble gum tourist image that the commercial Hawaii doesn't want publicized. That's too bad, cuz the humor and soul expressed in this music is unique, funny, innovative and stirring. Haven't the record labels learned anything about the power of music from punk and rap?

I don't use this for hard stuff like nuts and seeds, just for things like pesto, or grinding up cooked pasta sauces to a finer consistency.It's really too bad, because the style is great (pretty and compact), and the engine works well. But it just isn't terribly helpful to put in a bunch of stewed meat and veggies to whirr, and then find out the button won't work.

I kept wondering what is so great about a man wrecking a train or old women playing cards. It made me wonder if the writer ever had any amazing life experiences to share with people. The stories are so bland and downright stupid at times. The best story he ever wrote was The Piano Tuner and he told my class the publisher forced him to cut half of it if he wanted it published.

Most cheap hats I buy come in large to fit nicely but the Breezer fit me in the medium size.

The car gets a high RPM whine with a noticable increase in low RPM boost. Likely due to the removal of the restrictive bends in the stock intake.A common problem with aftermarket intakes is a Check Engine light (for too much air entering the system as would be the case with a leak in teh stock system) which i have NOT experenced. K&N; has changed the initial design of this intake and chances are they corrected the airflow readings of the mass air sensor keeping them within spec.The lack of 5 stars comes form a VERY tight install.

But, then, any writer who can debunk feminism, evoke pride in America, and express love and support for Israel in prose to make the angels know inadequacy should expect at best indifference and at worst ignorance from our intelligensia.Refiner's Fire may not be Helprin's best, but Babe Ruth only hit 60 once!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"Soldier of the Great War\\"","review":"I've read all of his books now and I think this is the weakest of his novels.

It doesn't have the features of a $... camera, but unless you're planning on taking professional 8X10 photos, this camera will do the job great and quite nicely too. It does have the ability to turn the flash on/off and it does have 2X zooming, which is equivalent to 70mm zoom on a regular camera. It does use a lot batteries but so do all digital camera's, you're best bet is to buy Titatium batteries and they'll last twice as long. One of my favorite features is that I can view the pictures on my TV, using the video in/out cord. It's nice because you can give your family a nice little slide show with the camera through a VCR or TV. Overall, I highly recommend this camera to anyone who is interested in a good digital camera without the fancy features and high prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"The production on this album is best suitable for raw black metal bands, mainly because it helps them enhance an atmosphere. Yes, it is primal and unpolished, but it doesn't work to Final Dawn's advantage. While it doesn't totally eclipse the intruments, it really keeps them from shining beneath a black cloud of mediocrity. Which is the other problem. The guitar playing should be able to carry the weight of a song, but the playing here is just below average. None of the riffs seem to leave an impression. As a result, the songs achieve zero memorability. The monotonous vocals do not help their cause either. There's a degree of technicality in the music, but it feels incoherent and at times unlistenable. If the band worked more in composing songs with perhaps a little catchiness or at least some interesting riffs, then they may be able to stand out more among a sea of unoriginal black/death bands. But as it is now, this record needed some more rehearsing and several shots of adrenaline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great beginner camera","review":"This camera is great for the beginner who is just starting to go Hi-tech.The pros are that the camera is lightweight and compact to carry anywhere. The upload speed from the camera to pc is not that long and the software that you can edit from is pretty useful as well.The cons are simply the camera is not advanced enough to shoot anything that moves. My friend and I sat as still as humanly possible and all we got back was a blurred image of where we think our heads should have been. Also the color is not as good as I had hoped and the lag time between taking pictures seems to be forever. Some instructions in the booklet are a bit vague and took some creative juices to get the camera properly set up.All in all if you are just shooting stuff for an auction site and color clarity isn't important grab this camera.

And his paragraphs are too long. Did he skip language/writing classes? Foucault's terms are seldom defined adequately, if at all, and he is hard to follow.

It is a simple yet touching story of true love in an unlikely setting: the rough dockyard neighbourhood with its drunken barroom brawls and 'ladies of the night'.

In the mousse haired 80's it was the synthetic new wave and Cyndi Lauper sound. The 90's she tried to ride the country linedancing haycart, and now it's blues. Damn, doesn't this woman have a style of her own? Given, her voice isn't bad but it has deteriorated badly after so many years and it not near the several octave soprano of yore.

We owned a small black and decker toaster oven for 8 years and it performed both functions very well. The Europro unit toasts the bottom side more than the top side every time, plus it takes forever to toast and drys out the bread as others have stated. In addition the top and sides of the unit get VERY hot when baking or toasting during normal functionality. You have to be VERY careful about leaving anything next to it when baking or toasting.

Although I've enjoyed many individual songs on prior albums, this album stands next to \\"Very\\" as one of their best \\"total package\\" albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Just Keep on Coming","review":"Neal and Chris have done it again! They never cease to amaze me, no matter how old they get. I am a 17 year-old fan who caught on to the Pet Shop Boys with Discography and the Bilingual. This CD is full of thought-provoking songs and innuendos galore. Every time the Pet Shop Boys sit down to write music, they really put their heart into it, and seem to explore a new subgenre with every new release. This album is characterized by more subdued, techno style writing. Good job to the Boys, my very favorite band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"y2k music","review":"\\"that's right\\"! i know history is supposed to repeat itself,but the PET SHOP BOYS really have the techno-pop down to a catchy lyrical cadence.i'm an afro american and i've never fallen into any special type of music-i like \\"GOOD MUSIC\\",be it jazz,r & b, pop, hip hop (Sorry-i don't consider \\"rap\\" to be MUSIC)classical,european disco...you'll know it's \\"music\\" when you listen to it and you find your toes tapping,or your mood swinging or your fingers snapping or you find the lyrics coming out of your mouth (unintentionally) or the song just \\"playing in your head\\" on some odd occassion!this is what happened to me when i happened by a MEGA MUSIC cd shop & listened to their new album (cd) nightlife!i like every song on the album & especially the symphony of musicians playing in the background!it's a masterpiece folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightlife is Not in the Dark, But a Bright Shining Star!","review":"Absolutely loved this CD. I am a huge PSB's fan and this was truly worth the wait. The first three tracks are fabulous, as well as New York City Boy. I listen to this CD over and over in the car and it really moves me! PSB's rule with their style and sensible and meaningful lyrics, and the beats don't hurt either! Keep up the excellent work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightlife shines","review":"OK, so I've never been big on any albums released by the PSB, but Nightlife impressed me. My roommate bought this one after he saw them tour last year. Highlights on this album are \\"For Your Own Good\\", \\"Closer To Heaven\\", \\"I Don't Know What You Want...\\", \\"Vampires\\", \\"Radiophonic\\"... The album has a few bumps, but all in all it's solid PSB. If \\"Radiophonic\\" becomes released as a single, I can't wait to hear the remixes... I must have played it 20 times in a row."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This has to be one of my favorite PSB albums. The songs are awesome and original.1. For Your Own Good - (5) Very cool song!2. Closer To Heaven - (3) Good song but not one of my favs.3. I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Any More - (5) Another of my favs. Good dance tune.4. Happiness Is An Option -(3) Not so hot5. You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk - (5) Awesome! Great song to listen to after being at a nightclub.6. Vampires - (4) Pretty good but kinda slow7. Radiophonic - (5)The best song on the album (in my opinion)8. The Only One - (5)Slow, sweet and awesome!9. Boy Strange - (4) Pretty cool song took some time for me to like it.10. In Denial - (5) Awesome!11. New York City Boy - (4) Pretty good dance song sorta reminds me of the Village People12. Footsteps - (5) I loveeeee this song! It's slow but the melody is sweet and it grew on me very quickly.Overall buy this album! It's a must have for any PSB fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Worst Album, what happened??","review":"Boy, this stuff sounds so...LIFELESS. What the heck happened? The Pet Shop Boys were one of the best groups around, did they just run out of gas? There was very little to like about this CD. Its better than most pop music but that's not saying very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a mistep","review":"This Cd hasn't caught on with me. The only track I remotely enjoy is New York City Boy. A huge disappointment is the Kylie duet and I am a huge fan of hers. This ranks as one of their worst ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightlife Delivers What You Expect","review":"By now you know if you are a Pet Shop Boys fan, so this disc will do little to push you in another direction. Now what does it offer? Sweet, smart, and danceable music that revolves around a decidedly Pet Shop attitude! It's fun for fans, good dance music, and worth the purchase if you are looking for more Pet Shop Boys or music to play at a low-key rave. It's pretty standard fare for these guys, though more lushly produced than BILINGUAL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The Pet Shop Boys have always been known for good music. Although they've been slipping lately, the release of Nightlife proves they still have what it takes! The album is awesome! It has great variety and even the lyrics are good! The first single, \\"I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Anymore\\" is a definite showstopper, as is \\"For Your Own Good\\", \\"New York City Boy\\", and \\"Closer To Heaven\\". Another interesting track is \\"In Denial\\" which is a duet with Kylie Minogue. The song is so good, and Minogue complements Tennant so perfectly. This is definitely a must-have for any PSB fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet Shops Boys At Their Best","review":"If you have ever been a PSB fan or liked any of their songs you will love this CD. A sure stand out in progressive/dance music for 1999. Surely one of the best PSB CD's ever. This is an example of why Europe is where the fresh and fun sounds come from. PSB have created a multi-layered musical trip into their minds. \\"New York City Boy\\" will have you dancing to the fun carefree sounds of the 70's/80's. This will become a giant gay hit. One bad song is \\"Footsteps\\". Trash attached to the end of the CD. Buy this CD and you will enjoy if for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous","review":"Wow; Once again they have come up with a really solid CD without any filler. I can already feel the beat of the remix's filling the dance floor with this one. The boys are really giving us a look into the soul of PSB. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Nightlife, Sweetie Darling ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This is not nearly as good as the Pet Shop Boys' previous cds. Tracks like Vampires and You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk are horrible. At least they could have been done with a sense of humor, but lyrics such as \\"you're a vampire, I'm a vampire too\\" are done with such seriousness that they become really annoying. Also, the music never really takes off. It just plods along at a relatively slow pace for most songs on the cd. However, the first two songs are good - thus accounting for the two stars given here. I'm sorry if you're one you loves this album. I used to think that the PSBs were brilliant and it's sad to hear what their music has become."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disconnected and Annoying","review":"As a serious PSB fan, I had a hard time with this one. Sure, you've read over a hundred reviews talking about the good tracks and the sucky tracks, blah blah blah. For me, this is the first PSB album that I could not listen to straight through beginning to end. That alone told me volumes about Nightlife. I credit this album for taking it's chances, but its not well sorted.Now albums like Behavior, Very, or even Introspective: They were spot on. Behavior still sounds fresh even 10 years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment!","review":"I am a big PSB fan, but this album just plain doesn't have it. Even the so-called \\"hits\\" are just so-so. Throughout all the tracks, they sounded very much like they were half-heartedly re-visiting their glory days from other albums. I very much hate to say it, but they stunk it up big time this time around, and I am stupified at the number of people who believe this to be their best album ever. It's almost as bad as \\"Behavior,\\" outside of \\"Being Boring.\\" A big thumbs down on this one. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIRED QUEENS LOOKING FOR ONE LAST HURRAH...& GET A FIZZLE.","review":"I am or should I say (was) a Pet Shop Boys fan since the 80s...I have their \\"Discography\\", \\"Please\\", and my favorite CD \\"Actually\\"....My favorite songs of theirs is \\"Being Boring\\", \\"West End Girls\\", and \\"Love Comes Quickly....but the CD \\"Nightlife\\", just shows how much creativity and imagination has been drained from the Pet Shop Boys over the last 15 or 16 years...Their last CD \\"Bilingual\\" though good, not great...showed the signs of slipping- except for the cuts like \\"Before\\" and \\"Discoteca\\", Bilingual slipped into a slow death, as for \\"Nightlife\\" just dies on impact.Cuts like \\"New York City Boy\\" and \\"Happiness Is A Option\\" just fall apart....actually this is their worst yet....Pet Shop Boys... it is time to hang up your synthesizers and call it day....You should of quit while you were ahead.A disappointment...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame - Not the Real PSB","review":"If you like high pitched ... sounding music, this is it. If you like the classic PSB sound, this is not it. I don't like every song on this album reminding me of their sexual persuasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great effort!","review":"The PSB are back with another terrific album. They are grossly underappreciated here in The States, and hopefully this album will give them the recognition and admiration here that they so much deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"silly and sublime","review":"Was lucky to hear these songs for the first time at their fantastic concert before getting the record. There's a gorgeous trance-y sheen over the music here, some totally silly dance songs, some deadly serious. The way \\"For Your Own Good\\" and \\"Closer to Heaven\\" slide together is breathtaking and probably their best album opening ever (and was also how they opened their show!). \\"Happiness is an Option\\", \\"I Don't Know\\", \\"Footsteps\\" and \\"NYC Boy\\" are all instant classics and the rest of it just grows and grows on you as well. In a word, FABULOUS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Very....","review":"When I first played this I didn't think much of it. After treading water creatively on Bilingual I thought that they would never be as sublime as they were on Very. But this is growing on me with each listen. Looks like the party isn't over yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, definetly worth the money..","review":"I do like this recording by the boys. I think that the two are maturing a bit musically and that shows by some of their selections on this CD like \\"Footsteps\\", which I happen to really like. Side 2 drags a bit for me though with \\"Boy Strange\\", \\"In Denial\\" and \\"NYCB\\" which is way too campy for my tastes.But I do recommend this album to anyone who has liked any of their past output. The thing I have always liked about the PS boys is that they have great songwriting skills. I tend to like mostly older progressive/classic rock stuff but the PS boys have talent that puts them into a class of their own. Most techno/dance music I have heard is very repetitive and uninteristing.....but I guess it is unfair to label them as such. To me they are just a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best CD EVER!","review":"This CD harks back to 80s--appropriate since the PSB are a band of that decade--even though they have been releasing albums for 15 years. Their music is not as melancholy as it has been in the past. \\"New York City Boy\\" is the Pet Shop Boys \\"Believe!\\" The opening song, \\"For Your Own Good,\\" is real dance oriented and should be their next single. This song opened their recent concert here and is really indicative of the PSB music. Brilliant yet accessible. \\"Closer to Heaven\\" is classic PSB. The Pet Shop Boys write thoughtful lyrics with highly memorable music. A must for every PSB fan and non-fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK--PSB \\"Over The Hill\\"?","review":"It happens to all pop acts eventually: they run out of nmusical ideas before the record company runs out of promotional ideas.Except for a few tracks, this CD is basically generic filler material. Not quite danceable, not really memorable, and not exactly a first choice listening experience.The \\"Thunderpuss Remix\\" of New York City Boy should have been included in this CD package, and perhaps a few of the filler pieces could have been dropped in favor of other remixes or other PSB songs.This one is for fans only"},{"rating":"2","title":"NIGHTLIFE darkness prevails.","review":"I believe Bahaviour and Very/Relentless to be my fav PSB, Nightlife would be the Pet Shop Boys album I listen to most. This record has a VERY dark undertone to it, which I absolutely love. I can listen to this album over and over and over..... though I gotta say it's ACTUALLY geared toward the Nightlife, great candlelight nighttime music. In 1999 I was in New York for a month visiting family, dropping by the three level Virgin Megastore on Broadway Ave (now closed) and hearing NYC Boy every time we walked in the store sent chills up my spine, I will never forget it's RELEASE for that alone. This would be the Boys most \\"concept\\" record still to date (up to Elysium\\") I still pull this CD out first when in a PSB mood. Nightlife Extra (2 CD deluxe set) has a handful of original B sides that follow the Nightlife feel just the same, with some good mixes on the second 1/2."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST PET SHOP BOYS ALBUM EVER!","review":"Every song is thrilling and a masterpiece of sound!

She has a First Little Golden Book copy of this book that is so worn out from being read that I am desperately trying to replace it for her and that's how I happened across this review form. This story is so much fun to read that the whole family gets involved in reading it together. I think anything that can get a whole family (mom, dad, 10yr old sister, the two year old and even the one year old sister) involved in any activity together, especially something like reading, is great. I enjoyed reading it too when they visited us recently from Japan where they live on an U.S. Airforce base."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pacific NW Step-Mother","review":"When I read the book, it did portray our family dynamics quite accurately. Of course, between the time of the interview and the time the book came out, a lot has changed but the overview of the daily battle is there. When reading the other stories, it was interesting to see how many of the families have the same underlying problems (money, control, privacy) and how each person handles them. I would recommend this book to anyone thinking about entering the step-family way of life or even someone who is there. It is an eye-opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Another Independent Artist?","review":"I had no idea of the surprise that awaited me after buying this CD at one of her shows. I recall hearing Joan perform with just an acoustic guitar and I liked her songs enough to buy her CD. What I didn't expect was the wonderful instrumentation I heard when I put the disc in my stereo. Right from the start Joan had me tapping my toes and singing along with her fun upbeat songs. Her ballads draw you to the lyric because the words are sung from a voice that delivers such a unique emotion. From song to song Joan has a way of touching your heart or breaking it the next. I usually find it risky buying independent records because they're never recorded very well but \\"Two Suitcases\\" surpasses the usual expectations from an Independent artist. The quality and production of this CD is very good. Its obvious Joan enlisted real creative professionals to produce such a wonderful collection of songs. If you like independent artists, this one is A++"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth ninety-two dollars","review":"This movie has two mini movies.

A must buy.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Got It","review":"George Jones proves with THE ROCK why he is still a force to be reckoned with, and why he is one of the greatest country music entertainers, if not the best entertainer, in the world. When you buy a George Jones album, you know what you are going to get. Some good ol traditional country. No need to change his image or his sound, he knows what works and keeps bringing in the good stuff for his fans.There is a duet on this album, with Garth Brooks, called Beer Run, which is clever and the two singers compliment each other really well. There's a good mixture of traditional country ballads and his uptempo honky tonks he is known for. His vocals are still strong, he still has it. This is truly a great album of country music. My favorites include \\"The Rock\\", \\"Around Here\\", \\"I Am\\", \\"Tramp On your Street\\", \\"What I Didn't Do\\", \\"I Got Everything\\", basically the whole album. Not one disapointing moment. Overall a strong effort, George Jones still proves that he is a legend in music today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song 50,000 on the Wall","review":"The recording was a gift for a friend of mine.

George attaches more meaning to a song than any other artist in the business. He can sing just about anything and make it sound as though he is living it or had lived it in the past. George Jones' music will be around for a long time to come. This CD is another example of his greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Bible","review":"This is a beautiful Catholic Bible. I bought one for myself and then another for a gift. The first Bible came damaged along with a small rip in the cover. Amazon sent a replacement which came with no damage.

Only time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good trashcan","review":"This is a great looking and pretty durable trash can. The lid is nicely designed and it closes tightly and stays closed. Easy to open but won't open accidentally. The only negative is that once you lock the pieces together, they don't ever come apart again. Be sure you read the directions carefully because if you put it together wrong, you can't get it apart to fix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best outdoor garbage period!","review":"These are simply great outdoor garbage cans. Easy to put together, rugged and lightweight. The lids lock closed so they are secure and safe from raccoons or cats that might try to get to the garbage. They hold the large lawn and leaf size bags and the bags are locked in place by the lids so they won't fall in from heavy garbage. They are also attractive so you can keep them around your deck or patio and people won't mind they are there. I use them for sorting recycling and to have as a nice outdoor garbage for barbeque's and outdoor get togethers. Be careful though, they can blow away in a heavy wind. I placed bricks in the bottom of each as they did blow away in a heavy storm of 50+ MPH winds. The bricks did the job as during the next storm of 60+ MPH winds they stayed right in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suncast Outdoor Trash can","review":"While the product went together quickly and just like the instructions said, the lid leaves alot to be desired. The mechanism designed to slide/open and lock does not stay attached to the can and instead ends up in your hand.Because there is nowhere to hook or secure a trash bag inside I have decided to make it my recylcle can instead.I would not buy this item again nor would I reccommend it if you are planning on placing regular trash in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suncast Outdoor Trash Hideaway","review":"This is a great item for trash, indoor or outdoor,I use indoors- I have two, one for trash and one for re-cycle.they work great to keep my 2 dogs out of the trash and they look great in my kitchen.I put smaller waste cans with liners inside, this keeps the Suncasts clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst customer service","review":"I needed some help when I put the pieces together. The customer service person was not helpful and kept saying not our responsibility.

It was easy to assemble, looked great (very neutral), and the dogs have never gotten into it. However, it is not water tight. If you always remove the trash, always remeber to remove the bag before it rains, or it you have a covered outdoor space it may work great for you. We kept a bag in all of the time and it was a hassle to move it and dump the water while tring not to dump the trash all over the yard.

We're ultimately junking them for one reason. They have uneven surfaces on the inside, not sharp per se, it's more a lattice of plastic ridges, knob-like projections, etc., which look more to be part of the manufacturing process, but invariably when you try to pull out a trash bag, some can, bottle, etc. catches something sticking out from the inside of the container, and the trash bag tears. I love my dremel, etc., but there just isn't an easy modification (sanding, smoothing, etc.) to obviate this problem. It's just not been worth it, and we're looking for something new.

The rest of the songs are good songs, but they are not performed by the original artists. Most of them sound ..OK, but some of them sound a bit off. It could be because of being trained to the versions the 'real' artists sing(i.e. This Kiss and Breathe are not performed by Faith Hill and you can tell because the voices just are not strong or 'technically improved' I guess you could say).

Sister is happy with book though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old-fashioned or just appalling?","review":"I quite liked this book at the beginning, but I began to get tired of the old-fashioned plot of a young woman in danger who turns to an older, more experienced man who takes care of her completely, down to picking out her clothes. I can understand that plotline in a Regency romance, but surely in 1971 women were more interested in a partnership than a sugar daddy? I was truly appalled, however, when (*SPOILER ALERT*) she realized that he truly did love her when he flipped her over and spanked her for disobeying his orders (and putting her life in danger). Yeah, when he hits you, it means he really loves you...I read another romance by Anne McCaffrey from the 1970s which was much better - The Kilternan Legacy - about a woman picking up the pieces after a nasty divorce. She inherits a property in Ireland and takes her children to check it out. Less suspense, danger, and sex than Ring of Fear, but more fun and romantic. I have also liked many of her fantasy novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"no longer available thank god","review":"I spent hours chasing this book to find it a major disappointment. Charactors shallow. Facts about horsemanship and showing inaccurate. Implausable plot. And isn't this the era where all McCaffrey books have their heroines fall in love with the father figures/gaurdians? Save your money for the Pern series instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ring of Fear","review":"This is quite unlike Anne's other books, especially as it is not science- speculative- or fantasy-fiction. It is relatively simple in plot, but enjoyable all the same. It's nice to read something set on Earth and in modern times to see the difference in styles. Personally, while I do enjoy reading this, I prefer the Pern and the Crystal Singer series, and others in the speculative-fiction style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Thriller","review":"Eighteen years ago, Manny Stevens saw Something...Something that defied all logic.

It's happening.","review":"I'm a high school English teacher who has been struggling with the task of implimenting horror fiction into the cirriculum. It has been hard to find the happy medium between the mastery of King (parents hate him)and the tradition of Lovecraft. On the occasion when I picked up Campbell's collection, I figured he would fall prey to the stereotype of another dry/strange English author. I was horribly wrong. Campbell's fiction is what keeps the horror genre alive. It's qualitative, wickedly penned, and highly imaginative. Up until Campbell, I was spending a great deal of time trying to find the type of horror that I wanted to read. I had even started writing my own stories to satisfy my need to be spooked. Campbell's short fiction is second to none! Try teaching \\"Mackintosh Willy\\" after your class finishes \\"Frankenstein\\". They will think it's like chocolate syrup on their ice cream!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantasmagorically Dangerous","review":"I picked up this book and read \\"In The Bag\\" straight through. In the story a school principle is haunted by a shadowy-faced man and the memory of the accidental death via suffocation of a childhood friend. Though a little trite it's interesting enough to hold your attention, then the ending hits like florid napalm. Suddenly your mind is opened up by a world that is unfixed, unsafe, crawling with horrors, and left to ponder an ending so terrifying, so bizarre, you cannot possibly imagine what bore it.And that's just one story.Like the dark fantastic of Clive Barker or H.P. Lovecraft, Campbell is an author who writes from a dangerous dimension that shimmies between this plane and the next, at anytime plunging normal lives into the fifth circle of Hell and caking them with layer upon layer of seething psychological excrement.This is a Horror writer that should be viewed alongside the greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Music","review":"I saw Blue Rapture this summer while vacationing in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Gleason","review":"The author provides an excellent overview of the development of risk management products and best practices since the early 1980s. The book also covers the latest developments taking place in counterparty risk measurement and the move beyond relying on value-at-risk models only towards 'stress testing'. In the final chapters of the book, the author provides a roadmap for developing an enterprise wide risk management framework and some of the pitfalls that may be encountered in its implementation. The book is clearly written by someone with practical experience of the subject matter and, unlike many other books in the field, explains the issues without reverting to complex mathematics and statistics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - I threw mine away","review":"I came to this one with high expectations, but I ended throwing away the CD.

The performance lacks in authenticity, since the voices are not as intended by Bellini. If authenticity is a priority, the Baltsa-Gruberova recording is the best I have heard. If this historical performance tempts you though (and it is definitely an excellent one), then get it from another company.

I'll probably replace it with a manual frother (looks like Bodum has a pretty nice one).Were it still working, I would give it four stars. Here's why:- The stand it comes with is convenient and sleek, but slightly awkward to use -- you have to put the frother in from the top, and the half-open design means that the tips of the wires scratch the body of the frother if you fumble.- It sometimes turns on in the off position when you apply pressure against the switch, which can be surprising/splatter milk everywhere/etc until you get used to it.- Other than that, it looks good and froths cold milk to triple its volume in less than five seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frother","review":"Does what it is supposed to do.

There was not a lot of information that was helpful. I felt the books touched a little on everything but not enough that I felt I got anything from it.

Everything he did was done well, but he often missed the mark from the perspective of those of us within the industry. Although his numbers were somewhat accurate, and he made some valuable suggestions, it is obvious that this book misses the mark when it comes to being useful within industry circles. In other words: It misses key points of reality. We don't think and act the way he describes.

I could hardly tolerate the taste of this stuff. It is supposed to be fruit punch flavored but the taste was terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes good","review":"I used this entire thing, and I have to say, it tastes solid. I don't have to shotgun it, I can drink it leisurely. I mixed it with Minute Maid fruit punches (tropical guava & regular fruit punch), and mixed in a little water to dilute it so it doesn't taste so much like a syrup or something. As far as results go, it's hard to say. I started working out again after about 6 years, so it's a lot like starting from square one. I believe it to be helping me a bit, but it's hard to say because I've only been at it for about 3 weeks.

For 30 bucks, this sounds okay, but you can see why people are willing to pay upwards of 250 for something that really has the watery swirly character. Fairly uninspiring sound, doesn't immediately force you to play Pink Floyd for half an hour. Maybe on different rigs or at louder volumes this would work for a few songs, but at least for me, I should've saved my money.My main complaint, however, is that the pedal is very noisy. I have a nice VOODOO lab's power supply , and even with that there is a lot of buzz and hum with this pedal as soon as you engage it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed with the sound of this unit.

There was a noticeable volume drop when the effect was engaged, and I also heard some noise in my signal chain when the effect was not engaged. Combined with the (known) cheap construction, that made this pedal a big disappointment.Based on YouTube videos, I'm going to give the Cool Cat Vibe a try... it seems to have a much more realistic Univibe sound (and apparently uses the same optical technology as the original Univibe):Danelectro CV1 Cool Cat Vibe Pedal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicken Salad","review":"The Danelectro Chicken Salad is a nice little pedal.

I have fine hair and my hair frizzes very easily most of the time, but especially when it's humid. I'd think a defrizz product would do the defrizzing like it says.

I have always liked the R+L R-L circuitry they use to get a wider soundstage. its not a goofy digital sounding processed sound, its smooth and warm. a little boomy but you have bass control and that can be balanced and it sounds like a lot more than just 25 watts in a box.I'm using mine with an airport express to wirelessly provide tunes to my children in their nursery. its too much power for them, practically, and I find it outperforms all the ipod-accessory units including the bose.its a nice good solid box with nice good solid sound for the money.and the feature of turning off when there's no input signal is the kind of \\"well, duh!\\" good feature too many product makers forget.

There is a marginal surround effect but it is very limited. The sound reproduction is better than that of the tiny speakers in the 19\\" set, but I do not find the sound particularly crisp. The one advantage it has over the computer speakers is that the volume is controlled through the TV.

What a pleasure to finally read an honest and balanced account of a very misunderstood time from a participant in the struggle. Chesler clearly understands that the most direct route to converting non-believers is to acknowledge that, at times, we all have our flaws and weaknesses. It obviously took a tremendous amount of courage to take an unpopular stand back then and this book really brings that difficult time to life; a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Helpful Book!","review":"I came across a new edition of Dr. Phyllis Chesler's groundbreaking work, Woman's Inhumanity to Woman, the other day. I'd heard of the title but hadn't read it. Thankfully, I have now.The new introduction is spot on in regards to direct aggression among third world women, today! She also points out in the book how female clique mentality is the equivalent to male bullying. In the 2009 Introduction, she demonstrates that it has now shown signs of evolving into outright female bullying with several examples. Disturbing developments, indeed.The discussion of the mother-daughter relationships in the main text has greatly helped me, a son, mediate some of the issues that my sister and mother have been engaged in recently. For these reasons, alone, the book has proven quite insightful.

Unbelievably, it covers almost everything: teenage bullying, murderous female primate behavior, indirect aggression among women, competition between co-wives, why fairy tales are all about Evil Stepmothers and Fairy Godmothers, why so many well-known daughters have had such a hard time with their mothers, why sisterhood in the family and in the workplace may be a myth and why feminist sisterhood was also somewhat doomed. Why? Because women did not want to admit that they could be mean and dangerous to each other. Read this and you'll get a handle on it all. This book will show you what women really want.Woman's Inhumanity to Woman"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Proof","review":"I have just requested that this book be made available on kindle as well. This book is perhaps one of Dr. Chesler's top three books though each always out does the next. I continually return to this book to remind myself of the complexities of the relationship between women. It is an area that few of us which to acknowledge but the power politics are even more fierce because of our expectations that it should be different and that there should NOT be inhumanity against women by other women. The mother daughter relationship often sets this regrettable circumstance yet we must remember that it is set within the frame of patriarchy and thus the inhumanity is a displacement often from that dominant realm. Inhumanity boils down to the terror of vulnerability. Dr. Chesler gets it right. This should be required reading for everyone. I look forward always to her next writings as they are succinct and invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chessler as usual","review":"I had to sit through hours reading this book and I must admit that it was painful.Not painful because I was experiencing the sadness experienced by women who have been subject to abuse by other women, but painful because every step of the way I was painfully aware that chessler writes with the unfortunate lack of understanding of the one thing one should keep in mind when writing about this subject.Chessler sadly is an antifeminist who accepts male paradigms . the goal to keep in mind is the freeing of women from the male \\"mindbindings\\" and to foster true understanding.Chessler is clueless on womens true condition and epistemology."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"There were two related bands, Colossuem and Colosseum II, one started as a blues/rock unit, and the other was a fusion band. In between you had this album.Daughter of Time is where Colosseum's music really began to change. They got a new singer, Chris Farlow, who had been in Atomic Rooster. The music became much heavier--perhaps to sustain Farlow's mammouth voice, and more influenced by classical and chamber jazz than the blues of the first two albums.This album is very good if you like very heavy art rock. It is at times overwhelming just because of the massivness of the sound, but the music is inventive.I like the blusier incarnation of this band, but that is a matter of taste. This is a good album for hard-core progressive rock fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"an old record to hear","review":"I prefer the the \\"Colosseum Live\\" with \\"Lost Angeles\\" and so on.An other record I like is: \\"Those about to die,salute you,morituri te salutant\\":mandarin,debut,beware the ides of march,..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindy is to be commended","review":"Mindy is to be commended for having enough sense to finally leave The Office.

(2) The nature sounds are very well done and very pleasant.Bad things: (1) VERY troublesome to assemble. The supplied screws are a cheap metal and they are screwed into plastic threads. In the most critical support structure (the kickstand) I could not get all of the screws into their holes completely before the screws stripped out. But I did get it together well enough to use. However, I considered returning it to the store during assembly. (2) The vibration feature broke after about 1 month of use. (3) Baby cannot reach the toys, even at 3 months of age, and we have a very tall baby. (4) Toys are very easily removed from their \\"holes\\" so that you can't really move the chair without the toys falling out. (5) The rocker has a very big \\"footprint\\". It takes up about half of the surface area of our four-seat kitchen table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for an older/larger baby!","review":"We just got this for our six month old son as he has really out grown the traditional bouncer. He still naps in the bouncy seat so I hated to lose it. This is perfect. He actually looks small in it and he is a really big guy for his age (around 20lbs & 28 inches)! Lots of room to grow. The vibration is great and all the different songs/sounds are nice. The fact that you can change them manually or even hook up your iPod for more variety is great! He looks VERY comfortable in it and likes the toys it came with. It was a little bit of a pain to put together as the screws seemed to be the wrong size but my husband was able to work around that. The pad removes easily so it should be easy to wash. I think it would be fine for a newborn if you added a head support pillow, which you need to do with a lot of bouncy seats anyway.

It looked roomy and entertaining. However, when we assembled it and put him in there, he was able to yank out the toy bar with one yank. Every time I'd replace it and try to put it in tighter, he could still pull it out, sometimes knocking the toys in his face. Our dog was even able to knock it out by just nudging the bar with her nose. Overall, it just didn't seem safe and didn't hold his attention for long. Plus it's overpriced.

I have contacted Karcher and they keep INSISTING that I buy a replacement hose for $61.00 that definitely WILL NOT fit this washer. I think they changed the setup because the hose for the smaller unit with 1400 PSI would fit, but I asked them if they thought this was a safe procedure and they never answered!!

The ability of this little machine is fantastic but it only lasts for a few uses. The hose kinked so bad that it sprung leaks and we had to replace it within the first week. The machine could not handle being on for more than 20 minutes. Now when you are power washing a deck or a driveway, it takes more than 20 minutes. It blew circuit breakers except for the dedicated line we had for our saws so it is challenged by a regular household line. The on and off switch was not in alignment so we had to jiggle it to just a certain point holding down the trigger and could not let off the trigger or else it would stall. The motor was challenged as well and not up to the tasks it was meant for. After the fourth time using it, the motor went into a surging mode, kind of like waves of power which would, of course, modify the flow of water. Eventually it just would not turn back on.

It does not seal well, and when it does, it eventually springs a leak.The hose: Way too light. The hose seems to be made of dripper lines(?). The hose is far too thin. It kinks. It does not like to be brushed against cement or bricks. It scuffs way too easily making the weak point even worse.The handle: Leaks like a waterhose. They had me order replacement parts. First order was wrong, wouldn't return shipping and handling. 2nd did not fix the problem.The plug: GFI plug rusted and eventually needed replacing. I was able to replace, not with OEM.I'm sure I'll recall other problems I've had with this unit. This machine is a money pit.

For cutting up onions, beef, carrots, etc. this knife really does the job. I find myself reaching for it first, passing over the Henkels knives. The blade is a bit more flexible and the Fibrox handle gives the knife a solid feel even when wet.

Heft and balance are spot-on perfect, and the blade is very thin for a western-style knife. The blade is nice and flexible, and the handle is very comfortable and easy to keep a hold on. Of the 10 Forschner Fibrox knives and 3 Japanese knives I own, this is my go-to knife for cutting large vegetable items such as cabbage and watermelon. Came pretty sharp out of the box, tuned it up with my diamond sharpener. Edge retention is pretty good, although not as good as my VG-10 Tojiro knives. However, Tojiro costs 4-5 times as much as Forschner, and little extra honing on the steel makes up for it just fine. This is a great knife!"},{"rating":"2","title":"professional chef recommends this for everyday use","review":"I had a 10\\" global chef's knife that was stolen from my kitchen a while back, and just couldn't afford another global at the time, so in the mean time I bought, and have been using one of these. It comes pretty sharp from the manufacturer, but I sharpened a bit more with my water stone to meet my standards. It held the edge for about a week and a half (which in a professional kitchen, where its being used quite a bit is a long time). Good steel, although its a bit harder to sharpen then my global (steel is harder), but once you get it to that sweet spot, it'll last for a bit.

That is, the knife they use when they need it to cut well, but be replaceable if damaged, for use in applications like cutting through bone or something. As an amateur cook, I can't justify a massive expenditure on a professional knife, but I really want something SHARP. The Victorinox fills this niche perfectly.

I previous purchased the 8 inch version of this knife, and it continues to serve me well, but the extra leverage granted by the 10 inch knife makes chopping and slicing all the more easy. For my weekly game nights, I often make Buffalo wings, and where I met resistance previously in cleaving the wings in half, this knife slices cleanly through the bones and cartilage. A person closer to 5 feet of height or possessing small hands might want to stick to the 8 inch version, but for me the increase in size is a boon not a hindrance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant knife - if you're looking for sharp, here it is","review":"The knife feels stable and safe due to the best handle I've experienced.Beautiful sharp, clean cut.I'd recommend this knife to anyone who enjoys using high quality tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joy to Use","review":"So pleased with this knife.

I thought the blade would be a lot more flimsy than it is, it's pretty rigid. Holds a good edge as long as you use a steel often. Only thing I don't really like about it is the edges of the blade on top are kind of sharp. I usually hold the handle and pinch the blade for control when cutting and it can be a little uncomfortable compared to my Henckels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price Great Knife!!","review":"I pretty much buy anything that is recommended by Americas Test Kitchen, and this was the knife they said to buy.

This is a CD full of empassioned performances, crisp production values, and the sort of dynamics that we just don't hear much in popular music anymore. The 17 songs included here help to explain not only why rockabilly continues as a cult but why British guitarists as diverse as Jeff Beck and George Harrison were absolutely enthralled with players like Gene Vincent's lead guitarist Cliff Gallup. I've listened to this CD again and again, and always find a new detail to marvel at. Gene Vincent was an exciting singer, and His Blue Caps were one of the very best rock and roll bands of all time.

It will cut wire with insulation still on it but it won't cut bare stranded wire (16awg) very well without jamming between the blades sometimes.UPDATE 23 Dec - I got this tool to rewire a 1985 porsche targa. It has barely made it. I finished the car yesterday and I think this tool is finished too.

While other authors overexert themselves in hopelessly convoluted terms and impenetrable analogies to try to explain the essence of Zen to their readers, Berger lays out its meaning in understandble terms by applying the principles of Zen to something that all of us can relate to--driving. And by not even trying to exlpain Zen at all, he does a masterful job--a true example of wu-wei in action!Oh, and observing the practice in this book would make for roadways with a lot less stress and \\"road rage.\\" These principles behind the wheel then can be easily applied to other apsects of life, thus creating not just more mindful drivers but a more mindful society as a whole.A quick, entertaining and enlightening read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a joy","review":"I concur with an earlier reviewer.

Martin gives a good intellectual appraisal of Mother Meera, and says a lot of the right things, but I think he misses the deeper message. He makes many personal judgements about Mother that reflect an undercurrent of his own agenda and personal disatisfaction despite the attempt he says he made to \\"edit out his anger\\". He also trivializes her development to be largely the result of a manipulative uncle. I guess that is his perogative as an author, but it casts an unfair shadow on this woman's incredible talent and free offering of Love to the world. I left this book feeling subtly manipulated by Martins personal agenda that he has projected on Mother Meera. I would not recommend reading this book, other than the first two chapters or at least not until someone has already had the opportunity to experience being in her presence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor man's Boss OC-2","review":"This is a cheap imitation of the classic Boss OC-2 Octave pedal. It only has one input and one output. It has three pots; the original signal level and two lower octave levels (oct-1 and oct-2). The three can be adjusted to add as much low-end as you (or your amp) can stand. Turning oct-1 up a little, does a fair imitation of a baritone guitar, but if you turn it up beyond halfway it digitally breaks-up, distorts, and becomes randomly inaudable. As musicians say: \\"it does not track\\". Using oct-2 is so low that it's nearly useless, unless you've plugged your guitar into large a Bass amp. For the price, this little pedal is fun to play with, but I would never really use it for performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Contents are standard sockets and standard wrench.

The bits are pretty decent, and I have yet to have a problem, but the downsize bit snapped when trying to loosen a bolt. The ratchet holds up well surprisingly. I used it with an extension bar to get an oiled up sparkplug from my truck. Despite a massive amount of tension on my part, the ratchet did not break. This would be a good set to keep in the garage for quick changes on a mower or compressor. I wouldn't recommend it for serious jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"very weak","review":"The sockets in this set are not heat treated and will break if much force is put on them. i bought this to change my scooter oil and the 10mm socket broke trying to take off the fill bolt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"Had to throw out after hearing it once--really poor sound quality.

They play a good mix of classic Brazilian music (choros, for instance) w/ some more modern tunes by Jobin (co-founder of the Bossa Nova sound). Paulo (lead singer) has a fantastic voice & really knows the music's history, which you hear between songs. Quite a few songs are included on this disc & it's broken up by region. That helps when searching for more of a particular sound (esp. since I don't speak Portuguese). The album was recorded live. I can't tell whether it was one concert or many, but that doesn't matter. Production is good. Banter between songs is good & the group really sounds like they're having fun (always a plus). I only give it four stars instead of five because Paulo's voice isn't as smooth on the disc as it is truly live. But if you've never heard them before you'd probably not notice. A good introduction album that will help you branch out in new directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opener","review":"Although the importance of the work of Karen Horney is sometimes downplayed, this is one of the best books I have read in my life. Far from incomprehensible language and theories that seem much more far from reality that the ones they are supposed to apply to, this book is an easy read for everyone, and I could understand simple mechanisms that therapists take years to reveal.

It was a great series and a collector's dream come through. Roy Thinnes is at his paranoid acting best. It was a real treat to have him do intros and antidotes about each show. Yes.. the props and special effects were pretty cheesy in those days (look at the original Star Trek for comparison) but non of that detracts from the A+ acting, story lines or that wonderfully eerie intro theme (makes a neat ring tone). Overall, a great addition to anyone's Sci-Fi classics collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY YO !!! this video is lame","review":"I did not like this video because most girls here are either asian or filipino. Nothing wrong with that I think but they dont get naked or even offer any tease shots for the camera. The video is mostly dedicated to fast cars and well more fast cars.

There is always the possibility that someone may want to put something in or take something out of the tank, and this cap will make that much less likely to happen. It's an OEM Motorcraft product and well made. It is a screw in cap, not the 1/8 turn. The tether connection was a little different from my old cap, so I simply took the tether off the old cap and put it on the new one. I don't think it could get more perfect.

This one didn't have enough of the scent to give me that relaxing feel of lavender. Overall, it had enough oils (over 6 different oils in there) but none of them were lavender....doesn't that seem wrong for a lavender -named and -colored bath product? I won't be buying again and wish I could return the other 2 ones I bought. I'll probably gift them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what pictured","review":"The photo shows a different product than what is delivered to your home. The water blade is all it was advertised to be.

Even if you've never seen the BBC show, you'll love \\"Brother Cadfael\\". Over an hour of period music from the early twelveth century, that is darkly meditative without ever becoming monotonous. A perfect album for rainy days and candle lit evenings.

But the book isn't as good as the movie. I think the character of Ruth is much more cynical and hateful in the book. There isn't a lot of comedy or lightheartedness. Moreover, the book has somewhat of a \\"dark\\" feel and has some underlying messages in it about revenge. I did not enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent revenge book","review":"This excellent book kept me turning pages until the end. As a guy, I don't think you need to be a woman to enjoy to clever and cruel plotting Ruth uses to get her revenge. Her sweeping retaliation against her husband and his mistress (who are deserving of a little justice), is well written and fun.The only reason I won't recommend this book to everyone is its unrelenting dark side. Nearly all of the characters are unlikable in an interesting way. Even the final ends for the She-Devil are unsettling. She's happy to have achieved her goal, but the reader is left to wonder about her wisdom.If you enjoy dark humor, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant novel of revenge!","review":"This book \\"The Life and Loves of a She-devil\\" by Fay Weldon is about a woman who doesn't look good and she wants to revenge her husband who left her with other woman. She gives up her children, love, and even her own body in order to revenge her husband......This is a wonderful novel that completely reflects to the relationship between wife and husband in today society and the situation of women's lives. After you start to read more and more, it's really hard stop it and keep you turning pages until the end .I do not recommend this book for everyone because this book has a unrelenting dark side and not everybody would like it, but I think this book is good for the woman who has faced hard luck caused by other man or have the same situation as the character of the book does."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rejection of feminine desire and action.","review":"This is a cynical little novel about a woman, left by her husband, who decides \\"I want power.

I thought the more ingredients the better, I was wrong.

I hate to think that I'm paying a little extra for herbs that don't have much scientific backing. However, I haven't seen much info on those things being HARMFUL, so I do like that it is at least coming from a trustworthy source. These are easier to take than the gritty outside of most drugstore multivitamins. Its a capsule so it goes down smoother, the smell is also quite tolerable.

It marked my introduction to erotic literature. The book is written with an utter frankness about an Englishwoman's sexual life in the earliest days of the British incursion into New Zealand.Stella McLeod began as a woman very much of her own era. She hadn't been in New Zealand very long with her husband (an army officer) before she was abducted and adopted by the Maoris. She gives the reader some interesting insights into Maori life and culture, including their sexual practices. For the adolescent reader (which I was at the time I read this book), \\"Oh Wicked Country!\\" was a revelatory experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving story.","review":"Pinky is a black girl who has been passing for white in the north. When she comes home after spending most of her life at school in the north, she is not prepared for the way that the law and other whites treat her. Trained as a nurse, Pinky takes over care of Miss Em, the old white woman her grandmother has long worked for and considers a friend. When her white boyfriend comes from the north, he discovers Pinky's secret but is ready to marry her--if they keep the secret to themselves. Pinky must decide who she is and where she belongs.Although Pinky is played by a white actress, Jeanne Crain, as the dictates of the time it was made would have demanded, this is a moving story. Ethel Waters plays Pinky's grandmother and Ethel Barrymore is Miss Em. The three ladies were nominated for Academy Awards for their roles in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accept who you are...","review":"I love the fact that when she came back home that she didn't hide her heritage. Pinky, who called herself Patricia when 'passing' as white. Came back to her hometown to see her grandmother and a patient, (who is her grandmother's employer) tells her to accept who she is. And that the black side of the town needed medical attention,and schooling young,black women tobecome nurses also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A courageous film","review":"\\"Pinky\\" has been unfavorably compared to \\"Imitation of Life\\" - which results in an unfair conclusion, especially considering the fact that \\"Pinky\\" came out in 1949, eight years earlier. The use of Jeanne Crain, as opposed to a light-skinned black woman (who, by the way, would not have been allowed to do the love scenes with the fiance), has also been criticized. However, I found it to be an excellent film, and I applaud the courage of those involved in its making. At the time it was made, such issues were not discussed, and were rarely challenged. Any review must take those obstacles under consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinky","review":"A friend wanted this movie. Said it is really good so I ordered it as a belated Christmas Present.

But in terms of the movie itself, it's an important one; dated, yes, but worth watching.

With her raw sensual and voluptuous appeal, I can't think of any actress in recent years that could pull off the roles of ingenue to film noir temptress to social drama; as we have here with Pinky. I know social pressure placed a white actress in the leading role but Jeanne Crain was up to the task, earning her an Academy Award nomination. A very powerful performance by all."},{"rating":"1","title":"phony liberal guilt at its most obnoxious","review":"elia kazan directed this liberal race fantasy which today reeks of the type of phoniness that kazan mocked when it came to jews in \\"gentlemans agreement\\". jeanne crain is ridiculous as the black girl who has been passing for white up north, but whose horrible secret comes to the surface when she goes home on a visit to grandma. turgid direction and a stupid script, occasionally saved by the sterling supporting performances of ethel barrymore (as a dying southern grande dame who takes an interest in pinkys future), and ethel waters as pinkys grandmother (and speaking of miss waters, when oh when will we be able to see her stunning performance in \\"member of the wedding\\" on dvd?). \\"pinky\\" is patronizing in a defining use of the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thumbs Down - Hated It!!","review":"I had heard so much about this movie for years that I was willing to pay any price just to see it.

Just as a previous reviewer said, it doesn't take much to lose complete confidence in both the text and the problem sets, so you can't use it reliably either in a classroom or as a self-study guide.Because of this, there is no good reason to spend money on this particular book.

Hilary Swank: wasted; Christopher Nolan: wasted; the gifted Maura Tierney: about four lines altogether; Robin Williams: horribly miscast. He's about as scary as a kid in a halloween costume and looks b-a-d. There are so many holes in this plot you could drive tractor trailers through them. And there's an ongoing bit of nonsense about Pacino being unable to cut off the perpetual daylight leaking in around the edges of the flimsy window shade. As if a place like Alaska wouldn't have decent shades on the windows! Give this one a miss. It's incredibly dreary. Pacino has insomnia but I could barely stay awake, waiting for something to happen. It's all sizzle and no steak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Movie, but....","review":"This is another american remake of the original Danish movie, starring Stellan Skarsgard, which is more interesting than this remake. I always wonder why, when Hollywood does a remake, they change the things that make the movie interesting in the first place. Even though I give this remake 4 stars, mainly because Al Pacino and Robin Williams restrained themselves, and that Hollywood changed the ending. Check out the original. I give the Danish original 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put yourself in a desperate man's shoes.","review":"An ace detective is after a killer, but his incredible sleeplessness (because it's always daytime in far northern Alaska) causes him to make more and more mistakes. Also his righteous indignation towards the quilty is clouded by his own guilt in two other incidents, making him gradually realize that he's not much better than the man he's chasing. All the elements are presented to you at the beginning, but you never know for sure how they're going to get there until they do so. For a movie that lays it cards out on the table so soon this one packs quite a few surprises. You may say, more than once, \\"I didn't know THAT was going to happen\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Sleeper","review":"Honestly I tried watching this move THREE different times and I fell asleep during it which I find quite ironic given the title of the movie.

After I saw 'Memento' I was absolutely astounded with how brilliant and gut-wrenching it was. I went into 'Insomnia' expecting it to be brillant- and it was a normal, boring avergae Hollywood film. I was so upset becuase Christopher Nolan seemed to have so much talent with 'Memento'- but after he got recognized by Hollywood and got the famous actors and the big money the talent seemed to disappear.I wouldn't say 'Insomnia' is a bad film, but defintely not a good film, or at least nothing special. I wouldn't recommend it, but I would defnitely recommend other films from Christopher Nolan- hopefully his next will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I had the opportunity to see a sneak preview of Chrisopher Nolan's Insomnia. Here are my thoughts:Poor Camera Angles: The camera switched angles so constantly that the person sitting next to me turned and said \\"what is this?\\" I almost got a headache. It got a little better as the movie progressed though.Ridiculous Plot Holes: Because this is a remake of a foreign film (which is considered superior to this version), there are several ridiculous plot-holes that make the movie rooted in nonsense almost. A few people left the movie early.Original?: Unlike Memento, Insomnia is extremely by-the-book. There is very little in terms of surprises, it's such standard fare - what's the point? If you've seen the trailer, you've seen most of the movie.Acting: But the actors do a good job with the material... What a waste of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to stay awake","review":"Big fan of both actors... but the directing did not do justice to either of them. AL was perfect for the part, NOT BW - He should not pick up these assassin roles they do not suit him at all.Pace of the movie was t.o.o s.l.o.w... I don't understand the reviews about the landscape shots? OK but this is not a commercial for Alaska, unless we are talking about different action movies?I finished it, because I believed a movie with names like AlP, BW and GC behind the scenes will have a surprise when I least expected it,... And I waited, and waited... ate icecream, then a salad (yes in that order)... But the surprise never came.... Left me perplex... With great regret, I do not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Insomnia starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams is pretty boring for a Christopher Nolan film, this is the second film after the brilliant psychological thriller Memento.

The only reason why I watched it was because of those two famous actor, and I saw that the reviews were decent. I watched up until they both met up on the ferry, after that, I just fell asleep while they were talking. I mean, a girl was murder, BIG FREAKING DEAL! that's almost half the crime movies out there. A couple of other things happen too, I'm not going to spoil it, but it was not interesting at all. The story was lame, and very, very uninteresting. Don't expect much action or thrills, it is just two guys sorta threatening and confusing each other, in other words, talk talk talk... That fact that Al Pacino was insomniac for most of the movie, made me doze off even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin WIlliams rules","review":"great little thriller that does the foreign version justice.

If you are as well, but haven't seen this film, then it's a must. Personally, I feel that Insomnia is the weakest of Nolan's movies, but it is a strong film nonetheless and one of Pacino and William's darkest combined roles.Compared to Memento, Inception, The Prestige, Batman Begins & The Dark Knight, I feel this movie is not as great but still has a lot of suspense, great acting, but a few bad writing/transition spots.Pacino's lack of sleep and how it's portrayed is amazing and you feel like you're experiencing the side effects of a sleep-deprived person alongside Pacino's Dormer character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Long drawn out, the pace is that comparable to a turtle. I imagine it could have been good if they would have picked it up a bit. However Robin Williams needs to stick to comedy. He is not the killer type at all, thus his role is fairly unconvincing!Al Pachino as always mastered the part, to the best of his ability. Hillary Swank was very good, for the first time that I've seen.All and all though it's not a movie to run out and pay a lot for, wait until the rental price drops or it's on cable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insomnia--- A Real Snoozer","review":"Perhaps the most boring movie I've seen this year.

That was much more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do what you think is right & live with it...","review":"That was the advice received by Dormer after being unable to sleep for almost a week. The real reason to his insomnia is a combination of guilt from an 'accident/crime' he committed & his inability to adjust to Nightmute where the sun always shines. How he handles his personal problems at the same time solve a mystery is worth the wait & watch.Here is another film directed by Christopher Nolan. A very straightforward film without the twists or the unchronological sequence of Memento where he was recognized -- but nonetheless as intese.

A younger Pacino previously visited this terrain in \\"Cruising\\" and Williams began to show his darker side as the unbilled 'defrocked' psych in \\"Dead Again\\", as for Ms. Swank? Possibly a better choice that the risky \\"Affair of the Necklace\\" - this might put her back on the 'A' list. Also an odd career choice for the brilliant Christopher Nolan to direct this 'remake'.Despite the cast and budgeted location, this version disappoints somewhat. This version becomes a \\"star\\" turn especially for the male stars. The original is emptier, darker and far more unsettling ...... a dangerous blending of moral choices.Better to stay with fresh material!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher Nolan directs an excellent flick!","review":"Insomnia is one of the best movies to date. It is not your typical murder movie. The scenery is beautiful and from the beginning the movie grabs your attention with its mystery. Al Pacino does a great acting role as he usually does, but this one is tops. He plays a cop from L.A. sent up to Alaska to track down a killer (Robin Williams.) Things start going astray for Pacino as he gets closer to catching Williams. Nolan directs a superb masterpiece that sets him apart from other directors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insomnia is a fun thrill ride!","review":"A slick , cool , thrilling , susprising , shocking , well - acted, great suspense crime film from Memento director Christopher Nolan. The story is about a cop , Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner Detective Eckhart (Martin Donovan) who get sent to Alaska to solve a crime commited by creepy and insane novel writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams). Even with the help of a young Alaska female cop (Hilary Swank) and her partner (Nicky Katt) , this is going to be a hard and an unrestful case to crack for Detective Dormer , hence the title \\"Insomnia\\".

The midnight sun (20-22 hours of daylight) we enjoy during summer months has a more positive effect than portrayed in the film, but I understood the message. I am a HUGE Al Pacino fan and see everything he does so I loved \\"Insomnia\\" just for that reason. Al doesn't do a bad movie, in my opinion. Other actors were very good and it was an interesting twist with Robin Williams as the \\"bad guy\\". I highly recommend this film for the acting, scenery, and plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Williams...????","review":"Insomnia is a very enjoyable, gripping psychological thriller that is brilliant to the plot, but dead to the performances, except for Pacino. Williams however is a little slack in his supposed \\"killer\\" role, but he is definitely no killer. His calmness works out for his role whenver hes in public, but with Pacino, you'd figure he'd be a bit more threatening. Swank is pretty good, however unnecessary, filmmakers needed someone bigger, but she is still a worthy character. Directing is awesome, however nothing like Memento. Leaves the viewer with an eerie, but unnoticeable sense of sleepiness, almost putting him or her in the situation.

I mean, it had Al Pacino and Robin Williams in it, so it had to be great, right? Well, after watching it I was wrong. This movie was totally predictable from the start, and had the same basic plot that I have seen in 40 other movies. I guess that my one star rating might be extreme, but the plot did [was bad]! I guess it might be worth watching just to see Robin Williams in a role that is non-comedic, but as to buying this movie?? I suggest going and renting it for $$$ and buying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"You know a movie is boring when you check your watch, half expecting to be half an hour closer to the end of the movie, and it's really been five minutes. The most enjoyable thing I could see was watching Al Pacino's forehead...you don't even need the DVD for this. Watch him as he talks for long periods of time with wrinkles in his forehead that don't move one bit...watch his eyebrows raised from plastic surgery. Truly amazing. I was expecting much more than an A to B to C to D movie where you can see the ending coming from a mile away.

Seven was very realistic, the ending sadly inevitable.Devil's Advocate is a movie that had a lot of box office success, the price point would have made the collection worthwile just for this one.Insomnia and Heat are both enjoyable and overall I'd have to rate the movies as follows [without giving much away].Acting - ****Scripts - ****Sets - *****Special effects - *****Overal entertainment value - ****Value for money - *****A nicely packaged, if double sided set, that is worth watching more than once.

A wonderfully entertaining thriller from director Christopher Nolan (MEMENTO), who proves he is a truly outstanding filmmaker. Hillary Seitz provides the script; David Julyan composes the score; there's also some really great editing (Dody Dorn) here. Pacino is terrific, although he's much changed since films like THE GODFATHER and SCARFACE; Robin Williams proves he's a master of acting with his first role as a villain; Hilary Swank is great as well, as the cop who returns Pacino's rest. One of the best films of 2002, no doubt about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insomnia Is Great","review":"This movie was really good. Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Maura Tierney, and Jonathan Jackson were great. The scenery was good to see too. Jonathan is hot as usual, but it's too bad that he didn't get much air time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric and gripping.","review":"Christopher Nolan has surprised audiences with the follow-up to his mega-successful film Memento. While not as layered and intricately plotted as his first film, Insomnia stands on it's own as a wonderfully paced murder mystery. The setting for this film is the main star. Alaska has never looked more foreboding, cold, or alien as it does in this picture and the wonderful cinematography only adds to the tension of the piece. Al Pacino, as always, is wonderful as Det. Dormer, a man with a haunted past of mistakes, guilt ridden decision making, and a terrible infirmity: Insomnia. Robin Williams infuses his manical portrayal of a cold, caluculating killer with righteous aplomb: The demon next door. A few particularly weak plot devices fail to ruin the mystery of the film, and the script crackles with sharp dialogue. Highly recommended for mystery fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain for four really good movies","review":"At first, I received the packaging that had two, double-sided DVD's. I had to return them because two of the movies got to a certain chapter in the movie and then stopped, no matter what DVD player or computer I tried to use. Amazon was wonderfully simple to do a return, and I had my replacement in two days. There must have been a manufacturing error with the first one, because the second shipment came as four single-sided DVD's and they all played perfectly. I did not see these movies in the theater, and the heavily censored and edited TV versions are hopeless. It was really great to see these movies as they were originally meant to be seen. At this price, to get four quality movies is a real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best thrillers i've seen","review":"One thing that puts this a notch above other thrillers is the utterly convincing moral struggle of the Pacino character. You can really imagine that if you were in his place you might do the same things--including making the same mistakes. If you like stories where a character tells one little lie and it leads to lots of bigger lies until you no longer seem to have the option of telling the truth, this is for you.Moreover it has spine-tingling suspense, a fascinating setting, and excellent acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pacino and Williams are riveting!","review":"Name a movie that Pacino hasn't delivered a masterful performance? Has he ever disappointed his audience?Christopher Nolan's Insomnia comes after his success with Memento, a film I gave only 3 stars, but received critical acclaim from my peers in the film industry. In Insomnia, the difference is Pacino and Williams. Two academy award winners in two great performances. Robin Williams is as great in dramatic roles as he is in comedy. If fact, he's better! Williams was able to hold his screen presence with Pacino, one of the greatest actors in history. Pacino as only he can, brilliantly immerses himself so deeply in to his role that you only see the character and not Pacino! The movie is a solid R rating due to language and violence. For the mature audience it a must see! Enjoy the twists and turns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait and Rent","review":"It's not a bad movie, but the scenery behind the opening credits is the best part.

I like to focus on whether or not the blu ray/dvd is actually worth it and this one definitely is. It looks and sounds great and it may not be Nolan's best (4th best, in my opinion, next to both Batman films and The Prestige) but the blu ray is packed with great special features and at less-than 10 dollars, it is a must-have for a Nolan fan (or a Pacino fan, as is performance is fantastic)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of suspense...","review":"Insomnia works well with an excellent group of actors. I especially loved Hilary Swank's character; very friendly yet sharp. Al Pacino, of course, makes the movie. He is a skillful actor, but be prepared for profanity. Just like Gene Hackman turned nearly every movie he starred in into a profanity laden trip, so does Pacino. If you don't prefer certain four letter words, don't watch it or keep your finger on the mute button. Other than offensive language, this movie is a must-see. It keeps you guessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't sleep?","review":"This movie will make you want to stay up to see the finish as Robin Williams plays a different and unique role! Pacino is brought in to hunt to an elusive killer (Williams) who local authorities can't pin. The action is suspenseful and Pacino is excellent again! Pacino is joined by a less-than veteran staff of local police trying to hunt down a killer. I enjoyed Robin Williams' role as he tries to work a potential black-mail deal with Pacino as he is suspect in his own partner's questionable death. Pacino is plagued by Internal Affair problems from Los Angeles and Williams wants to exploit this in order to be left alone from Pacino's persistence.This is a great suspenseful movie that I found quite enjoyable as it was great to see Robin Williams in such a different role for a change!

It is hilarious and fun! Woody plays himself basically as a New York-based filmmaker in a low point of his career. When he is signed on to make his comeback film, he goes psychosomatically blind! Mr. Allen (North America's Fellini) creates a bunch of purely enjoyable parallels between the character that he is incarnating, Val Waxman, and himself, Woody! The blind gags alone are enough reason to see this comedic masterpiece.Only complaint: slightly overlong by ten minutes or so...While blending great Hollywood industry humor and Allen's signature physical comedy, Allen makes a sort of r��sum�� of his entire career to date.Allen even provides an unusually sweat back story about his estranged son who is a punk rock star.'Hollywood Ending' is wonderful!The first, real, great film of the year... This comedy has brains!Also, it is packed with Woody Allen's classic self-mocking jokes and one-liners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good film","review":"Unlike some of the more recent Allen films (such as Small Time Crooks), this film was quite good (not that Small Time Crooks or other recent films of Allen's were completely awful, and this is not to say that Hollywood Endings is Allen's best work).

All I can say for it is that it wasn't as excruciatingly awful as Small Time Crooks and Curse of the Jade Scorpion, but it still WASN'T FUNNY. Is there anything sadder than a Woody Allen movie that's neither funny nor intellectually stimulating? I've seen all but three of Woody Allen's movies, but unfortunately that's now three too many. Reviewer David Edelstein's analysis was that Woody is trying hard now to cater to his audience but has no respect for that audience: the result is trash. Can we hope that he'll pull out of this hole? Of course we can hope. But we shouldn't get those hopes up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and funny","review":"I rented and watched this a year or so ago, loved it, bought a copy, and just opened and watched the copy.

But it does not. I underrated Allen (odd for me, I love him), he brings it off perfectly. I did not mind the mismatch agewise of him and his ex-wife at all, I wouldn't have had anyone but him play the part. I found it fascinating, original, inventive, imaginative, witty (though it is NOT as laden with one-liners as these other reviewers claim, it still has a lot of funny remarks), other people besides Allen have jokes, it is well and evenly written and has the perfect Hollywood ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH !!!","review":"As an avid Woody Allen fan the only movie of his that i haven't seen is The Curse of The Jade Scorpion. That movie being excluded this one ranks as his worst movie alongside Anything But Love.A hilarious concept but the movie is just plain lame and stale.Notice that the cast doesn't really include big names. Hollywood's A-List had a good sense to stay clear of this one.Tea Leoni is simply the most annoying actor ever hit the screenand Treat Williams should stay with Everwood!Debra Messing of Will&Grace; fame who had one of her earliest movie appearances in Allen's Celebrity is the best of the bunch though i think she deserves to be in a better Allen movie.This one will leave Allen fans with a sour taste. NOT GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood Ending","review":"Hollywood Ending is a likeable Woody Allen comedy about a director making a movie with the involvement of his ex-wife and her new fianc��.Woody plays his usual character- insecure and self-absorbed. He is a failing filmmaker whose movies are bombing the US. His ex-wife had left him for the studio exec who is financing the picture he's now making. The stress of it all leads to psychosomatic blindness in Allen, who without anyone's knowledge of his condition, attempts to make a film while sightless.Perhaps the greatest drawback to HE is the casting. Although I love Tea Leoni, she's really far too young to play sixty-ish Allen's ex. In the best of his films, Allen populates them with strong actors and characters that give them depth and complexity. The cast here is simply not as strong as in his other films and it suffers somewhat for it.And while this isn't any near his Hannah or Manhattan standard, it's still an enjoyable and fulfilling \\"middle\\" Woody Allen film."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOODY ALLEN vs.HOLLYWOOD","review":"Woody Allen's latest film is vs. Hollywood,The Audience,The American Mit,TheIndustry...Absurd?But isn't that our reality itself?..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a fan despite this film","review":"I have been enjoying Woody's films since I was about 14. This is the only film I can say falls a tad short of engaging in his extensive career as (arguably) the only living comic genius writer/director today. If you are a fan, take a look, you will still find one or two moments of hilarity. If its your first, start anywhere but here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still looking for an ending","review":"Though this movie had a classic Woody Allen appeal, with all the verbal jaunts and crazy circles of comedy, I think Woody Allen may be coming to the end of his movie making career.Despite decent performances from the cast, Woody plays the role of a dirtector (go figure) who loses his sight, and directs the movie blind with the help of three freinds who really know nothing about film.Woody's portrayl of a blind person may be exaggerated to the nth degree, but I think it was appropriate of a person who desperatley needs his sight back, and is lost without his most important sense.The ending of the movie is horrid, which may be why the movie's title is so. It is too perfect, too fast. That, or they just ran out of time and threw something together, and then added the title.Wait for the video. In fact, wiat until you can download it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful movie!","review":"The stammering neurotic Woody is well past his prime in this awful dud of a movie.

Both the \\"left-eye\\" and \\"right-eye\\" images are the same up to that point.Since the film goes from 2D to 3D between shots, this is probably an issue with how the left and right video tracks were prepped for 3D encoding, since my player registers a true 3D video track from the start.

It was short, boring and expensive. The 3D was non-existent for the first 3 minutes and everyone kept taking off their glasses and playing with its power button thinking something was wrong with their set, and much of the entire film was of home-movie quality.

The 3D didn't live up to its expectation, i.e., lacking in oomph! Watchable, fairly educational. Guess i expected a lot more from the blu ray: by being on the space station, i expected to see out from there and what the need for being out there is all about. The space walk is good,shots of half earth could have been better (like full earth), nothing of the moon in any of its phases, nothing of the stars or other planets. A lot of concentration of the people and a bit of their training. 3D is meant to be experienced and entertained (in that order), not waiting expectantly only to be disheartened.Not very impressive to own at the 3D price. 2D will suffice."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good movie","review":"This movie has some great 3d galaxy shots.

I think at this early stage of 3D content, the pickins are quite slim, so anything shot in 3D is being marketed. If this were not in 3D it would have no audience whatsoever.If you are a NASA geek, I'm sure you'll like this. But really that's the only audience that will appreciate this rather boring procedural.I gave it one star not because it it's horrible, or that the filmmakers did a bad job, it's to bring down the rating a bit, as it seems artificially inflated for what it is. People with a 3D system looking for some 3D \\"WOW\\" will be really disappointed with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Space Between","review":"This video is interesting and some of the footage is quite nice but, it is severly lacking as a 3D experience.

I've seen them in Santa Barbara and LA a few times... awesome. Santa Barbara said they could never come back because of the volumn. Apparently they were pushing the dB limit at the soundcheck. It was epic. LA was cool too, but not as homey as the SB Bowl was.

I do not have my disc in front of me now, so I am unsure if the last 2 pieces are on one track or two. The final portion of the disc is an extremely annoying joke followed by a stripped down acousticish sounding song.

On this release, the singer whines & moans more than ever, which should please most TOOL fans. This is a band for unhappy, twisted-people who like to feel empathy from other outcasts. If you don't like to ENJOY misery, stay away from TOOL! The lead-singer(\\"Maynard\\") has a very \\"angry-femme\\" voice and takes himself VERY-SERIOUSLY; by far the least-talented member of the band. The drummer really IS the band, and you can hear his talent; it is just too bad he didn't use it in a band that wasn't made for isolated-freaks. The Led Zeppelin cover(\\"No Quarter\\") is a DISCRACE to a beautiful piece-of-music, and anyone who thinks it is even close to the magnificent-original is...well..A WEIRDO TOOL FAN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Bother","review":"Nice to see that Tool is just as boring live as they are in the studio; if not more so! the carefully created, studio concocted atmosphere of dark depression that is the most appealing aspect of Tool's albums disappears in the live arena, leaving only a boring collection of two chord riffs and awful guitar solo's drenched in feedback and effects to mask their ineffectiveness. Oh Maynard... \\"think for yourself\\" huh? Hehehehehe! Yeah studio outtakes, wonderful. Another awful release from one of histories worst bands. Oh and their drummer is still one of the most amazing drummers around; pity he's in this band! Go listen to Rush, Maynard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Salival","review":"Insanely addictive.

So I looked no further than Amazon. I browsed the small group of sellers offering the set and found only one selling it new: \\"hugediscount\\". First of all, they didn't ship it until the 13th day after I ordered it(even though I payed for 'expedited shipping'), and second, the set was NOT NEW. It was pathetically re-sealed in shrink wrap. There was wear INSIDE the plastic sleeve. My bassett hound, Bina, has done exponentially better shrink wrap jobs than that. So a heads-up to other Tool fans: don't buy from 'hugediscount'--it will be a 'hugeripoff'.As far as Salival goes, its awesome. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme more","review":"The audio CDs great, offering live stuff, cover versions and various things. Its a real must have for any Tool Fan. The DVD however, is a bit of a let down. It has 5 videos which are all pretty good but thats all. No live stuff, no interviews, no band info, nothing. Now I know that the band like to keep a fairly low profile and therefore a certain mystique, but there's not even a photo of them. Also, this is a really awkward DVD to navigate through. I mean how hard is it to create a sensible menu for 5 videos? There was clearly more importance attributed to making it all look good (which it does) than work well. Oh and if you want to play it on a PS2, dont bother. You can only get to 4 of the videos and they play in black & white.

Although Lohan, Keaton, etc. all have great delivery of lines, this is nothing more than a kiddie movie. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone even in the pre-teen age-range because I didn't find this movie one bit funny. It only implies that you need to use violence and cheating to solve situation (for example: Herbie flying over other cars to win the race, or Herbie beating up the antagonist).If you have small kids that want to see this movie, it would be wise to warn them that it may be a bit scary - there's a monster truck ralley scene where Herbie is shown being beaten up, and even I was a little freaked out by that.The majority of music in the film is good.

I understand that it's a Disney movie and are supposed to be aimed for kids and families, but the jokes and acting were played a little too seriously.I feel bad for Matt Damon. He does a sensational job in Crash. I mean he really came out of his shell, but in this he just played this \\"bad guy\\" rival champion racer that was just to farfetched. I found myself saying, \\"Oh, gimmie a break!\\" in my head throughout the film.Lindsay Lohan is quite the attractive girl in this, which is the only reason I didn't give it a 1. She was very good in Mean Girls, but she had to go back to her Disney roots, which she seems to be getting a little too old for.Good movie for kids and families, but if you hate Disney, cheesy humor...Stay Away!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT totally innocent...","review":"I'm a parent of small children and I was kind of shocked with this \\"G\\" rated movie. Lindsay Lohan says \\"OH MY G..\\" about 5 times in a 5 minute segment. She says it close to 10 times in the total movie. For me, that is an offensive phrase and not one that I want my kids to hear and repeat. Also, when the guy is trying to sneak a peek at Lohan undressing in the backseat of Herbie, and when they \\"accidently\\" fall on each other in Herbie's backseat.Don't get me wrong...There are far worse things that a movie could have, but should this be rated G? I don't think so.This is beside the fact that the movie is completely dumb and predictable. One reviewer here said:\\"Herbie Fully Loaded doesn't fall pray to the typical family movie cliche\\". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? This is totally clich��. I mean, are we surprised that Maggie wins the final race? Duh.Lohan has ruined yet another Disney classic.

Though parts of the movie give an adult the need to suspend their willing disbelief, it is a good story.I went into it with average expectations and it beat them. I had almost as much fun watching the kids in the theater as I did the movie.It is an updated version of the orginal Herbie with more modern jokes, but it isn't a remake as many of this summer's movies are. It is refreshing.Matt Damon hams up his role as the villain, but most Disney villains were charmingly clueless in the live action films of the 70's.The romantic leads were fun to watch from an adult perspective as it brought back my awkward years around college.I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fun movie!","review":"My daughter begged and begged for this movie and I gave it to her for Christmas.

It was a good decision to cast Lindsey (Lohan) as Maggie, as she is a huge teen idol, she attracts alot of the younger viewers, and casting Micheal Keating also attracts some older viewers.I believe it was a fantastic remake of the originals and i very much enjoyed it, hope it goes well.annonomous"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this for?","review":"Basically a \\"best of\\" from three albums Hunter did for Chrysalis, I really don't understand what purpose this CD serves.

Both are vital recordings for anybody who wants to get to the essence of Ian Hunter.

Avoid.","review":"The Burke brothers have turned in what amounts to less of a book and more of a college thesis paper and one that deserves a bad grade. I can't believe anyone could take the rich subject of Saturday Morning pop culture and cartoons and make it all so boring. In fact Timothy Burke is credited as the author of another book with the title \\"Lifebuoy Men, Lux Women: Commodification, Consumption and Cleanliness in Modern Zimbabwe.\\" Yikes! From the author of the above comes a delightful book on cartoons? The information is inaccurate in some cases and the attempts at humor are sad.

These cartoons weren't very good, but they were ours(...)!Most of the target audience doesn't relate to the entire period examined in this book, so I find the development of Saturday morning fare useful. There are lots of insightful comments from some of the original producers, although the tone alternates from studious to wickedly sarcastic.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"No research, just snarky stream of consciousness","review":"It's difficult to understand what this book is supposed to be. As a reference, there is no organization or comprehensiveness. As an analysis, there are no connections made between any of the points raised. There is no research to speak of -- just about any fan of these sorts of shows knows this superficial trivia and will be familiar with the simple program descriptions. But most disappointing is that the book fails miserably as a celebration of its topic because the authors seem to hate it, systematically crapping on each TV show they mention.Thus it provides no value as a reference, no insight, no revelations, and no affection. This book is not worth the price I paid for it as a library second. I recycled it the weekend after it arrived in the mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"no photos! no photos! no photos!","review":"For a book which is to remind us all of our innocent days of eating Cap'n Crunch in front of the TV set on Saturday morning for hours, this thing is lousy. The text is an easy enough read, intelligent with some valid points. But the photographs (the very few in here) are awful. Didn't the authors and the publisher understand that this type of book demands nostalgic images from the past to help the book along? What were they thinking?--obviously not of book sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good memories and a great perspective","review":"The Burke brothers at last give a perspective of Saturday morning cartoons that is not wholly academic and is not wholly negative. They spend some time going into detail about how activist and advocacy groups affected the content that we saw on Saturday mornings in the 60s and 70s, but temper this information with what they saw as important to them personally. The greatest part of this book is the end sections where they reminisce about specific cartoons, adding to my own memories of great times..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite knife!","review":"The best knife i have!

This one heated, but it took 30 minutes and no steam came out. Also, the facial piece was broken. So I'm now in the the dilemma of deciding whether to spend yet another $15 to replace THIS one. If the 3rd one doesn't work, then I'm out $30 -- so far. This is not worth it.

First, I didn't buy the idea of a wife openly flirting with a 15-year-old without her husband having a clue. Is he an idiot, blind, or so trusting that he is incapable of seeing what's in front of him? And what about the wife? Where was the chemistry between her and the boy? I didnt 'see it. And the trip to Dsneyworld (which other reviewers describe in great detail below, so I won't) was absurd. Why would the wife or the 15-year-old, who are both feeling quite guilty, go to Disneyworld at the insistence of the husband, especially when the discomfort between the three is so thick you could cut it with a knife? I don't think the writer/director of this film did a good job of constructing a believable story. The actors were good, but capable of salvaging this silly story only to a limited degree. Not at all recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland, insipid, pointless and pretentious","review":"This flick naivishly glorifies infidelity and portrays a skewed, contemptible version of human relationships in a bland, insipid fashion. It redundantly mulls over a menage a trois, a concept that has been done to death by every genre of alt cinema around the globe, in an incredibly heartless and dispassionate manner.It also fails to capture the subtle impacts of human emotions of the male characters, but prods along in an absolutely insensitive manner. The movie merely concentrates on the feminine perspective and doesnt detail the impact of the wife's infidelity on her husband's emotional psyche either. It could even be termed utterly dishonest, purely due to the injustice it does to the poor, innocent husband's character.This is one of the few movies, where I liked absolutely nothing. I even found something worthwhile in the sexually deviant Cronenberg's flick - Crash - but this one utterly a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"This is one of the worst films I ever saw.

I find her music calming. It taps into the 'peace that passes human understanding.' It instantly connects me the Source of All That Is. While Christian in its roots, it is spiritual in the deepest and most universal and positive sense. I particularly like Chant (very centering), Christe Eleison (the heart of Christ's message) and I Wish for Peace (the essence of God's pure Spirit and my deep longing for the world). The beauty and radiance of Spirit shines through Michelle Tumes on this CD. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be at one with God through Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michelle Tumes - Center of My Universe","review":"Very relaxing album.

Is it possible to save a woman from rape, rape her yourself, seek to hide what you've done and to make ammends, and in the end still be something like a decent person? Maybe. Do good people do bad things? Yes. Is not a certain willingness to forgive weakness necessary between humans? Certainly.Rohmer captures the feeling Kleist's story beautifully. He is careful to show the strengths of the women, they aren't passive and dominated within a patriarchal society--important in a film wherein the leading man commits rape, and the leading woman eventually forgives him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull film by Rohmer","review":"This Franco-German coproduction is the weakest of Rohmer's historical movies (a group of films that includes such accomplished works as The Lady and the Duke, Perceval, and Triple Agent), perhaps because its subject matter seems hopelessly dated. Based on a novel by Heinrich von Kleist and set during the Napoleonic wars, it tells the tale of a young marquise rescued during an assault to her estate by a mysterious count (a young Bruno Ganz). Unfortunately, from that brief encounter the marquise gets pregnant, a huge problem during that time and on account of her position in society. Aside from a dated central conflict, the film is also dull and static, without the redeeming dialogue and interaction between the actors that one sees in other Rohmer films. The director, by the way, plays an amusing cameo as a French general."},{"rating":"2","title":"killer moves","review":"this movie rocks, not just skiing but also have the squirl suit skydiving.

I found the pilates section very challenging, interesting, and well, it just feels darn good to do. The movements are slow so you can really concentrate on tightening and working your abs through each exercise. I like that you stretch your body with each exercise, that feels great. There also isn't much repetition, so it never gets boring. It is motivating that the two women in the video both have fantastic abs. Now on to the yoga part....maybe I'm just not cut out for yoga, but I found it incredibly boring watching a dude in a speedo and ponytail talk about \\"softening your inner organs\\" and \\"feel the power of mother earth\\".

I have several of her other yoga DVDs (prenatal yoga being my first and favorite), but this is my least favorite by far. It takes place at a yoga connference, and (I should have known) it is taught as if you were a yoga instructor looking for pointers for your own class. It's just not at all relaxing, and a bit difficult to follow at times. Most importantly, it goes way too slow! She has us doing the same exact motion over and over for about 5-10 minutes while she explains some yoga concept and it's just plain boring! I wish I hadn't bought this as I don't plan on using it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A excellent collection of materials","review":"Sernett's volume is the single-best collection of primary materials related to the African-American religious experinece.

On the back of the CD jacket, in colored writing that partially blends in with the background color, in text so small that neither my wife nor I could read it without a magnifying glass, positioned at the very bottom on the back where you would normally only find manufacturing and copyright information, is the message:\\"New Stereo Recordings\\".The next CD in this series, 1971, has the same problem but a different disclaimer (again, printed in the same obscure manner as this one) that is worded a little more honestly. It says,\\"This album contains tracks that may be re-recorded by the original artist. Featured groups may not include all the original members\\".Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Explanation!","review":"This book is an excellent explanation for any who are searching for answers to the origin of mankind and how we came to be on earth.

There is little control, from a CD point of view, of focussing in on content the way one might with a cassette player. Further, the English parallels that appear in the companion book are missing. Without the book the usefulness of this CD is limited. In fact, DON'T buy this one by itself. The lack of reference to English meanings will make you crazy. The characterization in the dialogs is very spotty quality. The organization is not very good. If you have the book it will work as a complement, however limited. In the price range, with the book to put things in perspective, it is still a reasonable deal if one needs something right now. Better advice: wait for the 2006 version which one sincerely hopes will overcome the problems with this edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy german film","review":"I first saw this film as a kid on late night TV.

It is based on length of the trail to determine the easy, moderate or difficult. This book would would tell you that climbing a 200' rope straight up is considered easy due to the length. This book put us on a very dangerous trail which it called a moderate- there again based only on length of the trail.

Julie Harris is his wife, who knows his secret but refuses to give up the hope that their second son will come home one day from the war.Over the period of a day, illusions will be shattered, truths exposed, and tragedy will occur.Each of the supporting players creates a character that extends to the listener, drawing them into the Keller family.Those who enjoy this play should hunt out the vhs version with Whitemore/Learned/Quinn/Allen made in 1987.It is another excellent example of a powerful play."},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting family tragedy","review":"The autor's idea was pretty good and he knows how to show lifestyle in those hard years after second World War. While reading this book you can really identify with that time and also the people in this play. They are all different from each other and everyone has his own opinion and view of life. Especially Joe is an interesting character 'cause he's so phony (e.g. play police with the children, takes advantage of other people, for example Ann's father). But also the mother is a very important character allthough she's not noticed so much in the play. In general the book isn't really captivating because the scenes are all similar and until the end they more and more boring.

This is a stylistic form that pleases us very much and that's also why we enjoyed reading this novel. The tension increases more and more from the beginning to the end. The plot is very clear and comprehensible, and that's why this book is quite easy to understand. Through the whole novel there is a red line.

We found her voice grating, the camera follows Corne rather than narrowing in on positions and flow. How any of these followers managed to meditate with the endless ramblings of Corn is beyond our patience. Try Kundalini with Ana Brett for excellent music, active Yoga, breathing techniques, wondrous meditation......"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it","review":"This is a taped vinyasa taught to other students in a hotel, Seane walks around with a mic...no music and barks at people to tell them whether pose is good or not. I was surprised...not what I expected"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd prefer to give it 10 stars!!","review":"Seane at her best!! Live, relational and as genuine as can be. I have followed Seane's teaching and growth as a teacher and spiritual leader for years now. She 'walks the talk' and is what yoga is all about. Authenticity and compassion. Untrapped by her celebrity - she uses her platform to make a difference in the world by taking yoga \\"Off the Mat and Into the World\\". A truly gifted and extremely intelligent spirit. This DVD make for wonderful home practice. Integrates the beauty of the vinyasa practice with a wonderful sense of spirituality.A must have! Out of 5 stars - I give it 10!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit moaning about their change in style","review":"Anathema has changed a bit, but fortunately it was in the right direction. This album is much better than anything they ever made before. I even think it's better than Judgement. But maybe I'm just not into the music they made before this album. I also didn't like Katatonia before \\"Discouraged ones\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A depressing but brilliant opus!","review":"Anathema have fashioned a surprisingly original and melancholy sound. Anguished crooning, cheesy but beautiful guitar crescendos, Melodic bass, and atmospheric, lush keyboards. Vince Cavanagh has a surprisingly orignial, if not, strong voice. I recommend this album for anyone who shares similar musical tastes to me. Which I'll leave up to your imagination. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"Not enough detail in description. Small and plastic. It really would break easy if used for any type of heavy movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"In order to shoot you have to pull this trigger allll the way back and it is not smooth. i recomend the stock trigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belongs in everyones collection.","review":"I can only say that I wish he was still with us. An incredible musician who great soloists would join to back up like Linda Ronstat. His voice makes me think that, as eclectic as my music tastes are, if I had to only listen to one artist, I would pick Hoyt. He was multidemensional a great writer, great singer, great guitar player, very good actor and,a very nice man. Give a listen, you will thank me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Knife","review":"Outstanding knife in every way. I am more than happy with it. Buy it before it is replaced with another issue; or goes up in price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Excellent product. Very sharp right out of box. Good balance for vegetables, fruit and meat.Buying 2nd at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutelty Great Value","review":"This knife is perfect for slicing meats. I'm a BBQ fanatic and I haven't found a better tool for briskets. The Victorinox brand has a long history of using good quality steel, so I expect to have this knife around for a LONG time. For the price, you really can't go wrong.One small suggestion...if you're looking at this for slicing bread, get a serrated edge version. What works with meat does not work on bread and vice versa."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good title...","review":"This appropriately titled collection features a mix of UFO from the years after the mighty Michael Schenker left the band. Although at the time most people just bemoaned the fact that Schenker was gone, the post-Mike UFO actually rocked--his replacement, Paul Chapman, is a damn excellent guitarist and the albums they put out from 1980-1983 with Chapman (\\"No Place To Run\\", \\"The Wild, The Willing & The Innocent\\", \\"Mechanix\\" and \\"Making Contact\\", the weakest of the four) were all pretty much memorable records with great songs but some filler. As such, this would be an awesome mix of the better tracks from the Chapman years, were it not for one thing: the tracks from UFO's 1986 album \\"Misdemeanor\\", which is a horrendous, keyboard-laced waste of time. Nonetheless, for the cheap price this is a good buy as an introduction to the criminally ignored 1980-1983 UFO years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rated 6 Stars","review":"This is an incredible book, in my opinion head and shoulders above other popular African hunter books. J.A. Hunter was born in Scotland and moved to Africa when he became an adult. ... He subsequently became a professional hunter and guide, and later an animal control officer. He details a Masai lion hunt he took part in - rare stuff - and lion hunting with dogs. Many dangerous episodes are also related about rhino, elephant, and water buffalo. The book is a modestly written, eye witness account. This is a classic, and I'm glad to see it back in print, as it was originally published in 1952."},{"rating":"2","title":"hold on to this one","review":"If you like reading about hunting in old Africa, but still of a fairly modern time, this is a great read. I wish I could find my first edition copy as I see it is now worth quite a bit more. One of those loans that never came back and I can't remember who I loaned it to. I consider this a must have in any hunters library. You are reading about a past era, so don't think this is any sort of how-to book. Just a timeless portrait of a man and his fascinating life. I am so glad it was re-published. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you should have been born last century!","review":"I bought this book for my husband, who as you can guess feels he was born too late; this is the era for him.He has checked ballistics and other references from the narrative. He has read many passages aloud for me to experience with him and did nothing for the few days it took him to devour the whole.It has our reccommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gorgeous, but...","review":"The grandparents bought this durable but expensive trike when our son was 2. Sure it rides and pushes smoothly, is sturdy and can tolerate the elements, BUT there's something drastically wrong with the sizing- especially the distance from the seat to the pedals. He has found it very hard to ride (or even be pushed in) until recently and he's nearly 4. A small child must be able to sit snugly back in the seat and easily reach and push the pedals or he will lose interest-- and confidence-- fast. A friend bought the same trike and concurred there was just something wrong about how her daughter fits on it, though she has no trouble riding the more compact tricycles at school with no assistance. Maybe the manufacturer's mistake is in recommending it for toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"So worth the price!!","review":"I did a TON of research on tricycles before my son's 2nd birthday. After researching and looking at several Radio Flyer and Kettler models, we finally decided on the Jumbo for our son. We like the s-frame, which makes it easier for him to get on and off the seat. It's very easy to adjust and we LOVE the pushbar feature. We're both tall parents, and the handle length is great. My only complaint is that it can be difficult to push in a straight line. The handles lock, but not in a perfect line, so it tends to go to the left or right. I imagine this would happen with any bike, so I'm not that upset about it. I talked to several parents who bought a Radio Flyer, only to turn around and buy a Kettler within a six months. We decided to save the money by benefiting by their experience. We were fortunate to find the trike at a local toystore for the same price and they assembled it for free! Kettler is awesome and I expect this bike to last a really long time. Plus, our son loves it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Farewell Ferengistan","review":"This CD does nothing for me.The attraction that BDG has for me is its pulsating rhythm which uplifts you and carries you with it as it plays upon the tension of the melody the percussion and the chorus. \\"Last Train to Lhasa, BigMen Cry, The Magical sounds of Banco De Gaia\\" is the encompassing musical experience for those who like the pulsating almost primitive sounds that \\"Banco\\" delivers.The strength of Toby Marks is in his background as a drummer.
