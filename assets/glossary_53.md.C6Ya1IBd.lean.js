The sound may be a result of poor production or more probably the Stones just aren't that good. The Rolling Stones may be the most overrated band of all time. I used to be a fan, but after seeing this I lot much respect for them. As a guitar player myself I was disappointed at how sloppy and simplistic the musicianship was. SO many more talented bands out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical Issues","review":"The disc played in my Samsung Blu Ray player with great difficulty. At 11:19 it kept locking up, so I had to skip those chapters in order to see the concert. The menu caused my player, a Samsung with all the latest firmware upgrades, to lock up. Chapter selection was unavailable as were the extras. Why did they even ship this knowing full well it would not function with Blu Ray players- see other reviews about this as well. I am not the only one having problems with the bluray version."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T PLAY ON SONY BLU RAY PLAYERS","review":"I was really looking forward to watching this Stones concert on Blu Ray only to be disappointed when I found it wouldn't play on my Sony Blu Ray Player. I purchased two copies of this blu ray disc and rented it three times. None of the copies of purchased or rented worked on my Sony Blu Ray player. What gives? Anyone else have this problem? I'll have to take the word of the other reviewers because I still haven't been able to watch it. I'll just have to rent the regular, sub-par DVD version. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch \\"Gimme Shelter\\" instead","review":"The sound quality here is unacceptable. The picture looked great. But the concert was very predictible. And the performances were not very inspiring. I watched Gimme Shelter the day before watching this and it was much more exciting. To shoot Shine a Light, they had the lights turned up really high and lots of security at The Beacon.But at Altamont, it was dark and crazy and there didn't seem to be any security. People were all over the stage, at one point a dog walks across in front of Mick. At Altamont, the band was sounding great. Anything could happen at Altamont.It's nice that nobody was killed during the filming of Shine a Light. But all the IMAX cameras in the world couldn't make this performance fun to watch. And like I said, the sound quality on the Blu-Ray disk was really bad. They could have at least put high-quality sound on the disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blueray problems","review":"I have had two copies of this shipped to me, neither would play on my Sony Blueray player, too bad I like the movie in the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Get No Satisfaction","review":"Don't buy this for the Music...The music is just BadDon't buy this for the Performance...The performance is LameDon't buy this for the Production...

It's just another concert dvd at best. The vocals are too loud, so you dont hear the music very well. Jagger is dancing around so much, his vocals fall out of tune; Jack Whites does as well. No in depth look into \\"The Rolling Stones,\\" like you see on \\"The Last Waltz,\\" just some music, old footage.

I would like to hear from anyone who has solved the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and a lot more than just a concert movie!","review":"Great concert footage and sound along with very funny vintage footage and gag inserts. One of the best concert films I have ever seen. All my friends who have borrowed it love it. Highly recommended, especially if you have a big screen and good sound system."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK.....But.....","review":"One thing which has been (surprisingly) overlooked in the many reviews here is the fact that Mick was obviously in poor vocal shape at the time of the filming. He can't hit the high notes or hold a note, particularly in the earlier part of the concert. He has to resort to half talking/half singing and sounds somewhat like a rather poor Mick Jagger imitator.One plus of this is that you can actually make out the words to the lyrics when he's in this mode.Later in the concert he loosens up a bit vocally, but never reaches the 'normal' Mick sound.Keith gets a couple of vocals and has never sounded better, IMHO. His usually reedy, thin voice has some uumph this time out.I've got the Bridges to Bablyon DVD and IMAX and I would rate this one 3rd after IMAX and Bridges.I'll update this after I receive the Four Flicks and Biggest Bang DVD's"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stones Rock!","review":"Excellent documentary about a Stones concert show.

It does not provide loops for straps and the cover/carrier it comes with has already broken. But the guitar itself is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Morning Nightmare","review":"Looks nice but a total piece of junk. I have played guitar for 20 years and wanted to give my 9-year old daughter a good guitar to learn on. She has had one for 2 years that we picked up at a flea market for 15 dollars and I wanted to give her a little better quality guitar now. Let's just say, she is still playing the guitar from the flea market. This guitar can not be tuned or used for playing. Strings just buzz and the pins that hold the string in place just fly out of the back if you tighten them. Nothing worse than telling your 9-year old that you have to replace her gift because it sucks! Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems like a good product","review":"I bought this guitar for my daughter for her 8th birthday. So far, it seems to be holding up well. She likes it and it seems like the quality is fairly good for the price. I am not an expert on guitars by any means, but I would recommend this guitar as a good product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"yup","review":"This product serves its purpose and is of good quality. However, the picture fails to justify the color of the product. Atleast there are no hearts or kittens on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to buy a musical instrument online I suppose...","review":"The nut was too low on the guitar causing nothing but BUZZ, BUZZ, BUZZ. This was a Christmas present for my eight-year-old daughter, and I was disappointed for her even though she tried to act like she liked it. The company who makes this thing should do better quality control. Anybody would have known this particular one was no good. In the twelve years I've been ordering things from Amazon this is my first disappointment. I had good luck with a ukulele I ordered through Amazon but will probably not order instruments online again. By the way, I went to a local music store two days after Christmas and we picked out a great-sounding starter guitar that she loves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all Pink","review":"My 6 year old had been asking for her first guitar for a year, and it just HAD to be pink. You'd think \\"Pink Burst\\" would be pink, but it was absolutely NOT. The guitar was practically red around the edges, fading to salmony orange through the center of the body. Yuck! It was nothing at all like the online picture, nor any other online photos of \\"pink burst\\" guitars I could find. Luckily Sam Ash was happy to take it back and replace it in time for my daughter's birthday, and we got a true \\"bright pink\\" guitar. So, I give Sam Ash 5 stars, but this \\"pink burst\\" colored guitar is a zero - pink is everything to a six year old girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Guide to Paris","review":"After having enjoyed Michelin guides for years, I believe that this is a better buy. It contains much (if not all) of the same information in a layout that is easier to use and in a typeface that is easier to read. It takes you through sights, attractions, restaurants, and bars in a logical street by street manner. Saves lots of time in planning. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!","review":"Purchased this book and started reading and could not put it down. Very good and coloquial narrative style.

So I just thought I should let others know incase they make the same mistake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Story","review":"First of I have to say I went on a whim to order this movie, I went purely off of the trailer. After I watched the trailer I just had to order this anime. I'm happy to say I was not disappointed! It is truly a beautiful anime, both visually and in story. I absolutely love how they tied in the importance of family and how our actions can affect the ones we love. If you are looking for something heart-warming and that you can watch with the whole family, I highly recommend Summer Wars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Wars: Quick Review","review":"A stunningly gorgeous film with some of the most brilliant animation to date; using its fancy visuals to bring to life the wonderful love story of a family who sticks together, which brings forth the best of humanity. Trolls beware; you're about to meet your match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to see and enjoy","review":"I just bought this DVD last night and I've already watched it twice. I'm glad to say that this is something I would definitely be watching again. The plot was so good it kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved how it revolved around being a part of a family and how everyone came together, in more ways than one. The music score fit and was quite entertaining. I would definitely recommend this movie to families young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Anti-American, So Calm Down People","review":"For the people who say this movie is \\"anti-American\\" because our government is the bad guy, thank you for worrying me over nothing! I had already purchased this product when I read one review about the movie having an anti-America theme, and it made me regret buying it. This movie is in no way offensive. If anything, we're hardly mentioned at all, and it even says that the military did not know it would have these results and became out of their control. So, don't believe what those people say. It's perfectly fine. It's a bit corny in some parts towards the end, but the animation is FANTASTIC and it's an enjoyable movie. The main character is quite adorable, and I would definitely recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic!","review":"So intense when watching this movie. Made me laugh,cry, mad, whatever emotion there is. I love this movie, this movie could makes me speechless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly colourful and imaginative","review":"For those following Mamoru Hosoda, this film is another great work from the man, and for those who have only seen this work of his, search him in Amazon. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Anime Movie; Just Like Digimon","review":"This movie is the equivalent to the Digimon Movie; just with a bit less action and more of a focus on story & drama/emotions. I still have an attachment to Digmon the Movie, but this has just as much re-watch value; never getting tired of the awesome dialogue & art style! I'd recommend this to anyone; especially younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anime lovers","review":"We are huge fans of Hayao Miyazaki and because of Him we are now big big big fans of Anime and Manga. Love all the details in the movie, the way the live, eat and love. It makes you feel you are part of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange","review":"This film was far more interesting than I thought it would be. I was expecting a bland, straightforward, predictable summer romance. Instead, it was a blend of family, technology, cyberspace, history, and virtual reality. Good story, not completely believable, not completely unbelievable. The world of OZ was rather fascinating. I almost wished I had an avatar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very accessible and enjoyable.","review":"You don't need to be an anime geek to enjoy this.

People sharing information and doing friends and translating languages in real time. A brilliant movie, that I risk to say it's one of the best movies I ever seen so far!No movie caused me so much excitement like Summer Wars. Unfortunately (or not), there is no series or another movie. It's just perfect like it is!I couldn't expected a better movie =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine Magic","review":"This is one of those special films that really shows the focus on emotional storytelling. This film is one of those rare films that actually made me cry when I watched it. It is that well executed. And not just emotionally. The visuals and animation - for both the real world and digital world - are stunning and the characters are all well developed and likable. All in all, this movie hits almost all the right high notes in all the right times. A definate recommendation for any anime fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vibrant and entertaining","review":"Summer Wars is a richly colored film that delves into themes of family, responsibility, and perseverance. For extras the features include interviews with the Japanese voice actors, TV spots, and trailers for other Funimation titles.I found the yellow subtitles difficult to read in some places, particularly in the Oz segments (up against a white background), but the English dub will get the job done for non-speakers. The story is straightforward which is a strength and downfall because there leaves little reason to re-watch it story-wise (the richly colored Oz will entice the visual dilettante for another viewing). I only wish they developed the Kenji/ Natsuki relationship more. It is an entertaining film, extras and the story will leave a little to be desired for some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"Adler offers few fresh insights in this sequel to \\"Understanding Human Nature\\" as it mostly repeats his concepts of inferiority feelings and social feeling. In fact, one of the later chapters lifts sections of the first book word for word. Moreover, Adler veers into prejudice in his ardent promotion of social cooperation by suggesting single people or those without children are failing to meet their obligations to contribute to society. He also misattributes homosexuality to attachment issues. His first book is a classic - among the best I've ever read on psychology. This one is better left in the 1930s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Sorry. Furtwangler was a great conductor but as a composer all he could do was spin Wagner/Bruckner. There are a few interesting ideas but the work is just way too long to be worth while. If you have to have a copy of this thing try the Barenboim with the CSO. Its better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty basic.","review":"But, if you are exploring Blues music, and have little money, this CD might be a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"G-8","review":"Ok so a lot of people dislike filler arcs. But in my opinion this is not just the best filler arc in one piece but in all of the animes i've seen and believe me i've seen a lot of animes. This arc is right after skypiea and the strawhats are trapped in a marine base. The strawhats struggle to escape the base. This arc has a good story unlike other filler arcs. I highly recommend this arc because who knows maybe we will never get another great filler arc like this ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"a filler arc.......","review":"I am interested in how funimation dubs episodes 196-206 that are rumored to be included with this set. Even if episodes 207 and 208 are not included with this set, I still plan on preordering this dvd, although I am not a particular fan of filler arcs.

Instead, it's primarily a map of Newport News and surrounding areas. And the part that is of Williamsburg isn't even comprehensive - it cuts off the outlet-mall/Pottery area and the I-64/199 intersection, and there's no close-up of the Colonial Williamsburg attractions. Unless you need street-level detail for the residential areas of W'burg, you're better off with the free map they hand out in the historic area - it's not to scale, but everything is clearly marked and it covers the entire W'burg/James City County area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Nevil Shute","review":"Two novels/novellas published post-humously from the earliest writing period of Nevil Shute.

I had met a guy from Oakland when I was in the service and he told me that if you own a good stereo, it was nothin if you didn't have the tower playing on it. I had never heard of TOP prior to that conversation, so I went out and bought this one. Man, what a ton of bricks this album/CD is! Unique for it's time and timeless to this day. Hard punching big sound and what a voice Lenny Williams had back then especially on this one and Urban Renewal. I think they had the tightest, machine-like horn section on the planet with arrangements that took them to the moon. I went through a complete phase of TOP fanatisism, and special ordered Bump City, East Bay Grease and all their albums which were hard to find at the time. I saw them live back in the seventies while Williams was still with them and will never forget the experience. If you like funky jazz with fast, tight, searing horns - this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say. A true classic!","review":"It was back in the late 80's that I found this album on vinyl at a thrift store. I was about 18, and played sax in the stage band in H.S. Anyway, being an Oakland A's fan, the cover featuring the Bay Bridge interested me, and so I bought it!I was completely blown away by this album, and I think it still might be my favorite Tower album. My favorite tracks are: \\"Don't Change Horses\\", \\"Just when we start makin' it, \\"Man from the Past\\", and \\"Below us, all the city lights\\". Not as gritty as some of the other albums, but a great one in my opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tower of Power gets better with age","review":"Being of the same era as TOP, or at least the original members,and having heard them live several times in the last few years,I cannot understand why most anyone wouldn't agree, when theylisten to the tunes on this CD, that Tower of Power was (and is)a one-of-a-kind group that has a high degree of staying power. The tracks are still fresh almost 30 years later. Funky horn licks are the mainstay backed by a solid rhythm section. TOP is the best there is at their genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masters of Funk","review":"I purchased this because I'm avid admirer of the drumming of David Garibaldi. Had the original release on vinyl. Just a personal opinion but to me Squib Cakes is the funkiest drumming ever recorded! Even today as they tour, TOP still has it! Funky then, funky today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice gift...","review":"I purchased this as a gift to one of my friends baby and I'm happy with the toy and the price I bought it for. I have one for my daughter (1 yr old) myself and she likes it a lot. Its a nice gift idea to keep with even when there is no need for it immediately. I kept couple of them for the same purpose... you never know when a friend drops in and you have nothing to give their kids :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I must say, brilliant!","review":"Diana, Georgia's sweetheart, has brought forth a single that is stunning. Although she was not my first choice of that slot beside Fantasia, her music on this single can make your heart sing along with her. I was disappointed with her full album, because I had such high hopes with this album out. But, I still listen to this single almost every day.1. Dreams- 8/10 A good song to start with. It does not overwhelm you, yet it doesn't leave a peice missing.2. Don't Cry Out Loud- 10/10 I love this song. Powerful vocals and powerful lyrics create an outstanding song. A favorite song from the third American Idol season.3. I Believe- 7/10 Not a great song choice, but Diana copes with it well.Total: 9/10If her album wasn't for you, but you like her voice, I suggest this single. A pop powerhouse is a great addition to a music collection, and Diana has 3 great songs waiting to be added."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful cd!","review":"Diana has done it again, first on AI now on her cd.

Diana"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Offense","review":"Diana is talented, and there is no denying that - but come on! This single sucks, to be perfectly blunt. DREAMS is a drab, mediocre song that has a lot of \\"schlock\\" factor. DON'T CRY OUT LOUD is ridiculous, and her version of I BELIEVE really is a pale comparison to that of Fantasia. Also, Diana definitley needs to stop the screaming - there is a lot to be said for a subtle singer. Diana deserves better material, and needs more time to perfect her craft. Until then, don't buy this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Yet","review":"Diana has the potential to be a very good singer but is not quite ready yet. She tries to pull up emotions that are just not there, after a few years of life-experience she may be able to pull it off.

She should have waited until after she's had some vocal training."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad choice of songs","review":"i think she chose a bad choice of songs her voice really needs vocal training and i feel like her record label should have done that before putting out her cd. i donot feel like this is a good cd to buy if youre are looking for a good listening cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK......","review":"I think it was respectable start but I wasn't blown away.

They should think of Madonna's and Whitney's first releases which were fun, upbeat and youthful and will represent her age and maturity better.She has a powerhouse voice and as she matures she will learn to sing with more softness and less yelling when she hits her high notes.I look forward to her album as I am sure they will narrow her song selections to better reflect her unique and powerful voice.I wish Diana alot of determination to get them to help her do it right so she doesnt become another Justin."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's better","review":"Diana was one of my favorite contestants, but this CD, which seems to have been rushed, is a bit disappointing. Diana still shows she can sing (and that she's infinitely better than the overrated, non-singer \\"Donald Duck on helium\\"), but her songs have no feelings and the range, especially of \\"Dreams\\" and \\"I Belive,\\" not appropriate for her voice (there's no rule that says that a song has to be sung a certain key: it should be adjusted to the singer's voice).If you want to hear how \\"Don't Cry Out Loud\\" should be sung, look for (Shanghai International Song Festival 2004 winner and Search for a Star Philippines 2003 winner) Rachel Ann Go's CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best single yet!!!","review":"It is a well deserved 5 stars.

I was expecting much more from this single, and I reluctantly admit I'm very disappointed. It wasn't near my expectations, based on her performances on the show. There just wasn't the connection anymore, and I found the songs a bit flat. Wondering if she rushed to get a single out when more time should have been taken producing and arranging these songs. She should know them well enough by now to sing them better. :( Hopefully she'll work harder on a full CD, and it will be worth purchasing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE","review":"Are you guys not listening to her cd she hollers most of the time and she cant keep on tune. On her song dont cry out loud she shouldnt have because she couldnt carry a tune. Diana is the type of singer that can hit the high notes but cant carry a low tune. This was a waste of my money and I wish I could return it but I cant. Dont waste your money buy another cd instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the words of Simon, \\"So what?\\"","review":"She has a pretty voice, is a spunky girl, and souds older than 17. What's missing? Originality. I've heard this before. She's no Kelly Clarkson who has a wonderful quality to her voice and has a voice that fits with everything from Rock to R&B. Unfortunately Diana isn't given great material to work with here either. Her version of I believe is nothing in comparison to Barrino's and Dreams is just corny. I think this CD shows why FANTASTIC FANTASIA won."},{"rating":"1","title":"diana deGARBAGE!!!","review":"Give me a break! I think she got some nerve singing Fantasia's song!! It's conniving! She's just a sore loser and is still competing with Fantasia or trying to!! This girl is BORING to listen to. She may have a beautiful voice(this I agree) but she does not have the passion that should accompany this kind of music! She's just loud! Thank goodness I didn't buy it. I heard it playing in Walmart today and I walked right over to Fantasia's section! I'd rather listen to someone who sings from her heart than someone who is contrived like she is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good CD","review":"Diana is good, but has work to do. She can carry a high tune, but can't get too low. I think in a couple of years she will have more ability to sing a wider range. I saw her on Ryan Seacrest and The View and it sounded like she was screaming. I don't think her single is a good buy. The songs are OK, but not worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"DeGarmo shows why she didn't win","review":"DeGarmo's bland, often shouting, singing voice is enough to put the average listener to sleep when she sings of nothing but sappy love songs on this 3-track single. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singing through her nose?","review":"I have listened to her through-out her stint on American Idol and could never figure out how she made it to the final 2? I again tried to listen to the 3 songs offered here and just can't take her voice. She sounds like she has a very bad cold. Does anyone else hear this too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"diana deGARBAGE","review":"this is pure garbage.....the competition is stiff out there...the last thing anyone needs to listen is a frigid voice with high notes! I'd rather listen to someone who sings from her heart like FANTASIA....Diana started this comparison the minute she put out an album with the same songs as Fantasia!!! It just shows that she thinks she's better and I think that is what Fantasia fans are upset about. She should have chosen different songs for her album...be unique!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not good enough","review":"I bought Diana's and Fantasia's single. I do like Diana's better, but that is not saying much. I give it 1 star, because it is not worth much. Sorry, was hoping to really like it, but didn't at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana DeGarmo is the real deal!","review":"Diana DeGarmo proves in her debut single that she is the real deal. She never ceased to amaze on the AI show and she proved why in this single.Dreams- the title track to the single is a big song and Diana does it justice. It just fits her voice so beautifully and it's amazing. I've heard her sing this live and believe me it's incredible.Don't Cry Out Loud- while I have a somewhat emotional attachment to the version Diana sang on the show, I've really grown to love this track. Diana does the song justice, keeps her voice tender and really portrays the meaning of the song.I Believe- is the hidden gem on this single IMO. She does an amazing keychange that could only be done by someone with the power and range this young lady has.Overall, a very impressive debut by a rising star! I look forward to her next release with great anticipation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a True Talent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think she is such a bright light and i LOVED the cd from the first note to the last. Everyone is being hard on Dont Cry outloud but only cuz it is diff than they are used to but its okay to be diff and i love the way it changed. I think Diana has true talent and she will go far and be around for a long long long time and i dont care what anyone says, all the rude comments people make show how heartless people really are. This is a girl who is very talented and i say if its not your style of music than dont but it but you dont have to trash what she does becuz you dont like it. Personally i LOVED the cd and i cant wait for the album so i will tell anyone who loves Diana to def. buy the cd!!!! To all those who want to bash her.....GROW UP!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Really Grown Up","review":"I started noticing Diana in the finals and have watched her in the bottom 3 a few times. And each time she was safe, she did her 'cheery' dance that (to me) was unprofessional. BUT. In the last final weeks of AI, I've noticed her being more quiet and professional. I really want to give her a stand-up applause to a girl at a relatively young age who was willing to change. And I'm sure she was told to do so.Keep doing what you're doing Diana. I can see you go far in this world!In the rendition of \\"Don't Cry Out Loud\\" is a personal thing for me because I grew up with Melissa Manchester singing it and it quickly became my personal favorite. When Diana sings it, I have become a favorite on her part as well.As well as Fantasia, I can see Diana go all the way on this one. And to think, she still has years for her voice to become more deeper and richer. I would LOVE to hear this young girl sing in 5 years from now. I can only imagine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for \\"Dreams\\" by Diana DeGarmo","review":"I rooted for Fantasia from beginning to end of American Idol, but I must admit Diana made a few good performances. However, most of them, such as \\"Don't Cry Out Loud\\" sound like she is simply screaming the lyrics as loud as she can to make it appear that she has a powerful voice; she sounds like Roseanne Barr singing the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" at times. Her CD is no better than her live performances. Her voice is very nasal and annoying and she doesn't really deserve to have a CD. Her version of \\"I Believe\\" doesn't hold a candle to Fantasia's version. And the other 2 songs don't make up for it. I am not a hard-core Fantasia fan, and I'm not a hard-core Diana fan either. I am just giving my honest opinion so people will realize before they purchase this CD that it isn't very good. I give it 2 stars for sheer effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"It bored me","review":"First she should never try and touch I Believe again. Her rendition is without feeling and sounds like the people singing on karaoke tracks. I think I feel asleep half way into it or rather blocked it from my mind. Either way Diana is no Fantasia, or for that matter, Latoya or Jennifer either."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it 0 stars if it were an option","review":"With a little time and training Diana's voice might mature and develop a nice sound, but as of now Tiffany Evans has a more mature sound than Diana!Save your money and buy Kelly Clarkson's new album, you'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't \\"Cry\\" Out Loud! Don't!","review":"Not that I don't like Diana DeGarmo...well, maybe. There's something about the quality of her voice that I can't stand.Not that Diana DeGarmo is too young...well, a little bit. I think she's trying too hard.Not that Diana DeGarmo can't sing...well, just OK. I don't these are the best song choice for her.Dream - I didn't she capture the feelings and it was a bit pitchy.Don't Cry Out Loud - It was kind of flat.I Believe - She just didn't catch the soul of the song.Overall, she sang these three very different song with the same technic - and it was not very a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark","review":"Diana's CD was mediocre and was simply void of anything that could set her apart. Diana Degarmo has potential but currently lacks both the life and musical experience to make it in the industry today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"I was expecting a bit more. I don't want to rain on anyones parade who thinks this girl is the cats meow but I do want to warn the average consumer. You really need to pass on this CD. I have already given mine to someone else. She's just not ready to record and I think they know it. The one song I wanted to hear her sing was Don't cry Out Loud and it is pretty bad. They don't even include that power note at the very end. I never realized her vocals have a very stuffed up nasal sound like she has a cold. It's just not my cup of tea. I'd like to suggest buying Fantasias CD. The difference in sound, style, and vocal maturity is evident. Fantasia is just so much better. AI definitely got it right this year and after listening to DD's quick little CD I'd say she is a very lucky young lady to have gotten as far as she did."},{"rating":"1","title":"diana!!!","review":"this is an extremely lucky girl: how she made it to the final two I have no idea. she is so boring to listen to! she sounds so fake singing....i can't feel her at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd will make you cry out loud","review":"because it is so boring, she really doesnt know how to sing with emotion I feel like she quite wasnt ready for a cd.she may can hit the high notes but so what?? she cant sing all her songs in high notes or she will drive you crazy. i just feel like she isnt ready maybe in a few years she'll be"},{"rating":"1","title":"Screaming her face off","review":"All she does is scream her face off in this cdDo not waste your money on this dreadful first outingIt sounds like she is dragging you thru a funeral marchWho wants to listen to such dreary, drab, dull musicMusic should be entertaining not painstaking"},{"rating":"2","title":"DeGarmo is a rising Celine Dion!!","review":"The Vocals are absolutely incredible. Diana DeGarmo has such a pure, powerful voice that has the ability to be soft and sultry when neccessary. She is a strong vocalist with a long career ahead of her. Buy Her Single!! You will LOVE it. Don't Cry Out Loud is beautiful and relaxing, Dreams is strong and inspirational, and I Believe is stunning!! The Best Version. You Will not be dissapointed, I am looking forward to seeing Miss DeGarmo grow as a vocalist to become a strong, talented individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter LOVES her","review":"My kids think Diana's CD is great! We like her version of I Believe AND Dreams. She reminds me of a younger LeAnn Rimes. Only one thing that I didn't like all that well..was that I like Diana singing I Believe on A.I. just a little bit better. But it's still very good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A BREATH OF FRESH AIR","review":"THIS YOUNG LADY IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR HER VOCALS ARE TREMENDOUS, YOU BE THE JUDGE, BUY IT, YOU WILL SEE {HEAR} WHAT IM SAYING. GOD BLESS"},{"rating":"2","title":"5/5 for Dreams","review":"You know how when you get a 10 song album and you only get like 2 good songs? This 3 song single has 3 good songs on it! Diana brings them to life like no one else can. Dreams will make you believe in your dreams, but you have to hear it for that to work. Dont cry out loud is very very impressive because it puts the original to shame with a new sound. And I believe is also good. I've done better with this single than I have on some of my albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana Degarmo--A WoRK iN PrOGrEsS","review":"If you want to buy a CD that is \\"feel good\\" music, I wouldn't recommend Diana's Single. It's somewhat unenthusiastic. It doesn't excite me or make me feel or think about anything. It's just O.....K... I am both a Fantasia and a Diana fan, but something about Fantasia's singing from the depths of her soul is just amazing and Diana is good too but---A Work In Progress. I would give her about five or six years to mature vocally and performance wise but even still, what Fantasia has, she was born with and Diana doesn't do it for me........maybe one day though, I'll be optimistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's Good, But Not The Best","review":"I'm not going to be unkind regarding Diana DeGarmo, as some customers felt it was necessary to be to Fantasia, choosing to make an issue of her personal struggle and be judgemental. Diana DeGarmo is a talented girl with a great personality and graciousness that transcends her age. This is only a respectable single, however, and I would be interested in seeing how she handles different material."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE NEEDS WORK!!!!","review":"I think Diana has talent, but she needs work. All the producers had to do with Fantasia is give her the microphone. I don't think that Diana is ready for the mainstream.....she would do very well on the Disney Channel or Nickelodeon. The children would love her.....like Miss Nancy on Romper Room. Not everyone in this town swallowed when we were force-fed Ms. Degarmo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to say about it.","review":"I listened to the cd and was not impressed at all. It was like simon said a so what performance. I think with a little bit more practice Diana could be a really good singer. I would not say I wasted my money, but I know what to expect next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"I was a little disappointed to be honest. I loved Diana on American Idol, but there's something missing here. Don't Cry Out Loud isn't good. Dreams is okay, and I like I Believe the best. I also didn't like Clay's or Kelly's singles at first, and look at them now.This is her first single and it shows there is much room for her to grow as an artist. However, even though this probably isn't her at her best, look at how she is selling here at Amazon. Fantasia's at 5 and she's at 9.Bottom line-I'm not giving up on her yet. I think she's got much more to show us in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased reviews","review":"All of the 1 star reviews listed here are obviously biased, and written by people who never liked Diana to begin with. What are you even buying her CD for? Just to turn around and write a terrible review of it? You make no sense -- try doing something constructive with your life. She's a very talented singer. I'd like to see you do what she can do at the age of 16."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is alright but...","review":"I think the only song I enjoyed on it is \\"Don't cry out lod\\". The others I did not like at all. She pales in comparison to Fantasia Barrino, on the previous songs, and does not have me singing along with her which is abad thing to me, because when I really enjoy an artist and thier music I always sing along. This one by DD is not making me feel that way ..so I wouldn't buy it again. Waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"la la la la............la la la la","review":"Elmo's world!

It's pathetic how she even came in second place. That was Latoya London's spot.

I just sat through and listened to each song on this sorry album. by the way it's appropriately entitled dreams because this girl needs lots of training. i think you all are just hating on fantasia and that's where these 5 star ratings are coming from. her rendition of i believe is pure garbage. she is just loud but loudness is not what it takes. she sucks. i listened to dreams and i wanted to puke. I couldn't take it. don't cry out loud was ok and that's why she get one star from me. even so, i thought she was lame and doesn't stand out from any other singers out there. she just blends in. she sucks man. people please be sincere. by the way, no comparison to fantasia: the nerve to try and sing the idol queen's song.

I look forward to hearing more about you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible! *****5 stars!","review":"She has outdone herself! \\"Dreams\\" \\"I Believe\\" & \\"Don't Cry Out Loud\\" are indeed unignorable.

What happened??? \\"Dreams\\" was, as judge Randy Jackson would say, aiight. But, \\"Don't Cry Out Loud\\" -- what happened??? This is not the way she sang it on the show -- the one that blew everybody away -- the best performance of that night's competition! Again, what happened??? \\"I Believe\\" is the best song on the CD, although I missed the \\"Love Keeps Lifting Me Higher\\" part. I am disappointed in this young lady's first effort, based on her vocal performances on the show. We know she can do better. Hopefully she'll get a chance. As Paula would say, \\"Oh well, we still love you.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A STAR IS BORN!!!!!!!!!","review":"I was so immensely moved by these three tracks.

I know she has a wonderful future ahead of her. Well done Diana and much success to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give the young lady a break.","review":"Maybe Diana didn't deserve to be in the top 2. I don't believe Fantasia belonged there either. But that's not saying that these two women don't deserve a recording contract, they do. Personally, and it is a matter of opinion, I like Diana's version of \\"I believe\\" much better! I have one complaint about her version, they have edited it. It's not as long as the version sung by Fantasia. Macy Gray comes to mind when I hear Fantasia. Despite what Simon thinks, I don't care for the Macy Gray sound. Fantasia is a great personality, but the voice, not my choice. Although I feel Diana sounds better, let's face it, both \\"Dreams\\" and \\"I believe\\" are very cheesy. I mean please, stop writing songs for the idol contestants that sound like an Olympics soundtrack. We are better then this and so are they."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Believe....","review":"...that this single is some of the best music I've heard lately. After cringing from radio stations full of artists who are hardly musical, Diana's single is an amazing display of vocal talent. I wouldn't dare buy Fantasia's single, but Diana's is definitely worth my (and your!) money."},{"rating":"2","title":"How old is this girl?","review":"If I wasn't an avid American Idol fan, I'd think she was older than she is. Diana's version of I Believe is amazing; it brought tears to my eyes when I listened to it the first couple of times. And just for the lurking Fantasia fans that seem to think they can post rude comments whenever, the two of them have very different styles and are both very talented. There shouldn't be a competition between the two. This single truly is worth $5, especially if you appreciate vocal talent as deeply as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds like a dream","review":"this cd sounds like a beautiful dream. so melodic and warming to the soul. diana has incredible talent well beyond her years and is such a joy to listen to. i truly am inspired by her. this is such a heart felt cd. will put you in a truly lovely mood. just lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"to the repeat reviewers","review":"This is for the person or persons from Tennessee/elsewhere: stop posting 1 star reviews saying how bad Diana is.

Both versions of \\"I Believe\\" are cheesy, but at least Fantasia sings it with emotion, Diana DeGarmo sings it too low, which is not what she's known for. \\"Dreams\\" sounds just like \\"I Believe\\" but worse, still the problem of her singing too low. \\"Don't Cry Out Loud\\" is the best song on the CD Single. The reason why is because she at least sings higher and louder on the chorus, but still, during the verses she sings low.Conclusion: If you liked Diana DeGarmo's lower voice on American Idol this is the CD for you. If you liked when she let go and sang louder and higher, this is definatley not the CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!! This girl is going places!!","review":"This single is very good. Diana sings these songs like a seasoned talent. If she sings this good now, at 16. Just think how great she will sound in a few years! Phenomenal. The only thing I would say negative about this single is in the single version of \\"Don't Cry Out Loud\\" she doesn't sing as big as her live performance. When she sang it live, she pulled you in with her big notes, but in the single version it is rather mellow. Obviously that's not her fault, some record labels don't want singers to go all out on their first projects. I will say though, expect great things from this girl!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana...","review":"Hey, I listened to both Fantasia vs Diana's rendition of I Believe: I must say that Fantasia renders a powerful version of the song....while Diana may be able to hit the high notes I'm afraid that is not enough....Fantasia makes you believe that you can do whatever it is you want to....Diana to me was not connected to the song she just sang and for me anyway, I need to feel any music that I am going to shell out money for...Diana is not enjoyable to listen to...she needs more work and the sales ratings prove it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"although I've had high expectations for Diana and saw her developing potential during the show, I'm afraid that this single doesn't live up to star status. she is cute, but no sex appeal and, although she sings well for such a young person, she hasn't learned to convey emotion in the songs - they seem rather bland, average pop-ish recordings"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Bland","review":"A very pleasant voice, with not much distinction.

The intention of the song was to be of the Pop genre, however there was alot of shouting. And then there's the Don't Cry Out Loud, the lower registry was not working the favor of Diana. But her high registry was working overtime. Congratulations to such a sweet girl, for this is her first cd release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't that great","review":"Sorry, I hate to bash people's albums but this single wasn't that great. I was actually extremely disappointed. I listened to both Fantasia and Diana and though Diana was going to blow Fantasia away but she didn't even come close. Fantasia's single proved that she is a star already and Diana's single proves that she'll has potential later on. I think though that as Diana grows older she'll be able to mature her voice because she honestly sounded like a young Kelly Clarkson. I wish her the best though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money to buy this CD","review":"I thought by buying Diana's CD that would make me like her and it only made me dislike her voice even more. Dreams is horrible. It could be the lyrics to the song but it is just horrible. She sings I believe also on the CD, buy does not put as much passion into it that Fantasia does. Diana version of I believe is more like a teenie bopper and Fantasia is like a soul Diva when she sings it. Buying Diana's Cd is a waste of five dollars that I could have had Gas money for."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEED TIME TO GROW MORE!","review":"DIANA DEGARMO HAS AN OKAY VOICE FOR HER AGE,IN TIME SHE WILL IMPROVE. THE SONG (DON'T CRY OUT LOUD) WAS NOT GOOD QUALITY AND HER PITCH WAS OFF SOME.I ENJOYED HER ON AI3 BUT I DID NOT THINK SHE WAS ONE OF THE TOP 3. I HOPE SHE HAS A LONG STANDING IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. THE PEOPLE WHO BASH OTHER ARTIST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMEONE YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEIR CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm...just not there yet","review":"I really think Diana has a great voice. However, her uninspiring, youthful voice truly emerges on this cd, for you do not \\"feel\\" or believe any of the songs she sings. Once she gets older and her voice matures she will be able to compete with the top singers out there. Until then, I would save your money on this album. I am a Diana fan, but I am very disappointed by her voice sounding so lackluster and inexperienced."},{"rating":"1","title":"quit leaving negative remarks","review":"Many of you diana fans are coming into fantasia's review and leaving very negative remarks trying to make her review bad.why are you all being so immature? I bought both of their cd's and Honestly I prefer fantasia's but Im not bashing diana, grow up little kids because you are really are being stupid because 1/2 of you all leaving negative probably have not even purchased fantasia's single......"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD Single Sucks, Big Time!","review":"Diana sounds like a sour fool. She is and never will be an American Idol because she has no talent. Singing is not standing on a stage and yelling until you are out of breath. Take this mess and shove it Diana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana Degarmo-Sadly Disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed with this CD. It was slopply put together. It seems like they rushed to put this CD together and forget about the fans. She has a nice voice but on this CD all you hear is D. Warren's. It's a bad remake. Please save your money on this one just buy the American Idol CD if you like Diana"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"I like Diana and I think she's a pretty good singer, but this CD is totally unimpressive. Diana is still a work in progress. She can hit the high notes and hold them for a long time, but she has big problems with her lower register. When she sings low, at the beginning of Don't Cry at Loud and in Dreams, she sounds flat and at times nasally. She also totally lacks in emotion when singing.Why they had her release Don't Cry Out Loud is beyond me! Hated it in 1979 and hate it now. Dreams is a beautiful song. Unfortunately, Fantasia Barrrino already sang it and did a superior job. Same goes for I Believe. Diana just doesn't have the voice or the emotion of Fantasia so she shouldn't be singing the same songs.I wish Diana all the best. But this CD is a big-time SNORE."},{"rating":"2","title":":)","review":"I think she did a pretty good job on this cd. Even though I really like the way Fantasia sings I Believe I think Diana did a good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"No offense, but Diana still has a very long way to go","review":"She is no Christina Aguilera. Her only decent song is \\"Don't Cry Out Loud,\\" yet the performance of that song is not consistent. Sometimes she's good, other times she's horrendous. No originality, no creativity. Maybe she'll improve as she gets older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana makes the single amazing!","review":"Dreams- Is a slong song, yet Diana captures the emotion of it, and pours it out. The 2nd verse, that was not sung on Television shows was amazing. 9/10DCOL- I really like the version Diana sung On AI, but the producers wanted her to do the same version of Mellisa Manchesters. While Diana still brings out the emotion and power in the song, I wish they would have let her put her own spin on it. But she still does great. 8.5/10I Believe- I would have bought the single, just for this song! Its amazing! Incredible how well she did! I really dont know how else to describe, but its for sure you need to hear how awesome it is! 10/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana rocks","review":"This young lady has a set of pipes...She actually holds back alittle on don't cry out loud..but her rendition of I Believe is by far the best that I have yet to hear of this song..Given time and experience she will be hitting the pop/country charts by storm.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Time !!!","review":"Diana cd is not something that get your attention, she has a nice voice but lack emotion. As time goes on maybe she will get better. I understand that she has fans but five stars is not what you hear on the cd. Her notes on some of the songs were off and she has not feeling for the songs she is singing. Diana needs to have stage appeal and her own style."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO AVERAGE...","review":"Diana DeGarmo has an okay pop voice. It just happens leave me me unbelievably bored and unsatisfied. She sings with no soul or conviction, and her high notes are just \\"okay...\\" She needs a lot of work on her lower range because she has a very dry one. In a competitive world of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Stacie Orrico, Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson, Avril Lavinge etc etc, I don't see where Diana DeGarmo can fit into this. Each of the artists that I mentioned brings something different to the table, wheras Diana is just like every one of them rolled into one. It's not a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave it a chance","review":"I gave this cd a chance and I was disappointed because I felt her cd was flat.I found that her performance on the show were better than her cd. The Dream song was too cheesy and She screamed through her songs. She was off key. They should have not rushed her cd out but let it show her full talent as a singer. This might really hurt her so will the people who are giving this cd 4 or 5 stars when it clear that this cd is a rush job"},{"rating":"1","title":"No subtlety or artistry","review":"Although she hits the notes, I can't say that Diana DeGarmo infuses any subtleties in her CD. Her idea of nuance is varying degrees of loud: loud, very loud, extremely loud. She doesn't have any mature level of musicianship or artistry... just a halfway decent voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"I was a Diana fan from the start, I thought she was the next Celine Dion..I thought Diana would blow Fantasia away on their singles, but I decided to purchase both and give Fantasia a chance to win me over.After listening to both cds, I realized that I was wrong and the American voters that voted for Fantasia had it right the whole time.So I officially am apologizing to Fantasia, and I need to let everyone know if you can only buy one cd, do not waste your money on Diana.Her entire cd totally let me down, while Fantasia's cd taught me to dream again with \\"I Believe\\", to dance (groove) with \\"Chain of Fools\\", and to feel all the love in my life with \\"Summertime\\".Great job Fantasia, Diana get some more singing lessons and find a new producer it did move me in any way and my cd of yours is going up for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIANA MAYBE IN 5 YEARS","review":"Diana may become a good singer in 5 year or so. Her cd is not getting attention because she lack the emotion in her songs. This site is really a joke because some people like on artist more they feel the need to downgrade another. I don't care for Diana cd but there is no reason to use personal attacks on her.Maybe most people on this site just need to make personal attacks to feel better about who they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana loses again!","review":"This cd is so boring and emotionless. I would advised that she seek into some more voice lessons but that will not teach her to display her emotions more. I didn't like it one bit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana DeGarmo's on her way!","review":"I got her single on the day it was released, but I never reviewed it. I also got her album, \\"Blue Skies\\", which I also highly reccomend. As for her single, it is an amazing collaboration of three songs that she unquestionably knocks out of the park.Dreams (5/5) this is her debut single, and it is a beautiful song that has meaningful lyrics.Don't Cry Out Loud (3/5) this was her best performance on American Idol, but the recorded version is lacking something. it's still very well sung.I Believe (5/5) this is where she nails it! this song sounds much better on her than on Fantasia in my opinion, and really showcases her vocal range.Again, I reccomend both \\"Dreams\\" and \\"Blue Skies\\" for anyone who truly has a feel for music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Believe in Diana","review":"Diana is a true star waiting to shine. When I heard this CD, I was genuinely blown away by her powerful voice. For 17, she's a stunner. I love all 3 songs, but I think DREAMS has to be my favorite. When I heard her sing I BELIEVE on the finals, I loved it. The recorded version is even better. DON'T CRY OUT LOUD is just and added bonus since it highlights her skills even further. I can't wait to hear her full-length album. She will be a classy and professional addition to the music industry. I look forward to following her career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mix","review":"I can't believe that made Diana wait an extra week.. Then another week because Fantasia couldn't get her tracks straight in the studio. Diana is truely a new talent for 2004. The tracks are good, the mix is good and of course her singing is fantastic.. Only one minor complaint and that is that \\"I Believe\\" is sort of bland with that choir in the back etc. Otherwise, it's a great Cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Talent, Great Cd!","review":"Diana is such an amazing talent and it really shows on this cd. Her version of I Believe is magnificent. She has an incredible voice that really makes you feel the song. Dreams is wonderfully orchestrated and shows her true talent. Don't Cry Out Loud is not as good of version as she belted out on Idol, but it does display her growing maturity in her vocals by being able to control them and tone it down. I am extremely pleased with this cd, the more I listen to it the more I love it. I forsee an incredible future for this talented young lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Talent","review":"WHY did Diana allow them to do this to her!?! I enjoyed her performances on AI....I enjoy seeing her interviews. She such a happy person. I am happy for her. I simply do not like this single. Sure she can sing them but it doesn't seem to fit her 16 y/o, \\"cheery\\"-happy happy-joy joy personality. I hope her future album is NOT full of cheesy elevator music. I am disappointed.SPEAK UP DIANA...BE YOU!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana DeBARF0 - Another no talent blonde","review":"She didn't impress me on American Idol, and I wish I understood HOW she got to the final two. Oh I know, the teenybopper vote. This season of American Idol was horrible, and if it wasn't for Jennifer, La Toya, and Fantasia, I wouldn't have watched. Luckily there was a miracle and Fantasia won. I got scared for a while, other no talents from AI3 like John Stevens outlasted some great talent....and all because of the teenybopper vote.Diana can't sing, she yells, and fills her songs with \\"C'mon Y'all\\" filler. How many times can someone sing that? Easy lyrics to remember, which is a plus for teenyboppers. She sings off-key, she sang off-key several times during the AI3 competition.Don't waste your money on this album. You might as well stock up on Britney album and singles, at least Britney is a better preformer.Take a stand against teenybopper pop and ignore this single, ignore her album. It's time for teenybopper pop to disappear!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wwwooooooooooowww!!!!!!!!!","review":"Diana is amazing on this cd!!! GO BUY IT NOW!!! It's the best cd I own!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana told us she'd be back....","review":"At the end of American Idol, Diana DeGarmo told us she'd be back, and she is. With the release of her debut single, \\"DREAMS\\", she proves that she belongs in the same group as the rest of the successful Idol contestants. She shows great vocal control, and keeps herself poised as a great singer. Her version of \\"I Believe\\" sounds stronger than Fantasia's, although Fantasia's version has a different ending due to the ad-libbing Fantasia did on the show. Overall, Diana looks to be in line for the same success as Clay Aiken achieved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melissa Manchester is better","review":"When singing a song recorded by a previous artist, it has to be as good or better than the original. Melissa Manchester's version is much easier to listen to. Maybe her CD that will be released this fall, which I'm looking forward to hearing, will be better than this one. I think Diana will have a great career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I found this single to be boring and plain. Not as good as it could have been. She struck out, which is too bad.

I've used the intro in two organizational presentations and both times, it has spawned lots of discussion. The 212 concept is developed enough that it can be easily merged into a variety of industry areas and adapted for different audiences--professional, personal, religious, etc. CONS: I bought it after I scanned the first few pages, and was a little disappointed to find that the content gets a little watered down as the book progresses. It starts to become a collection of motivational sayings without any additional substance. One of the \\"chapters/sections\\" is only 2 pages long, and I kept thinking, \\"did they leave pages out?\\" OVERALL: The beginning of the book is powerful, and the concepts will stick, so it's well worth it's tiny pricetag!212 The Extra Degree"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Depressing","review":"This little book was handed out to all the employees where I work.

Most of the passion of the book falls in the last few pages where you are enticed to buy copies of the book by the 100's and give them to everyone you know. Let me save you $10.

Most of the trainings are boring and something memorable for only a short time. This book is not that. The simple metaphor used in the introduction, and the entire basis of the book is very meaningful and easy to see in action. Today I hear so many people complain and feel that they are entitled to things instead of taking responsibility for their actions. This book shows that the smallest increment of effort can have positive effects not only on your professional life, but all aspects. This book uses real life examples that are easily relatable and prove the point. This is a quick read, but definitely worth the price and definitely applicable to life.

Boysie coaxes his little friend K-fer the kitten onto the table, hoping that a scuffle will ensue between K-fer and a large bully cat in the house. The scheme works; the bully cat pushes K-fer off the table along with the bear.It's likely the author was trying to illustrate self-reliance and ingenuity. Instead, the story makes it clear that it is acceptable to deliberately put a friend in harm's way to get what you covet.

I don't see how spouting God platitudes is supposed to help someone earnestly seeking to overcome being a People Pleaser. If the Bible has all of the answers why do Christian self help books abound? And if the authors are truely Christians shouldn't they be giving their advice away for free?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not Joyce's voice!!","review":"I was so disappointed when I started the tapes and heard that this is not Joyce Meyer's voice reading her own work, especially during parts about her personal history. It is really jarring to hear her elevator-recording voice saying \\"I felt like x\\" and \\"I thought y\\" when it is so clearly not herself she is talking about. The woman who did the reading aloud of this book has a mild, monotone, and impersonal tone that is in sharp contrast to Joyce Meyer's style. If you want this product, buy it in book form. Then you will still feel you're connecting to the author, which is I think why we read these type of books at all. The tapes are just not engaging to listen to at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man Pleaser To God Pleaser","review":"Joyc Meyer always has a way of making matter of fact out of the mysteries of Heaven and most importantly God's heart. For those who want out of the rut of feeling unworthy, unsuccessful or unaccepted in life, this book will redefine acceptance and love through God's eyes, which is always there no matter what, and help take our eyes off ourselves or our circumstances. We need look no futher for those attributes from people. Once we know we are loved and accepted always by God our true Heavenly father, we no longer need to base who we are off of people's thoughts of us. They make no difference. To live for God alone is all that should matter, not to be so stifled by what other people think about us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used it for 15 years as an aircraft structural engineer","review":"It was 15 years a go that I got this book as a part of a lecture by Dr. Broek. Over the years I have come across many books on this subject. I have to admit that this book is one of the best introductory material written on DTA.

I usually lighten my color and add some reddish tone to it. For some reason I thought I'd give this color a try, big mistake on my part. My hair looked black in the house and a crazy, un-natural purple-burgundy in the sunlight. It looked like a Halloween wig! I hated the color and felt pretty stupid for trying it. I refused to go to work with this crazy color and get teased so I ended up spending money and time at a salon to have them remove as much of this color as possible. I could see the stylist kind of tsk, tsking me for coloring at home. It took quite a while but I was left with a lighter color I could live with until I could use my normal hair color again. Just be aware that this will get extremely dark and it does not look natural at all. You will stand out if that's your goal! As for me, I've learned my lesson and I stick with colors that say \\"light\\", even medium colors get way too dark for me. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!","review":"I really loved this dye.

I picked up a bottle of Feria True Red again and it is TOTALLY different. There's a new thing called \\"color boost\\"... okay. I added it to the other ingredients and just the tiniest drop fell onto my white sink and stained it immediately. I started dying and I thought someone had played a joke on me: the color was bright pink! I've been freaked out by colors before so I went through with the whole process.

Many of Citron's facts are erroneous (beginning with Lloyd Webber's last name which is NOT hyphenated, but appears hyphenated in every instance throughout this book). His approach to this material is very condescending. For example, he implies that A Little Night Music and Passion only won Tony Awards because there were no other decent shows that opened those years, thereby dismissing other good shows and offering backhanded compliments to Sondheim. Rumors are that the Really Useful Group is extremely embarrassed by the Lloyd Webber sections. Wait for the forthcoming Yale series on Broadway composers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and embarrassing","review":"What a terrible book this is. As with Citron's other books, this is LOADED with factual errors and misunderstandings of the shows he discusses. The first big clue is that he misspells Andrew Lloyd Webber's name throughout the entire book -- where were his editors? And he says that the period between the 1920s and 1960s was \\"a time when plot was secondary\\" in musicals. Oh really? Like in Carousel, West Side Story, Show Boat, Pal Joey, South Pacific, My Fair Lady, Camelot, Gypsy, The King and I...? I feel sorry for anyone who wastes their money on this the way I did.

Are we following traditions, religious mores? Or are there deeper meanings revealed in God's Word that can help us know what worship is?This book was recommended to me by my pastor along with Peterson's bookEngaging With God: A Biblical Theology of Worship. Both have been very helpful in explaining the biblical history of worship, the fulfillment of the Law by Jesus Christ, the worship of the early church, as well as worship in the future described in the book of Revelations.Noel Due takes his readers beyond the animal sacrifices of the Jewish Law to the daily personal offerings in recognition of Christ's work on the cross and a believer's response to this offering in loving God by serving others.

The Believers' Church is a history book on the character of radical protestantism. And if that subtitle doesn't put you to sleep, then the first 20 pages will surely accomplish that.Durnbaugh wants to inform his readers about how the protestant church came about and the branches thereof. John Yoder calls this book, \\"A classic\\" and I guess I would agree with him if by classic he means a book that is not enjoyable to read.This book is divided into 3 parts: The Concept of the Believers' Church, The History of the Believers' Church, and The Character of the Believers' Church.The last part would have to be the most enjoyable for me (and that really isn't saying a lot). In The Character of the Believers' Church, Durnbaugh dives into Mission, Evangelism, Church & State and other areas of minor interest.The rest of the book is an entire bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Feat's Best Album","review":"DIXIE CHICKEN is Little Feat's best album ever, perfecting the group's blend of Allman Brothers, New Orleans funk, country, and island influences.

It has 17 remastered tracks, some that are missing here. Of course what's on here is all great. There is also the \\"What a long strange trip it's been\\" best of. But that's 2 discs and also not quite perfect. If you wanted just ONE live disc, which is hard to come by, I would suggest \\"Dead Set\\". That's a good 14 track selection.

I mean, how else do you explain their legion of fanatic fans, or the fact that they even got signed to a major label at all? Truth be told, these guys are a bunch of Bob Dylan wannabees with long hair. Grateful Dead tried to be Bob Dylan by turning up the amps, growing out their hair, and smoking dope. Trouble is, they lack the poignancy of Dylan's beautiful poetry, plus Dylan's political sense of the world. These guys were only out to get stoned, while Dylan was intent on changing the world with his music - and he probably did!!I'll admit there's some jamming electric guitar on some of these songs, but it's nothing that heavy-metal icon Van Halen weren't doing much better ten years later!!Oh well, Halen is still thriving at least.

I've always enjoyed the mix of songs on it, and the sequencing. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this album does go well with the double album \\"What A Long Strange Trip It's Been\\", only one song is on both albums (Truckin'). It's not really a greatest hits album, Truckin' was pretty much their only early radio hit. The Grateful Dead never received much airplay until the mid to late 80s, not on the east coast anyway.

Those two albums though were hallmarks of my college experience. I'll never forget them. I listened to these tracks over and over again. My dormmates and I even made up alternative lyrics for a few of the songs which we sang to one another at every opportunity. I like every tune that's here but I'd be a liar if I didn't mention that Uncle John's Band is near the top of my \\"Favorite Songs Ever\\" list.

I have been a fan of Bonnie Raitt ever since. Since I also sing, I could appreciate a great performance. All the numbers are great, but if I were forced to select my favorites, it would be \\"Angel From Montgomery\\" and \\"Rainy Day Man\\". Bonnie cannot be categorized into a particular genre.

This cross-pollination resulted in a unique sound, illustrated wonderfully on this (and other early) ZZ Top album(s) before they sold out and went \\"pop\\". Other notables are \\"Brown Sugar\\" (not your Rolling Stones variety) and \\"Goin' Down to Mexico\\". Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF!","review":"Find yourselves the original album or casette and play it for a pure sound. This cd release is remastered with added effects that deletes any history of what ZZ Top's original sound was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musically great album with terrible re-release production","review":"Let me start by saying that I listen to this album a lot in its entirety... ON VINYL. I would never waste my money on this CD reissue of the album because all of the songs were remixed with those cheesy 1980's sound effects and production techniques. So, basically, this remixed album lacks the crisp sound that the original mix had. I know that vinyl will always sound crisper than CD, but a CD with the original mix of this album would sound a lot cleaner and less cheesy than the production quality of this remix.So, do not buy this CD. The band has stated that they would be reissuing their first 6 albums on CD in their original mixes, and did have already released 3 of these promised reissues. So just sit tight and I think we shall see the other reissues within the next few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money on this CD","review":"I should have carefully checked the reviews beforehand. I don't normally do because I like to form my own opinions but in this case I would have saved money and would not have been disapointed.I'm a great fan of ZZ TOP and I wanted to complete my collection by adding their very earlier stuff like ZZTop's first album, Rio Grande Mud and Tejas...what a disappointment!!! Who's the brilliant person that switched the drums with electronic drums or a drum machine??? Man-o-man what a mistake to have screwed up such classics as these. What a waste, can I return my purchase?"},{"rating":"1","title":"1980's botched remaster of a unbridled classic","review":"If you've not heard about the \\"remaster\\" that was done on this release consider this your heads up.At sometime in the 1980s/90's they remixed this album with way too much echo and fake drum machines. Gone is the beautiful rawness and classic mix that defined this album. What you now get is a sound that resembles a bad soundcheck in a tin room. I can see why this was done, it was an attempt to get the Elminator/Afterburner fans to buy the early discs. One review on the \\"Best of ZZ Top\\" early greatist hits package, said he felt these remasters have destroyed the whole original vibe of the music making it almost unlistenable. I gotta agree with him. Why can't an import at the very least be issued of the original mix? I would gladly cough up 20 to 25 bucks to have this and the other early albums in the way they were meant to sound.So be wary of this CD. This release is not the album you remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage Remix With 80's Gimmickry","review":"As part of an attempt to capitalize on the success of their Eliminator sound, ZZ Top decided to go back into the studio and remix and also re-record parts of their first 6 albums thinking it would make them more money and entice fans of their newer sound to go back and buy their earlier records. Well guess what, in the process their older fans who were used to the original versions on the old cassettes and albums were shocked when they listened to any of these first generation CD releases. They heard bogus reverbed drums, and entire sections of both music and vocals re-recorded. Talk about tarnishing the legacy of a great band's output. Well someone finally wised up and now at least Tres Hombres and Fandango are now available in original mix, remastered form. So stay away from this trash and wait for the entire back catalog to be released in it's original mix, remastered form on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Rhino release, or dust off your turntable and find an LP","review":"This is in regard to the 1980's recomposed/remastered version of ZZ Top's First Album. Ditto all of the comments about the awfulness of the reverb and fake drums. What's really sad is what was printed on the back of the vinyl LP jacket in 1970:\\"In this day of homogenized rock, synthesized music, retakes, overdubbing, multi, multi-tracking, an honest recording by accomplished musicians is a rewarding pleasure. Z Z TOP'S FIRST ALBUM is just such a recording. This is the way blues-rock is meant to be played: openly, honestly, and spontaneously. It takes an experienced sensitive group such as Z Z TOP to capture the abstract blues from within and combine it with the ability to feel and play good hard rock without losing their communication.\\"17 years later, they trashed their own philosophy. Tres Hombres, and Fandango by Rhino, are the first honest digital transfers of the original first 5 ZZ Top albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"STILL WAITING FOR THE PROPER REMASTER !!!!!!","review":"This is the best ZZ Top record ever.

This is an excellent book.IT is NOT 15 minutes cooking time. It is NOT 15 minutes AFTER everything is put together. It is just about 15 minutes from start to finish (provided you are not dwadling as you cook).The only thing I don't like is that everything is given in weights and grams and other measurements.

I was thinking this would be a waste...until I put it on his play mat with him (he is 9 months now) and I always catch him doing something different with it. Whether he happens to hit it with his arm and discovers something it does or accidentally hits the button on top, or decides he wants to chew on the rubber suction cup he's constantly having his attention drawn to it.

Two caveats - the sound quality is not always the best, and some lines are hard to understand.

Some people may not like Manic Mechanic but I like the vocal effect that is used here. The use of saxaphones and keyboards on some of the other tracks just enriches the overall sound.

With ZZ Top it is simple, they sing about women, sex, cars and Drugs/alcohol, most times all in the same song. The opening track is a very blunt sexual cover of \\"Thank You\\" followed by the rockabilly sounding \\"She Loves My Automobile\\" and the classic \\" I'm Bad I'm Nationwide\\". Every song on the album seems to have the blussiness of their first albums and the pollish of their later radio friendly sound. The diamond out of all the gems on the album is \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\".

The orchestra - under the baton of Noel Smith - is of high caliber, though the transfer of music onto videotape was done just a bit off speed, with the result that some sustained passages by the orchestral winds are marred by a slight 'bubble' in the sound.

Lowell George could have a twang in his vocals and there may be a slide guitar, but there were backing vocals that could have been from a funk record.The playing is so subtle, but complex at the same time. The bass comes in halfway into the beat, the way the best sessionmen did it. The dobro could slide, and somehow sound rural and cosmopolitan at the same time.

I've listened to this cd quite a few times, but the pretty ballad \\"Long Distance Love\\" is still the only song I can remember anything about. Even the playing somehow feels routine, more uninspired than previously. This disc is somewhat saved by the inclusion of the two tracks which had to be left out from the single-disc edition of the live double album \\"Waiting For Columbus\\" (the cover of C&W band Fraternity Of Man's \\"Don't Bogart That Joint\\" from the \\"Easy Rider\\" soundtrack is short but hilarious, and seems to go on very well with the audience despite the subject matter).

They are great band that fall in line of bands like God Flesh abd Pitch Shifter. With their catchy lyrics and killer mix it makes for a great but unique sound. One of the best tracks on this is Giving you the Dutch Fist. I think you understand the tilte without going into detail. All in all it pretty dam good for a local band that stands up with the rest. If you ever run across video of these guys check it out. It is one of the craziest live shows I ever seen. They have this light show with videos running in the back ground are some the most violent and pornographic stuff I ever seen.

Solid and sturdy. Used them extensively in the military in the field and on deployments. I would have given it 4-1/2 stars. However, the supplier is very careless about shipping this item. The easel arrived poorly boxed and was broken. Returned for a replacement, and arrived again broken, same type of packaging. Returned for a refund. Amazon has been very good about returns.

Two out of three of the nail polishes were dried up, brushes splayed. The girls liked the toe ring, but fought because there was only one. The beads were stringable with difficulty, but my girls didn't have the patience and insisted I do it. The emery board was ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Based on a mixed bag of reviews for even the best chain whips, I decided to go with the Cog wrench instead. Never used a chain whip so I can't compare, but this works well and cost less than the competitor.

I purchased this sleep mark instead of spending a lot of money on drapes, etc. When I first put the mask on, I was very impressed! No light came in around or under the edges and it was pitch black. It was also extremely comfortable. The issue came when I tried to sleep with it on--I sleep on my sides. The mask is too thick, and sleeping on my side caused a \\"lump\\" where the thickness of the mask came into play. I was up all night readjusting the thing because the band also has a tendency to work its way up. What's more, all night I kept feeling \\"tickling\\" from what I thought was a stray hair but turned out to be the bottom of the mask already fraying and a string was the tickle.

I love her writing style and the detail that she includes. However, I found Vanessa to be a shrew and a control freak and it became increasing harder for me to like her.I hate when heroines, in an attempt to show their strength and independence, do foolish things like help in gunfights when their help is clearly unnecessary.In Wind of Promise, the heroine does this three times. After the second time, our wonderful hero explained to her the danger to others that her actions were creating and I thought - ahh, now she will stop. However, she did it a third time so I turned off the Kindle and won't finish the rest of the book.Also, our hero fell in love with her much too easy and early when she was still being shrewish, unkind and they hadn't had any true conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance and customer service","review":"Purchased a similar model NWB Excursion phone. Performance was poor from the start. Battery died incredibly quickly after charge. The real killer was customer service. When the phone stopped working entirely after a few weeks, I tried literally dozens of times to get through to customer service via the 800 number, which is actually on a big sticker on the base. They NEVER pick up - you're on hold several minutes, and then told to call back or leave a message. If you leave a message, it's not returned. Emails to their customer service were also ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this phone","review":"I got this phone free after rebate. That said, this phone wasn't worth the price to me. It has one very bad feature that overrides all of its other features: when the battery is low it will beep until you place it in the cradle. As fate would have it, it usually beeps in the middle of the night. I guess if you are the type of person who keeps the phone in the cradle at all times, you would find this phone satisfactory. I don't. One other thing, even with the ringer off, the phone needs recharging about every five days. Compared to my 10-15 year old Panasonic phone which needs charging about once every three weeks, this phone isn't very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, now I'll have to buy 4 more of them.","review":"The empire had hundreds of these so I should buy more of them.I really like this set. The wings wobble like the toy did so you can have it get shot down easily. The cockpit is quite plain but the glass is cool.The stand works as a nice display tool and looks like a landing platform. I just don't know how the pilot gets down.The fact that this comes with a Storm trooper is quite the bonus.I noticed someone was bummed that Darth Vader wasn't the pilot of this. In the movie, he had his own tie with bent wings. And in Legos he and his Tie come with the Y-wing.I can't wait to get the X-wing toy to place behind this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks better than it is","review":"My son (4 yrs) was disappointed in this tie fighter because the wings wobble. I am baffled as to why LEGO settled for such an unstable design. It would have been easy to eliminate the wing-wobble using parts they include with other sets. You can customize with other pieces to eliminate the wobble, but the fighter will look different. The cockpit is also a little unstable. On the positive side, my son and I have used the pieces of this set to build several different ships of our own design. I don't regret the purchase because this set has inspired my son's creativity, and will do so for years to come.P.S. I highly recommend the Model 7140 Tie Fighter! Great design and stable enough for kids to play with."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIE Fighter","review":"This set almost exactly like the the 2005 TIE Fighter.

I quickly purchased my own copy from amazon.com after reading it. It is an amazing book - it really did change the way I parented my daughter [for the better] and it also really REALLY worked for child spacing purposes. I was fascinated with the information in this book [which I'd never read or even heard of elsewhere] and it was fun and easy to read. I also really REALLY enjoyed being without periods for more than a year too. :) I think any breastfeeding mom would really benefit from reading this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gave me the Courage to Continue breastfeeding","review":"I am the mother of a 17-month-old child who loves to nurse and was feeling obligated to wean him because of what others might think of an older child still nursing. This book gave me the courage to follow my natural insticts and let my child decide when to be weaned. This book gave reasons why continued breastfeeding is beneficial to older children as well as younger and also helped me see that I am a good mother. This book is an excellent tool for any breastfeeding mother who cherishes the bonding time breastfeeding provides.After reading this book I was told I would need to wean my child to have a medical procedure. The book gave my the courage to say no. Later it was realized that the certain medical procedure would have been unneccessay. I am so grateful I took the time to read this book, I know it can give you the courage to continue also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any woman","review":"If I could recommend just one book to the expectant mother undecided about breastfeeding this would be the one. It gives information that I've never read or heard anywhere else, all of it sourced from experts most people would recognize such as Dr. Dickley Grant-Read and Dr. John Bowlby.Everyone knows breastfeeding is best for baby but that in itself might not be enough to persuade some women. Adding in the fact that proper breastfeeding can keep the mother from having her period for over a year and keep her infertile naturally might just be the extra nudge she needs to nurse her baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eco. breastfeeding doesn't always work.","review":"I guess I'm just blessed with an early return of fertility, despite following the rules.

A 1979 CD of anything would have to be pretty collectible. That aside, this is one of my favorite Ry Cooder albums, (I have an original vinyl copy and a CD version... not from 1979 though). He is a great player and has excellent taste in what he chooses to record."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Toilet seat blue...\\"","review":"...was the way I think Ry described his Fender's finish in an old Guitar Player interview. Part of Cooder's genius was/is arranging electric and acoustic instruments in a way that's satisfying to fans of both. Granted, \\"Bop\\" is not a blues record and neither is the music it reinterprets. Still, Ry's open D and G comping is a pleasure to hear and learn from. But, for a guy whose prior records just \\"sounded\\" so terrific, the digital production sheen on this one was a disappointment at the time and, while fun to hear again after so long, for my taste, \\"Bop\\" can't quite take its place among his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooder's weakest album...and still great!","review":"If there is one song on this album that is worth the price of purchase it is Look at Granny Run Run. That, for some reason, has always been one of my favorite Ry Cooder songs and I always lamented that it was on my least favorite Ry Cooder album. My lamentation is not so much a bad thing due to the fact that this, the first digitally recorded album ever, is ten times better than most artists' best work. The strange mix of tunes and styles such as the gospelization of Trouble, You Can't Fool Me and the oddball Down in Hollywood give this album a \\"late-night, late seventies LA, the party is over and we're all out of coke\\" feel. It seems that Cooder and producer Lee Herschberg threw everything they had into this album. And even though the production on this disc gives it an unnecessary sheen that sometimes drowns out Cooder's guitar and makes things a tinge tinny, Cooder's infectious playing and great selection of tunes make this one a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong Amazon Reviewer Wrong!","review":"For some reason critics have decided their is something wrong with this recording by the great Ry Cooder. That the digital recording somehow doesn't sound right or some such nonsense. Whatever...Uh this is an excellent record. What a great choice of songs here performed as only Ry Cooder can. Is there a better guitar player in the world? And the accompanying musicians and players make for an excellent and highly SATISFYING record.

The most intriguing feature is that you can stealth kill your enemies. You can also chose a variety of items; shuriken (throwing stars), caltrops, poison darts, gas grenade, just to name a few. You may chose from two different characters who have their own story lines! And another awesome feature is that when you beat the game with these two characters (Rikimaru and Ayame), you get third character named Tatsumaru! Honestly the best Ninja game ANYWHERE! Highly recommended. I also recommend Tenchu: Stealth Assasins"},{"rating":"2","title":"Think of it as Rikimaru's Revenge","review":"I would've given this game a 4 star rating, but you can create your own missions! If you like stealth games like Metal Gear Solid, then this is for you. You can be two Ninjas....Rikimaru(boy) and Ayame (girl). Your goal is to keep away from the guards....and kill them without anyone noticing. You can use 22 Ninja Items, some magical (Vanishing Tree makes you disappear to another place in a flash of leaves), some not(Grappling Hook anyone?). Rikimaru is armed with a deadly Katana and Ayame two daggers. You can do front flips,and back flips, and you can creep along walls. You can crouch so the enemy doesn't see you, and you can breath underwater with the help of a bamboo pole. One of the best features of this game is the 1-hit Stealth kill. If you can manage to run up behind an enemy without them noticing, you can kill them silently. Overall a great game, but a little bloody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tenchu 2: Nostalgia","review":"My brother and I used to play this game CONSTANTLY when it first came out. It's one of those games that just gets better and better the more you play it. The Mission Editor was a nice addition to the series, as was the ability to swim and conceal your weapons when you don't need them. Although this game is flawed in some ways (nothing is perfect) it's still a PS1 classic that should be included in any gamer's collection. And I'm not just saying that because of nostalgia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stealth is the key...","review":"In my opinion, this game was quite realistic with the backgrounds, the characters, and all the nasty killing. You begin in a training area where you learn all the techniques of a ninja. As you continue through each new level, some of the bad guys change just like the story. There is a secret character that you can play as, but you'll need a code to get him (Tatsumaru). The little number at the bottom-right hand side of the screen determines how close to an enemy you are. The higher the number, the closer an enemy is. That system is easy to use and very dependable, because then you'll know where the enemy is, instead of searching for them. Sometimes it gets too dark and difficult to see, but I guess that it's supposed to be like that for the background. Has some violence, pretty neat graphics, and cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GAWD!","review":"This game is bad. I loved the first Tenchu game, and the PS2 version rocks. The entertainment factor here can best be described as standing on a packed bus on an 95 degree day, with no air-conditioning....someone crapped thier pants...you don't know who, the bus stinks, you just missed your stop, and the next stop is not for another 20 minutes....yeah it's that much fun!

For me, this album is just great art and to try to describe it any better than that would be impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Van Morrison's True Masterworks","review":"In my estimation, Veedon Fleece, among Van Morrison's albums, is second only to the incomparable Astral Weeks. While this album is composed of songs as strong as those on Astral Weeks, it does not function quite as well as an album. \\"Fair Play\\" is arguably the best fall asleep on a summer day song ever, and \\"You don't Pull No Punches\\" the best of his epic vocal improvisation songs. My only real problem with this album is that Van employs an upright bass for the first few tracks, switching over to an electric bass guitar for the majority of album. Though all the tracks with the electric bass are eccellent, I think they would have been better with the upright. It would most likely lent the coherency that would have made Veedon Fleece function better as an album. That said, it is still one of Van Morrison's best recordings, and one of pop music's best albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album","review":"Whenever I liston to Veedon Fleece I'm carried along a gentle pathway beyond the day's troubles. It's luscious sound is like angels ministering to me.

Warm, rich, earthy, bold, and challenging, this album finds Van stretching, lingering, emoting, and contemplating with a great, flexible band that follows him every step of the way. For those who want to not just listen passively but actually be taken \\"Into the Mystic\\", this one's for you. Put it on and wander a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another voice in praise...","review":"...I can't really say any more about this album as all others have simply drained my thoughts. Something very special happening here. Lay back and drift along with this and at the end you feel as if you've just been on a long revealing journey. Not many albums can transport me like this one. Vintage Van; as I said twenty years ago, I continue looking forward to growing old with this unique talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer magnificence! It doesn't get any better than this....","review":"Although certainly a very large statement given Van's incredible body of work, this could- in my opinion, very well be his finest moment. The sheer power and beauty of his vocals is sonic perfection to these ears. The instrumentation is wonderful and the songs rank among his best. Get it, now! You certainly won't regret it!

My shower is now soap scum and hard water stain free.Another reviewer said you could just spray it in the shower and then rinse it off. I usually take a cup and wet the walls first, spray on the Comet, wipe it down with a rag, and then rinse it off. There is one thing you should know though. This cleaner has a very strong smell that burns your throat and nose. If you have a built in vent in your bathroom, make sure you turn it on. If not, leave the room a couple times while cleaning.

I'd read The Birth of the Firebringer years ago and had been looking for the second and third book in the trilogy ever since. I have to say I was greatly disappointed in this second part of the trilogy. Aljan is dragged out to sea and winds up in the land of the two-foots without memory of who he is, knowing only that he must find the secret of fire. A good concept, but poorly pulled off. Pierce loses the sense of magic and adventure that was such a big part of the first novel. It's also much darker than the first and third. You don't really feel like it fits at all with the other books. The only places it ties in are the beginning and end. It feels more like an interruption than a continuation of the original story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 star","review":"I didn't like the parts when the book talked about Jan and the two-footed sorcerers.

The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because the content doesn't apply to me. I was sort of hoping for more symptoms/stories about children diagnosed with ASD and less information on how to get help, etc...Otherwise, I suppose it deserves more stars if it was more applicable to me. Also, I've done so much research on my own about the subject, that the first half of the book was information I was already familiar with, so that was disappointing. In fact, I had to skip through much of it because it was redundant, but if you don't much about the disorder, then this book is a good resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"WHAT A RESOURCE!

It's an easy read full of great ideas about what to do now and how to move forward.My only critic are the story box's that get placed in the middle of a sentence and run on for a page or 2, it throws off my reading groove, I want to keep reading though now I have to search for where it picks up again.So if your child has this disorder or you know a child that does, READ THIS BOOK.

The only reason to listen to The Sex Pistols is if you want Malcolm MacLaren to make more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOLLOCKS!!!!!!","review":"The Pistols made Punk into the biggest media bonanza since hippie.When Punk came out, to spread out its dirty little wings, the generation caught by the narcotic f**k up of the sixties had a new hope something to fight for, to live, but within months the dream was sold, baught out it was turned into another commodity beacause of bands like The Pistols,The Damned, and the Clash. They can stuff their punk credentials, with all their money up their a**. ANARCHY IN THE UK WHAT A BUNCH OF BOLLOCKS, what did they ever do to live out that dream.They didnt care about punk, they dont wanna worry about anything. They numb their minds on T.V., space out on coke and dope they dont want their sh*tty lives to surface. I know its sh*t and u know its sh*t but they wont admit to the themselves that the fun they have all that style they got is the same old sh*t. Their music is a joke. Find some other Punk bands theirs many and a lot better too. THE PISTOLS, BOLLOCKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Junk","review":"Some say that this band was the original punk band, some say the Ramones, some say the MC5, but the original punk band was The Gas Company with their single \`\`Blow Your Mind\`\` in 1965. It shreds the Sex Pistols but it still sucked. 0 stars for the Pistols and the Gassers."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank goodness punk rock has improved","review":"Cheers to the band for pretty much starting the punk rock genre, but really at this early stage punk rock is really awful. The Sex Pistols have a really annoying singer, unmemorable songs, and a pretty stupid name too. When I listened to this album I found myself constantly wanting to do something else as the dull tunes rattled on. A word to the M Saylor reviewer: the world does not revolve around the Sex Pistols, and stop calling Green Day, Simple Plan, and Relient K junk because I doubt you've even listened to them. This band is really trashy, conclusively. Don't get the CD, but if possible get their decent hit \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" I do like that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punk=Poseur","review":"The whole punk thing was manufactured by mainstream corporates, and all those mindless sheep think that they aren't conforming and that they have minds of there own, but sorry your entire scene is a lie and was made by the media.

Then again, I have never accepted \\"punk\\" as a form of music because it takes NO TALENT WHATSOEVER to play a generic pair/trio of chords. Just learn to play guitar for a few months and you'll be able to \\"play\\" this garbage effortlessly.If you want to learn the true definition of garbage in music, all you need is one listen. Then again, I have never been able to endure five minutes in one sitting. I guess I prefer music with melody, passion, taste, lyricism and a given level of musicianship. You won't find any of the above here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this crap?","review":"please - rebel against the establishment, only to become part of the establishment. this album reeks of hypocrisy, and foreshadow just what length Mr. Lydon (Rotten who?) will go to for fame FROM the establishment he is rebelling against. depressing. very depressing. buy The Clash or even Gen X, but this album is terrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"All attitude, no talent","review":"I was fifteen when this album was released. I loved the attitude; so \\"in your face\\" and antagonistic that it felt like an act of revolution to play it loud enough for your parents to hear. I think that some of the reviewers here are giving five stars because of what the band and record MEAN to them, instead of rating it as music. Because any honest assessment of this band would reveal thier total lack of musicianship and the fact that the lyrics are juvenile at best, and that the recording quality stinks. Some will say that this is all a part of the punk attitude and that stripped down, bare-bones sound without studio fluff is what they were after. If you admire them for setting out to make a crappy sounding record, that's fine, but don't try to pass it off years later as some sort of masterpiece just because it's old. It's still just as crappy as the day it was released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screed","review":"As seminal an album as has ever been released, this record has lost nothing over the years. Lest punk rock be thought of as sloppy or ill-conceived, this album, from the genre's best-remembered, most influential band, remains as well-crafted as any record ever made. Nothing more need be said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the hoopla influence your buying decisions","review":"Alright, so punk wouldn't have existed without the Sex Pistols. In fact most of what we now call rock and roll wouldn't be nearly the same. The fact remains that Never Mind The Bollocks isn't a very good album. I listen to music for music's sake. I listen to black metal bands that growl, but the vocals on the Pistols' album are just irritating. Some Punk fans would say that's the only way to get their message across. Maybe true, but it doesn't exactly make me want to listen to that message. And isn't that the purpose of music? That you actually enjoy listening to it? Much in the same way that Nirvana's imitators often surpassed them, the bands that followed the Sex Pistols, like the Clash, actually made punk a legitimate musical style. This album, with the exception of God Save the Queen is just overrated dreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"still the best ever punk album","review":"\\"Never Mind the Bollocks,\\" the sex pistols first album, is the best punk album ever. Johnny Rotten's anger, emotion, and lyrical genus combine with great instrumental performances by Paul Cook, Steve Jones, and Sid Vicious to make this revolutionary album. What the pistols lacked in lyrical talent they made up for with pure emotional anger, creating the most significant record in the history of punk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk my #$&, it just rocks!","review":"Its a shame that the sex pistols dressed up and acted like drunken fools. Anarchy in the UK, God Save the Queen, Pretty Vacant and Holidays in the Sun are great rock songs. They did not need the hype. The songs have stood the test of time.What a bunch of losers. If they would have stayed together and developed like any other band, they definitely had potential. Although PIL basically sucked, the second album was very innovative with a couple of cool songs. Lydon was one of the first to experiment with dub and Keith Levene and Jah Wobble were really cool, innovative musicians Too bad Lydon has alway had his head up his rear end. I hope his public persona is an act b/c, if not, what a jerk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of all time.","review":"The Sex Pistols were one of the best early punk bands and this is one of the best punk album ever recorded.Sure The Ramones and The Clash stayed together longer but The Pistols more than made up for it with Bullocks.There arent many better songs than Anarchy In The U.K.,God Save The Queen,the underrated and very impressive Submission which is my favorite track on the album,Problems,No Feelings and the great opener Holidays In The Sun.Despite the songs being angry and rebellious,listening to this album is a release for me and I even like to sing along sometimes cause all the songs are catchy.Its a great,great album and one of the best albums of the 70s.Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"History in the Making","review":"12 songs, 38 minutes and 27 seconds and Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, hippies, prog rock and all self indulgent, self centred tedious 'rockers' of the 70s were justly dismissed as meaningles old farts and replaced with this - Rock and Roll! They were downed much like the Berlin wall and with them went 20 minute guitar solos and drum solos and it was great. The most significant single moment in the history of the greatest musical form in all history (rock and roll, folks, rock and roll) apart from Elvis recording 'That's Alright Mama'(of course). Thrash, bash, crash, demonic stare, anger, sarcasum, and energy to burn. A piece of history everybody should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Have","review":"This was a very good band who very well could have been great if not for poor/arrogant management and their own life style. If you want some hard rock with a different slant you might want to give this one a try. This band defined punk in the late 70's. In my opinion the greatest punk band of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album saved the 70s!","review":"That anyone could give this album less than 5 stars is simply ridiculous. In terms of its influence on the music industry since its release, there is likely not another album that has had such a dramatic impact. Especially considering that the group were only together as a unit for a relatively short while."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greatest Rock'n'Roll Hype","review":"Pure crap. It is just amazing that some critics praise the band and anything it produced. About its sucess? Well, prefab stupidity like KISS, Marylin Manson, The Monkees and ABBA, to name a few, sometimes hit the big time. Sex Pistols is just another example.If I want to listen to punk rock (whatever it means) then I'll favour Stooges, MC5 and the clownesque masters of the genre, Ramones."},{"rating":"1","title":"The below 5 star reviewer is naive and a sucker","review":"If you bought this album instead of Britney, you should be banished from civilization.

If you ask me, they just straightforward sucked, and even Johnny Rotten admits he can't sing.

Save your money","review":"Alright, I used to be a huge fan of the Sex Pistols then I realized that there were WAY better bands out there then them. Sid Vicious was nothing but a coat on a hanger (only there for publicity purposes) and I don't understand how girls can find him attractive all he was, was a heroin addict who cut himself on stage (Yes Iggy Pop did this too but at least he was good and is an artist) he also ended up killing his girlfriend. He couldn't even play the bass!! Not to mention that horrible T-shirt with the swastika he used to wear and for what reason other than to make people mad and get attention. Johnny \\"Rotten\\" is just jerk off. If you want \\"Political\\" punk then save your money and get some Sham 69 maybe even some Crass, but then again there's only so much screaming one can take"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone like these guys?","review":"Sorry, but it is impossible to comprehend why anyone would like this music. Even the Amazon editor calls it \\"bile\\". The lead singer? Well... he doesn't sing. Period. That's the main problem with this band, the other being that the songwriting is horrible. There's good punk rock, like The Clash and The Ramones, but then there's this. On top of that, we can thank this cruddy band for inspiring hundreds of musically untalented snubs to try their hand at punk rock, ultimately killing rock n' roll and good rock in general. And these guys got inducted into the Hall of Fame? Pathetic! When the Sex Pistols never gave authority respect, why should authority give any to them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for 13-year-old boys, but....","review":"This is pop music that yer mom would like if it weren't for the explatives. Punk rock is for those whose attention span is too short for a King Crimson album. May I suggest listening to Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, who John Lydon worshipped when he was a lad? They are noisy, so Mommy will leave the room, and are talented enough that you wouln't feel stupid for listening to them when you're out of middle school. Trout Mask Replica is a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish!!! A one star stinker!!!","review":"Put some make-up on, mess-up your hair, bite your lower lip, and play like crap...that's the formula used by the Sex Pistols on this, the most pathetic testament to noise pollution since \\"Dr. Zaius Sings The Monkees.\\" The problem with punk rock in general is that it's soooo phony, and there's nothing denying that here. The anger is forced, the music boring, and the message is a cliche wrapped in a Bazooka Joe comic. If you're a mall chick who just got cut from the pom-pom team, this album might make you feel better. But, if you appreciate true music from the heart, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do you people bother?","review":"Someting tells me that the Pistols, the Ramones, the loathsome Green Day, and the rest of the genre could have achieved as much musically if they had been playing car horns and trash cans as opposed to musical instruments. Do you self-deluded \\"rebels\\" really think that punk was about liberation and freedom? It was about finding a new way of separating a bunch of gullible, immature fools from their money. Mission accomplished.\\"Pogo On Dudes!\\" Duh."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate the Sex Pistols","review":"The Sex Pistols are a horrible excuse for a British 1st wave punk band. If you want the real deal, get the Clash's first album, early the Damned, The Boys, Slaughter and the Dogs, or Eddie and the Hotrods. If you want something harder, try the slightly later offerings from Sham 69, The Business, GBH, or The Exploited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated. Poorly written.","review":"Seriously. I was bored through most of this album. There were only two songs on here that I liked, and those were 'Holidays in the Sun' and 'Seventeen', and they themselves get annoying after a while.

I bought this remastered version at the store the other day for almost twice the price of the un-remastered version, excepting better sound (and it also had nicer packaging). Boy, was I wrong. The remastering renders the album with almost no bass whatsoever. Really, I almost can't hear the bass guitar at all, except maybe on Submission, but it's still way too soft and flat even on that song. With no bass to hold the sound together, the guitars and drums end up sounding like noise coming from a cheap radio.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the music itself, but I'm thinking about returning this version for the earlier and cheaper Virgin CD, which I've heard is supposed to sound much more like the original LP. Some people may really like this remastered version (like the reviewers who gave it more stars) and that's great, but for me, it just doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"When Guns 'n' Roses (an over-rated band) first were touted as the best thing going, their lead guitarist Slash was asked if he was surprised at the praise they were receiving, and he said, \\"Nah.

What were the kids supposed to do? Spend their entire dole money to see some washed up rock band perform a tired old stadium show? I think not. You might argue about when, where and how punk rock began, but for many British kids it began right here. NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS HERE'S THE SEX PISTOLS encapsulated the fed-up, rebellious, gob-in-your-face mood of the times with a collection of songs intended to antagonize parents, diss the Royal Family and promote anarchy in the UK (unless you were a \\"lazy sod\\" who thought that would be too much effort). With a message that still resonates today, The Pistols summed up the DIY aesthetic of punk rock in a world where the established pillars of society were collapsing all around. \\"The problem is you. What you gonna do?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"*The* punkrock album","review":"Never Mind the Bollocks is the complete antithesis to Sgt.Pepper. And thats the point. No other punk album defined so clearly the attitude and paradigm of the punk's rejection of the failed counter-culture revolution then Bollocks. Though other bands covered more ground musically and socially over time than the Sex Pistols, none captured the frustrated and radical spirit of the era more precisely. When I first heard Bollocks all I heard was a wall of noise. But wantonly the pattern emerges from the chaos and a masterful portrait of mutation in underground culture is heard. No musical library is complete without this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically important but...","review":"...musically worthless.

Sure the songs are catchy and a talked a big game, but did you know that the band didn't write them? Did you know that the album was recorded by studio musicians? Did you ever sit and think what it really means to be an assembled band? You'll find all of that to be true after doing a bit of research. I mean come on, what kind of real band has a bass player that LITERALLY COULD NOT PLAY! Sid Vicious was hand picked out of the local punk rock scene to fit the bands image.

Good; but like all revolutions did it replace the establishment with a better alternative. Perhaps; a lot of very talented groups and individuals sprung out of what the Sex Pistols did. But a good album? I don't think so. Characterised by very simple guitar chords and a singer with no vocal range but an ability to howl into a microphone in an aggressive manner, the Sex Pistols represented an anti progressive movement. And they did pretty kill off this movement, for better or worse. But whilst, say, Yes, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, etc., were the antichrists as far as the sex pistols went, musical ability was replaced by no musical ability. I listened to this album as little as five years after it came out. It sounded just as it was meant to; a bunch of talentless musicians with a raw sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't stand the hyperbole...","review":"I first heard this about 20 years ago, and I immediately recognized it as contrived and lame.

It's that simple. When Bollocks came out, it ignited a movement and became THE standard to which all other punk rock records were held. The Pistols are the trunk of the punk rock tree. Everything else is just a branch: Nirvana, Green Day, The Clash, Gang of Four, Buzzcocks, Dead Kennedys, everything. If you like music with attitude, this is your record. Bollocks is protest music in a league with anything by Bob Dylan or Public Enemy.

During the mid Seventies in England, life was bleak, the Pistols said \\"get off your arse and do it for yourself\\" and F to the establishment. This is what the music on this album is about. And to say Steve jones cannot play the guitar, try playing the songs and then tell me that.Society today is going the way it was in 1970's and music is crap, so lets see if Green Day can be real PUNK's and change society as the Pistols did.

Some didnt. And those who did make it had a certain something that kept them going.Now a word about Busted: Busted was a band that only released ONE song. Better yet, it was in the UK. Still, they toured America, where no one had ever heard of them, made loads of money, had their own TV show called \\"America or Busted\\", were featured in magazines as the \\"hot new thing\\", and then broke up less than 4 months later.I realize times have changed.

Only \\"Thieves in the Temple,\\" \\"The Question of U\\" and Tevin Campbell's \\"Round and Round\\" are worthy of your time. A definite low point in the Prince discography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rent the movie","review":"What better way to preview the cd than to rent the movie. As well thought and planned as Prince's albums usually are, you can believe there is correlation to the movie, so you'll have the background. Some tracks are meant to be lesser tracks. The best songs on this album are the title track, We Can Funk (feat George Clinton), and Melody Cool (with the powerful vocals of Mavis Staples). With George Clinton and the Prince together this is definitely the funkiest song in all of Prince's career I'd say. The Time also has 3 songs on this one which mainly are there for fun. Love Machine is sexy and inspiring in it's simplicity with a hook that sounds like a blonde joke. Also is Tevin Campbell's hit Round and Round. If you like Tevin's debut cd, keep in mind that most of it was written by Prince apparently at this time. Joy in Repetition is a fabulous sexy ballad (a requisite on every album it seems), and Graffit Brigde is an uplifting \\"feel-good\\" fave."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little biased?","review":"When this CD came out I was in love with Prince...no one could touch him. I thought this was going to go down in history. I even went to see the movie twice (singing along with every song)and watched it nearly everyday when we got it on tape. Ok, when I was 8 I was a little delusional. However, I look back at this CD and considering the time it was released, it was still decent. The guest spots can be skipped as well as the title track but as always he leaves us with a few signature songs. \\"The Question of You\\", \\"Joy in Repetition\\" and \\"Thieves in the Temple\\" are the best. If you were willing to venture into the world of singles, perhaps you heard the original \\"Get Off\\" and \\"Loveleft, Loveright\\" on the maxi for \\"New Power Generation\\"-- fine reminders that the man didn't lose his touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT IS THE BOMB BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I THINK THAT ALL OF HIS MUSIC IS THE BOMB AND THE GREATTIEST THAT I EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.I HOPE THAT HE DO MORE AND THAT HE HAVE ALL THE SUPPORT;OF HIS LOVING FANS AND HIS WIFE.PLUS HE HAVE MY TOP #1 SUPPORT AND BEST WISHES FROM ME AND GOD ABOVE TO DO SO.MY MOST FAVORITE SONG OFF OF GRAFFITI BRIDGE WAS \\"STILL WOULD STAND ALL TIME\\" AND NO ONE CAN TELL ME ANY DIFFRENT OFF OF THE CD.PEOPLE YOUR BEST BET IS IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CD IS TO GO OUT AND GET IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince's Magical Mystery Tour: Great Soundtrack, Bad Movie","review":"Ok, so the film stunk. That said, the soundtrack ranks as one of the top two Prince albums of the 90s (the other being the Gold Experience). This album contains two hit singles: \\"Thieves in the Temple\\" (arguably Prince's best single of the decade) and \\"Round and Round\\" (a song written and produced by Prince, but performed by Tevin Campbell). It also features four lesser-known tracks that rank with the best pop produced in the 90s. \\"Release It,\\" performed by the Time, is the album's hottest jam. The little known trio of \\"Question of U,\\" \\"Still Would Stand Time\\" and \\"Joy In Repetition\\" belong among the greatest songs of Prince's career. \\"We Can Funk,\\" a randy duet with George Clinton, is also a highlight.And the best thing about the album is that you can obtain it very cheaply (see all the used copies available for sale). For under five dollars used, Graffiti Bridge is unlikely to leave listeners unsatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRAFFITI BRIGE (SDTK) IS THE BEST MAN.","review":"I TRULY LOVE THIS (SDTK)FOR REAL THOUGH.EXSPECAILLY #15.STILL WOULD STAND ALL TIME-(WITH THE STEELES) THAT IS MY MAIN FAVORITE RIGHT THERE.#14.MELODY COOL-MAVIS STAPLES AND THE STEELES,#11.SHAKE!-THE TIME,ARE THE OTHER TWO THAT ARE MY FAVORITE AS WELL.#10.TICK,TICK,BANG,#9.LOVE MACHINE-THE TIME,#7.WE CAN FUNK-(WITH GOERGE CLINTON);#4.THE QUESTION OF YOU,#3.RELEASE IT-THE TIME,AND #1.CAN'T STOP THIS FEELING I GOT;ARE THE OTHER SONGS THAT ARE MY FAVORITE TOO.BUT THE MAIN ONE IS #15.STILLWOULD STAND ALL TIME(WITH PRINCE AND THE THE STEELES.)THAT SONG GOT IT GOING ON FOR REAL.WELL I GUESS TO ME IT DOES IF SOME ONE THAT GOT THE RECORD OR GOING TO BUY IT YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO THAT SONGS AND THE ONES THAT I LISTED AS MY FAVORITES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint over this \\"Graffiti\\"","review":"The title track sounds like a theme to a sitcom, and the rest isn't much better. Not even cameos from George Clinton, The Time, and Mavis Staples can compensate for the lack of a single decent melody. It's pointless to discuss individual tracks because they mostly sound the same. If you want a musical token from this movie, I highly recommend \\"Pandemonium\\" by The Time. There's more fun in its first 5 minutes than in the entire \\"Graffiti Bridge\\" album."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh, no","review":"I can say this 'cuz I was a Prince fan when Prince wasn't cool.

I would say that it is more quantity and slightly less quality than Purple Rain, but it is a good album nevertheless. I also own the movie. I highly recommend that too. It's really corny, but it has a good storyline. I don't understand why it's not a classic or something yet. It's sort of like a dirty Mary Poppins, but that's a rough telling of it. Watch it.

Contrived dialogue, character development that evaporates, and a non-ending all contribute to an average story and a poor mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of one-note stereotypes","review":"I found nothing suspenseful or entertaining about this book.

This is the first and last book I plan to read by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"AS had been written before, the book kind of sucked me in at first but turned into a total dud. The end was a big disappointment. There was lack of plot development, lack of character development, and most of it was just unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good story,but poorly written.","review":"Let me preface my review by saying that I read the whole book and was really interested to see how it ended. However, I was annoyed the entire time I read this book. Jess, the main character, is a pyschologist? She is a nuerotic mess who is bullied by everyone in her life, including her three rotton children. Her teenage daughter tells her that her brother molested her, and she just brushes it off as normal behavior? I could go on and on.Some plot points were so ridiculous I couldn't believe they were on paper. Deloros gets caught giving false testimony to a detective and then physically attacks him THREE timesand he sends her on her way.The same veteran detective lets a rent-a-cop security guard put a gun to his head and threaten to kill him and also sends him on his way. terrible dialogue.This is the 1st and last book i will read by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Vu!","review":"I am halfway through reading this book and am stunned at the similarities between it and Rosellen Brown's \\"Before and After\\", which was made into a movie starring Meryl Streep, Liam Neeson, and Edward Furlong. In Brown's book, a New England couple are stunned when their teenage son is suspected of murdering a neighborhood girl. The mother is a doctor; the father is more of a house husband, and they have a preadolescent daughter, too....the same cast of characters as in \\"After the Fall\\"! The simliarities don't end there....as the couple struggle to cope with the accusations, they are faced with neighborhood gossip, harassing phone calls and a lot of unanswered questions from their uncooperative son. I feel as though I am reading the SAME EXACT book for the second time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too trite","review":"I kept waiting for this book to get better. It's not hard to put it down, but very difficult to pick back up. Her characters are all out of an overblown soap opera. You can guess exactly what's going to happen with the first few chapters. Absolutely no surprises here! Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing book","review":"I made the mistake of reading \\"After the Fall\\" after Tami Hoag's Ashes to Ashes. It seemed like cinderella in comparison. The plot and the character development in this book was very shallow and stereotypical, as was the entire police investigation (the Stamford PD looked like a bunch of fools). I found it hard to believe anyway that the crime committed would get so much media/police attention. After all, there was no murder or mysterious circumstances etc..... This book had potential, as evidenced by the many sub-plots the author started to develop. However, thats as far as the author went. As soon as the story started to get interesting (what most readers would regard as \\"page turner\\" material), the author went back to the hum drum story line of 90% of the book. This book was more about character's thoughts than development. I got through this book by reading mostly only the conversational parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money or Time","review":"This book was ridiculous. A scary mentally-ill patient threatens to destroy her psychologist's comfortable life, and sure enough it starts unraveling. However, the patient has nothing to do with it, there's no resolution of various subplots, and all in all it was a disappointing read. I wouldn't buy another book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book, Bad Ending","review":"My sister let me borrow this book. It was very good and suspensful and kept me reading for hours at a time. The way the book was setup for more then one person's story at a time was great. But I didn't like the ending, it wasn't what it should have been and one of the characters did not get what they deserved. I do reccommend this book though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book starts out so well... but the ending was terrible!","review":"The book had tons of suspense and I couldn't wait to finish it, but I was terribly disappointed with the ending! It seemed like the author decided the book was long enough and finished writing in about 20 pages. I do not recommend reading After the Fall; it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dud!","review":"I turned the book over and over searching for the final chapter. Did the author just get tired and quit? Where's the ending? Author Judith Kelman leaves at least one major clue unresolved (Ryan's whispered cryptic statement), and frustratingly provides no resolution to some of the book's major plot twists. It's a cruel blow to the reader to simply abandon Lisa to her father without attempting some closure and justice. I forced myself through the amateurish prose and the predictable plot hoping for some sense of unity toward the end, only to throw the book down in disgust. Someone take this woman's laptop away from her before she writes another book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bust","review":"Ms. Kelman's books are always attention grabbers and wonderfuly, weirdly crafted thrillers. However, this one fell short of the mark. This may sound odd, but I did not like the ending. I was hoping Danny would be proven guilty because that would have been a deviation from a predictable cliche. I hoped he would be held accountable when his sister said he had touched her inappropriately when she was little. I was highly disappointed he turned out to be mostly innocent of the charge. The girl's father was the real culprit and I'm sorry he wasn't punished to the fullest extent of the law and then some. I loved Dr. Chow. He provided a medicolegal voice that lent credence to parts of the story. He was the only one I liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, I hardly ever watch it.","review":"For Baryshnikov fans, this particular ballet does not showcase Misha's virtuostic gifts. Roland Petit's choreography is over-the-top throughout the ballet. In some of the dance sequences, the corps de ballet speaks (in French, of course). This makes a serious story come off silly which was probably not Petit's intent. For such a natural dancer as Baryshnikov, he looks somewhat uncomfortable in the choreography although the role of Don Jose fits him quite well. Zizi Jeanmarie does not make a convincing Carmen at her age and the chemistry between Baryshnikov and Jeanmarie is lacking. For Baryshnikov fans, \\"Don Quixote\\" or \\"Baryshnikov Dances Sinatra\\" will more likely please you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carmen Fails","review":"Any resemblance between this production and Bizet's opera is purely accidental and not intentional. Baryshnikov, as always, is fantastic but Zizi Jeanmarie is a smiling flirty chick who just can't carry off the character. In addition, the story is not conveyed as essential elements of the story are conspicuously absent to anyone who has seen the opera. All in all, I which I had never spent my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea, but poorly executed","review":"I think that Bizet's music has great potential as dance music and the story of Carmen has great potential as a ballet. With all this potential, however, the result was rather pathetic. I found it boring and unappealing. There were some sections were the dancing was impressive, but none where it was beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of little interest...","review":"While any ballet featuring Mikhail might be reason enough to watch it, this work might be the exception. Very little of the choreography is appealing and the sets are very bland. This is the drabest Spain I've seen pictured in a good while. Mikhail acquits himself nicely, but sadly Zizi does not. While perhaps an expressive and talented dancer in her heyday, here she appears to be afraid of injury and never really stretches herself. You can see the concentration on her face as she prepares for simple back attitudes. She has an adequate port-de-bras, but her shoulders, so pivotal to Spanish dance, barely twitch when they should shimmy. Carmen was a vivacious gypsy, but Zizi gives us a merely brittle, hesitant gamine with a toothy smile. She is acting like hell, but it is not enough to cover her flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop global warming with a couple of iron freighters","review":"Did you know that we could end 17% of the excess carbon dioxide that we generate every year to the bottom of the ocean? And do it by fertilizing the plankton with iron spread from a freighter? And that this has actually been tested by marine scientists? If not, read The Restless Sea and learn this plus dozens of other fun facts to know and tell. Kunzig is a kind writer. If a scientist has no personality, he writes about the science. If a scientist happens to be a truly warped human being, we get a paragraph or two about the warpage before Kunzig dives back into the science. If you hate James Gleick's endlessly tedious books (e.g., Chaos), you'll be refreshed by Kunzig's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Restless Sea","review":"Although written by a talented journalist rather than an oceanographer (probably a reading plus anyway), it proficiently introduces the reader to recent discoveries in oceanography and to the personalities responsible for the research. Most texts on the field are somewhat more pedantic. Mr. Kunzig's approach is one of personalizing the subject by introducing the reader to the people behind the it. He gives the reader a greater feeling for the excitement and enthusiasm that such individuals bring to their field of study. I would recommend it to anyone with at least some knowledge of oceanography who is interested in knowing more of the individuals who have contributed to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastically informative","review":"This novel is extremely well written and organized that it so allows the reader to absorb the tremendous amount of dazzling information being explored, yet not feeling overwhelmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for Garden Hose","review":"The tube which is inserted into the end of the hose fit so loosely in my 3/4\\" Gilmour hose that no amount of crimping would make a leak free seal.

Not enough support for the low back and no variations on moves. I felt like I had wasted the last 20 min or so of the workout doing useless moves for my core.I do like the emphasis on posture and form, however, as this is where many barre workouts are lacking.

It's not a big deal for me since all my tools stay in a stationary box, but for someone who moves around a lot for work this could be a pain.

The chronology is filled with pictures -- many rarely printed and of some interest -- and generally useless sidebars that only barely scratch the surface of their topics.

But it was a pleasant change to read Southern fiction with mostly likable characters, and the story itself held my attention.

The robot has a simple interface and uses Basic as the programming language. It also has a pose mode where the program can be written by posing the robot and then taking a snap shot to automatically \\"write\\" the code. It teaches basic programming, servo theory, and human motion dynamics (walking, running, dancing, flipping, balance, etc). I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it has no sensor accessories for feed back available at this time. It will challenge a preteen (my twelve year old assembled and programmed it and its running and back flipping around the house).

Can you tell me how I can get it, or why it was not published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"The only reason to get hold of this book (preferably from a library) is because it's one of the weirdest cookbooks around. Apart from the fact it's supposed to be largely vegetarian and yet has chicken and pork recipes, it also has Maggi sauces and various non-Asian items. Some of the recipes are surprisingly unappealing; others look like they are the ingredients for the lowest-quality Asian packet junk food. How this book got into press is beyond me.

The title of this cookbook is very misleading. There are at least 2 recipes that contain chicken in the book and the last time I checked, chicken was not a vegetable or tofu or a type of seafood. Look on pages 185 and 205 for the chicken recipes. I was very disappointed when I saw this. And practically every type of seafood that man eats is in so many of the recipes that real vegetarians will want to stay far away from this book unless they're willing to spend the time it takes to convert every recipe to true vegetarian status."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remembering the Birth of a Classic","review":"Still to this day, when people say something about Scarface, I always ask them which one; Brian De Palma or Paul Muni. Gets 'em every time. But still both classic films 'til this day. Starting the attitude of having the biggest ego of all the hustlers and wanting the trophy wife who doesn't lift a finger when you want a home cooked meal. Criminals don't know anything. But, all jokes aside, when ever I watch Scarface it's if I'm seeing it for the first time. \\"LOOK OUT, JOHNNY, I'M GONNA SPIT!\\" The showdowns were epic and very graphic in an implicated and visual detailed point of view.

It is the same version that came out a few years ago in that SCARFACE box set (exclusive). At least it is out for the people who did\`nt want to pay that high price. I did\`nt get that then, and I\`m not getting this now, since I\`ve had this on VHS for a number of years now. I\`ll wait for the special edition, or the collectors edition, or the anniversary edition, or the extended edition, or the directors cut edition. PS.

I wish there were more extras, but I am satisfied with what is there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Forget Brian DePalma's bloated, overwrought, ill conceived blood-fest, Howard Hawks' original gangster picture is a brilliant and comic symphony of Capone-style gangsterism. The violence is real and Paul Muni is excellent as the swarthy hood in 1920's Chicago. There is as much comedy here as a Marx brothers film, so don't take Hawks' political posturings too seriously. Unlike the genre today, there is little attempt to connect the elements of crime with \\"deep\\" \\"psychic\\" or \\"nationalist\\" causes. Munni simply responds to his violent and macabre environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the 30's gangster movies.","review":"Although there were many movies similar to this one made in the 30's and 40's, I feel that this one stands out for it's realism and spark.

It's badly acted, with inept direction from Howard Hawks, and features a musical score more fit for a comedy. That so-called \\"car chase\\" is laughably choreographed.

It has been described as everything from a brilliant metaphorical adaptation of German idealism, to Calvinism, to a thinly disguised autobiography of the Professor himself.

Also tells you what knocks, rattles and all kinds of other noices can be in each part of a cars system. Shows you what the inputs are to the computer and what the outputs are.

The stories themselves are surprisingly short, often only a few pages. The comedy is of the heartwarming Andy Griffith Show school of humour: all Opie, Aunt Bee and Barney Fife with Canadian accents and island problems. Generally, the plots focus on the various misunderstandings between characters with a rose-coloured tinge. Island idyllism through and through.

The depth gage changes so slow, you can go from 100' to 1' and be agroundand it will still be at 100'. If you fish in three feet of water for ten minutes and than move out to four feet, you actually have to shut the unit off and turn it back on for it to change depths.

My Hummingbird still operates properly when the Garmin had given up the ghost. It also does very poorly in heavy weeds and cannot manage any cavitation at speed where it renders massive quantities of noise artifact. Also, it is very slow to restore a usable screen image when mounted on the bow trolling motor and put back in the water at a new fishing spot. It is not useless but I think that I selected a subpar performer for a demanding job. If you planned to use this for saltwater fishing it might be completely adequate however it will not show a thermocline or even consistent bottom composition rendering. I suspect that the fish ID is useless as well so that might be better off disabled.

But, I don't necessarily want them blended together. This DVD is really good but I just didn't feel as if there was enough comedy and too much singing. I personally would have preferred if there was more comedy. It's a good and funny DVD and I definitely enjoyed it. If you are only a fan of Mark's singing or comedy, but not both, then I don't think you will enjoy this DVD as much (although you can fast forward through the parts you don't like). However, if you like everything about him, then you will love this DVD. I would definitely recommend it, especially for family viewing because it is good, clean and uplifting fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Lowry goes Hollywood","review":"I thought it was very good. Mark does a great job of keeping the show moving along and delivers a powerful message as well. Lordsong is not my favorite christian group but they did a credible job. The Issacs were great. I would recommend this DVD highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"So you think you're a tough guy huh?!","review":"This is a wonderful story about a pirate who's rough and tough on the outside, but has a soft side too. Death is treated matter-of-factly with no philosophical overtones (you fill in the blanks when they ask, \\"why did the parrot die\\", or \\"what happened when the parrot died?\\") and children identify with Boris about their self-concepts and reactions to conflict and fears in their life. In the end, Boris teaches children that it's okay to be a nice guy and still be tough, and that it's okay to be sad and cry sometimes. I recommend this book to children over the age of 4 (mainly because of the slightly scary pirate scenes involving angry faces, swords and scuffling-nothing gorry)- all the way through adulthood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Grieving Little Pirates","review":"My mom found this book for my three year old \\"tough pirate\\" daughter and gave it to her in preparation for the death of her little brother. It was such good medicine! She asked to have it read to her many times a day for months - and we still read it almost daily. This book was so much better for her than books that attempt to help children understand death and deal with the subject more directly, and it didn't insult the intelligence and insight that she and all young children have. It allowed her to enjoy a great story - in words and pictures - and process the meaning in her own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Just A Book About A Pirate","review":"All of the other reviews focus on this book describing a pirate who has feelings besides just being tough. But this book is MUCH more! It lets children know that death/saddness happens to everyone and it is ok to be sad and cry about it, that crying is a good way to express yourself. It is a good book to prep children for the inevitable things that happen in life...it should be read often...before something inevitable happens. I read this book often in my preschool class and found that the girls enjoyed the story just as much as the boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, short book about grief","review":"This book is simple enough for two-year-olds, but complex enough for much older children, or even adults.The trick is that the words (only a sentence or so per page, and mostly of the format \\"Boris was ADJECTIVE. All pirates are ADJECTIVE\\") only barely sketch out the story - the rest is in the illustrations, or else has to be guessed at.At the end of the book, we find that when Boris' parrot died \\"He cried and cried. All pirates cry. And so do I\\", a line that echoes in the mind.Don't pass this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book For All Ages","review":"I fell in love with this story instantly. I've never seen empathy being presented so well. Plus the pictures tell their own story of adventure, death, friendship and woe. It's a simple book with few words for young readers, but the message is well delivered and I personally think it's a book that can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, candid, and penetrating","review":"Without hesitation, this is a top five novel on my list. Keen insights on the illusions and fallacies often associated with missions. I would place this on a must read for anyone considering missions. But more than for missionaries, this book touches on the central natural tenant of the human heart---idolatry. Man is so prone to make idols out of anything---even good things.Elisabeth Elliot is a fantastic writer. This book, though fiction, has imagery and instances that paralleled her own life as a missionary. So many have a very romantic picture of missions. This book focuses the lens upon reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth climbing","review":"With it's combination of punk and soul, grunge and R&B, new and old, and yes, even good and evil, the Whigs have created a sound that defies catigories and takes the listener to a place they might not have known they wanted to go, but will return to often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just to clear things up","review":"Well, this is a brilliant EP, with two really good covers. I recommend this cd to any whigs fan, but as Radiohead fan as well, i feel i should say: it is not Creep by Radiohead. It is Creep by TLC, which is quite different. I doubt a true Whigs fan would be really dissapointed, cause the song rocks either way, but just to prevent misleads."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comment on Your Review","review":"Your reviewer, Mr. Bill Holdship, should be a bit more careful with his research. He claims the CD adds 3 tracks to the 10 on the original vinyl album. I've had this album on vinyl since it was first released, and it has always had 13 tracks. They are 13 magnificent tracks. WB could have added 3, 5 or 10 more from the many wonderful recordings made by PP&M over the years. Unfortunately, WB did not do what Mr. Holdship gave them credit for. Oh well, the CD is still a great recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"peter paul and mary are very talented","review":"This group is very inspiring to me along with other music as well.

Leave the CD on a jet plane, and download all these songs in stereo from Kaza."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some songs are not the origninal that appeared on the 1970 album","review":"Yes, the cd cover looks the same. However, some of the songs are not the orignial versions that first appeared on \\"10 Years\\" album back in the very early '70's. One very good example is \\"Day Is Done.\\" Here they clearly used a different and updated version of this song. (Some things just shouldn't be messed with and this is one of them.)With the version that appeared on the original album is much more intense when they sing and there is not a child singing in the back ground. So as you listen to this cd version the first time, you may think to yourself that this is not the way you remembered exactly how that song went, you're right. It's an updated version that they have re-recorded later on. Still a great CD. Rated 2 stars because some versions are not the versions that first appeared on the original LP release when this came out on LP in 1970."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of Peter Paul ad mary","review":"Love Peter Paul and Mary the Item was shipped fast and the Item was a great price I play it all the time"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll LOVE This one!","review":"If you're a PP&M fan, like we are, this album is the greatest!

The sound is excellent and the choice of songs is a fine representation of the folk-rock tradition.One comment however, the CD has the same number of songs as the original vinyl issue. There is nothing new here: 13 tracks then, 13 tracks now. The only thing I can think of is that in later vinyl issues, the producers actually REMOVED several of the songs. Record labels did this with the re-issues of Don McLean's American Pie album (where Sister Fatima was omitted from later album versions, then magically added as a CD bonus track when it came out in that format)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic of American Folk Music","review":"I still have this on vinyl, but just never bother with the stereo anymore. I pounced on the CD and popped it into my player, so once again I can relive the sound that meant so much to me in my college days. It's still a mellow blending of voices and a great selection of songs.You get your classic folk tunes (Blowin' in the Wind and If I Had a Hammer), plus 60s songs like Too Much of Nothing and I Dig Rock and Roll Music.

I have seen him in other movies but this one showed a side of his acting ability that I had never seen before. The movie is believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?!!!","review":"If you purchase this movie, this is the feeling/question you'll be left with. While Elba is convincing as a man who's mind devolves into delusion, the storyline is nearly non-existent, patchwork. Mental disorder is hard enough to capture as entertainment. It's even more difficult to present a story from only the perspective of a warped mind's concoctions. The film needed at least one other character's viewpoint to give the audience validation (or not) of the main character's perceptions. Unfortunately, this didn't happen, leaving the audience hostage to the constant question of reality or fantasy. All characters introduced, with the exception of two, were products of the main character's mind. While one was a peripheral character that was on screen for about 5 mins, the other was served as the story's villain. He is only glimpsed through the eyes of the sick character. The end is designed to make you think, but it doesn't go far enough (especially without at least one additional vantage)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for psychological-thriller fans!","review":"I was extremely impressed with this film! Not only is Idris' performance awesome, but all the characters give great performances. Don't be fooled by the \\"terrorist\\" theme on the poster - this is a definite must see for psychological-thriller fans.

It seems they used a translation tool without human edition. So the text is awkward to read.Secondly, there're not much technical knowledge, nor much business knowledge being demonstrated in this book. It's very elementary. The whole book can summarized in a couple of pages, and one won't miss much from several hundreds pages of bad English."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Story","review":"Few stories, much less story series, can be remembered as vividly over the years as can the Danny Dunn books - a tribute to the authors and their product. In this story Danny and the usual cast (less Irene, who no doubt was absent due to morality standards of the day) are inadvertently launched into space through the an accident with the wondrous anti-gravity paint. Despite the initial mishap, all seems to be going well until the spacefarers discover that they cannot activate the switch that will return them to Earth! Once again Danny must rise to the occasion and save the day before it is too late.As with all the Danny Dunn books, readers are painlessly introduced to science concepts while reading an absorbing tale.

The Hebrew font is not the best, however very good. on a 1-10, I'd say a 9. This is not coined to Strong's. Which means it would only be helpful to a serious Bible student, with at least a knowledge of the Heberew alphabet. For those, the Strong's just gets in the way anyhow. The front of the book has an extensive section explaining in detail, the different aspect of Hebrew grammar. An excellent refresher, or foundation to anyone studying Biblical Hebrew. Each word listing also has the three letter root word listed on the reverse side of the page. Very convenient. It is a very beautifully bound book, very affordable, and very informative. Definately a great buy. I am a Hebrew student attempting to master the Scriptures, and I need to look no further for an excellent Hebrew lexicon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"Very useful.

Her God-given ability to remain calm in the most stressful of situations no doubt saved her life. Panic would have only accelerated an already dangerous predicament.Though it might not work in every case, Ashley was just what Brian Nichols needed to show him what he was. Not only that, the same was true in reverse. Thankfully, they were both willing to respond. I am a firm believer that God knows who He can trust in certain situations to achieve His purpose.

I listen to audio books on my long drives and I almost immediately stopped listening as the author's voice was grating. I only kept listening because I was curious as to the whole story. Instead this was a very repetitive narrative, mostly of her life before the incident. The professionals involved in this production should have a) convinced her to let a professional reader narrate the book and b) should have done their job of editing. Like other reviewers I was more interested in the story behind Brian Nichols. Instead we got her version only and very little of it was of the actual incident, she must have mentioned her husbands death years before at least 12 times.

I'm not judging, but I do have an opinion: Every story has three sides; this was Ashley's. We haven't really heard Brian's, and then . . .there's the truth. The story was probably great therapy for Ashley, but I think this is her version. I read it; it was ok, but I'm convinced that Ashley and Brian knew each other and a lot more happened in that apartment than what she wrote in the book. I wish the best for her and Paige . .. and Brian. He's guilty of killing three people, but there are probably some other folks out here who should feel some guilt for what happened.

If we had read between the lines just a tiny bit, we would have known she was not an angel, so that's not what I was looking for. I was looking for bravery and inspiration.

They were $2.00 a pack cheaper than the other ones I usually purchase on Amazon, and boy, the \\"cheap comes out expensive.\\" Our printed labels absolutely would not stick to these and practically fell off and had to be taped on to keep them from being removed just by touching the label. The material is \\"shiny\\" compared to the matte finish you usually find on these bags, which I suspect is the reason the labels won't stick.

Nothing is a bargain if it is unusable!First and foremost, I see no way to securely address these envelopes. I tried ink and marker. Both simply WIPE OFF! The surface is slicker than a ziplock bag with no opaque surface on which to write the return and ship to addresses. That is an essential feature for any mailer. Without the ability to address an envelope, it is useless at any price!I considered using address labels but there are enough negative reviews from those who have already tried and failed at getting labels to stick. Who wants to risk a package being returned or worse, wind up in a \\"dead mail\\" bin because the address became detached or illegible during shipping?Secondly, these bags are GRAY not white as advertised. That fact is not a big deal for me but the description is incorrect. Either way, these go back to the shipper and I will go back to the pricier but reliable Tyvek envelopes.Disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slick for labels","review":"These envelopes are significantly slicker and thinner than the envelopes that I was previously sent from this listing. I'm forced to assume that the supplier has moved to cheaper materials. I wouldn't care, except they're so slick that they won't hold shipping labels. I've already lost the cost of the damn envelopes in wasted postage as things come back to me with the address label ripped off. I don't address these things daintily, I cover the entire label with packing tape and the postal machines still tear them off of these envelopes about 20% of the time.

When removing the strip that covers the sticky adhesive, the entire closing flap rips off! I had to use packaging tape to seal the mailer. Not only that, I needed to use 2 bags just to make sure my product would be protected. I ordered these because they are waterproof, but that doesn't mean a thing if the bag is so thin that a finger poke puts a hole in the bag. I would not recommend these.

The mailer bags seemed flimsy when I opened the package, and the bag barely holds one shirt. Concerned about how flimsy they seemed, I slid into the bag a light-weight cardboard backing. The cardboard poked holes in the bag material. After seeing the holes, I tried pressing my fingernail through the bag and it went right through. I can't imagine what would have happened to the shirt as it went through post office machinery if I'd tried mailing it in one of these bags! It could have easily snagged and torn open. The only reason I haven't returned them is it isn't worth the postage to return them -- it would be throwing good money after bad. Also, the only reason I gave it one star is you that Amazon won't let you give a product ZERO stars, because ZERO is what I would have selected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"These bags are the right size and the perfect thickness to mail clothes, which is what I use them.

They are ok for lightweight paperbacks, but college textbooks should never be sent in these mailers even with extra taping. Totally useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for a dime a piece.","review":"These will fit books, action figures, smaller size t-shirts, etc. They will stretch a tiny bit to add packing materials like Styrofoam.I shipped a Starting Lineup figure today and it just fit, then it stretched enough to add a little foam on both sides. Boxes offer more protection but the boxes lay piled up around my house and the envelopes take up much less space. I will buy larger sizes, too.I was impressed by how sticky the tape is that closes the envelope. It is strong enough that I don't have to add additional tape because it seems secure enough as it is.The main reason I save boxes is because they're recyclable and reusable.

What was done to this album during the remix should have been a crime. It's tinny, hollow and void of any bass. The vocals are unbalanced and completely change the original tone of the album. I grew up cranking this album during hot summer nights and partying to this with the intensity it offered.

Not that I dislike the others, of course.About the drum sound, I don't remember how the vinyl sounded but I guess people are right when bashing it here.

Remixed it in the 80's... for heaven knows what reason.Get the original version in a secondhand store, for this one truly sucks....

Why didn't they just go ahead and re-record the whole damn thing while they were at it since they're obviously ashamed of it's AWESOME orginal sound. What made early ZZ Top so great was the tight, compact sound. Find an original copy of this album so you can be outraged at well. Technology was kind enough to give ZZ Top an extention on their career lifespan, but they really pushed it too far when they wanted all their drums to sound like a drum machine on their ENTIRE back catalog. Anyway, it's such a shame because I really wanted to hear this album on CD in it's orginal form and instead I got a doctored up, soul-lacking piece of dung.

Alas, with Tres Hombres (in my opinion ZZ Top's finest album, and a rock classic to boot), the drums have been remixed with something similar totheir 80's offerings. (Which are fine by the way, but do not belong here) It has ruined the sound and overlooked some of the excellent musicianship on the original recordings. The same applies to the album \`Tejas' I would ignore this issue till Warner Bros decide to reissue early ZZ Top with respectful and decent remastering, such as that shown in the \`Chrome, Smoke and BBQ' boxset and \`Rancho Texicano' (Very Best Of), where Engineer and remastering expert Bob Ludwig has done a faithful and exceptional job. As for now, those with fond memories of ZZ Top on the vinyl versions, will be in for a nasty shock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute BUTCHERING of the original recording","review":"I Have tried in vain to find the original organicrecording of this classic on CD but end up dissappointedevery time.

These Texas dudes show a fine display of rock n roll and blues with as raw cool sound. The four FM radio standard tracks Beer Drinkers And Hell Raisers, La Grange, Waiting For The Bus, and Jesus Just Left Chicago are all on here. However, there are several hidden gems like the drivin' Move Me On Down The Line and the grafceful ballad Hot, Blue, and Righteous. Sheik is a another raunchy blues number with compelling guitar licks and raunchy Billy Gibbons vocals.I seem to like DeGuello a little bit more than this. However, Tres Hombres certainly rates as ZZ Top's second best recording excluding greatest hits packages. You will not be dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by a mastering error","review":"My 2-star rating isn't for the material: ZZ Top's seminal work merits 4-5 stars. Nor is it for the mix: the original mix as intended by the artist at the time of recording has indeed been restored. My gripe concerns the remastering. There's an error in \\"LaGrange\\" at 2:22: in the process of \\"cleaning up\\" the original master to create a master for CD, about 1/4 second or 1-2 beats of Frank Beard's fill has been deleted. Most may not notice it, but being a drummer and having the song committed to memory, this error sticks out like a sore thumb, and now makes me question the integrity rest of the material, with which (with the exception of Bus/Jesus) I and other most casual fans are probably not quite so familiar. Bottom line: If you're intent is to buy \\"LaGrange,\\" arguably the song that best defines ZZ Top, get \\"Best of ZZ Top\\" or a vinyl copy instead and you won't miss a beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sounding version of this classic release","review":"Steve Hoffman and Kevin Gray did a spectacular job on the mastering of this vinyl of ZZ Top's classic album, Tres Hombres.The drums and bass guitar sound as if your right there in front of the Dusty and Frank (Rube).

He is the biggest name in Christian comedy, and has been going for 25 years now (it says so on this album). He has always been a poster boy of hyperactivity, but I think that the age factor is starting to kick in, as well as the joining with the Gaither Vocal Band. This album demonstrates the decrease of comedy and the increase in mediocre music.I love Mark Lowry, and he is the only artist besides Newsboys on whom I will pay full price for an album. However, I like Mark Lowry for the comedy, not the music. If I wanted the music, I'd look somewhere else. He has a nice voice, but stick to what you know! The comedy on the album is decent, but there should be so much more! Oh well... maybe next time, Mark Lowry will realize that clean, Christian comedy is what we're looking for, since there's very little of it around.

This is a power packed performance with Van belting out the blues as never before. And the quieter songs are sung with pure emotion. For the newcomer to Van, you have alot of work to make up and this is a great start. For those that just have the Best of cd's (almost,not all, but almost all of his cd's are best of's!)check out 'It's too late to stop now' and then get 'Belfast'. Fans, you already have this...

A friend recomended this album to me for my collection of live albums, and I was not dissapointed when I listened to it in a used vinyl store. After taking it home and getting intimate with it, I was impressed with the excellent live acoustics on this record (other live albums tend to be frought with sonic imperfections - The Mothers at Fillmore East, and Live at Leeds are some obvious examples). In fact, There are no overdubs on this record at all. Everything that happened onstage is on this record, and it all sounds good,(including minor musical mistakes, the drummer dropping a stick, and Van himself tapping the side of his mic in places!)

When they do finally come out (and they will), they will be issued first on LP to really gouge the fools and then on CD with some \\"live bonus tracks\\" that really suck, just like they did with \\"Tres Hombres\\". Too bad, because I used to be a HUGE fan back in the seventies.

And I think this is the best Album ZZ top ever made. Here is my take. If you see it for a good price, go for it. Maybe there are different versions made. My CD recording is just fine.

Although some songs might confuse non-christians listeners who don't know that most songs are about God and not some girl.

Their first few Cds were an effort to explore the boundrys of christian punk. Most of them were meant to be listened to by 13 year old girls. They were catchy, yet very unimpressive. Mmmhmm changes this. It is more geared to anyone who will listen. Their topics are a bit more refined and realistic, and their lyrics have advanced. Musically, they have always been catchy, and this is no different. However, i do believe this effort is also more musically refined as well. Overall, Relient K is growing as a band, and this is by far their best album so far. A good purchase for anyone who wants simply a great listen, and meaningful lyrics if looked into more. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I found this on here for just $5 dollars, so I downloaded as it is one I had kinda been wanting for awhile. It did not disappoint.

Their guitarist knows a total of 4 chords. He uses them in a different order for each song he writes and when he runs out of different combinations he doesnt care and uses the SAME CHORD PROGRESSION twice on the same album. If that isnt bad enough, he doesnt even bother to change the melody or lead line that he plays throughout the intro. He may mix it up a little and change from acoustic to electric. Hopefully they will stop their downward spiral and their next album will be good again. Save us."},{"rating":"2","title":"good.. but","review":"Great cd, bar far their best cd to date, if you wanna call sell them sell-outs go ahead, but the cd is well done.

Green Day is the best punk band of all time, relient K wouldnt even crack the top 50 in any catorygory you want to place them outside of christian rock.

Who can't hear the obvious change in this band? I personally could not stand the goofy lyrics and annoying pop punk crap that they tried to rip off of great bands like MxPx and did very badly. But with this new album its as if they are a different band all together. The musicianship and singing are way above previous efforts. I even attended one of their concerts in the past and was bored to tears. I bought this new album though and would even recommend them changing their name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a good CD...","review":"Its amazing how people give a band hell for changing it up a little. I mean, people are so picky now, that if one chord doesn't go to their liking, it's a horrible CD and not that band at all anymore.Relient K did just that, not only have they made better MUSIC, but have matured. Look at the likes of Blink 182, New Found Glory, Good Charlotte... all of which have changed their sound a tad... and *gasp* don't say it... have matured in playing and in song writing. Can't talk about high school days forever...All in all, Relient K's new album gets me into it, I would reccommend it to a friend, but not be head over heels for it, there are better albums out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmhmm!","review":"Well, Relient K has been one of my all-time favourite bands since I heard them this summer... I just recently purchased this Cd and wow. Having borrowed the previous two (Tongue In Cheek & Two Lefts) off a friend, I was amazed at the depth of the lyrics and the strength of their musicianship that was so obvious in their fourth album. The strongest piece (Which To Bury: Us Or The Hatchet) is a wonderful punk song, strong with amazing guitar, and yet it flows seamlessly into the softer, more reflective Let It All Out. Other stand-outs include: The One I'm Waiting For, I So Hate Consequences and This Week The Trend. Every song on this album is gold, and I would adivse you to consider buying it. Relient K is not a band to be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmhmm!","review":"Man oh Man! This CD BLEW ME AWAY!!!!

If you enjoy bands like the pop-rock bands without the bad words and negative messages, PICK THIS ONE UP! Matthew Theissen has the most awesome vocals I've heard in Relient K and I love it (just listen to More Than Useless). This album is a little bit heavier than usual albums because Matt has now reached the point where he starts yelling - not screaming - lyrics and I love it. There are some forgettable songs, but few.

Go get Relient K's MMHMM."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHA-BAM","review":"oh, relient k. what can i say? you are truly amazing. another wonderful, fantastic, catchy CD that I again, have fallen in love with. whether your a newbie to rk, or a faithful fan..MMMHMM will find its way into your stereo..for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of if not the Best","review":"This is one of if not the best Relient K albym to date. It has more deep, thoughtful, tracks than silly, meaningless tracks. Still, it is still recognizable as Relient K. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is this. It did not have a stand out, immediate smash hit. Such as \\"Sadie Hawkins Dance\\" on \\"Anatomy of the Toungue in Cheek\\" or \\"Chap Stick and Chapped Lips and Things Like Chemistry\\" on \\"Two Lefts Don't Make a Right but Three Do\\" If it had a breakout hit like those, I would have given it 5 stars. But if you are a Relient K fan or just of the pop/punk genre. Immediatly, not tomorrow, not an hour from now, immediatly (I'm serious) go buy this album. It's one of THE best out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"best yet","review":"while on vacation with a bunch of friends, we only listened to relient k cds. all of them were great, but all the songs that we danced to and remember the most are ones from MMHMM. awhile back. when \\"Be My Escape\\" was a free download on iTunes, i downloaded it not knowing what i was getting myself into. it quickly became the most listened to song on my iPod. i am slowly getting other people to listen to this amazing band, and soon my youth group is going to a concert of theirs! surely, it will be amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoah","review":"From the moment I heard \\"Be My Escape\\", I instantly fell in love with the song. I had never heard of Relient K before, so I decided to a little research on them and I found this CD. This has now become one of my top favorite CDs ever. From the deep and powerful \\"When I Go Down\\" to the cute and catchy \\"My Girl's Ex-Boyfriend\\", this CD was made for those of all ages and carries a subtle yet powerful and beautiful message of love. Relient K really outdid themselves here. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone, Christian or not. If you are interested in other bands similar to them, I would also recommend Switchfoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a change","review":"Call me nostalgic, but i really loved the old Relient K cd's, like \\"The Anatomy Of The Tongue In Cheek.\\" This is taking everything a whole new direction. A completely different Relient K. Not to say that it is a bad cd. This is an absolutly amazing cd. But it is just so different from what they have done in the past. I would however, still recomend this cd for anyone who likes anything by them, and anyone who hasn't heard of them. It is just a great cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't have to be a religous person to enjoy","review":"I was a little bit disheartened when I first heard that Relient K was a Christian Band. I feel I stereotyped Christian music as all being prayer music and songs about worship, and religion. Relient K surely put an end to that stereotype that I set for myself. Aside for \\"Let it All Out\\", and \\"When I go Down\\", Relient K really rocks the house with upbeat songs that are comparable to Blink 182, Green Day, and Good Charlotte. \\"Be My Escape\\" \\"More than Useless\\" and \\"This Week the Trend\\" are my favorites of the album, and I feel these shows the talent of the band. I feel that this album is a great one to have for fans who enjoy ROCK/Alternative music, not particularly Christian music..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Form someone looking for something a bit different","review":"As fan of lyrics, I am always looking for some one that gives me great listening music as well as well though out lyrics. I am tired of the mindless dance pop, rehash rap and life less profanity that seems to pass for music now a days. I have to admit when I heard of this group I though it would be like some of the awful Christian rock that exists out there(don't get me wrong I'm not against Christian rock, just badly written unimaginative lyrics). I was pleasantly surprised that Reliant K seem to have brought back some of the energy of the 80's punk style. With great puns sprinkled throughout the song that make you think and laugh when you get the meaning. They also, seem to take themselves a bit less serious that the average angst ridden band and seem to really enjoy what they do. If you want to rock out to some driving guitars and drum (with a few added instruments) in you car our home give this one a try, but make sure you read the lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmhmm lifts me up and inspires me","review":"you gotta listen to the last track, \\"when i go down.\\" that song spoke to me and reminds me that god is always with us. even when we have fallen in the deepest hole, he reaches out his hand and lets us know that he will lift us up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"MMhMM, me likey!","review":"In my opinion, this CD is not as good as \\"The Anatomy Of The Tongue In Cheek,\\" but then again, few pop-punk CD's are. This CD kind of moves them into more of emo/pop punk sound, which still really works for Relient K. Thiessen still has an excellent singing voice and he still writes witty songs with great wordplay. His balance of serious and funny songs reward the listener with a great overall CD. Some of my favorites are: The One I'm Waiting For, Be My Escape, I So Hate Consequences, Which To Bury Us Or The Hatchet, Let It All Out, and Who I Am Hates Who I've Been. The maturity on this album is showing that Relient K has a great future ahead of them, although punk rock isn't as big as used to be. So Relient K, who does not put out bad albums, should be a band to watch for in the next five years to see how much more they will develop and adapt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"I am a big Relient K fan and have their first 3 CDs.

Two rather pathetic losers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"But is it art?","review":"First rule of impro (in movies): it never works. It was embarrassing, if compelling, when Godard tried it. Here it's merely excruciating. With Godard it was more cross-examination. You knew he was in control - and jolly uncomfortable (if electrifying) it felt. Here it's just two young people with nothing to say to each other and drink as default for the awkward gaps. How like life! (OK, in Godard they smoke.) An art movie for people who don't watch art movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good!","review":"This movie was great. I loved how natural the romance between the characters was and how believably it blossomed. Watching it reminded me of the first time I fell in love. A lot of things in the movie were unsaid and this made the movie all the better. Everyone who has fallen in love will understand all the parts that the writers left to ones imagination. It felt so real, I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great","review":"I love how real this story feels. It will leave you debating what will happen in the end. Well worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love and Selfishness Can Not Coexist!","review":"This is not a love story. It is a story of two selfish people who don't know what real love is. They put their own interest above the others. Most romantic movies ignore the fact that the feeling that comes with \\"falling in love\\", is not real love and is always temporary. In this movie it is clear from the tortured existence the characters choose to live, real love is something they have not yet been willing to give, and probably don't even understand. Even in the end it seems the only thing that brought them together was their selfish desires to regain that fleeting feeling that comes with falling in love, never learning how to truly love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait, what?","review":"I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was happening in this movie... You get the story in snippets, mostly without words. I was disconnected to the characters because I was left guessing a lot as to what they were thinking and feeling. I got the cheating part quite clearly, though. They were both unfaithful multiple times, even after they get married. They drag each other and two other people through the dirt, so it's no wonder they both struggle with trust issues the entire movie. The ending leaves you hanging. They get back together legally and supposedly permanently, so the distance issue is resolved, but they really don't appear happy. Perhaps because they realized the distance wasn't really the problem in their relationship... That being said, there was some good cinematography, so I give it some credit for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"stays with you","review":"This movie stays with you long after it's over.

While it had good parts i felt the movie as a whole was rather meh. The most frustrating part was the ending - it just ends without any resolution. Overall - not a bad movie to watch once but i won't go out of my way to watch it a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"ending sucked","review":"The viewer is able to feel the pain and angst that the two main characters are experiencing. We begin as their love unfolds and follow them through their journey. The transition between scenes could have been better There were times when I was watching and found myself to be confused as to what was going on. The ending was quite upsetting because it is unclear whether Anna is moving to America or if she is just visiting. Also, where they still married?? The ending could have been better which is why I gave this movie a 4 instead of a 5.Overall, i did enjoy the movie. So it definitely is a good watch, but just a heads up, the ending disappoints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Crazy","review":"I bought this as a gift, my granddaughter had seen it and liked it so much!

WRONG! (Should've chosen the zombie movie, most definitely). For the next two hours you watch two very average young people deal with the most unpleasant aspects of a relationship (jealousy, distance, etc) and attempt to execute the most pitiful coping mechanisms.All the hallmarks of emotional immaturity and unrealistic romantic expectations are here: reading each others text messages, lying to your partner about previous/current lovers, etc, etc.The thing is, it's not a bad *movie* per se. It's just an exceedingly unpleasant experience to endure. Why anyone would subject themselves to two hours of this emotionally contrite drivel is beyond me. It's a well-made, mumble-core-ish melodramatic trajedy masquerading as a chick flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Crazy Didn't Hold My Interest","review":"I didn't finish this movie.

I always search for the kind of movies that stick with you even weeks after watching it. I think the reason it is so different than any other movie is because it feels so real. Anyone who was ever in love can relate to this movie. I loved every minute of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Don't waste your time or money.","review":"This movie is terrible.

Seriously, just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!","review":"To sum it up... this movie starts out slow, then speeds up (almost too much), and then gets confusing and you cannot read what is going on with the actors because their expressions don't tell you! And the end of the movie... so bad that it actually kind of got me mad. It literally just STOPS. With no explination of what will come of the two.I was so excited to see this movie because all the reviews hyped it up to be this epic love story. NOT!! So so bad. The way the characters acted in it kept me confused. It was like having Kristin Stewart play every role because of all the stone faces and clueless looks and expressions.

It was slow paced at times, the dialogue could have been a lot stronger especially between the two main characters. Their acting was fine, but there was definitely an element missing in this movie. If you're looking for a classic love story, then keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pains of an international relationship","review":"It's hard for one partner to live in the US and another in Britain. The conflicts involved are shown strongly by the lead actors in this often painful but compelling story. No matter who moves or how often they get together, there's always going to be the distance factor and the fact that the families will not want to see their kids leave for another country.The only annoying thing was the use of very rapid and unnecessary quick cuts and some time-lapse photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going nowhere obviously takes an hour and a half.","review":"I was under the impression that the movie was going to go somewhere.

Poorly developed characters in a boring story that goes nowhere and then just ends with NO resolution or redemption! Pointless unless you just need a depressing reminder that long distance relationships are very difficult and frequently fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great of a movie","review":"I was really excited for this movie when I first saw the trailer, but when i finally watched the movie I was really disapointed. I loved everything about it except for the fact that nothing happened... I kept on waiting for something to happen, but really nothing happens at all. Also the ending is quote annoying, you never find out what happens to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating love story that has you suffer through because of one characters decision","review":"i was truly looking forward to watching this movie especially with all the buzz but found myself almost immediately frustrated that by one character's decision, they are torn apart throughout the movie and a lot of people get hurt in the process. I don't buy the ending nor find it very satisfying and it's all done with a gloss over -- you have to piece together why one minute they are broken up and the next minute they are together. the deleted and alternate scenes do help. but still not enough.

She's a mixture of Celine Dion style ballads, Michelle Branch's soulful expression with a fresh hip edge. Her voice is individual, and although some of the music does seem recycled, and lines can develop predictable endings (can't they all?) she's got a great style. I'd recommend this album for any Delta Goodrem fans, because it outweighs her by far (Sorry Delta!). She's such a talented young lady, I hope this album takes her to the top.

I also purchased the Amazon recommended book to go with this, the CPP examination. I went with the CPP book due to the fact that ASIS CPP publications start at $500 and go to $1,000 for books to help with the exam.In reviewing sample tests for the exam, there are questions in highly important areas of key domains and information that are not covered at all in the CPP book. I was looking for an all-in-one guide with the quality of a Shon Harris CISSP publication, but this book is very lacking in that regard. If you are the type of person that would rate Shon Harris books an \\"A\\", this book would be a \\"C\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best thing out there......","review":"It is pointless to read this book.

I cant tell you how disappointed I was when I got this. It is a mere shadow of the ÒMoon Montana HandbookÓ, and only a pamphlet of highlights compared to the ÒUltimate Montana Atlas and Travel EncyclopediaÓ. They try to funnel you in to the high traffic tourist spots, and only suggest the pricey restaurants and motels. About the only good thing I can say about it is that its a quick read. They cram all of Montana into a little more than 200 small pages. If you really want to explore Montana, get the ÒUltimateÓ or the ÒMoonÓ books (the ÒUltimateÓ book is really the only one youll ever need).

The cover and title are goofy, and even the author's photo and bio make the book look like a third rate \\"cozy\\" mystery. But it isn't.The plot was gripping! The murder scenes and descriptions were so vivid and horrendous, I could barely keep reading (makes you want to cover your eyes like at a horror movie). The intensity kept building as the pages flew by. The author uses his medical knowledge well in building a believable murder mystery. Count me in as a new James Tucker fan.

The young (and, of course, beautiful assistant D.A. who is also Merlin's live-in lover) is so worried that the mole on the back of her neck (near her hairline) might be cancerous, that she elects to visit the area's premier plastic surgeon to have it removed. She doesn't see a dermatologist, not an oncologist, not even a general practioner, but a PLASTIC SURGEON?

The magnificent sound and color brought out the wonder of the documentary even more. The music created a mood. I learned so much that the ninety minutes went by in an instant.The interviewer has asked questions of todays great writers of horror in a way that has solicited comprehensible responses. They look as if they are relaxed and discussing family in their living room.I was not a Lovecraft enthusiast before I watched this film but I am now.

I also happen to personally know someone who's mentioned in the book, somewhat maliciously- and she was never even contacted by Ms. Rich to either get or check facts.

On page 145 she refers to Allen's age as 49 years old in 2002 then on page 149 as 52 years old in 2001.

Though I feel it should be renamed--it doesn't deal with most indian cultures, but rather the Chippewa Indians, as they are who Frances Densmore made an extensive study of.

According to the standard size chart, that is a MEDIUM! If you wear larger than medium, you will have to alter the pattern significantly to fit. That is truly ridiculous-- the sizing should go up at least to XL, and preferably larger. The book ought to be called \\"Knitting for Two (As Long You Don't Weigh Over 98 Pounds)\\".

Superb, rich mono sound, compelling conducting, wild climaxes, musicality and frenzy in perfect balance. Little wonder Berlin Classics has re-issued this on their \\"Eterna Collection\\"--both as a heavy vinyl LP and a beautifully produced CD with the original cover and liner notes. It further helps this release that it is coupled with an equally--or even more--gorgeous rendition of the \\"Songs of a Wayfarer\\". The (East-) Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra under Kurt Sanderling and booming roundness of Herrmann Prey were recorded in 1961 and it'd all be a perfect match were it not for the considerable distortion.

I know I felt great compassion for \\"The Good Soldier\\" of whom the narrator speaks. To me the novel was aboutl his sexual suppression.

The plot is simple, almost mundane, a story of betrayal and infidelity.

The telling of the story represents true creativity and art."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saddest Story","review":"As Ford says, this is the saddest story. It is a wonderfully sad story about Edward, a sentamentalist, and his search for true love which never materializes.

It was difficult for me to stomach the portrayal of Americans. The book is thoroughly English in every respect, and I thought his writing of American characters betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of America. It's not that he's stereotyping Americans; it's more like he's never met one before. The story itself was riveting, but the narrative style, while it may be fascinating in a literary criticism class, was more of a liability than an asset to me as a reader. I also would have liked to develop my own empathy or distaste for these characters, but instead, I was continually reminded by the narrator how noble all these pathetic people were supposed to be. It disappointed me. If that makes me a literary cretin, so be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mccormick&Thomas Glow with energy!!!","review":"I love this movie! Seen it 3 times, Thomas is funny.

If he liked liked a band's demo tape, or live pub show, they got a live studio session on John's radio show. I remember hearing this session for the first time, as clearly as I remember, say, hearing Hendrix. I rushed to start recording the session and was blown away by an intense driving sound and a horn section that was to my amazement British.

Can't praise this enough, and am amazed it remains out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books. Surprises and twists.","review":"One of Mr. Foster's best. The world he creates is full of surprises to the people who go there and the reader who follows. Finding a world based on silicon life forms and intelligent life based on their form and function rather than just evolution is very, very clever. The story twists keeps me reading it over and over. A must read for ADF readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories","review":"I read this book as a middling teenager, and was enthralled then by the totally different life forms and story that Foster presented. I had gotten the book from the local library, returned it and was left with a nice memory of the book. Now, a couple decades later I've found the book again and purchased it for my own. I am not sorry that I did. This book is a brilliant piece of work, where the life form are crystalline silicon based, as well as some silicon/carbon mixes. The humans have advanced so far that they use external suits to do everything for them, from just taking a stroll down the street, to swimming in the pool. Evan Orgell, our protagonist, is dropped on the planet to find out what has happened to the research team which was left there previously. He quickly finds that the life forms on this planet, while beautiful, can also be extremely dangerous. Over all, I am VERY happy to finally include this book in my personal library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Different!","review":"A friend of mine lent me a copy of this book, and I couldn't put it down. The descriptions of the inhabitants of Prism shows Foster's fabulous imagination. I give it 4 stars for the wonderful descriptive qualities alone. It would be next to impossible for two different people to imagine the same kinds of creatures as set forth in the book. The only downside to the book is that the plot/story development is fairly typical/ametuerish sci-fi. But the monsters: Very imaginative! Worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foster conceived an incredible planet","review":"Foster always seems to touch on an aspect of human sociality in each hardcore sci-fi book. In Quozl, he dwelled on adolescence, Slipt, elderly complascence. Prizm explored fashion and human vanity, not to mention human superiority. He has an astounding vision and extremely flexible biological views. He has been one of my favorite writers since I read \\"The man who used the Universe\\" back in 1978. Not being a sci-fantasy buff, I cannot reccommend all his works, but I strongly endorse all hardcore sci-fi.....TTM III"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is this, a rare edition?","review":"Wow. It is weird to click on a book you own and see other people selling it for over a hundred bucks. Anyone want my copy?Whatever, I'm here to write a review.This is a book about redemption. An immoral man is sent to a strange planet by an immoral company to figure out why their immoral actions are not working. With an abundance of hubris and technology the man lands on the planet, and is quickly and definitively relieved of his pride and his machines. Only once he hits bottom does his redemption begin.It is also a book about a fascinatingly interesting planet. One of the fun things about reading sci-fi is that the authors are allowed to stretch their imaginations and give us fantastic new worlds. This is definitely one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little sci-fi","review":"Nice story about a guy trapped on an uncharted planet with a radically different life system of silicates and photovore based creatures, some intelligent.

Probably more like McDonalds for a hardcore sci-fi reader, but still fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic SF","review":"I love it when a writer creates a whole new world.

If this record is one of the highlights of avantgarde, then what I am I to think of records like Fred Frith's 'The Technology of Tears', John Zorn's 'The Big Gundown', records which truly amazed me, and still do. No, I'm sorry, I won't be fooled again by Miss Anderson's theatrical pseudo-art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consummate Musicianship","review":"I felt compelled to rebut Noam Bronstien's critique of Laurie Anderson's work. It can hardly be called \\"pre-triphop\\". Laurie Anderson is a fine example of a minimalist composer, dealing in the complexities of sound. Far from being simple,as Noam claims, Anderson's venture into minimalism is actually a complex and difficult to grasp experiment in the interactions of various sonic experiences. And, to quote an old professor, she succeeds wonderfully at creating a vivid, if somewhat stark and frightening soundscape. Big Science is the pinnacle of her career as a minimalist, but her other albums are well worth the investment, especially to any who are interested in looking beyond the surface of the notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call the Humane Society!","review":"\\"Walk The Dog\\", the B-Side of \\"O Superman\\" is the best song Laurie Anderson ever recorded, but couldn't get enough respect to be an actual CD track...who ever heard of a bonus track on a CD being an Mp3 download only? \\"I'm not gonna walk THIS dog...woof, woof!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"Having been a fan of different and \\"alternative\\" music, I was intrigued when I first saw the videos for \\"Sharkey's Day\\" and \\"O Superman\\" on MTV. I was just blown away. So, I went out and picked up my first Laurie Anderson album, Big Science. I was simply amazed at the quality and consistency of this album. I wanted to hear O SUPERMAN first, but when I started with FROM THE AIR, I didn't stop until the album was over. Mesmerizing is the best word I can think of in describing this album. While the lyrics may seem loony, they are actually very intelligent and thought provoking. One of the most haunting songs is BORN, NEVER ASKED. There is a line in that song that says, \\"What is behind that curtain?\\" This just underscores the simple yet fascinating aspects of Laurie's lyrics. I just never knew that I was \\"always falling when I was walking.\\" If you didn't know that, then you must own this album. In fact, everyone should. This is simply a magical piece of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worth it if you don't already own it.","review":"This remastered and \\"expanded\\" 25th anniversary edition of Big Science is a huge letdown. Not only is the one audio bonus track not included on the cd proper (it's a file on the enhanced portion of the cd) but the remastering itself is negligible. Also, the introduction to the title track has actually been truncated from the original version. My disappointment is compounded by my purchase of Holger Czukay's Movies which was remastered with such care that, even though it was recorded slightly earlier than Big Science, sounds like it was recorded yesterday.Big Science is a phenomenal and groundbreaking album. If you're interested in delving into Laurie Anderson's work, this is the place to start. However, if you're already a fan and you already own Big Science on cd, this is simply a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice remastering","review":"The quality of the remastering is excellent. The material was totally unique when first released, and still is.The extra MP3's are very cool. The \\"O Superman\\" video is basic but very innovative.Laurie really knows how to use all the various elements she does in the video and it is a reflection of some of the multi-media tools she uses in her live shows.The packaging is very nice as well. Groovy pics and a nice booklet with lyrics and backround information.Note: I found that dragging the cursor from the track listing (Mp3's) and going over the little face in the middle allows you to create your own little \\"doggie\\" songs.Go buy this now!I can't wait for Mister Heartbreak and the live multi-disc remastered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter price is paid from the heart","review":"\\"The price you pay\\" is a book about love.

We have to rely on this generator completely in our wilderness off the grid location when there is inadequate solar gain to power our home and pump our water. We use ours every single day at times. This unit works so well that THREE of our neighbors have bought the exact some model for use at their own places after seeing ours in action.

Now I've had to find a service center, haul it there, be told they can't get to it for a week and I'm out of a generator. Now I have to see if I can rent one, at probably quite a fee, to use for my trip. The engine fires right up but has a noticable miss every 2 or 3 seconds.The free shipping is also a joke, I got a call from a truck terminal a half hour's drive away to come get it.

And while recycling books under my kitchen floor storage, I came across it once again! Seeing there was now a 6th edition I ordered one for a friends 60th birthday, then ordered another for myself. It is a great read. One point I wish/hope will be made, is how a college class could create a geologic scale of time, and assign the ages as they wish. Then confirm them with the radio-metric styles used to conform the millions or billions of years desired today. It is a matter of matching the isotopes to the chart, which was assigned a century and a half ago..... whows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell yeah indie cinema!","review":"Okay, here's the deal folks: Us Sinners is admittedly and unabashedly indie, micro-budgeted cinema. But by that token it enjoys the freedom to do whatever it wants, narratively-speaking, and first-time writer/director George Snow takes full use of that freedom. Equal parts Psycho and Peeping Tom, this psycho-sexual creepfest will manage the nifty trick of making you feel sorry for Tim, even as you are revolted by the hideous things he does. The cast is well up for the challenge, and I guarantee that no eye will be left unwidened at the oogy conclusion.

It's basically an introduction to the adobe creative suite, rather than a 'bible'. I have to say, I find it rather ineffective, trying to learn all these things at once, and the basic theme of the book, 'interconnectivity' is simple enough that you really don't need a book.I'm also a bit bothered by how much they seem to want to sell the idea of the adobe creative suite. There is no mention of other tools available in places where they admit adobe's products have shortcomings.Also, the paper is poor quality (what did I expect for the price?!).That said, if you're looking for a generalist, get your feet wet kind of hand-holding book, this could be a good one to buy, the examples are clear and easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"George was robbed","review":"This is one of GM's best vocal performances and unfortunately due to his involvement in aforementioned scandal of the time, MJB's record label neglected to allow this gem to be released in the USA.

I was especially dissapointed because I really liked Chacon's first book, Chicano Chicanery. In fact I liked the short story collection so much that when And the Shadows Took Him came out I bought a copy right away and enthusiastically began reading. Unfortunately, however, I was only able to get about half way through before being overcome by boredom. I put the book aside, and am just finishing it now-- two years later! In my opinion, the plot is convoluted and the prose flat; there just wasn't much to hold my attention. I think Chacon really hit the sophmore slump with this one.

They're not very good. One or two are alright: I like Te Quero Puta! and Benzine. Te Quero Puta! is sung in Spanish, something I can't imagine from US or British metal bands, and the accent is done well.The rest are toneless and tuneless, a bit like Slipknot in German. You'll probably buy this if you're a Rammstein fan but you'll be disappointed. If you're new to Rammstein try one of their earlier albums instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this CD","review":"It's an incredibly kitsch album,with some very ridicolous moments like \\"Te Quiero Puta!\\".And there's absolutely no power inside: it's just a collection ofvery commercial songs with overproduced guitar sounds.Do not buy it (their old Mutter is a bit better)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappoinment from Rammstein","review":"I fell in love with the band after discovering their album Mutter. Skillfully mixed heavy sound and foreceful vocals are no longer present in Rosenrot. All songs on this album are mellow and unremarkable. The vocals are not good enough to pull it off. The album leaves you with an impression that you just listened to poems read to some boring background music. I hope the band goes back to the unique and unforgettable sound of Mutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"The older they get...","review":"Boy Rammstein is getting old, in more than one way. This music is boring with none of the power or energy as their older stuff. I liked their fast paced songs which they made up until the album Mutter. But both this new album and last years Reise, Reise aren't that at all. These guys are done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make it Short and Sweet.......","review":"Rammstein Have a VERY wonderful Album. Reise, Reise, they tried to work on the melody. Rosenrot,.... I think they made it better. The songs have very strong structure. It's weird, they took some time on Reise, Reise and I think that Rosenrot came out to be the better.It's a really good disc everyone. Solid songs. O, and one more thing, I MEAN THIS WHEN I SAY IT, YOU'LL LOVE THE BONUS DISC!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"German Rock","review":"This is the first Rammstein album I've listened to, being attracted to it in the first place by the single 'Benzin', which constitutes track 1. I wasn't sure what to expect, other than probably more of the same. Rather surprisingly (I felt), I really enjoyed it - less 'Industrial' and more 'Rock' than I expected. I can hear many echoes of decades-old favourites such as Nina Hagen and Spliff.....of course, there's more power chording and the production technology these days is way better, but - German Rock still sounds like German Rock. So if you like the above mentioned Nina Hagen, Spliff et al - you won't get too far out of your comfort zone with this. And it goes without saying - if you're already a Rammstein fan, it may pay you to backtrack & investigate some of the older players in this game, to hear where some of it's coming from.Incidentally, you may enjoy (as I did) putting this album on the headphones, turning the volume up & visiting the Ramstein Air Base homepage."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THIS RAMMSTEIN ???????","review":"I am a great Rammstein's fan, but this cd really disapointed me. I can't imagine the band performing songs like this on the stage. The DVD is fantastic, great old songs that make us full of energy, but the CD is a \\"German-sugar-metal\\" ! What\`s the next ? Rammstein performing with an Philarmonic Orchestra like Metallica ? Making a duet with Celine Dion ? Come on guys, give us your best and heavy sound with a furious and noise guitars, and a agressive and consistent voice from Lindemann. If you want to invest your money, buy the old albuns from Amazon at the half price of Rosenrot. If you want to spend, try the new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Day Has Gone.....","review":"Every dog has its day, as they say, and Rammstein seem to have had theirs. For fans of the seriously heavy, powerful industrial sounds of Rammstein, \\"Rosenrot\\" will probably disappoint.With exception of the track \\"Zerstoren\\", which is filled with powerful chords and hard riffs, the band seems to have gone for a lighter, cleaned up sound. Most tracks have a softer sound to them, as if Rammstein have tried to change their image and style quite dramatically. Some songs get heavy in the choruses, only to lose that hard edge again in the verses. Sadly, this seems to be the case with every song on the CD.For fans who have been pounded into fan-hood by the sounds of \\"Sennsucht\\", \\"Mutter\\", and Herzeleid\\", this one is certainly one to avoid. If you buy it, make sure you listen to it first. Maybe the changes will appeal, but for fans of the earlier music, \\"Rosenrot\\" is really where the \\"rot\\" has set in.If you were only mildly impressed by \\"Reise, Reise\\", then steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth","review":"It's the truth every band will let you down eventually no matter how much you love them. I spent a month tracking down this cd and actually getting it, so my expectations were held high to begin with. But alas, It's nowhere near as good as their others sure the spanish song is pretty amusing, the rest well.. I'm sorry to all those who found it utterly spellbinding. The first song you hear american words randomly which is confusing and yet retarded gasoline, vasoline... Then the love song.....that is by far the worst part of the whole cd..It ruined their whole image for me. So for people who love rammstein and really want to know what they're getting into, I would say wait for it, because I spent more getting the cd into the states than it was worth itself. And very saddened to have to say this about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best","review":"I have been listening to Rammstein for years and saw them in concert a couple of times.

It feels a little ... rushed.That being said, the album is worth the purchase. I wouldn't pay more than $20 for it.There is only one bad song \\"tiera de puta\\" or whatever the hell crap song that is, and the rest of it is pretty good.

My favorite is still their SEHNSUCHT CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary!! Rosenrot is a unique find!","review":"Rosenrot, the newest cd from Rammstein, is amazing. Personalty, I thought that Rammstein albums Mutter and Reise Reise were incredibly good and could not be beaten. I would not be able to say that I think Rosenrot is better than those two albums because they were amazing, but I can say that Rosenrot is now an album that is just as good as them. What makes Rosenrot so unique, which most cds do not have, is that EVERY track on this cd is good. Of course people are going to have there favorites, but with this cd, I will be listening to every song on it not just a few select ones. Thank u Rammstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Rammstein!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This album isn't just Reise,Reise Part II. I think everybody, who's interested in Rammstein should buy this record.Es ist ein gutes Album, was teils schwer(Spring und Zerstören), aber auch intrumental(Wo bist du?)ist.Das finde ich klasse und deswegen gibt es 5 Sterne.Ich hoffe, dass das nächste Album genauso gut wird."},{"rating":"1","title":"What??","review":"I must have heard a different album than these other reviewers. Being a fan since the first time I saw them in '98, I've always liked Rammstein's work, but this one's definitely their least impressive, aside from the beautiful packaging it comes in. A couple decent songs, but nothing they haven't already done, and better. It's like a sluggish version of \\"Reise, Reise,\\" almost all ballads, and the song \\"Te Quiero Puta\\" is downright embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"The production was well polished and high quality. However, I couldn't help but feel bored listening to it. It almost appears that they are going through the motions musically, while saving their efforts for adolescent lyrics and wild live shows. There are some bits of varied musicality and language, with a slow partially English ballad, and an 'industrial Mariachi' song in Spanish. But, the core seems to be hard hitting without enthusiasm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfection","review":"This album is quite the impressive one with plenty of songs that issues this purchase worthy. \\"Benzin\\" has a powerful message but isn't all I expected for the first single, though it does grow on you. \\"Mann Gegan Mann\\" is possibly the most contraversial song yet although it is very misunderstood. People think it's bashing homosexuals when it's about the benifit of being gay. \\"Rosenrot\\" is very worthy of being a single aswell, my 4th favorite from the album. The crunchy guitar riffs end at \\"Stirb Nicht Vor Mir/Don't Die Before I Do.\\" Rammstein teamed up with the lead singer of the British pop band Texas and came out with this. A very good and haughnting ballad. It feels as the calm before the storm because \\"Zerstören\\" immediately follows with heavy guitars and an onslaught of Till's screams. The most autistic songs of the album is deffinately \\"Te Quero Puta!\\" which seems like a mix between Dance Metal and classic Mexian Guitar. Very good album, but not all it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice when working","review":"Got this for Christmas. I agree with another person that it has a fairly steep learning curve.My main problem is that it doesn't pick up a satellite when I turn it on.

It always finds it and then it works.I have clicked on \\"Set GPS\\" & \\"Automatic reconnect\\" but it still doesn't connect.Also find their support pretty bad. Very hard to get any kind of answer from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Living God is a beautiful short book by Romano Guardini.","review":"The Living God is a short book by Romano Guardini which is a treatise on God as a living, active force in our lives, not just a concept of theology to be studied on paper. He starts with the face of God (what God looks like), divine providence (God's care for our lives), then what God sees and wills (God's control of everything) and goes into other facets of our relationship with God, always writing with clarity, holiness, and profundity and always taking us back to the very simple truths about the nature of God and man. It is a beautiful beautiful book. The part describing God's face is one of the most beautiful I have come across in religious writing. Guardini is very very deep, but not at all frightening. I highly recommend this book. He is an excellent guide into the mysteries of faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Long Term Weather Resistance","review":"I purchased this cover over two years ago and it still is in excellent condition.

The picture is outright misleading unless the patio set displayed was made for minature people. If the picture were to be porportionally accurate it would imply the pictured chairs are less than 3' tall since over 2/3 of the chair's height is covered. Furthermore, if the diameter was actually 94\\" as advertised I probably would have at least a little extra slack on the sides to pull it down. But no, the diameter works out to more like 88-90\\" so it was already snug as-is. My patio chairs are at regular seating height but have slightly higher backs so this just doesn't work for me at all. Overall this cover makes my patio set look like a mushroom.Would it have really killed them to just add an extra 6\\" to the overall height?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything it says it is and more","review":"I am extremely pleased with the Patio table and chair set cover.

The extra room also allowed me to place two small end tables underneath the cover so I could store all the patio furniture in one corner of the deck where it is out of the way for the winter.I am very pleased with the color and the quality construction of this cover-the fabric is heavy with reinforced seams. The features such as the straps to secure the cover to the table or chair legs and the vents to let moisture escape are very nice touches as well.

Since this is a little too big for my furniture set, it covers all almost to the bottom of the furniture legs (it may not look so nice aesthetically.) and although it can be tied only at two points, the cover stayed all the time even under very windy/snowy weather. (Wind even pushed the furniture set all together as if it was one big piece!) So far so good!I did not give the full 5 stars, just because I could not find the best size, and of course, I would like to continue to check the durability for coming years....My patio furniture set is a 48\\" table and 5 chairs, but the cover size is large (to 94\\" diameter) as the medium (to 70\\") seems to be too small to cover the whole set. I guess the bigger the better as there is plenty room to put other things underneath."},{"rating":"1","title":"good quality, bad fit","review":"The quality of the cover was great for the price. Unfortunatly, I had to return it because of the unclear measuring instructions to determine which size cover would be appropriate for my table and chairs.

But to call this film a mere comedy would be an injustice to it. It is a deeply intelligent and thought provoking film that was made during the time that the Nazis were rising in power. It is also Chaplin's first full lengeth sound feature. Also featuring the beautiful Paulette Goddard. The Criterion Collection brings this brilliant film to blu-ray and it looks amazing. From the brilliant mind of Charlie Chaplin we see a piece of cinema that can truly be called great. From beginning to end this film is entertaining. Highly recommended for all Chaplin fans or fans of films about complicated issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Momentous, one-of-a-kind, inspired brilliance","review":"Here, Charlie Chaplin accomplishes the impossible, by juxtaposing comedy next to horrible tragedy, and having it all work because his positive motivation and wit package the critically important messages in a way that effectively sent the point home to many millions of viewers worldwide. His intent was to favorably alter the course of world history in a very dark era, and he may, indeed, have done it to a degree. The 50-minute explanatory narration covering the historical context of this work is a great asset to the set. It sells at a premium and, if you are a serious film and/or history fan, pay it to get this set. Buy it, also, to appreciate the damage done by the McCarthyist era in this country, which was so bad that Chaplain had to return to his native England."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"Chaplin was a genius.

Will definately deal with this seller again. - JG"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily, Chaplin\`s best work","review":"Here Chaplin speaks for the 1st time(Modern Times and City Lights had a soundtrack, but still considered silent films)and The Gold Rush 1925, was given a Chaplin story-teller in 1941.He is alarmingly funny in this satire; the story and script is a credit to his genius. The only setback is that it is spiced with reworks of earlier glorious scenes(the dinner here versus the dinner in The Gold Rush)... But it is all in good fun and the end-speech... from a man\`n heart; He expresses the wishes of every soul on earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criterion Does It Again","review":"First off, I want to say Amazon ships REALLY FAST AT TIMES. I ordered this movie using standard shipping on the morning of May 26th and it arrived the day after.The Great Dictator is the second Criterion release from the Chaplin library. Given that this is the blu ray version the transfer was immaculate. The movie had a stunning clarity to it that was leaps and bounds above the previous releases of this movie. The uncompressed monaural soundtrack was excellent as well. The supplements are a combination of new and old, the supplements that were on the older M2K release are carried over with this one. There's also a 27 page booklet included with this release.At 125 minutes this is one of Chaplin's longest films. This movie does have some pacing to it and it hits all its high marks throughout the film and the pay off is worth it. I can't really say anymore about this movie that hasn't already been said.I anxiously await the next Criterion release of a Chaplin film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kingdom of God","review":"A daring commentary, prophecy, and spoof of Adolph Hitler made before the full horrors of the Nazi regime were known. Chaplin's concluding speech regarding humanity might be equalled only by Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. In the speech, Chaplin refers to the scriptural passage of St. Luke Chapter 17: ...behold, the Kingdom of God is within you. He makes but a subtle mention of this, but it is the foundation of the speech...and it is the foundation of Chaplin and his work: that we must RESPECT not only ourselves but ALL of humanity. For within us ALL is the Kingdom of God!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the great dictator","review":"The \\"great dictator\\" is a masterpiece of high value since it is performed by one of the most famous actors of our time, humoristic but meanwhile also real."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Classic Comedy Film---Better than anything produced today","review":"Possibly Charlie Chaplin's best work ever--his Hitleresque character is beyond belief, and the \\"Master of the World\\" ballet is one every comedy enthusiast should see.

But bewaring about all the consequences, he threw his hat to ring, dared and gave a knock out film, filled of mordant cynicism and fine humor about the life and times of the Nazi opprobrium.This movie will stand out as an everlasting advise for all leaders who pretend - impulsed by any sort of beleifs - the man was born to be free, far beyond of any other ideology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Masterpiece","review":"This is one of my favorite movies ever!!!

Fields, One Night in the Tropics, which was the film debut of the greatest comedy duo of all time, Abbott and Costello, The Thief of Baghdad, and this MASTERPIECE. I only saw about 15 minutes of this CLASSIC to know how much the comedy films of today have de-evolved into senseless, offensive TRASH. This is comedy.

Only the most forgiving Madonna fan could sit and watch this through AND enjoy it. The costumes were elaborate but it had far too much shock value, that just wasn't shocking.

Terry's dynamic harmonica playing (and joyous \\"whoops\\") and McGhee's understated guitar playing make the blues a cause for celebration. This CD is actually a repackaging of two of their 1960 Prestige/Bluesway recordings (Blues and Folk, tracks 1-10, and Blues All Around My Head, tracks 11-20).There are no other session musicians used. This is Terry and McGhee doing what they do best--performing folk/country blues with passion and conviction. They perform standards, like \\"Midnight Special\\" and \\"Muddy Water,\\" but most of these are originals. This is blues that won't leave you blue.

Later that year it broke. The autoreverse mechanism kept reversing until the motor overheated and shut off. At that point I variously called and emailed about my problem. It obviously was never perceived as their problem. After about 6 months of calls, I finally got a replacement motor, which didn't work. I continued to attempt to get satisfaction, but never got any response. I don't trust these people who said that they would fix the problem. I asked to send the machine back and offered to pay freight. No response. I loved the gelato and sorbets I was making, but now I'm off the find a more reliable model.

I had this machine exactly one year. The motor, and plastic part it slots into, did not stay in place. They would fly apart and crack even when the ice cream mix was still runny. The ice cream was delicious when it did freeze, but this involved me holding the motor in place for 30 minutes, not very convenient! There is only one contact number to call for spare parts and assistance and they NEVER call you back. So after one year I had to throw it away.

It does so, however, with instructions and lessions that are valuable for all in the industry and for anyone who thinks an Academy Award winning screenplay is just a blank sheet of paper away.

The quality of the book plummeted as the result. It's just a description of movies that you've seen zillion times: enclosed space, monsters or obstacles coming one after the other, in the last moment the main character beats the monster (obstacle) to find the next one coming.

Michael Crichton has a gift for starting a novel in such a way, that you can't put it down. However, he has an equal gift for losing his steam and completely blowing an ending. Sphere is a prime example. This book should come with a warning: DO NOT READ THE LAST 20 PAGES.

I would give this book to a third grader to read, and even then they'd probably hate me.The dialogue is so amazingly poor, so horribly childish, so laughably bad I went through it with a highlighter to pick out some of my favourite pieces of trash.

The basic story borrows ideas from all over. Time travel, alien monolith (the sphere), deep sea submarine setting, and it looks like a pop culture survey patched together. A plot that rambles around trying to get the reader interested and then a disappointing weak ending.

The plot has many thoughtful details. However, I was a little disappointed by the way the story ended. Why not forward the knowledge to the future. Also, if this story was founded on the so called \\"collapse of the wave function\\" creating multiple universes any knowledge would not spread to the proper universe.Another book with a story about multiple universes is \\"The Proteus Project\\" which I recommend to anyone who liked \\"Sphere\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently thought-provoking","review":"I've never been a fast reader, but after the first 20 pages, which I read in a few months, it took a week to read the next 80, but after that I read the next couple hundred pages in one sitting. After the first few chapters (which I've since found more interesting on more recent read-throughs of the book), the pace picks up and it's impossible to put down.

Just imagine..... uncontrollable power....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crichton comes up with great ideas but can not write at all!","review":"Sphere was a very good book, it reminded me of Ringworld. Though the book has poor character development and the characters are shallow, the premeis is good and makes for an erie sc-fi. Crichton should be strictly an idea man, his writing is bad, sometimes bordering upon terrible. For all of thoes who doubt me read \\"Eaters of the Dead\\". After I read that waste of paper I was so disgusted that I almost threw-up right on the book. I wanted to get back the time I wasted reading it. \\"Andromedia Strain\\" wasn't much better. When he writes his books he sets the place, time period, and level of technology, and then blasts holes in them all. The only reason Crichton's books become best sellers is that his premis blinds readers to the implausibility, and they don't realise the holes until the end, if ever. He probably has powerful friends or relatives that owe him favors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good book....will make even better movie!!!","review":"While this was a really good book, I think it will make an even better movie. There are very few movies that are better than the books, but I think this will be an exception. The ending is astounding, and I can just see Samuel L.Jackson as Harry, and Sharon Stone as Beth, and Dustin Hoffman as Norman. Even Caroline Goodall and Rip Torn (Barnes of course.) Anyone agree..or have any suggestions for the movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How could anyone read this entire book???","review":"I just couldn't finish this book!! It was so boring, I gave up on it after about 50 pages or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, thrilling story, really LAME ending","review":"The ending of this book was so weak and unimaginative that it ruined the entire novel. It is as if Michael Crichton worte a great story and slapped the ending together as an afterthought. It has to be one of the worst books I have read and it all has to do with the \\"Let's pretend nothing happened and it will all go away\\" ending. After reading the novel I have lost all respect for Michael Crichton as an author. All his stories seem to have \\"zero-impact\\" endings. After all is said and done the worlds in which his novels take place are no different on the last page as they were on page one. This includes Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, that lame movie Demi Moore was in, and Sphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid 'manifestation' of interesting ideas","review":"Cardboard characters purporting to be geniuses in their fields talk textbook drivel while acting like spoiled adolescents. This book makes me never want to read Crichton again. I read Disclosure and quite enjoyed it, but Sphere is preposterous. Not the ideas in it, which concern a spaceship found at the bottom of the ocean, time travel, and the nature of reality. No, all that I could digest. But the poor writing and thin characterizations were almost more than I could bear. Read the Dune series for a rich, complex and involved sci-fi adventure. Crichton is a lightweight and will be forgotten after his career is over and the publishers aren't pushing his cheap writing on us."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a maelstrom into soulessness","review":"I have read little by Crichton. But whatever it was, it made me not enjoy his type of Science Fiction. Two of the few things that I did read were \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"Sphere\\". Both, I thought, hopelessly losing their slowly developing content before me. \\"Sphere\\", however, was an exception, for it was just a non-exaggeratingly empty roll of toilet paper with unwise words and a constant morphing of a worsening story. The story seemed promising and exalted me even when I looked at the appearingly deep-in-meaning cover. I must say that I was constantly saying to myself: \\"What a good book this is!\\" all the way till the four fifths mark. That's where things got so lousy that I even considered quitting on the book, something which I rarely do. To tell the truth, I couldn't believe what pure adulteration of a good initial plot my eyes were witnessing. I finished it, but with much regret and with four days of wasted night-life."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WAS WITH THE ENDING??!!!???!?!!!!!!??????","review":"It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends? I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has a special place in my heart","review":"This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading. I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book. But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end. That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel. This is \\"deus ex machina\\" in its finest form. This is unexcusable in my opinion. I just don't get it. I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages. I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book. This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"With so many good books written, don't bother with this one. Weak plot, page filling words and obvious situations with an obvious ending leaves this book as very ho-hum. Michael must have been under pressure from the publisher to pump this out. Read Timeline or Jurassic Park instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere written by Michael Crichton is a book that will engage you and will not let go. This is the sixth novel written by Crichton and it is intense and the narrative and storytelling suspenseful with nonstop action.Sphere is about a spaceship found in the South Pacific and a team of American scientists that are sent to investigate this astonishing discovery. The resultant story is what really brings the book to your imagination. Crichton has written a most ingenious tale as the team goes through phenomenal dimensions through a roller coaster of emotions and images.This is truly one of Michael Crichton's best, as he is at the top of his form. This book takes right off and will keep you engaged till the end. Be prepared... your imagination is in for a wild ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Good","review":"I love all of Crichton's books but Sphere is by far the best. This page turner will leave you wondering what's going to happen until the very last page. I Rates this book five stars but it really needs ten stars (Jerry is a winner)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plot, more action, a little confusing.","review":"One of Crichton's best! Indeed worth making a movie about! You should enjoy this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but its a bit to long","review":"The book is a good book but it gets to be a litle boring in the middle and the end isent exactly a big thriller. Its plot is fairly complicated so dont read it if your not at least on a 12 grade reading level. It is also graphic and contains swaring."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've seen the movie don't read the book.","review":"I saw the movie, and was so interested that I wanted to see if the book was any good. The book ended up following the plot-line of the movie so closely that the extremely interesting topic was covered up by the knowlege of what was going to happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"gripping, perplexing, and imaginative, sheer genius!","review":"After reading this book, you will be more conscious of yourself, your surroundings, and how precious your life is. You might even understand the role of humans on earth, what makes us different... Just when you think the characters can't get into any more trouble, Crichton takes their desperate situation and smashes it to pieces. It is amazing. Sometimes it gets a bit on the technical side, so if you don't like to read about a lot of scientific information, this book might bore you a bit, yet for those who are interested in the sciences, Crichton manages to take the most advanced perplexing concepts and explain them to the reader with extremely suave. The ending is superb, and I must advise any one who likes science to pick it up today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a really good book.","review":"This book is from the movie \\"Sphere\\" and is written by Michael Crichton. In my point of view, I recommend that you read the book THEN watch the movie because I think that the book is better than the movie. The book comes more to the details than the movie itself. The book and the movie are not the same. Some of the parts in the book are different than that of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"A fan of Crichton's previous books, I didn't like this one very much. It was very predictable. The annoyance of some of the characters i.e. Harry, Ted and Beth really got to me after a while. I was wishing that Beth and Harry would die so that they could shut up. I guess I was wrong. Thank God Ted the most annoying character was killed. But come on a squid attacking the habitat?? It's trite and boring. Also the ending 'Let's just forget about everything and everything will be ok!' What a joke, it only shows society's mentality of thinking that they can solve their problems by magic. The only good thing about this book is that some of the discussions between the characters gives a lot of insight on human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great page turning sci-fi book","review":"What a great book, The human mind is a very powerfull thing, and Michael portraid that very well, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"I read this book when it first came out, and could not let go.

I started it in the morning, and was done by the time I went to sleep. I could not put it down. I've been highly recommending it since then. My favorite character was Harry Adams. He was such a cool guy. This would be a great movie, if done right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"Once I started reading this book, it was hard for me to put it down. It was slow at the begginning like most of Crichton's books, but once it started...I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichton's worst.","review":"A three-hundred-year-old-spaceship at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Sounds interesting enough, right? Well, listen to this. The 'life form' controlling the Sphere inside the spaceship is nothing more than a scientist's 'manifestation' as Crichton calls it. The Sphere is a supposed liason between imagination and reality, creating whatever the person inside it imagines. I give Michael Crichton great credit as an author. (I've read seven of his books.) But he was obviously hurting for a plot when he wrote, (or perhaps 'manifested') Sphere. The story does not flow along smoothly, and the end is big disappointment. If you love Michael Crichton's works, but you haven't read Sphere, I advise you not to. The ending, which wraps up in the final ten pages, is a waste of the other 350 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crichton's Best, Why hasn't this become a movie?","review":"This book is magnificent. The events that occur are mesmerizing as the humans communicate with the sphere. The idea of an entity living in the depths of the Pacific Ocean for 300 years is fascinating. The sphere manipulates the humans thoughts to confuse them about time and recent events. This book is much better than any of Crichton's novels and will forever be a favorite of mine. The only bad part was the ending, which seemed to not have been pre-planned and finished in a rush, but how could you judge the dazzling 350 page story by a 7 page ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Michael Crichton's best book.","review":"Sphere is by far one of the best books I have ever read. It is definitely Michael Crichton's best book. Not only is it his best plot ever, but it is the strongest and most vivid storytelling he has used in his long and illustrious writing career. I liked it so much that when I was done, I forced my mother and father to read it as well, and they also loved it. By all means, read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best suspension novels I have ever read","review":"This book is about the thing I like most. Science Fiction.I love this story because of it's twists and it's ability to keepthe reader's attention. I don't know how to describe it but allI can say is that it is very descriptive and mysterious. I thinkMicheal Chricton has one of the best imaginations in the world"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!!!","review":"Michael Crichton is one of the best writers of our time. This book is a perfect example of this. If you're into science fiction you will like this for sure. This book is much better than the movie. It mixes a lot of technological science fiction with suspense in a well balanced way. If you're a fan of Michael Crichton and haven't read this book. Please do. You will not regret it. It's a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's better sci-fi around","review":"I found Sphere to be pleasantly diverting for a few days, but I guess I'm spoiled by reading novels of late that are actual \\"literature\\". Crichton's writing here just doesn't make the cut. His characters are cardboard (even though he tries to give some a PC twist, like the black mathematician), his prose is utilitarian, terse and vocabulary limited (e.g., he used the word \\"uneasy\\" twice in two pages to describe one character who was lying and one who had a stomach ache), and much of his \\"science\\" is hokey (I say that as a scientist). On the plus side, he does know how to concoct a clever, suspenseful story and reel out just enough of it at a time to keep you turning the pages. My advice if you like sci-fi adventure: your time is better spent reading real writers like Asimov, Verne, Wells, Bradbury, Heinlein and many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good tech writing, interesting plot, but boring","review":"The technology represented in this story is facsinating. The plot is interesting. The story, though just ain't neither. This book's major flaw is that it lacked oomph to pull the reader through to the end. I finished reading it because I felt I owed it to the seven bucks or so that I spent on it. So if you're familiar with his other books, you will be disappointed by this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down... which really disappointed me.","review":"I could NOT put the book down, and that turned out to be disappointing because Crichton doesn't GO anywhere with his fantastic setup. The book should have gone another 200 pages at least. Problems were solved so quickly and easily, and I really didn't like that.Frankly, I don't see how anyone can rate this book a 10. If they do think it is the best book they've ever read, then obviously they haven't read much! They assume that since Crichton has written so many novels that get turned into movies, he is by definition a \\"great writer\\" in today's society. These people simply accept the one-dimensional characters, unanswered questions, and all too easily solved problems presented in this book as \\"fabulous fiction.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!! HIS BEST!! READ NOW!! \\"Brian Gaughan\\"","review":"Toataly awesome his best to date. Some people may say the ending makes them loose respect for Crichton its not true. HELLO they need to ask themselves what would the ending be like if they wrote it and they were at the part Where Harry, Beth, and Norman are in the decompresion chamber thinkin what to say to everyone. I still have full respect for Crichton. Dont listen to those other coments. READ IT THE FIRST CHANCE YOU GET!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting, imaginative!","review":"I finished this book during a 13-hour flight from Chicaga to Tokyo. Frankly, this book didn't impress me very much at the beginning, but halfway through, I was hooked! The first part is a little boring, but from second part, it slowly builds up tension, and reaches climax and I was very impressed by Mr.Crichton's thorough knowledge of zoology and astronomy, and the descriptions of the fictional spaceship is plausible and imaginative.Unlike many others, I like the ending of the book. I think this book would have been a mediocre sci-fi novel if Mr.Crichton had conceived some alien creature in the sphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's the man","review":"He's done it again. If you haven't read any of his stuff this will get you started. His writing style is unparalleled and wildly unpredictable. If you like books that consume you from beginning to end this is the book for you. Once you start you will be a Chrichton JUNKY."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MASTERPIECE!","review":"This is one of the absolute best novels that I have ever read! I love the way Crichton can simply explain difficult subjects like black holes and the difficulty in understanding alien life. I loved the book the whole way through and when I read the ending i was wowed. Read the end carefully..."},{"rating":"1","title":"a few truly fascinating parts, disappointedly weak ending","review":"This book captured my imagination and I think it did the same for most people who read. It posed some intriguing questions about the power of the human brain, something which the human race has been fascinated with from time immemorial but which we still know very little about. The time travel aspect of the book was also interesting, albeit somewhat cliched. All in all, a great novel, its only weakness being a mundane, anti-climactic ending which stands in blatant contradiction with the rest of the plot. --DB"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, predictable, uninspired","review":"I'm a Crichton fan, but I'm very disappointed with Sphere. It's been awhile since I've read it, but I remember thinking how unbelievable most of the book was. I don't know how I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over all this was not a good book","review":"I enjoy reading Mr. Crichton's work. He is an excellent story teller, but this book seemed rushed. He started off with a really good idea: Space ship from the future (American) found enbedding in a reef at the bottom of the ocean. No one was inside except for this sphere. Where did it come from? What does it do? Did it kill the crew? Where did the ship come from? Etc Very intriguing! Then it stopped. The concept concerning what the Sphere could do and how they fought against it was lame. It read as if Mr. Crichton had to hurry up and beat a deadline so he just wrote it and finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"For some reason I hated this one.","review":"I'm giving the book a 3 simply because it was good Crichton.Till the ending that is.

I guess you'll have to read it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crichton's best? Probably.","review":"I was hooked on this book from the moment I read theback cover.

I've never read Crichton before and I don't think I will ever read him again. The only part that I thought made it enjoyable was \\"it ended.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Price Of Self-Indulgence","review":"This book is noticeably more psychological than the author's other novels, but just as suspenseful and engaging. The story deals primarily with the misuse of technology for fulfillment of desire. The characters must deal with a proverbial alien vehicle that changes the human that touches it. Tension throughout the book leads up to a heart pounding ending.It is not the most uplifting, ideal novel, but it's fun recreational reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, weak ending","review":"Michael Crichton is my favourite author. I know this book is greatly hyped--i have a friend obsessed with it--but I think ol' Mike could've done better with the ending. The plot, however is thick and very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Crichton -- which is a good thing.","review":"Let's put it this way: If you liked \\"Andromeda Strain,\\" or \\"Jurassic Park,\\" or other books by Crichton, you'll probably enjoy this. It's good -- if a bit confusing at points, and a bit eccentric at others -- and worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply, Staggeringly, Brilliant","review":"I really was hit in the face with this one! Finished in 2 days, kept me hanging on with addictive force. The way the three scientists manage to solve the mystery of the sphere is amazing, and Chrichton makes it sound so plausible. And the structure and theme of it is a definite cry for us to wake up and see what could happen in our society. Give it a try. It rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichton was not quite \\"on\\" this outing","review":"This book is fast-paced and well written, especially the first half, but the plot is not as well constructed as some of his others. The problem is that subsequent events render earlier events illogical and senseless. The book starts out well but reaches a very disappointing resolution, as if Crichton bit off more than he could chew. The fact that this book was made into a movie demonstrates, yet again, that Hollywood will go with a project of dubious merit if it is attached to the name of a proven winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down","review":"To put it as simply as possible, Sphere is one of those books that once you pick up, you won't put it down. Chricton's style of writing leaves the reader constantly wanting to \\"see what happens next.\\" He entices us with incredibly vivid imagery. Chricton is like the rider of a mule, who is hanging a carrot out in front of the mule. The reader is the mule, always pushing forward. Excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilient, the psycology of the book was excelent.","review":"There is no compare, Crighton is a brilient writer, he can reach into the mind and bring out the trama within."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I Ever Read","review":"Sphere is probably the best book I have read.

I thought it was interesting how he combined sci fi, suspense and psychology all into one book. The technology in this one is a bit dated, but other than that a good, scary read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites.","review":"I've always been a fan of Michael Crichton, but this is the book that captivated me. I startd reading this book, and then I couldn't put it down. The rich plot and wonderful details make this a great book for fans of science fiction. It never get's complicated, but never get's boring either. If you were a fan of Prey, Rising Sun, or Jurassic Park, you will love this book. The charachters are all interesting in their flaws and their good charchteristics. There are a few things that might be confusing though. I can't think of an example but I remember getting mixed up somewhere near the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"sphere","review":"The book Sphere was a superb read. Not being able to put it down I finished it quickly.This story just hooks you. With a great plot, this book is supernatural.

If you like good twists at the end, that changes everything that you thought would happen, you should read this awesome, exciting, yet thrilling book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly imaginative book","review":"What is the sphere? The key to all your dreams, and all your nightmares. It's the one thing that manifests your dreams, your desires, your fears.

If you like Crichton's work, READ THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry but","review":"I'm sorry but that was one of Michael Crichton's worst books. The beginning had me hooked but the end was just stupid. I am also in the making of a book report on this book for English and i'm supposed to pretend i'm selling it but i wouldn't even try to if it wasn't for getting a good grade. The characters weren't very complex and kinda dumb. Norman sounded tired and an idiot the whole time. Beth was insane. Harry was just not there, he was supposed to be rude, smart, and sarcastic all the time but he was not. The ship was pretty cool but they thought the sphere was more important, which it was the point of the story but it was pretty boring. The Sphere really doesn't do anything, its all in Norman, Harry, and Beth's imagination that ends up coming true b/c the sphere shows them that part or power of their imagination to make things real.Oh well maybe its just me who didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What would Scooby do?","review":"Totally predictible.

I am a big fan of Chrichton, I love how he weaves fiction and non-fiction together in his books (he knows a lot about science if his books are any indication). If you saw and hated the movie (as I did), you should still pick up the book because it is far better. The book is very suspensful (if a bit predictable, but if the writing is good then its easy to overlook that). I loved the ending, its different and intriguing, it shows that the real enemy wasn't any of them, but rather the power the sphere had to offer. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second book I read by Michael Crichton","review":"This book was a great read. I read it back in 1998. Soon after the movie came out which ofcourse was not as good as the book. One of Michael Crichtons classic. Another book that own by Michael Crichton. Michael Crichtons recent books are no where near as good as this one. Definetly as must read if your into scfi or Michael Crichton."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 BOOKS IN ONE!!!","review":"That's how much adrenaline pumping, heart thumping, wake up in a cold sweat suspense you'll get in this book!! It has the classic Dean Koontz suspense, the freakiness of John Saul, and the originality of Isaac Asimov. All of these attributes, Michael Crichton has taken as his own, time after time after time. I first read this book in 1989 and I've jumped out of my skin every time I read it... time after time after time. If the movie is made with the same quality and special effect that made \\"Jurasic Park\\" a hit, this movie will be like none you've ever seen. Whatever you do, DO NOT read the last page FIRST!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the Movie will be better","review":"Crighton misses an opportunity to add to the lore about first contact with aliens, through his flat, uninteresting characters. His initial premise about a possible alien ship sitting at the bottom of the ocean is exciting and the twist about it turning out to be a human ship from the future is great. Furthermore, his genius for plot is demonstrated by having the actual alien artifact the Sphere inside the ship.However, his characters were boring. I was hoping they would die. I liked how the Sphere effected them, but I could careless about the people. Hopefully, when this is made into a movie, the actors will be able to make more out of the characters than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO BAD IT WILL BE A MOVIE!!","review":"THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST OF HIS.

In fact, this one takes its place right near the top of the class.\\"Sphere\\" is great science fiction.

What more can a reader ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CRICHTON BOOK EVER!!!","review":"This is the first MC book I'd read, and I've read every one ofhis books since! I was bored at a library, so I picked outa paperback w/ a nice cover, and there we have my favoritenon-classic novel ever! Who says you can't judge a book byits cover? Scientists uncover an alien spaceship from thefuture, but what they discover in the ship is nothing comparedto what they find out about themselves. Mix in high-tech,mystery, suspense (200%!), fear, and there you have THE bookwhich I HAD to finish in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful and Engaging","review":"While not among the very best books I have ever read, Sphere is thoroughly engaging and kept me turning page after page from beginning to end. I've read many reviews that refer to Michael Crichton's cinematic writing style, and it's certainly on display here. (Although, as I've been told, the movie based on this novel was not particularly good.) As the plot unfolded, I was drawn in by the mystery of what is actually happening to the characters, and found myself caught off guard (pleasantly so) a few times as the truth was revealed. A good read, and one that I would recommend to almost anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think that this is one of the better books this year.","review":"Michael Crichton makes you feel like you are there.

Very well thought out, his best book by far. I read it in one day two summers ago, can't put it down. It can be looked at from different angles, dealing with aliens and the concept of black holes, and the unknown. A must read for those who don't think Sci-FI is for them. Basic yet complex, he lays out his theories in layman's terms. Don't base it on the movie, it's much better than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-Fi plus Mystery","review":"This book was very interesting. It combines science-fiction and mystery in one. In fact, I found this book to be so interesting that it is one of my favorites.

The plotline, characterization, and imagery are all top notch. The plot keeps you on the edge of your seat, and keeps you hooked, forcing you to turn the page to read of the next mishap or discovery. Filled with fear, action, and intense situations, this book is a must read for the Crichton enthusiast or anyone else interested in killer sci-fi books."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MODERN FICTION EVER WRITTEN","review":"This book gave me PURE AWE...it's unlike anything you've ever read...people over use the term a \\"page-turner\\", but believe me, this book is just that.

I just finished the book and I appreciate Crichton's advanced, creative and imaginative thinking. However, unlike Timeline, the ending left me wanting an answer. Being a writer myself, I always know the part that a writer just assumes the reader will discover after some thought. Yet, the novel seems to want to stay ambiguious; you're mind is always searching for a concrete answer. Crichton refuses to give you one.Sphere transcends a \\"sci-fi thriller\\" that \\"keeps you in suspense\\". It, unlike most else, makes you think. It also confuses the hell out of you, but (to quote my favorite Gladiator) \\"Are you not entertained?\\" People forget that Crichton isn't writing to answer long asked theological questions; he's writing to make you think and to entertain. After all those vanishing pages, I would answer a definitive yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well written...surprisingly disappointing","review":"Being a Crichton fan, I was very disappointed by this book. Crichton usually writes in a combination of theory and fact, which is what makes his books so interesting. However, this book is just way-out \\"weird dream\\" fiction. If you are a Stephen King fanatic, you may like this...it's just like Tommyknockers, only add an ocean. It was too unbeleivable to be enjoyable. It could have been made interesting if the alien object (the sphere) was the focus of the book, rather than the exploration team. Where did that thing come from then? What was it designed for? And, why? Who knows...in this book all that matters is the 3 member team left at the end of all the weird stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"forbidden planet / solaris redux","review":"His worst book?, same plot as many other sci fi classics - humans encounter alien technology that makes their imagination come true, beware the dark side!

I liked Jurassic Park, I was disappointed by Congo's plot but I liked it's technology, Terminal Man simply frightened me, and Andromeda Strain just left you feeling cheated but when Crichten wrote this book he had the neccessary plot, the needed charachters, the awesome technology, and a theme that blew me out of the water. I would definitely reccommend this book to any lover of Crichton, any loather of Crichten, and simply anyone who likes a good thought once in a while.

Inside, they find a perfectly polished sphere. Everybody in the group has an idea of what it is. Ted thinks that it is a trophy of some sort. Harry thinks that it was picked up on the travels of the ship, and Norman thinks that it is a door of somesort. During a routine day, the sphere opens, and that is when things go very wrong. The ending really tops off the book. Leaving the reader in shivers, the book ends the way that it ought to. Supspensful and very dangerous, this book is one of the best fiction novels I have ever read. Like all Crichton books, it leaves you wondering what if, and is very, very suspensful."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!","review":"This book rates with Crichton's best, and his best is THE best! While the characters could be a little better, the combination of a wonderful plot, great suspense, and knockout writing skill, Crichton puts this one over the top. I loved this book! You don't have to like science fiction to read it, anyone will like it! READ IT NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor character develop. & predictable outcome--NOT MC's Best","review":"Crichton weaves what could be an interesting tale of underwater science fiction, however the characters are unimaginative and the conclusion is easy to predict. Save your money for other Crichton classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST EVER CREATED. THANKS CRICHTON","review":"Before I read this book I didn't like reading much. I started to read this book because I heard it was going to be a cool movie. Once I started to read it I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was actually there with Norman and the rest of the characters. The part where Norman needs to go to the sub and is walking all by himself on the ocean floor and when the giant squid attacked him made me sweat. I think after Crichton comes out with the prequal to Jurassic Park I think he should write the sequal to sphere. I thought the ending to this book was absolutly awesome and could leave the story open for a sequal. I am looking forward to The Lost World movie that is coming out May 24 1997"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing, and rediculous","review":"This book is all setup, and no reward. This is one of those \\"wow, this is so interesting, I can't wait to find out what happens next!\\" type of books. Not only does it dissapoint in the silly \\"let's forget everything.. What should we forget?\\" ending, but halfway through it seems that Chrichton gets bored, and doesn't know where to go. What a waste of hours I spent reading this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp at its worst","review":"Crichton writes \\"blockbuster\\" novels which handily translate to \\"blockbuster\\" movies. Lowest-common-denominator action pulp at its worst. It's not even good science fiction, which genre has a noted tendency to forgive some of the traditional demands of literature (character, style, plot) if the imaginative vistas are nice enough. But this one? Naw, baby, naw. I can't tell you how many times I've groaned in pain when I mention to someone that I read a lot of science fiction; three out of five immediately ask, \\"Oh, do you like Michael Crichton?\\" In a word, no.On the other hand, if you need something for a transatlantic flight, you might find this in the airport. As brain candy, it serves its purpose. Leave it in the john for the next guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book about a Sphere of the 20th Century","review":"Wow, what to say about this book. Well I forget. If you haven't yet read Sphere ignore that last statement. Sphere has everything you would expect from a book with such a title. It has a great sci-fi story that keeps you guessing and guessing, and I don't mean why am I reading this damn book guessing either. Sphere is such an excellent book that I would say without hesitation that Jay should read this book... right now. Hey I said right now. The Pepsi joke just killed me. Now thats great writing, but its the end of Sphere that is so forgetable. As a matter of fact this book is as forgetable as Jays mom, but hey that's just me. So if you are reading this review and just not sure if you should read this, than just stop reading now and buy this book. BUY THIS BOOK! Well there you go you gotta admit it, on a scale of one to ten, I give this book an A... Of course"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sphere by Michael Crichton","review":"Very good book-- Keeps you on the edge as always with his books. He always keeps you on your toes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good...","review":"The only redeeming quality I was able to find in this book was the attention to detail that Crichton paid in compiling scientific information for this poor excuse for a novel. Aside from that, the characters were two-dimensional cardboard cutouts, which prevented me from having any sort of empathy with them at all. At the end of this novel, the biggest mystery I found was how I was able to finish this mediocre piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Crichton at its best.","review":"I love Michael Crichton. I have read nearly all of his books, and this stands out as one of his very best. For everybody that ever took interest in science, you will adore this book. I was sleepless for several nights after reading this book, exploring the possibilities. Even if you hate Sci-Fi, this book will be enormously entertainning because of the master storyteller in Crichton. This is a great book and I highly recommend it to every type of reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!!!!!!","review":"I'm a seventh grader. I loved this book every aspect. It was almost perfect. This time the flaw in this book is the ending; it was horrible. The book itself was great. It had lots of description and mystery. The characters were excelently played out and every page held suspense and kept you wanting to read on. The thing I like about this book is that it's one of those that is science fiction but has the extremely slight chance of happening in real life. The other thing I loved about this book is that you can go back and read it two or three times and always catch some thing new. One last thing, the movie; it was a disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"crichton is no asimov","review":"Reading this, I could tell that Crichton loves big Hollywood movies, filled with young groovy scientists and lotsa shiny special effects. He also loves computers and high technology and space travel and the theory of general relativity. It's a pity then that he can't apply his mind's eye camera and grasp of all things technical to the writing of a decent sf novel - Sphere does has some intriguing ideas about time travel and alien life, but the execution is lousy - uneven pacing, one-dimensional characters and a conclusion that fizzles. If you think this is great literature, go back to reading pop-up books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could picture it so easily.","review":"This book is the best written book I have ever read. I can still se all the details of the book and I read it almost a year ago. I don't remember how much I enjoyed the story but the author created a wonderful picture and I could imagine everything.

I can't believe people actually rated this book one and two stars. They said it to \\"technical\\". Well, I'm twelve and I wasn't confused at all! I am also a big Chrichton fan, and I love all his books. A MUST READ BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SF only a non-SF reader could love.","review":"As an avid SF fan I was disappointed to realize about two thirds of the way into the book that it was basically a mish-mash of the novel Solaris and the movie Forbidden Planet (with the Fruedian \\"Id\\" replaced with a Jungian \\"shadow self\\").(spoilers)There were also some basic plot problems as well that bugged me. At several points the characters were worried that their habitat would run out of air or that it would be destroyed in another attack by the creature. Apparently they forgot that they were parked right next to a half mile long spacecraft that had survived over 300 years on the sea floor and was full of god knows how much breathable air!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Psycho-drama","review":"Sunday, July 09, 2006\\"Sphere\\" by Michael Crichton, 1987This is an interesting book. I started reading it because it seemed better than that J. A. Jance story I had brought with me.It has the distinction of having a psychologist as its hero. There are not too many science fiction books that even have psychologists in them, much less, as the hero. The best part of the story is the end: it makes so much sense and it was so obvious to start with. Then there is the inevitable what happens now that we all feel after a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underwater adventure/psychodrama","review":"What is real and what is just a dream? Be on guard for mysterious events that may alter your perception of reality in this thriller. Crichton injects a fair amount of legitimate science (but unfortunately, along with the unrealistic picture of scuba diving at 1000 ft below sea level) into this intriguing story about the encounter between a team of scientists and an unseen alien named Jerry. Is Jerry a playful child or an entity with no understanding of human morality? How will anybody survive? This book is a must read and much better than the Sharon Stone/Dustin Hoffman movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the vainest of them all?","review":"This mixture of science fiction and horror is really a psychodrama, set 1000 feet below the ocean surface. A team of intrepid scientists is assembled by the US Navy to explore an alien spaceship found in the Pacific. Although we don't entirely solve the riddle about where the ship came from, we do find an incredible sphere inside it, which changes the lives of the scientists. Who can you trust? What is real and what is only imagined? What is reality? These are all questions thrust at our protagonist, an overweight psychologist struggling to keep pace with the other intellectual giants. This book should be made into a movie - not the one with Dustin Hoffman and Sharon Stone - but one faithful to the text. It keeps the reader's attention. Michael Crichton deserves kudos for doing his homework on it, as well. His scientific descriptions are believable, for the most part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"Seems to me it's kids who like this book so much. I can't imangine anyone with brains who think MC is go great anymore. These days he writes with the big screen in mind. I remember reading \\"The A--- Strain\\" centuries ago and it was really D--- good. Someone mentioned \\"The Great Train Robbery\\" which is very good because it's based on a true (note:TRUE)story so MC can't stick any lizard aliens in it. (Why are all aliens lizard-like anyway?

We all know the movie stunk but keep that out of your mind, in fact never see the movie in the first place. If you have to see the movie, see it after you read the book, don't let the movie ruin a wonderfull plot and suspense that the book sphere has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting book on fear, power, and the mind.","review":"The way he described the technology was a definate plus. Everthing he described was very accurate. Especially the Heliox Enviroment. At 1000 feet under water nitrogen becomes leathal so they replace it with helium.The book was slow and dull if you like action. The entire book was about emotions which slowed down the rest of it even more.I do not recomend this book because it is slow and alot of people like fast suspensfull books. If you are a training on emotions the you might read it so that you understand the feelings of uncontrolable urges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeveloped Ideas","review":"Sphere, like many of Crichton's novels, starts off with good intentions. But, unfortunately, it is like walking into a coffee shop with wonderful aromas only to have the promise of the aromas result in ordinary and somewhat dissapointing taste. He could have gone much further with this novel but seems, instead, to only want to play to the superficiality of the masses. His books seem somewhat formulaistic and predictable and he sometimes mistakes a confusing plot for great intellectual insight. But, what the heck, if someone makes it into a movie, it is going to be a best seller regardless of the quality of writing. That is an indictment not of Mr. Crichton but of the general public. Perhaps it is us who is wrong and it is Mr. Crichton who is correct by playing to an audience he knows well. By the way, if you thought the novel was bad, rest assured, the movie was even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a croissant - crummy and flaky","review":"Michael Crichton is one of the most uneven authors around.

This guy's writing is sharp as a tack, witty as hell, and each and every sentence simply will not let you go...hence my Dickens reference, and, believe me, I don't reference our greatest novelist lightly!

As I remember, the reviewer described this book as a combination of Samuel Beckett and Joseph Heller, which isn't a bad description, but the book truly deserves to be given credit as a unique, tender and beautiful work of art. From the first page on I knew that this was one of those books written for me. I loved every minute of the experience of reading this book and when I finished it, in a hotel room in Key West, I knew that it would be a very long time before I found another as good.

Johnsy is dying of a bad case of pneumonia. There is a tree visible through her window, and somehow believes that she will die when the last leaf from this tree falls. She is losing her will to live. Behrman, a frustrated artist living in the same building, often states that one day he will paint his master-piece. Sue informs him of Johnsy's tragic thoughts. The same night, he climbs up the tree and paints a leaf for Sue to see. Behrman becomes very ill from the cold and dies, after painting his master-piece, which is the leaf that will keep Johnsy alive.The story is told in graceful style and dialogue, and was made into a movie later."},{"rating":"2","title":"It rocks!

The person below me said this machine sucks but she's also a first time sewing machine user. Maybe get some lessons before writing a review saying the machine sucks. Maybe it's user error. Even my fiance understands this machine now. It's easy. The stitches are really nice, it comes with some necessary tools.

Upon the first press of the pedal, the bobbin thread jammed - I was unable to remove the jammed thread or even operate the machine without taking it apart. I checked reviews of this model online, and I found a lot of people have had similar problems with jamming.

Once again, my favorite children's author has not disappointed. It is about time someone starts celebrating dads. My husband of 32 years and father of our four children could have easily been the model for this book. How interesting that the official editorial reviews on Amazon panned it. To you in your lofty towers, I say, \\"How about getting in touch with your market instead of your own, perhaps jaded, views about family life as it really does exist today for a vast majority of people?\\" I purchased this book as a read aloud for my classroom and as a Father's Day gift for our son-in-law, who is doing the best he can to be a great dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fathers, read this book.","review":"Every time I read this book it reminds me to be more patient and affectionate with my children.

The Runaway Bunny is the best children's story ever, but this must be the best one about a father I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable!","review":"I borrowed this book from the library to read to my 3-year old. As I'm reading it, I laugh at some of the lines. In my role as a full-time, impatient mom, I am the one who says the scolding lines that the dad in the book avoids saying. My husband is every bit the part of the doting dad in this book. This book is a wonderful reminder of what raising a child is all about - it's not just the rules that we have to have but the freedom to let ourselves have fun and show our kids how to enjoy life."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"A really good book for children about love from parents and family great for my book collecton.

It has great herky-jerky rhythms mixed with very evocative and moody ambient tracks. I especially love the early 80's arcade noises on The Red House. A highly atmospheric and funky collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Byrne's most solid solo work","review":"I don't know what the confluence of circumstances were to make this so satisfying a musical work from David Byrne, but satisfying it certainly is. For all that the Talking Heads were moving into the same \\"funk\\" waters on the band's recordings, here Byrne and musicians make it seem so effortless. One very tangible asset is the crack drumming of the late Yogi Horton, who propels everything with an arsenal of fills, rolls and a spirit of swing. And everything here seems to pull together as a cohesive whole, something Byrne's subsequent solo offerings don't do. I find that once I start playing it, I have to hear the whole thing to the end, it's that tight. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off--don't waste your money","review":"Had the vinyl copy many years ago and basically wore it out beyond playability. Downloaded this from Amazon, hoping to hear the entire score (the vinyl had only half the song selections, but was a very cohesive piece of work). Amazon has chopped these songs up so pathetically bad as to really make this unlistenable. Many (all) of the songs are abruptly cut short in order to make them fit within one download, and the fluidity is gone: no pauses between songs--in fact there is OVERLAP, the segues between many songs are gone, and the entire score is, at best, choppy. What a shame...this was a true masterpiece of Byrne's. Overall this is a very amateurish compilation. Sound quality is good, but if I could give it no stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Experimental Music.","review":"This album contains a lot of experimental music, with a few early Talking Heads type songs sprinkled in.

A Practical Guide to Property Investment.","review":"All too often, books on the \\"practical aspects\\" of real estate investment in income producing properties are nothing more than expositions of simple and often useless concepts. In this book, Mr. Tompos shows that he understands the value of using \\"real-life\\" situations..actual case studies. He deftly shows the reader how to use an inexpensive and portable hand-held calculator... to make all of the critical calculations needed to evaluate an investment property. I am a professor of finance and would recommend this book to any of my students who want to know the \\"how to\\" side rather than the \\"theoretical\\" side of the real estate investment process.

The difference between the two brands is startling! The BonJour frothing tip is a solid wavy metal tip which actually OVER-froths the milk. This causes the bubbles to keep breaking down. I can only achieve a very thin layer of foam and it won't last long. On the othe hand, the Aerolatte frothers(also widely available with several models on Amazon) uses more of an open-metal mesh tip on their wand which must be responsible for how thick and dense a foam it will create. I'm buying another Aerolatte and will use the BonJour wand for things that don't need thick foam (like mixing salad dressing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Froth!","review":"I recently purchase this item and I have used it only once so far, but it was amazing.

This was before rap and hip-hop, etc., etc.There's the mesmerizing guitar sound on Freedom (with a Jesse Johnson feel)...Any true Zapp fan has to have this on c.d. before it becomes obsolete or hard to find. The worst that could happen is it could wind up on an import list where you have to buy the c.d. at a ridiculous import price (yes, it happens).

I don't know if \\"K\\" was pulling her leg or she misheard him, but some of the incidents recounted fail on the \\"ring of truth\\" test and the application of plain logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Twist on the Truth","review":"A well written and fairly well researched book... and an immense disappointment. A married woman, happily undertaking an \\"adventure\\" in landmine-ridden Mozambique with a man who is clearly in love with her. Sadly this, together with the fact that yet another unmarried man also falls for her charms, completely detracts from the story. Furthermore, I am a displaced Zimbabwea, and my father and husband both fought on the wrong side of that war. Their memories of that time are somewhat different to Ms Fuller's, and it's very doubtful that a man as tragic and scarred by his internal demons as K would open his heart to this relatively unknown woman. Having read Peter Godwin's excellent \\"Mukiwa\\" and \\"When the Crocodile Eats the Sun\\" I can honestly say this book falls a distant way behind those two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Don't Let's Go first","review":"After finishing Scribbling the Cat, the reader comes away with a history and an understanding of why it was important for Fuller to write this story. In her signature way, it's honest, interesting and she tells the story without judgement---which is why her writing is so compelling. However, if this book had been written before Don't Let's Go, most readers would not have been compelled to read futher. I think because it is a sort of travel log, it lacks that compelling pull of what happens next because what changes and what is learned is internal within the people in the story. But that being said, if a reader has an interest in Africa, Fuller's life lends us a keen eye to life inside. Read Don't Let's Go first is my only advice"},{"rating":"1","title":"Making a Hash of It","review":"In the end, the reader is left wondering why the Who, What, Where, When is not complemented with the longed-for Why. Namely, why a book that slams to a dead-end? Fuller attempts unsuccessfully (as an afterthought?) to depict herself as someone much in need of \\"closure\\" (not her term) with respect to her white-colonial childhood in war-torn Zimbabwe, and in so doing is overly obtuse in sporadic representations of empathy with ruined lives, black and white. Her stylish, semi-metaphorical descriptions of African ambiance too often seem detached from larger literary purpose, amounting on the whole to high-flown travelogue. The impulsiveness of her travels with a psychically (pre?)-damaged war veteran leads her, and us, nowhere except to disgruntling uncertainties about her, the narrator. Irresolution, multifariously manifested, unfortunately scribbles the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"With so few books about the conflict in Rhodesia, it's disappointing when somebody comes up with something that is so factually inaccurate. Although the story is well written, there are too many mistakes - or exaggerations - to make it a plausible or credible account of the Rhodesian war, and the people who fought it.Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scribbling A Book","review":"This was a huge disappointment for me because I really enjoyed Fuller's book, \\"Let's Don't Go To The Dogs Tonight.\\" Problems with this title included a lack of focus for the first half, followed by an apology for a wartime event (during the Rhodesian conflict) that suddenly becomes a vehicle for slandering the efforts of those who fought against communism and terrorism. I tried to read on, but after a few more pages my copy found its way into a McDonald's trash can near Gate 17 in Reagan National."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was definitely a let-down after \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\", which I thoroughly enjoyed. I found \\"Scribbling\\" to be rambling and without purpose at times. It seems unfinished and incomplete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"There is a certain subgenre of literature about the Third World that insists on reminding the reader of the heat, bugs, filth, poverty, and misery on every page, turning the problems of the developing world into a sort of fetish. Scribbling the Cat epitomizes the style. In this book full of vivid images, very little actually happens; the protagonist, \\"K\\", is a crazed, violent pseudomystical freak on page ten and a crazed, violent pseudomystical freak on page 250. Two stars not one due to Fuller's strong, vivid prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest Account of Africa","review":"The author should have stated that this book was fictitious rather than stringing the reader along. The first few chapters are engaging, but it is unrealistic that she would leave her family and, on a whim, travel with \\"K\\" to his old Rhodesian War haunts. It was also a fallacy to suggest that she was so naive as to not pick up on his attraction for her. I was truly dissapointed by the self-promoting arrogance of this author and the trivialized generalizations that were haphazardly made about Africa. A true waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Myth creator","review":"After reading Fuller's first book I was surprised at the uncritical praise given to it. It was hardly credible given her age at the time of the events. The post-modernists might excuse her but given that it was supposedly autobiographical I found it hard to trust. The same is true of her latest work. There is an air of exaggeration about it that left me wondering whether this is a work of fact or fiction. Ms. Fuller certainly seems to have some trouble with depicting other than an extremely biased and overly emotional rendition of life in post-colonial Africa. Perhaps the fact that she has chosen to live in the USA contributes to her angst but if one wants to balance out the story she tells I suggest Paul Theroux's \\"Dark Star\\" and the works of others. There are far more intelligent and better written books on the market than that which Ms Fuller has written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great visual dictionary","review":"Very good and helpful visual dictionary, but I could not give it 5 stars because it lacks the plural form of the nouns. I also wish that the pictures pertained more to German culture. The picture of the textbook showed the textbook with korean writing.

This book is small enough to be called a pocket visual dictionary and has an exceptional variety of clear, well-organized, indexed images.While some categories, like the human anatomy section, provide detailed vocabulary well beyond my needs, other sections are wanting of some basic classroom vocabulary. Words like binder and binder paper are not included, but I have yet to find another visual dictionary that includes them. The addition of plural forms of nouns would also be a boon, but it is still a great dictionary. I recommend it to my German I students as a means of linking German vocabulary directly to images rather than always translating to English."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Coolest Book Ever for this German-Learner","review":"I am learning German usingRosetta Stone Version 3: German Level 1, 2 & 3 Set with Audio Companionand so total immersion and learning via images and photos works for me.

So, I checked Amazon to see if they have any foreign language visual dictionaries and they have this one and it is completely comprehensive and includes just about every single photo/German word association imaginable, including technical words.

She isn't afraid to reveal the truth about herself (all of it), and in doing so, she challenges the conscientious reader to do the same.While I would highly recommend this book to anyone, I would ESPECIALLY recommend it to women who feel trapped in abusive relationships.

I think the B-52's one-upped themselves from their great debut album on Wild Planet, and as far as I'm concerned this is their best work. Don't dismiss it as being musically simplistic like the \\"professional\\" reviewer here seems to think, either; they sort of invented a whole new genre here. I can see how some of the reviews consider this to be simple party music, but I can still listen to this 30 years later (ugh, where does the time go!) and it doesn't feel that dated, which is the hallmark of good music. If you don't get a your head bopping at least a little to this you are probably clinically dead. Put it this way; here I am talking glowingly about this album and I'm a Death and Heavy Metal fan, so what does that tell you? Great stuff, and I personally have not seen or heard of a band that captured this sound the way the B-52's did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music but horrible transfer from master","review":"This is one of my favorite albums but the transfer from analog to digital is really horrible. I can not listen to it. It sounds like it was recorded under water. I put on the vinyl copy when I want to dance this mess around.Please Warner Bros. Remaster this CD! To you buyers, spring for the compilation CD's if you have to have any of these songs in the digital format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best","review":"This album is too often seen as a weak followup, hiding in the shadows of the band's debut album. I really can't agree with that standpoint-- the songs here are very good and are generally better than on the band's other albums. \\"Private Idaho\\" is the catchy radio classic, but \\"Party Out Of Bounds,\\" \\"Strobe Light,\\" and \\"Give Me Back My Man\\" are all prime slices of B-52 wonderfulness, and the darker feel of the entire album (as opposed to that of the debut) really helps the band's sound a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good machine, so-so headphones.","review":"When my old portable CD player finally gave up the ghost, I was mortified to learn that the maker had discontinued that model. On the recommendation of a friend, I picked up this COBY MP3 CD player. I have smart friends.This unit plays crisply and cleanly with absolutely no skipping. The headphones that came with it were okay, but they weren't very flexible. I took my headphones from my old player and what a difference! Not only was the sound louder but I got much more bass. So five stars for the machine but only three for the headphones. Thus the 4-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say no to Coby","review":"The sound on the unit is very good. You can recharge rechargeable batteries while in the unit. Only one inch thick. These are things that earn the CD player two stars.The quality/durability of this Coby CD player is horrid! It only lasted a few months, just like the earlier review. It also skipped all the time, meaning the skip-protection barely worked at all, and it's the stupid meter protection, the one where you have to wait for your skip-protection, which in reality isn't TRUE SKIP-PROTECTION.There are a few features, but for $30, a CD player that lasts a few months isn't worth that.

With the exception of a few killer tunes like \\"Tube Snake Boogie\\", \\"Pearl Necklace\\" & \\"Party On The Patio\\" this release sounds like a bunch of songs that were headed for the \\"Deguello\\" scrap-heap. I would give this 3 stars if it were not for one of the worst songs ZZ Top ever recorded \\"Heaven, Hell Or Houston\\". I find the song virtually unlistenable (at least in the cd format you have the skip track button...20 years ago I'd have to lift the needle by hand to get to \\"Party on the Patio\\").

A Ballad? From ZZ Top? yes, and a damn good one at that. Billy Gibbons guitar playing is completly amazing on 'Pearl Neckless' and the songs not about what youthink its about which makes it that much better.Other then 'Tube Snake Boggie' 'Heaven Hell Or houston' and 'Pearl neckless' El loco really lacks musical quality!

I tried a comb and almost pulled my hair out. My hair definitely stayed in place, but it was SO stiff I couldn't get a brush through it. If I don't brush my hair before I wash it, it's just one giant snarl, so there is no way I would've been able to wash it with that hair spray in it. If you're looking for a hair spray that will hold your hair in place, this will work, but I would not recommend it.

I have seen both episodes it is based on - Welcome to the Hellmouth and The Harvest - but that didn't stop me from enjoying it.

Much better than most. It's intelligently written and the story develops into two love stories between the same two women -- the first being lust based and the second of loving someone even when it isn't easy. The sexual tension develops realistically. What I really liked is that once the \\"straight woman\\" realizes she has woman-to-woman desires she acts decisively with her family, friends, and in her business. I really hate the \\"I have so many doubts -- is this right for me\\" plot in most novels of this ilk -- and this book doesn't go that route which was a refreshing change. I hope this author writes many more books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome story with terrific and witty characters, a wonderfully endearing romance","review":"Fantastic page turning writing. A great story that spans several years. You really get to know the people. The story is a wonderful romance that develops into a relationship not only with themselves but also their families and friends. The characters are utterly endearing without being stereotypical. Wonderful humor as always from this author.There is a plot development halfway through the novel that caught me by surprise as it was not typical of a romance, so be prepared for a very intense read.

Almost every track has vocals, very smooth soulful light R&B vocals. The vocals tend to be the main focus, rather than the interesting sounds or creative programming that made beanfield's previous albums catch my interest. The songwriting and arrangements are consistently non-offensive. and maybe a bit bland to my ears.Great brunch music. Not very exciting though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beanfield - Seek","review":"Beanfield has always been attuned to downtempo jazz, and their 3rd album, SEEK, doesn't stray from this. Ernesto certainly adds some soul to the pizzicato strings of \\"Chosen\\" and the smooth house vibe of \\"Someone Like You.\\" But it's Bajka who adds the most vocal spice, with her unique phrasing and moments of spoken word on \\"Tides\\" or the twinkling electro of \\"Home.\\" But Beanfield does just as well with its instrumentals.

The plastic scoops tends to gouge the boat cushions or fiberglass decking leaving black marks that are nearly impossible to remove. This tube is also fun for adults who don't want to end up getting dumped in the water at 35 miles per hour. I have used this tube with 3 small adults (all women) and they had a blast.

Each chapter tells what happened to her at some point in her life, and the events are so universal that ANY one could relate to them.

We see things like Notre Dame, a ticket to ride the Metro, and a gendarme. The illustrations are just lovely, done in a style that helps provide a leaping off point for imagining even more about the story. A marvel of brilliance masquerading as simplicity!

There's even the shower scene of the two of them lamenting wether to get rid of one man they've hung onto for a while.There's also a couple near-by doing a survey, and like the classic film there's a similar run-in between the wife and the vampire ladies.One of the few new elements is that the vampires become encased in a skin/cocoon.

My girlfriend kept an old copy of \\"Sloopy\\" stashed in the glove box. I almost crashed her sedan as she read aloud the first lines of \\"Sloopy\\".McKuen's writing style, a strange combination of self love and bombast, mixed with bad grammar and awkward metaphors, will ever serve young poets as an example of how not to write free verse.

Every zeitgeist has its prophet, and Prince definitely saw the 80s in all its glory and perversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"his most honest","review":"this album concieved by one person was a testimont to the genius of prince. it was brutally honest and put things out in your face. and the music took chances like Head and the funky board solo or when you were mine which is still solid to this day. uptown was banging. if Prince had have stayed like this he would have been if not the most scary artist one of them.he pushed his heart and soul in this one.and like one of the reviewers that wrote said it best from this post that the honest and emotion is missing from today's music nobody does it anymore and sadly more importantly Prince. to appreciate his music,the vocals,and his vision this is the album.before what today goes for risque this was it.back when prince was badd and didn't give a damn.back when he was good unlike now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic Prince.","review":"Before he started getting all, uh, serious about things, Prince offered this great funk/rock masterpiece from '79 that sounded like nothing else at the time. The title tune alone is worth the download price. This is a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds great, but big skipping issue.","review":"Just wondering if anyone else is having this problem? My first copy skipped a lot on side two. Amazon just sent me a replacement disc and this one skips as well. My player and needle are fine and working well on other discs, including other 180 gram vinyl. I just wanted to see if this is a common issue from others who have purchased this disc. It's a bummer because the new remastering sounds terrific otherwise. It's the best I've ever heard Dirty Mind sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"His first masterpiece of songs. The sleazy, sexy atmosphere, mixed with a collection of songs that doesn't include even one less than genius song, this album was the album Prince tried to one up allt he way until 1999, where he actually perfected and expanded upon this style to the point where it was time to move on. To Purple Rain.Any ways, not one song on thsi album is bad. Dirty Mind, When You Were Mind, Sister, Head, Uptown, christ. All amazing funk songs. The ballads are good too, but really the funk is what hits you hard on this album. If you are interested in Prince, this is a good album to start with, but it's also good to just get them all from this to Sign O The Times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, unrelenting funk!","review":"Unfortunately, since Prince's name change, his \\"weirdness\\" has overshadowed his music. That is a real shame, because he has released some of the most incredible music of the past thirty years!Dirty Mind is probably my all time favorite Prince album. It still has all of the bite that it did when it was released 20 years ago. Time has not diminished it one bit! The music here breaks down barriers. For example, When You Were Mine combines Funk, New Wave, and The Beatles. The lyrics are definitely not for the faint of heart. But, if you like music that gets in your face and takes chances, look no farther!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirty Mind=Good,clean fun!","review":"His late seventies albums as well as his output throughout the eighties could do no wrong;1980's'Dirty Mind'is a prime example of the tremendous power and inspiration of an amazing artist able to tap into the very sources of creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince's first mainstream strike blows pure genius.","review":"Prince writes and plays with a no holds barred type of sound and genius. Dirty Mind takes us on one ride through and endless highway of sexual backroads, that only Prince knows the directions to. An early taste of musical revolution the world will never soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"\\"Dirty Mind\\" in my opinion is the greatest Prince album ever. With a mixture of funk, r&b, soul, sexuality and glitter, it represents the best of post 70's music. My only complaint is I wish it were somewhat longer, maybe 15 minutes to and hour. But other than that... it RULES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking for its time","review":"Whne I was in High school in the late 70s and early 80s, we eagerly awaited the yearly release of new Prince Albums (as the overall state of R&B; was so dismal at the time).This was one of his most, er..\\"interesting\\" ones. Quite shocking for 1980-81. He actually sings of the \\"joys\\" of incest with \\"Sister\\" and \\"Head,\\" well, that speaks for itself. The title tune and \\"Do It All Night\\" were not so hot. \\"Party Up\\" was quite raw for it's antiwar chant near the end (considering that the US was not actually involved in any war at the time).The original album had a nice poster of Prince's original band that would be later known as the Revolution.It's interesting also to consider that while the kids who listened to this in 1980-81 upset their parents by listening to \\"Dirty Mind\\", these very same kids are now upset over THEIR kids' rap cds. Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"No-Ad provides great coverage","review":"As a scuba diver, No-Ad Sunblock 45 provides me with protection from sun rays without being greasy.

But this new \\"expanded\\" and enhanced CD is a travesty.It's pretty unbelievable that this \\"expanded\\" version still contains the 5-minute version of \\"Il Triello\\" (The Trio) that cuts off abruptly and without any proper buildup or denouement at the trumpet fanfare. And considering that \\"Il Triello\\" is one of the defining pieces in the entire score, and represents perhaps THE defining moment in the movie, it's also unacceptable.My advice is simple: Skip over this one and order the Italian import version, which is easily available from Amazon. It's titled under the movie's Italian title, \\"Il Buono, il Brutto, il Cattivo.\\" It may cost more, but it is well worth it almost for the complete \\"Il Triello\\" alone, as well as the complete 6-minute \\"Story of a Soldier.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Go With The Import.","review":"Get the import \\"Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo\\", by GDM. The sound quality is ten fold better. The expanded version does not do Morricone's talent any justice. And it still has the abridged version of \\"The Trio\\".A bit off topic, I found the same problem with Ikura Ifukube. Again a brilliant composer (known for Godzilla), again short changed by American released CD's. Always go for the import it seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"the good, the bad & the ugly","review":"Again a great soundtrack of Ennio Morricone, just for people who knows to taste great soundtrack scores, a must have!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only The Good...No Bad Or Ugly","review":"Ennio Morricone's score for \\"Il Buono, Il Cattivo, Il Brutto\\" is very good. Featuring previously unreleased music, this score has it all: suspense, action, betrayal and melancholy at the horror of war. Great companion to the movie. My only gripes are that the score for the duel isn't exactly the same as in the movie and the main title theme isn't repeated at the end of the score. Ennio Morricone has done a masterful job with this soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ever popular ringtone","review":"I heard the main theme as a ring tone and I still have not found that as a download. This is all the music from the movie and it is timeless. This is music that is still in use in Hollywood today and it is a common theme in many shows. Tarantino is not the only one that uses it. I would have liked to have all of Morricone's music from Leone's Westerns on one disc but they did not make one or I could not find it. Still this disc is well worth the price and I have some of it on the computer at work and the trumpet is awesome. I get fired up just listening to those songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack score","review":"This soundtrack is very good and quite easy to loose yourself while listening. The track listing is in order with the film which makes it easy to follow. Ennio Morricone did a superb job on this score from the opening theme to the final showdown it is all here along with some bonus tracks. The only thing this disc lacks, as mentioned by another reviewer, is that there could be some dialouge between tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This item is the June 1965 edition of the Reader's Digest.

I would say it's a must have for teachers too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Math Review","review":"This was recommended by our son's 1st grade teacher, we borrowed hers and then bought our own. It's a great family book that incorporates math into fun games. We have a 1st and 4th grader and it works great for both of them. The reviews and suggestions are appropriate and easy to use.

I decided I wanted to start my daughter off ENJOYING math and not get her too caught up in workbooks right now. Well after using it for a week, my daughter says math is her favorite school subject. She loves reading, but if given the choice, she chooses to do math first.The book is sectioned out into different math topics. Then, within each topic, there are multiple activities/games you can do with your child. These games are labeled according to 3 different levels so you can determine if your child is ready for that particular game. The activities are simple, use items easily found in your home, and most importantly fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey confection","review":"This is a good tasting product but way too costly.

Some of the best travel writing anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can adventure writing be so dull?","review":"I found this book to be extremely boring - it jumped from topic to topic, from location to location, without any explanation of who, why, where etc., and no sense of \\"leading into...\\". I had just read Bill Bryson's books and found them most entertaining, but Tim Cahill, I just could not identify with. He's certainly had major adventures, but his style is just so unemotional, so factual i.e. I did this, went there, climbed that, drank that... but I just couldn't identify with him. No empathy or amusement whatsoever. I love adventure books but this one I just found very dull and unimaginitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim Cahill is lots of fun","review":"The best thing about Tim Cahill books, this one included, is that they are made up of perfect end-of-the-day-sized chunks that whisk you off to far points in the company of a humble but articulate and informed travelling companion. For everyone who may never spelunk, rappell, canoe down the Amazon, or face bison in mid-winter, but wishes they could!If you liked this, you'd probably like \\"Pecked to Death by Ducks\\" even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Cahill has perfected the art of the short travel essay\\"","review":"One of my favorites. Author of Pecked to Death By Ducks and A Wolverine is Eating My Leg, Cahill, a founder of Outside Magazine, has perfected the art of the short travel essay. There are man-eating sharks, dangerous cave diving, eating cheese in a yurt in Mongolia and all sorts of ridiculous first hand escapades all over the globe. He is brilliant and brilliantly funny. Perfect travel book to take along on a trip. If you want to learn how to write, read Cahill and pay close attention to his introductions and conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, three-and-a-half","review":"Cahill is fun to read; not as funny as Dave Barry, and not as (what?) thoughtful or thought-provoking as John McPhee, but fun. Cahill is (or does a good job of convincing us he is!) a Regular Guy in the Dave Barry sense, but he gets paid to go to interesting places and do exciting things. He tells us what that's like in a friendly journalistic style laced with well-done humor.One warning: the sequencing of the essays leaves something to be desired. In particular, the last four or five pieces are all rather dark and dismal contemplations of tragedy and mortality, with almost no humor. You might want to read them first, or sometime in the middle, rather than come away from the book on such a depressing note."},{"rating":"2","title":"A adventure traveling Dave Barry","review":"Tim Cahill is the Dave Barry of the outside world. I subcribe to \\"Outside\\" magazine just to read Cahill's articles. Most of his stuff is funny, but he is serious at times, but not for long. This book is a nice anthology of his earlier articles. If you like the outdoors and like to laugh, get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, with one fatal flaw...","review":"This book is a beautiful edition, and serves the purpose of explaining sybolism in art quite nicely. There is, though, one flaw: Most of the large color plates are spread across the spine of the book. This is not a problem for most, but as an art student, studying the paintings with 15% lost in the spine is a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe someone would publish this book","review":"Author Ed Sanders cannot write to begin with. Making sound effects is another annoying matter. I guess he wrote this book like he is talking to someone. But, speaking and writing is really a different matter. I don't know if his facts are all correct but reading through this book is difficult because the auther cannot, I repeat, cannot write. I first thought maybe Sanders is a foreigner, but I think what he really needs is to go back to grammer school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad","review":"I did not care for this book. It contained more speculation than fact, and it contained many discrepencies. There are better books written about the Tate-LaBianca murders. The only good thing that I can say is that it has some good pictures, but thanks to the internet, these can be found anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the cover was impressive","review":"Sanders' writing was so abysmal that I couldn't stomach more than one chapter of this book. The continuity was fragmented and jolting. Facts were stacked on top of each other helter skelter (pun intended) with no apparent connection between them. And the prose was so sophomoric and smart-alecky that it was embarrassing to read. How did this book every get published? Didn't the publisher have any editors on board to tame Sanders' bizarre use of the English language into a readable narrative?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never finished this book","review":"This was a poorly written book and I lost interest in it about 20 pages in. It felt like the author was just trying to make some money (another book about someone elses misfortune, pain etc) and rewriting the same information other people have already written. This subject is like the game \\"telephone\\". Wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD BOOK AT ALL!","review":"Sorry to say it, but this book is not very good at all. There is no depth or scope to it, not getting inside the people. The writing it tricky and flashy and does not balance out with the horrors these people perpetrated. I do not believe this author got to know his subject matter very well, and has offered only a glib, clever style to cover up for his lack of understanding his subject. I have read the book, MANSON, by John Gilmore, and find it to be the best one showing the Manson side of the story. HELTER SKELETR shows it from the police side. Either are better than this poorly done book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 Star Because ) Stars Isn't An Option","review":"How did this get published? This is without doubt one of the worst writers in the world. Don't waste valuable time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for effort","review":"Sanders seemed to have had good intentions when he wrote this book, but halfway through his effort he seems to have had the sudden idea to instead begin regurgitating Bugliosi's book, thus rendering the entire work useless for those interested in learning more about the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plug Plug Plug","review":"Although I am a \\"fan\\" of this subject (and I don't think it is appropriate to term it that way) I found this book to be a collection of facts and stories from those who know and a huge way for the author to plug his own projects. If I had to read about his damn record (which he names several times in the book with very loose ties to the actual story ) I was going to throw it against the wall. I do not think I learned anything that was not covered in \\"Helter Skelter\\" and the authors use of slang was, in my opinion, a pathetic attempt at being cool.Dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sorry, Disappointing Read","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Not that I expected much from Ed Sanders, who is generally a very pompous, self-important writer, but I had hoped for some serious info on Charlie Manson. What I got here was more of Sanders posturing about what a great writer he is. The sobering fact is that he isn't. Save your money and don't waste your time looking for any insight into Charlie Manson in this one.

You can only guess which period of time she is talking about at any given point as the author does not go into great detail about Status Quo or what they did/do/plan to do. It is really a typical book by a dumped ex-wife with all the customary bitterness attached. You end up not believing her as she loses her objectivity early on. At the end of the day she was married to an amazing musician in a band that is now an institution. Who cares about Parfitt's personal life. Tell us about the band.

It is written on the box \\"Made in China\\". Caution: All three plastic circuit board standoffs were broken when I received this product. Lucky I heard the pieces bouncing around inside the case before I plugged this device in or the circuit board would have shorted against the metal case. Had to install new standoffs before use. Also, when this device is turned off, the caps hold a steady 8V on the variable leads so be careful not to leave voltage sensitive devices connected while turning this thing off. Potentiometer to adjust the voltage on the variable side is not of good quality, so adjusting to accurate voltage is hard to accomplish.

I bought it because at the high altitude where I live, it takes forever to cook beans and potatoes. Boiled potatoes used to take an hour, now take ten minutes. Beans which I'd boil for five hours were still a little chewy, but they're perfect now at fifteen minutes (but still need an overnight soak). Another benefit is that quick cooking keeps the kitchen cool in summer.

Forget being afraid of pressure cookers. Besides being an elegant piece, it is safe and the food ( kiss ). I joined Yahoo's pressure cooker group and learned a lot. But it's common sense that a condensed, confined good combination of food locked in pressure is going to emit a wonderful taste. I cannot believe I waited to try it. Now I play games with it. I used to cook even frozen veggies in water: duh. Now add beans to cooker, add seasoning, little water ( but enough ), seasonings, cream of mushroom soup, ff onions and parmesean. Bring to 2nd red line for 7-8 minutes, and let pressure come off. We are not talking normal frozen green beans here folks.Every meat peals off. Add Marsala. Add sherry.But I must say the Kuhn Rikon flipped me. Get one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, but pricey","review":"I had not used a pressure cooker before so this was an experiment for me. So far I am thrilled. Risotto is now very easy and comes out perfect. Wild rice in 10 minutes puts it on our menu in place of the one time faster white rice. And making a lamb curry with a cheap cut of lamb was amazing. The frying pan pressure cooker was used for the curry. Pressure cooking a takes a little practice to find out what setting on your stove to use to get the different pressure levels. But after about four batches of rice I think I know all I need to know.I bought this pressure cooker because I had various Amazon coupons etc. It is more than twice as costly as others, and I am not sure that is justified.

I've already spent alot of $ for a product that requires expensive replacement parts? I bought this for my Indian curries and beans but I find my enameled cast iron pot or cladware work just as well.

Or the right way to iron a shirt (I could never quite get it right), and why you should iron everything while damp.Betty knows her laundry, and I'm SOOO glad I know about Betty. I cannot reccomend this book highly enough. My girlfriend loves it too. We take it to the laundry room with us just in case, often referring to it when we're not sure what pile to put what in, or what to wash in cold or hot, or what to hand wash (and how).

I originally heard of them from an old split CD with Dawson High, but wasn't that interested at the time. Once I heard them though, they immediately became my favorite band. From Brett Detar's perfect vocals, to Josh Kosker's amazing guitar riffs, this CD is perhaps the best indie rock album of '99. Check out \\"August In Bethany\\", one of my personal favorites. - Jesse of The Rejection Set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smiling with musical infatuation....","review":"The Juliana Theory is a rock and roll band that has the rare ability of sounding good at any speed or rhythm. When this record blasts from my speakers an atmosphere of enjoyment and confidence seems to cascade from their music. It seems to me that when The Juliana Theory decided to make a record they just decided to go into the studio and have fun. This entire album rocks so effortlessly; this band feels there own music and as a result the fans feel it. I don't mean to sound introspective of the members of The Juliana Theory but everything blends so effortlessly, the lyrics drift through the shallows of all that is mellow and relaxed and then gush into beautiful rockin' choruses. Every song demonstrates a new emotion and vivacious melody that will send your head bobbing regardless of what mood you are in......By the way, The Julian Theory could be inflexibly categorized as emo, or emo-core, but I hate categorizations so let's just say they are rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is the Closest thing to perfect songwriting","review":"Wow!! This CD is amazing!! The songwriting is good, the vocals and simply everything about this CD kicks. The songs are pretty relateable. Especially The Closest Thing.

The rest of the songs are also great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Garage Band Ever!!!!","review":"From a guy who played garage band music for years, Brett has really pulled his stuff together this time.

It's a bit more rocky (more electric guitars), although there are some beautiful pop melodies.Case in point: \\"August in Bethany.\\" That is one beautiful song. The melody will sweep you away into dreamville (I'm starting understand what the title means). Some other great tracks include \\"Music Box Superhero\\" and \\"The Closest\\" (which contains some very well-written lyrics).So, no, it's not as good as Emotion is Dead. Like I said, few bands could create a masterpiece like that. But this is one wonderful CD. Play it when your friends are over. They'll be like, \\"Hey!

There is some amazing guitar work. I think all the vocalists are awesome, not just brett, although brett is very incredible. Although the music isn't quite as passionate or EMOtional (heh heh) as, say, Appleseed Cast, it has more pretty stuff. The content of the CD leaves something to be desired, though, and I think some of the songs' lyrics get repetitious. If you are looking for a Christian emo band, don't buy this CD. Look for Brandtson or Appleseed or Right as Rain. If you are looking for a beautiful CD, this one would be good. Oh, I also thought I'd mention that although the drumming doesn't suck or not fit in, it's pretty easy stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing but emotinal","review":"This is a awesome CD.

The author provides depth and variety to his human interest coverage but makes a large number of egregious factual errors, all of which are avoidable. Just a few corrections: some US torpedo planes DID return to their carriers; Geo. Gay of VT-8 did NOT receive the Medal of Honor; SBD and TBD armament is incorrectly described; and for some vague reason the Yorktown dive bombing attack that sank the Japanese carrier Soryu is glossed over in one short paragraph.

I have arthritis in my hands and it's a breeze to use for me. As nothing on the opener touches the food it stays clean which was a big issue for me. I didn't like having to use two different openers for my dog food and people food or having to wash openers your not suppose to wash. The little jaws on the side to grasp and pull off the top is ingenious and works very easily. Since it separates the lid from the can by what looks like releasing the glue I've never noticed any debris or shavings of any sort in the food. I will never use any other opener as long as these are on the market as the quality is also excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stays clean","review":"Since this works by basically prying open the connection between the top of the can and the sides, it doesn't cut down into the food/liquid inside the can. That means it stays clean!I gave up on my trusty SwingAway after many, many years because, in spite of taking care, rust finally did it in. Traditional can opener blades get wet and dirty as they puncture through the top of the can, and you'll spend more time caring for the can opener than opening the can, if you want it to last.This opener doesn't touch the can contents. Go around once, then turn the knob backwards a bit to release the grip of the opener, then (use the little side pliers on the opener, if you like) lift off the top. Open can, clean can opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't use lid to squeeze contents","review":"It really does cut smooth. I can RUB my finger against it and not get cut. It's also built very sturdy.

I do this still but it's more difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!! Worth the price :)","review":"This is an excellent can opener worth the price as well. I love it nothing can beat this.

Luckily the can was just a few inches from the counter and no major spill. Could not open that can completely after re-tries and had to bend the top with pliers. Tried another large crush tomato can but with that one I kept the can on the counter while cranking so it wouldn't drop off the opener. It made it all the way around with a clean cut but was a little awkward. Another awkward thing, even with small cans, the crank is on the top instead of the side. Kind of have to lift your elbow while cranking. Side crank would be more comfortable, don't have to lift elbow. The opener is well made, nothing flimsy about it and Im sure will last a long time. Just the design and performance is least to be desired. I recommend buying one with a side crank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work!!!","review":"I bought this item because my wife likes the Kuhn Rikon Garlic press top rated by Cook's Magazine.I have tried this can opener on several cans.

And my old hand Swingaway can opener worked great for 20 years + , but the problem with that was that the food particles attached to the stainless steel and I couldn't clean it no matter what - cat food, tuna juice, tomato soup - all dark spots on the old can opener.

It does the job every time, and the extra $10 or so you'll spend buying this is worth every penny.I have to say however, that the first time I used it, it did its job so efficiently that it took me awhile to realize the can was actually open. You will need to use the little teeth on the side to grip the lid and lift it off the can. Now it sounds trivial, but I was totally flummoxed the first time. In fact I opened the can two or three times before I realized it was actually OPEN, I just needed to lift the lid off.Besides that first time issue, it's been fabulous. The edges it creates are not sharp so it's a very safe little device too. And it's handsome to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best can opener I have found","review":"I could never find a decent can opener that would do the job like this one does. This one really works every time and I love how it opens the cans around the side instead of the top. You can put the cover back on the can if necessary and also it's so much safer. There are no sharp edges. Seems like I was always getting cut when washing and recycling the cans - that doesn't happen anymore with this can opener. Wish I could have found it sooner. I purchased the stainless steal one so it would last. I am thrilled with this can opener!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"Best I've ever seen.

The grahics, are stupendous. (for an original xbox game) I love the game play to it too. Some people are dissapointed you can just gun down random pedestrians, (like grand theft auto) but it dosen't bother me any. Because if you've seen the movie, Tony Montana never did kill pedestrians!

It's definitely one of my favorite impulse buys. Listening to the CD is like listening to a classic rock station. The styles of every song are a little different (leading some to say that there is no continuity/no clear voice to the record) but in the end it's a rock record that combines sounds from the late sixties to early eighties. It's a great break from the deluge of pop-masquerading-as-rock that is all over the radio. A great CD to jam to in your car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Killed the Zutons?","review":"The Zutons first (I'm assuming) album is amazing for those who like a variety of rock genres. The Zutons remind me of Modest Mouse, just a calm sort-of rock feel about them. The tunes are catchy.. The band is really talented. This is the first album I've listened to in which I haven't had to skip any boring songs. Every song is worth while. I recommend this to anyone and everyone. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good...check out The Coral","review":"First off, this is a really good album...quirky, ambitious, catchy and a whole lot of fun. Not to take anything away from The Zutons, but they sound almost EXACTLY like The Coral, who've been around for about 5 years. Anyone who likes this album will love The Coral's debut (which is self-titled). The Coral's second album (Magic & Medicine) is also good but pales in comparison to the first one. Check 'em out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Debut!","review":"I just saw these guys (and gal) on Aug. 2nd, 04. Man, what a live set. This is one of the few bands that is hard to place. They definately carry a vintage vibe. There are some classic rock sounds, there are some nice folky songs (but not traditional), there is a bit of Mo-town, a bit of ska and a splash of rockabilly! Now blend it up, shake it, and play it loud. If you are not infected by the songs, check your head, eh?This is the record that I hoped the band the Coral would follow up with, but they didn't.Buy this and enjoy introducing them to you buddies.ps...after the show (they opened or co/headlined) for Cosmic Rough riders) we were able to meet them and hang out for a while. Great people, great fun. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No one killed The Zutons !","review":"This band is not only alive and kicking, but, they're actually breathing life back into hum-drum rock-n-roll.My good people, this is an entire CD of exceptional music. It's rare when an entire album is so perfectly realized, with every song a standout and placed with perfection to flow like honey. To put it briefly and correctly...if you like great music that is smart without ever being pretentious, always intriguing and heartfelt, played and sang with finesse and fire, then look no further. \\"Who Killed the Zutons\\" is the best album released in 2004, and will certainly be an album that stands the test of time. I am so impressed with this CD, I am anxiously....impatiently.....awaiting their next album. Easily one of my favorite \\"new\\" bands, and definately an outstanding debut.

FYI the ambulance does NOT make noise, which is okay, because its door opens. The cars and people are cute; I think the cars would be a little better if they could hold the people in a more realistic way--down in the front, instead of just sitting on top of the vehicle.

AC/DC, The Who, Rocket from the Crypt, Dead Boys, the Ramones, Hot Snakes, the Decendents, MC5, the Stooges, the runaways, the Pixies, Talking Heads, and so on... were the exceptions to the boring masses. Unfortunatly the Yeah Yeah Yeahs gave up this torch and decided to be arty and boring instead of arty and fun. Too bad, The Master EP was one of my favorite records a few years back and I even liked Fever to tell. Guess they were just another semi-punk band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck Yuck Yuck","review":"I hope who ever produced this album contracts Ebola. Although the disease itself kills too fast (thus there has never been a severe outbreak), knowing that their flesh will rot off their body will give me some comfort after enduring this trash. Every catchy hook from the 80's is tossed into the blender here and spit out without any type of imagination. Karen O's voice is so electronically manipulated it almost sounds like she can sing. There isn't one song on this disc that is memorable. God I hate it.

While I still condider Fever to Tell their best work, this is almost as good. The mix of punky hard rock and alternative songs blend nicely.

I can't say enough good things about this album, so I'll just shut up now."},{"rating":"2","title":"YYY's Calmed Down A Lil Bit..........","review":"Great album, they really sound like they went in a different direction with this one but stuck to thier roots. With more powerful songs like, Warrior (a personal favorite of mine because it sounds like my life) \\"Cheated Hearts\\" but they still kept it fun with songs like \\"Way Out\\" my other favorite, \\"Honeybear\\", \\"Phenomena\\". I think they could've left out \\"Fancy\\" Though it was the most boring song on the album, since there is so much intensity coming from the them to slow down like that kinda threw me off. Buy this and support a seriously great up and coming band, they deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vibrantly surviving","review":"Listen, The best artists, and those with the most longevity, know how to do one thing well, and that is re-invent themselves. Now, I wouldn't so much say that The YYYs have \\"re-invented\\" themselves, but for lack of a better word, have matured a bit, and yet still kept at their core that childlike enthusiasm. Thus the title, \\"Show your bones\\", which Karen explained as a reference to the cartoon electrocution effect. You have to love it. Karen O was infectious then, and she is infectious now, just a little more refined, but no less lovely. A little wiser, but no less cool. I think this is a perfect follow up to \\"Fever to tell\\", since it is not just a remake. In its way, it is more spacious, deeper, and I think will prove to be the very move to make them stay in the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than anything they have done...","review":"I own both major label disks from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and I am gonna have to say that this is by far the best of the two. They are just an amazing band that has improved ten-fold. I saw them live years back, and they were great, and to hear on this album how far they have come since then makes me really want to see them again. The first half of the album is better than the last half, but it doesn't matter, it is an all around great album, and well worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than ever","review":"I bought this the day it came out, and the first time I listened I got a little disappointed cuz most of the songs were slower than my favorites on Fever. i mean with the exception of a few moments there was no crazy screachy songs like rich or art star. But it grew on me fast, soon I couldnt stop listening to the cd, It has been a week since this came out and seriously this is the only cd I've listened to. I can't get enough of it. Especially Way Out, Mysteries and The Sweets. So yeah buy this album, and all the fleeting fans who latched on because of maps, they will enjoy Show Your Bones also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eternity's Handmaiden Review","review":"The concepts of this novel are thought-provoking, causing the reader to question the morality of man's advancements, and humanity's very existence. A gifted artist, Ubtrent paints a picture of words. His descriptions of untouched landscapes are without flaw.

It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"The most intense, clever, funny take on the Jekyll and Hyde story I've ever seen to date. There were only two things that kept this DVD from being five stars, one was the language. When watched on television the language was edited, on the DVD however the F-word is dropped over and over in the first few episodes, personally I thought they over did it. The second reason for my four rather than five star rating was the ending. While I understand that they planned on making a second season, they never did, so we're left with a cliffhanger. A word of caution, this is not an excited, \\"Ooooh I want to see more!!!\\" Cliffhanger, it's more of an annoyed, \\"What?! You can't end like that!\\" Cliffhanger.Despite those two things this was an amazing mini-series. The acting was top notch, James Nesbitt was supreme as both his Jekyll (Jackman) and Hyde , never has a psychopath been so fun. You get everything in this, humor, suspense, love, tragedy, and two great characters who happen to be the same person!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully stupid","review":"Steven Moffat is Britain's foremost purveyor of adolescent cr*p and wastes more potentially good material than any director on the face of the planet. I find it hard to believe that so many people liked this - it' s pointless, the plot \\"twists\\" are arbitrary and there's absolutely no attempt to explain any of the \\"science\\" behind any of it, just a bunch of adolescent notions about the eternal nature of true love. Like all of Moffat's stuff, a total waste of time...think \\"Torchwood\\" but even sillier. Nesbitt it totally wasted on the lousy script, for which he attempts to overcompensate with the hammiest acting imaginable. Awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jekyll","review":"James Nesbit is at his finest here. This has to be the best mini series I have ever seen. Great actors, great characterization, great story line.

It totally blew me away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devilsh Fun","review":"I stumbled upin this show through the fabulousness that is BBC on Demand. I decided that since it was free it was certainly worth a shot. I got more than I expected and I found myself instantly wanting the next episode, lucky for me it was there. \\"Jekyll\\" tells the story of a modern Jekyll and Hyde\\". James Nesbitt plays the dual roles brillantly, looks like a different person when he switches to Hyde. He plays the role so well that he was recently nominated for a Golden Globe which is uncommon as it is a British pseudo sci-fi/horror show. Word of advice with the show, don't take it too seriously. Most British shows have dry humor and can come across campy, but really are brillantly funny and entertaining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love and scared","review":"I loved this series when I caught it in bits and pieces on Showcase.

Way creepy, and way chilling!A very modernized retelling of the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but NOT how you'd expect! It is very clever, and on the borderline of being nearly feasible. Not really- but it's not SO far fetched it seems campy.It's a BBC series program, (British actors)so the videography is a little unrefined, compared to what U.S. viewers may be used to.

I first heard him on the Leftfield track, \\"Dusted\\", and dug around until I found his name and eventually this cd.I give this cd 5 stars for the shear brilliance that is Roots Manuva, however I would normally dock it a star due to poor production on the album. It seems to be inconsistant from track to track, thus sounding more like a collection of Roots' songs up to that point, rather than a concerted effort to build an album. I'm anxiously awaiting his next release. After hearing some of his more recent tracks, I know this one flaw will be missing from subsequent albums.So disregard the poor production and pick up this album.

I bought our KR model 3916 (5 ltr.) over the internet from an authorized retailer.

KR makes a different 5 ltr. model with a metal valve cap, but its circular valve housing is plastic. Others have reported breakage of the \\"legs\\" on this plastic housing. Overall, I conditionally give our #3916 high marks, but only if I don't have to replace another plastic part anytime soon. #3916 was originally sold exclusively by a large culinary retailer with locations nationwide. Because it is still available from other vendors, it suggests my slightly discounted purchase came from remaindered stock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Owned since Dec 17 2002","review":"We just now have had to order a replacement over-pressure valve and new sealing ring. This pressure cooker has been used on average 5-7 times a month for the entire time we have owned it. In the last year we have started purchasing all of our staples in bulk and have been using the pressure cooker 5-10 times a week. Some days it will cook Irish oats for breakfast, Rice for lunch and quick soak beans for dinner. The best thing about all of this is for all of those meals the pressure cooker allows us to have the stove on for less than 5-7 minuets.

For $178.00 I would expect a pressure cooker to last longer than 4 years of minimal usage! I didn't use it every day. I used it once in awhile and the other day I took it out of my cabinet and the metal disc going around the pressure indicator had fallen off and the plastic was cracked! I'm really annoyed!

None yet, and I'm convinced now that there won't be any. Food is evenly cooked, fast, and has well developed flavors. This package comes with everything- CD, cookbook, pot. The only downside is the small size. If you're doing a lot of broths you might want to upgrade to the 7 liter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid little game","review":"Battle Cry is a simpler strategy game than old timers will have come to expect from Avalon Hill, but it has a charm all its own.

Mark Thurston's guidebook teaches how to use synchronicity to access our inner wisdom and answer our questions. I didn't have three weeks to practice the eight-step program, so I tried the method in a shorter period of time. By the time I had finished the book, I had learned about synchronicity, focused on my spiritual goal, formed a question, practiced the exercises and had a meaningful response from the I Ching \\"with parallel wisdom from the Edgar Cayce readings.\\" If that offends you, don't buy it. If you are open to Cayce, the exercises are powerful. For example, how do you identify your spiritual ideal? Thurston had me recalling peak experiences and remembering feelings from when synchronicity had worked in the past. The energy from this and the other exercises helped me receive and trust my insights from the I Ching/Cayce messages. I will keep this book and refer to it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Cayce than Jung","review":"A light introduction to synchronicity that pays more attention to the prophecies and teachings of Edgar Cayce than the theories of Carl Jung, this book is far from an absolute text on the subject. The author even refers to occurences as being \\"synchronous\\", instead of the proper \\"synchronistic\\". It also contains a poor translation of the I Ching. I didn't find this one very helpful, and would recommend instead \\"The Power of Flow\\", a book that has much more of a grasp on the essence of synchronicity than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"package was fine","review":"used for a church fund raiser. looked like the real thing.would have been nice to get a smaller package option"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rack for the money.","review":"Found this Raxxess rack easy to put together, works great, and looks very nice as well.

Cornwell really gives the reader a great inside look at the Vatican and the politics involved. The amount of backstabbing and shady dealing that goes on behind the scenes is incredible. The cast of characters is very interesting and Cornwell does not spare individuals when they deserve to be criticized (and this turns out to be just about everybody!). John Paul I was a good human being who was used, abused, and ignored by members of the Vatican heirarchy.

A small town heroine addict can't leave his home for agoraphobia and is being evicted for not paying his rent. This all makes no sense to me, and I love weird movies with little plot. The performances by Rip Torn and Bruce Dern were great, but all the other amazing actors were under-utilized. How can you have Cloris Leachman, Val Kilmer, Diane Ladd and Peter Faulk in a film and it fizzles? Oh, yeah, they need a script. I can understand how people may like this movie.

It's quite thorough, plus they don't say the words or phrases so fast that you get frustrated. Everything is also repeated, which is very important. You also not only have the two cassettes included, but also have a nice informative book with everything that is spoken in written form. They even give you a little history about how half the English that we speak comes from Old German; that was very interesting to hear. The book also gives you a history of the German language, grammatical notes, and important signs. You shouldn't feel ripped off if you buy this pack. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Oldie, But Goodie\\"","review":"I bought the DVD of this movie primarily as an exercise in nostalgia. It was a mainstay on local Los Angeles television, enabling channels in the early 1950's to stay on the air until their sign-off time of 10pm or so by showing it repeatedly. All told, as a child I must have seen it close to 100 times.To my surprise, it holds up remarkably well as romantic melodrama. Martha Scott and William Gargan give affecting performances, as do the various actors playing the wide assortment of students influenced through the years by Miss Bishop of Midwestern, a woman unlucky in love, but blessed in her career. If the film has a weakness, I would say it's in the performance of Mary Anderson, whose winking and blinking as a hormonally overactive teen is almost laughably over the top. But this is a minor flaw, one which does not appreciably interfere with the pleasure of seeing this film once again after so many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I had to force myself to watch the first 20 minutes which was quite boring.

Jouy, a field hand, who pays children to blow him in the 18th century? This unbelievable anecdote appears on pp. 31-32. It's so badly written that maybe nobody actually reads that far. But he very pointedly says that statutory rape should not be a crime on the books, that it's a normal part of any French village, and that young girls should give hand jobs and/or blow jobs (he never explains 'the game of curdled milk' and leaves it as a euphemism) to simple-minded menial laborers to earn their keep.Foucault actually asks what's the big deal.This book made me sick to my stomach.

You will love humor that Lauras friends bring as you can see any group of lesbians acting as they do. You will be rooting for these two women and love the romance and you actually wonder at times if they will get together. The thoughts that were going through these two women made perfect sense and you could 'feel' the turmoil both were going through.As was stated by another reviewer I would love for the authors to do a story on Jenny.

She's put in charge of teaching children the traditional songs, but forbidden from making her own music. Over the course of the trilogy, we follow Menolly's journey as she runs away from home, gains self-confidence and independence, and is finally recognized for her talents.

Menolly is a great heroine and an inspiriation to keep dreaming. A note to people who feel this was unresolved, this was the first book of a trilogy know as the harper hall trillogy. Read Dragonsinger and DragonDrums, the two sequels, as well as the later Pern books like The White Dragon and All the Weyrs of Pern, which continue the story of Menolly, Master Robinton, and the other dragonriders, harpers, weyrleaders, holders, etc. It is a fantastic read for any SF-fantasy lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragonsong was an interesting book.","review":"DragonSong was written by Anne McCaffrey. She made the story very interesting.This book is an imaginative book filled with fasntasy and is fun to read. Dragonsong was a very interesting story because of the dragons and firelizards. It was interesting because of the way the dragons and firelizards were able to go \\"between\\". The way the people of Pern used the dragons to kill the Thread was also interesting. Seeing how that was the fastest and best way to kill the Thread. The story in the book was unclear as to how the firelizards helped the people of Pern. Altogetherthis was an interesting story with intriguing characters. I enjoyed reading Dragonsong, because of how interesting it was. I think that it is a good book to read if your into fantasy,and mild si-fi,or if you like to read about dragons. This is a book for you. Dragonsong was very captivating towards the end of the story, and I encouage you to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragonsong is imaginative and a complex story","review":"The imaginative and sometimes complex story of Dragonsong is an involvong read. Dragonsong was a complex book in which the author introduced foreign and new fictional concepts. The entire story of Menolly is derived from the ongoing drama of a fictional land called Pern. The story is complex because it explains a twisted tale of a moon that sends deadly bacteria to Pern. The story goes on to describe how the dragon lizards were formed and why. The complexity continues with the ancient art of being a harpist, which is a singer of ancient story-songs that describe ancient times. The novel Dragonsong although imaginative was over all a complex and foreign story. I personally found it hard to believe and understand at all levels. Unless a person is intrigued by fantasy and the magic I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragon song was a very exciting book.","review":"I happen to enjoy reading a good book.

The author adds many things that help fill it with excitement. For instance the threadfall provided much excitement with its deadly charactaristics. Therefore the author explains that the fierce dragons battle this deadly thread to maintain life on Pern. Menolly was almost killed by this treaturous thread and that experience was exciting enough to exemplify the the excitment of this book.

She has many adventures. She discovers and help a group of fire lizards(smaller versions of dragos).This book has a predictable plot and ending.

In a cave, she helps a fire lizard hatch her babies. Menolly is imprinted on the nine babies and teaches them to sing. A simple young adult tale that many young adolescent readers will enjoy and identify with, though the lack of deep characters, the slow pace and predictability, the unoriginality in the face of other superior novels of the genre, may hinder some enjoyment. Grade: C"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragonsong was an imaginative, but yet complex book.","review":"I don't enjoy reading fiction books because there is no base of reality and its all imaginative, like the story of Dragonsong written by Anne McCaffrey. It is an imaginative but yet complex book about dragons and fire lizards. The thought of dragons killing thread and protecting the world from harm. People had to impress the dragons and fire lizards by feeding them and talking to them. After that the person would be connected to that certain animal for life. The dragon or lizard impressed could actually read the mind of their owner and would follow them everywhere the person went. When dragons go \\"between\\" it gives a totally new view on our lives, it gives you a lot to think about and really starts your imagination. I personally didn't enjoy reading Dragonsong. To me it was very confusing, and boring. But for the people who like fanatasies, this would be an excellent book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"OverAll","review":"The characters in Dragonsong all have very different personalities from one another, which makes them interesting in my opinion. Menolly's character at first is mostly annoying but later really develops. She acts as any human, would making her character believable. For example, she runs away from Half Circle Sea Hold when she is unhappy. Also the setting is believable because when Ann McCaffery describes it, she gives Pern characteristics that are recognizable to Earth.The book is hard to connect to and does not involve the reader, though the details are consistent and descriptive. The author makes the firlizards seem natural. She does this by having them act like a dog or another animal that people react to. The plot is hardly interesting or entertaining even with good characters and details. However, the story is not slow moving or hard to understand.

Perhaps this is due to the youth of the characters. They'd be an excellent way to introduce your kids to Anne's books, but are a bit childish for an adult or older teen. Still, since Menolly becomes a major character later, (along with Piemur, Audiva, Sebell, who are fixtures in the sequel to \\"Dragonsong\\") they're a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dragonsong is a interesting book.","review":"I think Dragonsong is a really interesting book, the author writing a mythology about the Dragon and I think this book interesting.

Not that I expect all the older, rarer stuff to be absolute top-notch quality, but the live recordings on here get so garbled that I find them hardly worth listening to. On the upside, the new 'World Eater' track is interesting and 'Dying Creed' is definitely one of Bolt Thrower's best songs (at least out of what's included on this compilation). I actually gave 'Dying Creed' quite a bit of air time on the radio while DJing in Nashville, TN.

The example solos do not have a backing band, so they are a bit empty; I think that a little more time could have been put into showing useful examples of the tricks, but it's good enough (especially for the price!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Metal Guitar Tricks","review":"I bought this book thinking that Im going to learn the tricks of the trade about making unique sounds, As i was led to believe that this book has it all, As it was marketed for beginners aswell as advance players.

I realised that i must be a better player than Steve Vai, as I already knew every thing that this book had to offer.In Brief:If your starting to play guitar or just learning lead guitar, this book is great..

Instead of doing lame soundalike covers they do it in a bunch of different styles. Only Peoplemover tried to be a carbon copy of U2, Boo for Peoplemover. There are many rocking versions on this CD. I really lived Drag's Rocked out version of \\"Discotheque\\" and Statica's pop rock \\"Who's gonna ride the wild horses.\\" There are also so cool arty folkish versions like Friction Bailey's \\"Pride.\\" If you like a wild variety of music like I do and Love U2 like I do, You should pick this up CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL","review":"Not really \\"better than the real thing\\" but fun none the less. \\"Pride\\" and \\"Bullet the blue sky\\" are bad. \\"Love Is Blindness\\" made me ill but I never like the original. \\"With or without you\\" is definately worth a listen, as well as very cool renditions of \\"Where the Streets have no name\\" and \\"Wild Horses.\\" A must have for the U2 fan like me!

Also provides background about characters who have a more central role in stories that have already been published.Most of the series I read develop chronologically. Asaro succeeds in writing stories out of chronological sequence so that I can get fully involved with the characters and plot even though I already know what will happen to them. One thing I notice in this and other books that move back in time (e.g., Schism) is that she develops characters whom I have already met without excessively repeating old information or contradicting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I fell in love with the Kuhn Rikon Pressure Cooker the minute I took it out of the box. It's very sturdy, stylish and well made with a minimum of plastic. I'd emailed the company directly to make sure the Amazon products were in fact made in Switzerland. They responded within a few hours to all my emails and yes all of their products are made in Switzerland.( I had just returned a Fagor cooker for safety reasons but was also very disappointed that Amazon didn't print in their ad that it was made in China). I've only had the Kuhn Rikon for a week but so far it's very easy to use, the food tastes great and the clean up is quick.

I'm not sure if its true or not but i don't really care the book is great and has drawings that will help you understand what is being described. It discusses training, weapons, missions, tactics and so on. This book and the tactics in it are based on one clan's tactics the Koga ninja clan.

Quarantined along with a group of society's elite, including her friend's aunt and his former wife, due to exposure to smallpox, Kit soon finds herself in the midst of a series of crazy events including several burglaries, bungled escape attempts and a slew of mysterious occurrences...with a little romantic confusion, too! Who is stealing from the household? The same man she suspects of kissing her on the stairwell or someone else? Events gradually grow more and more strange and the solution more murky until the final chapters of the book when all is revealed and Kit determines whether or not the man who both attracts and repels her so much is worth her heart.Filled with Rinehart's trademark suspense and action, this book may not be one of her best but it is still a satisfactory, entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good!","review":"This book took off slow, then never really moved much at all.

I didnt want them to not buy the house.The day after they moved in I got a bloody nose.

On the other hand their directions are HORRIBLE! Utterly mind-blowing that Holley actually paid someone for writing these so called 'directions'. A company of this caliber should not include such overwhelmingly BAD directions.

Afterwards, I heard the other songs little by little and they stayed on my mind after two playings or so. I keep listening to this album (for about a year and half now) on and on and I still have not got tired of it.

I plumbed it according to the diagram in the instruction manual (which leaves much to be desired), only to have to re-plumb the pressure tank. Once i did this it has worked great, It has drawn water out with no problem, It is quiet, powerful, and well worth the cost.

Tommy couldn't be more excited, about his brother, Dill's, arrival. When Dill comes into the world, Tommy's life changes dramatically. Tommy feels alone, when Dill gets all the attention. Tommy's life long pals feel Dill is a lot of work, and causes too much trouble.When Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, and Lil set off Tommy's Dad, Stu's, latest creation sends them on an adventure. Baby Dill is along for the ride, and his older brother must come to his rescue, leaving behind his emotions.The play on siblings not getting along easily connects with the age demographic. Children can relate to the disagreements, and the need to unite, finding a common ground. The imagery of an older brother taking care of his younger family member in a time of uncertainty is a huge undertaking, for any child."},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny","review":"I saw this in a movie theater filled with Rugrats.

It had a nice story. I think it even teachs you something (I know thats pretty lame but it does). I think it talks about that you should always trust your friends and not argue with them because they are the ones who will be there for you and you should stick with your family and love them no matter what.

The item I received is not an $80 item, or a $64 item, it is in my yard, it will remind me where not to buy things in the future.

He prefers his dream world to his real, ordinary life so he begins to boast about it, pretending that he is, in fact, a hardened and ruthless gangster. But George Fraser boasts to the wrong people and suddenly his dream world becomes all too real. But he has exciting dreams. In his dreams, he lives in a thrilling world of gangsters, guns, fast cars and beautiful women. And of course, in his dreams, he is the toughest gangster of them all. Obviously, when a dream comes true, the dreamer is expected to be happy, but tragically, Fraser has to be worried and sad for his dreams coming to limelight because he never knew things could turn sore even as a gangster living in a gangster paradise; he forgot to ask Coolio before consult chase for his dreams. It is an intelligent and harshly revealing piece of work with not a little serious penetration and power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning - Not a SACD","review":"The Amazon listing for this item is not correct; this is not a Hybrid SACD.

My DVD player does recognize it as a 24 bit stereo disc. And the sound quality is excellent, certainly equal to or better then some SACD discs I have. I'm curious now how good the SACD would sound, but don't plan to buy it to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiosyncratic performances","review":"I wish I loved this set (composed if this and another separate CD) of Vivaldi's 12-concerti group called Il Cimento dell'Armonia e dell'Inventione.But I hate it. The performances seem so self-importantly stylized and idiosyncratic, and the sound, which is highly touted as being recorded in \\"24-bit, 96Khz\\" resolution, is very grating and annoying, with little bass and highly accentuated upper frequencies. I love this set of concertos but I greatly dislike this recording and performance of them, I'm sorry to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just install a new audio player!","review":"I had heard poor reviews of even the more expensive FM transmitters so decided to try out this cheaper one.

There is constant audible static on all channels. I have tried it on 2 different car stereos and the results are always the same. If you are listening to loud music and driving on the highway, the background noise may cover up the constant static, otherwise you are going to hear it. I wrote to tech support and they could not help. It seems the product I received is simply a poor one. If you want something cheap and don't care too much about quality then it might be worth getting. If you are picky about sound quality I don't recommend it. All of these FM transmitters will somewhat diminish the quality of the music compared to havening a direct connection to your stereo anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the .99 paid for it.","review":"i am using this for an htc hero.

I must have been living under a rock to have missed this incredible virtuoso.Having been a longtime fan of Shakti I grew quite enchanted with the heavy Indian influenced sound so for me this was a no brainer, but it actually surpassed my expectations. This is one great performance!The DVD itself has two sets (chapters) that must be individually started, so make sure you watch both. Do not miss the incredible guitar work of Shawn Lane on the first cut of the second set.Evidently the audio is stereo rather than 5.1 (I see no audio options) but it is very clear and clean.

On the one I was replacing, the plastic interior basket was starting to fall apart but the exterior was fine. The new one is made much more cheaply - the gears in the top slip *a lot* and doesn't spin smoothly. Luckily, I kept the old one and just swapped out the lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for us.","review":"The salad spinner was a replacement for our old one which was similar and we had for over 12 years -- finally broke after the kids got to it. It's inexpensive and does the job we want. We chop/tear lettuce, put it in the basket, rinse the lettuce under the facet in the sink, put the cover on and spin. Water comes out the bottom and you know when to stop spinning when the water stops draining out. It does not double as a salad bowl, but we use our own salad bowls, and not have to worry about drying an outer bowl before using it for a salad with the dried lettuce. The spinner does what it's supposed to -- dry lettuce and does a great job. It's lighter than others that have an outer bowl and seems to take less space than others I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the price","review":"I needed something that would spin my veggies dry and wasn't too expensive.

The little gears slip and as a result you cannot get the water off like you are suppose to. I had one like this previously that I used for many years that worked great but not this one.

When they move onto reality they sing about rain, not just rain, but spring rain from the Liberty Belle release, easy to see the genius here. Seriously when you buy an album and put it on you can tell what your going to get with them. It will be solid and formulaic. Unfortunately the items I have bought from the Go-Betweens have never lived up to the promise of the reviews I have read. The songs remain precious and dull. This is their best offering, but still it is bland and it does bother me when a band is ignorant and conforms to the worldview shared by the masses. They continue to do this and remain a band that delivers generic, dull songs AND although this album is their best at capturing their formula it is not entertaining. Pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some fun puzzles, but not much else","review":"I would have given it two and a half stars, but I'll have to give it two. There are some fun puzzles in this game, but it lacks a lot.One -- some of the puzzles are badly unoriginal. The worst example of this is a player piano that imitates the game \\"Simon\\", where you have to remember the tune and play it back. Other puzzles almost repeat themselvesTwo -- the puzzles do not interact with the game play at all. The game is basically just a walkthrough movie, with puzzles here and there to solve so that you can make it to the next part of the movie. In this respect, it is somewhat like the game \\"Fool's Errand\\"Three -- the animation moves too darn slow in the puzzles. When you click on a move, the characters or icons on the screen move annoyingly slow.Overall though, if you buy it cheap off the rack, it will be worth it for you. But it is still not a great game at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like chess...","review":"When this game first came out it was outstanding. We have come along way since then. The story is very weak. There are way too many puzzles closely resembling chess. The piano puzzle is overdone and the Basement maze is from hell itself-even with hints. The scenes are gross but fun.

The bass is very well done and the drums are really tight. There are some great lyrics on this album as well. Another strength of Loyal Frisby are their live performances. Don't pass them up if they happen to be playing near you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Combination","review":"The bali beads and faceted onyx beads are a nice combination and set each other off very nicely.

Navigation is simple and intuitive. Overall, the program is pretty much what you'd expect in a crossword puzzle.The most disturbing problem is the extraordinary number of typos present! Many times, two letters are transposed in the puzzle and you will be told that your answers are incorrect; to have the program count your efforts as a \\"success,\\" you must know the _REAL_ answer and then play around with the letters to make it match the program's _incorrect_ answer. I was quite disappointed by this particular flaw. While I have experienced the same problem with other crossword software titles, I had hoped that a product associated with the New York Times would have placed a higher priority on accuracy.

I listened to the 1957 Studio cast recording with Jack Cassidy & Shirley Jones, the 1991 Broadway Angel version with Brent Barrett & Rebecca Luker and this one with George Dvorsky & Janis Kelly. Out of the these I liked George Dvorsky's voice the best so I went with this recording. Also, Megan Kelly's rendition of \\"The Love of My Life\\" is spectacular!

It's the same house -- the same puzzles -- the same general story -- and most of the same actors. Did they think that adding more and better FMV cutscenes would disguise that? Puh-LEASE.The only really positive thing about the game is how much fun it is to wander through an abandoned house poking at things. The puzzles are all of the improbable chess-problem sort, and several of them require you to play against the computer, a situation that is not always winnable. Quite frustrating! especially since every wrong move you make gets you an insulting remark by the overacting villain. Add to it that the basic story is hopelessly contrived and silly, the ending unrewarding, and the neverending music boring and hokey, and ... well, I wouldn't call it a winner.If you're intrigued by ghost stories, go play 7th Guest. It's more fun and at least has the benefit of originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please","review":"Definitely this game had possibilities: decent story line, fair acting, but I was totally frustrated with the puzzles.

You're back in the mansion, trying to find your friend. Not only are there more fiendish puzzles to solve, but there are also riddles to unravel as well. Both will either open up more of the house, or provide further video clips, pushing the story forward. I loved the fact that I could take a break from the (sometimes insanely hard) puzzles and work on the riddles, and still progress in the game.This is a mature game--no swearing, but lots of disturbing imagery and some risque moments--nothing beyond PG-13 though. It's very similar in style to the first game, with some improvements (the sound isn't so faint, for starters), and the story is fantastic.

Unfortunately, this book gives no in-depth explanation of any basis associated with names but rather assures the reader that the author has studied names for over 50 years and knows what he's talking about. The beginning of the book attempts to explain some things but only a paragraph or so is offered for each topic, certainly no real in-depth information. The whole book was terribly disappointing and the numerous typos are surprising - someone did not proof this book.I highly recommend \\"The Hidden Truth of Your Name - The Nomenology Project\\" over this book. Fewer names are included but the principles are explained so much better. I also feel the attributes for each name are much more accurate than the ones in \\"The Secret Meaning of Names\\".

Every attack is aggressive, there is no time for the music to breathe, some of the loud parts sound actually violent, and the phrasing can be so incredibly square that one gets the impression that the pianist actually resents Poulenc.

(He could master this game w/ no idea of what fighting a real fire is like.) If you want an \\"idea\\" of being a \\"true American hero\\" is like, go for it.

Two stars were taken off for the bad sound quality of some of the live cuts. The balance of the instruments is so bad on these tracks that they are almost unlistenable.A third star was taken off because no information is given about who the performers are, or about the music itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Version/Remix is Still Dynamic...","review":"....I recall in the 90s' R & B radio was being hi-jacked by the New Jack Swing. Certain ol' skool artists were complainin' that they couldn't get any of their new product played on gumby-hairdoo saturated, aggressive rat-a-tat-tating new jack radio. That's why when this cut came out--from the soundtrack of Van Peebles' New Jack City--it kissed a lil of the ol' skool with the new trend and it was an instant hit that everyone seemed to dig. The extended remix has some partifying new jack bass drum electrobeats at the end of it which make you wanna move even if the babies are watching, trying to figure out what's going on with Mommie and Daddy. And with the powers that be allowing For the Love of Money to become Trump's the Apprentice theme song, I bet this can find even newer audiences. (There are however many New Jack Swing tunes which sound curiously dated nowadays. Divine reciprocity I would gather.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book to read for group therapy","review":"I will keep this book as an extremely important reference in forming and leading counseling groups. It is such a practical guide. Certainly, it's based on theory and provides research on the theoretical foundation of group therapy, but the part I like most is the step-by-step guide on creating, leading, and facilitating groups. In addition, there are several chapters devoted to helping you deal with conflict in the group, as well as challenging groups that avoid risks and confrontations. Some very useful techniques discussed in the book are the Hot Seat Method and Stir the Pot. Also valuable are assumptions you must consider when leading groups. I'm beginning to put together a group at my high school on stress management. I can't imagine not using this book in planning and executing the curriculum. I know I will need Chen and Rybak's book often as a reference while leading the group. Every counselor who plans to facilitate a group should buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Invaluable Group Counseling Textbook","review":"Group Leadership Skills: Interpersonal Process in Group Counseling and Therapy is a textbook designed to be an aide beyond learning the pertinent material for a particular course. As a new and practicing school counselor working with groups, my familiarity for the group process is a skill that I credit to the thorough nature of the text. Each chapter builds upon the last and by using real life examples; the content is as practical as it is engaging. Group Leadership Skills is a perfect blend of theory and application and I would highly recommend adding it to your collection of counseling texts for use in graduate courses and future professional pursuits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book a must read for group counseling","review":"Through group counseling and the use of Dr. Chen's book I am able to communicate my feelings more openly in my relationships with significant others in my life. This has helped me to be more sensitive to the feelings of others and also to ask for help from others when I need it. I have learned a lot about my way of interacting with others and I have been able to see that I have connections to other people rather than focusing on differences. I am making more connections to other people and I have been able to make positive changes to the way I initiate interactions with others.

A highly intelligent, literate and adult piece of historical fiction with a pleasingly sophisticated plot that is very difficult to put down - also featuring Edgar Allan Poe as the eponymous boy (though crucial to the plot he is not one of the major characters as his father is).Fully deserves the excellent reviews it received in the UK press, an enaging evocation of time and place and a wonderfully paced thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is fantastic!","review":"I had never run across this author before, until I was reading an online review of thriller novels and found that Andrew Taylor was suggested. My local library had only one of his novels, not the one I really wanted (\\"The Four Last Things\\") but I checked this out and was very pleased. This is the only novel I've read since \\"The Quincunx\\", that catches the feeling of Charles Dickens, yet without the sentimentality of that author, and adds a modern eye to the early Victorian period as well as a gift for intricate plotting without the coincidences that sometimes strain the edges of Dickens' plots. As has been pointed out elsewhere, this book is not so much about Edgar Allen Poe, but has him (as a young child) in a subsidiary but important role. To anyone who shares my fondness for sharp, literate mysteries and 19th Century England will love this.(Also published under the title \\"An Unpardonable Crime\\".)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good training advice!

Niles is very good at explaning the physiology and mechanics of multisport training without going overboard on technical jargon. As a recreational triathlete, I devoured this book in two days and can't wait to put some of it into practice. His sample workouts seem too aggressive for beginners or older athletes, but they do demonstrate how to balance training time and level of intensity to optimize performance gains. The book helps me understand what I did wrong during my last racing season and where I can focus for improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is too technical.","review":"After reading reviews that stated this book was simple to use and had specific examples, I couldn't wait to receive it. I really need time saving training methods and hoped this book would offer solutions. What I found was the usual confusing information on VO2 max, heart rate and other measurements that needed to be taken before you could move on to what you could do to train efficiently in less time. I tried to skip all that and move ahead to the meat of the book and found that pretty confusing too. If I had enough time to read and comprehend this book, I wouldn't need it...I would spend the time training.

This book is also very, very,very badly written, probably the worsed written book I've ever read. He doesn't write anything interesting about miles either.Read the 'Miles Davis autobiography' it is a thousand million times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, exhaustive effort","review":"Ian Carr's book on Miles is complete, fairly even-handed and really tries to capture Miles as both a Musician and a budding painter and importantly as an individual. It relates the large roller coaster of Miles decade by decade at the top of his game and then coming down, getting involved with seedier elements and then somehow surviving and coming back up to ascension. Anyone who respects the Jazz genre owes it to themselves to read this book if only for the history involved, because during all the twists and turns in Jazz, especially from the Bebop era on, Miles was there, and his place as a central character is assurred, among the Jazz Greats.The only reason I just gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I read Miles' own autobiography a bit later, and although he throws f-bombs throughout that book, I feel that it is still a better book because it comes from the mind of the Man himself.. This is still a great chronology, definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is the best biography on Davis. Carr does a great job of covering both his life and his music in prose that is detailed, but not unreadable. I wish there had been an even great discussion of his music, but I'd argue that such an approach would have left less more for information on his personal relationships and life. I wish I'd have had time to listen to all his albums while reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book might be more relevant for an American school teacher, but I am teaching AIDS education in Africa and it didn't have any useful information.

'Tant de Belles Choses' is incredibly moody and melodic.

This movie would have you believe that von Richtofen and Roy Brown were friendly rivals competing for the love of some anonymous nurse. Even the flying scened look fake, like they were doing a CG version of a 1950's style miniature of a dogfight.

The actual life and historical military activity on Manfred Von Richthofen was pretty far off, and had most of the real history been included, it would have been a far more interesting and exciting movie.

Having taken a course on Middle Eastern history and one on borders, I felt like this book supplemented everything I had read about, and more: it provided me with the human dimension of more broader policies and events of the region. Well-balanced, informative and interesting, takes place on the eve of the 1967 war. It examines the same events through the eyes of different characters: an Israeli spy living in Syria, a Palestinian terrorist, a Lebanese banker and an Israeli military adviser. Wonderfully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another book I couldn't put down","review":"This is another of my favorite true crime books. Once again, Ann does an outstanding job of introducing the reader to all of the characters. I felt like I knew each person by the time everything tied together in a horrible tragedy. Ann did a wonderful job of detailing the \\"friendships,\\" the murder, the investigation, and luck involved in finally learning what had happened to the victim and who was responsible. True, the book does paint the victim as somewhat of a saint, despite the evidence that he may have been \\"creative\\" in some of his business practices. However, this book to me was more about true love -- finally found, and then lost way too soon, and how this horrible experience affected the widow for the rest of her life. It was quite a tear jerker, unlike most true crime books. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read true crime as well as to those who like romance. This book has it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The storyline and facts are dead on","review":"Even though I knew alot of the facts of this case and was very involved with the first trial of Steven Bonilla and William Nichols Ann Rule kept me glued to the book with her consise and accurate knowledge of the case.

I thought I-5 Killer, Dead by Sunset, and Everything she ever Wanted were fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Name of Love: and Other True Cases","review":"I have read all of Ann Rule's books and thoroughly enjoy them. However, this book seems to lack objectivity. Jerry is so good and Steve so bad. Jerry is so tall and Steve is so short. He even loses stature as the book progresses but if you will notice in the wedding pictures they seem to be the same height. Well written, as usual, but I just wish I could have been surer of the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Name of Love","review":"I read this book when it first came out and my first thought was \\"Ann Rule did not write this book\\". It is poorly written and not at all in the same wording / manner that Ann Rule uses.Second, it is totally one sided. I am sorry but the 'poor victim' was a crook himself that took from others and used others to get what he wanted.He was murdered because he stepped on people to get money for his own benefit.I wonder, did Ann Rule get paid by Jerry's wife to write such a false account of this devious man?Not worth reading if you have read any other Ann Rules, and if you want to read TRUE life crime novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book does not give enough background on main characters","review":"I read this book in much the same way as I have read Ann Rule's other books: fast. While I enjoy her books, Ann Rule does not define the main characters here as much as she has in say, \\"Everything She Ever Wanted.\\" For instances, why did Jerry Harris get his nose broken three times if he was such a saint? Why didn't Ms. Rule do more research into the character of Steve? I would have preferred to look at this story from the angle of how someone is set up to be a good guy, a scapegoat, and how they play it out over their lives. I was irritated overall by Ann Rules one-dimensional view of everyone. And I did not like being made a part of Susan and Jerry's schemes to outwit others as part of a cute joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable book","review":"This is a very good ethnographic account of some important aspects of everyday life in the later years of Soviet Union.

Granted, it was a nice quick sunday afternoon read...but nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This book is your basic summer \\"no thinking required\\" read. I (like several other reviewers) was totally shocked at the amateurish editing... assuming this book was edited at all. It was a waste of money, and I'm ticked off that I bought it. :-( The story's setting had a lot of potential, but DS never went anywhere with it... she just re-played the same old romance cliches over and over. This was my first (and probably last) DS book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This is the second time that I read this book and I really enjoyed it. Danina Petroskova is Granny Dan to her granddaughter. The grandmother who sang to her, liked to roller skate and wore black and shabby dresses. When she passes away in the nursing home, all her belongings are given to her granddaughter. This includes a pair of ballet slippers, a locket and letters written in Russian. She was a prima ballerina in Russia who had a relationship with the Imperial family and had a magical romance. The Russian Revolution changed the course of the life forever. It shows that we all often forget that the elderly were once young and vibrant and have many experiences worth hearing about. It was a very touching story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Granny Dan by Danielle Steel","review":"I was pretty disappointed as I struggled to maintain interest! This has got to be one of Steel's most uninteresting novel's I have read. The end had a rather unique twist though predictable leading up to the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick too Many Times","review":"I think one should describe this book as how to survive the maladies of the early 20th century. My gosh, how many times does this woman have to succumb to complete exhaustion and be able to take only bits of nourishment. And sorry, Nickolai, you are a complete loser. You married Marie....make the best of it. Obviously I didn't like the book! I don't like these unrealistic episodes of complete romance conquering all...my fault. I am sure Steel satiates the longings of many a reader, just too soapy for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did all that talent go?","review":"I am still trying to figure out what was going on with that disaster, the Klone and I, so I read \\"Granny Dan\\" Where is the depth in the characters? In her early books DS gave a history of each character that made one feel as if they were intimate friends. I was left wondering what \\"Marie's\\" problem was, what was Madame Markova's history and WHY did everyone at the school apparently love this little twit who was sick most of the time or running off to the czar. Surely one or two other ballerinas could have provided a little conflict. I was so sure we'd get some old DS twists. Madam dying. leaving the school to Danina, Danina taking a few orphan kids to Vermont and landing in the US, pregnant of course, and so on and so on. I am ready to see another one like \\"The Ring\\" or \\"Thursten House\\"I will get the next DS book, hoping it is comparable to her first books.

Kept me wanting more even with tears shed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"To the author of Granny Dan.....Who are you and what have you done with Danielle Steele? This one rates right down there with The Klone and I.......stinkers. I didn't think I'd ever get through it, kept waiting for something to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I was really disappointed afer reading this book, it sounded so good reading the dust cover. I found this story of Danina and her lover Nikoli lacking in many areas. First this novel starts out with Danina's Grandaughter discovering letters of her recently departed Grandmother. The book then begins telling Danina's story, although a letter format is not used here. Also this story is lacking a lot of historical detailing that would have given more substance to the storyline. Finally there are too many personal details missing here. I found it really hard to want these people to be together, there was no chemistry between them. The book abruptly stops and leaves out details about what happens to Danina after arriving in the United States. I personally wondered why Danina's daughter was descibed in the manner she was. This book would have been great if it had been about 300 pages longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I am not a romance junkie nor a regular Steel reader. I bought this book in the hopes of finding something different and exciting, a glimpse into the world of Russian ballet training, along with a tender love story. I got neither.To me this was an outline of what could have been a great book with only a few of the scenes developed.Much of the action, including Danina's entire training at the ballet, was summarized in a few narrative paragraphs.I never formed a bond with any of the characters nor could I \\"feel\\" for them because they never became real to me. Except for a few scenes most of the integral conversation and description that should have lead to that bond was merely reported on not shown in detail.Ms. Steel forgot the elemental rule of fiction writing, don't tell, show. Make each scene come alive with detail and conversation.It's a shame because this COULD have been a great book if it had been written correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!!!","review":"When I picked up \\"Granny Dan\\" I was a bit skeptical. Historical romance is not my forte, but this book is good. Danina is a bit naive but she's a wonderful character. This book is interesting enough to read in a day and I recommend it to all Steel fans!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Steel Fan!","review":"This was the worst offering I have read by Danielle Steel.

As a dancer, myself, Mrs. Steel describes it very well, almost perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danielle Steele's Latest is Bitter Pill","review":"Danielle Steele's latest work was obviously the result of a tight publishing schedule and too many conjunctions. I, unfortunately, heard the audio version, and I found it difficult to keep track of the many illnesses of the protagonist, who had - let me see - severe influenza, morning sickness, a bad abortion, and a banged-up foot. She was constantly in bed - either ill or with her adle-brained doctor-lover, who was stupid enough to go to Siberia to the Czar instead of running away to exotic Vermont with Granny Dan. Forgive me, Steele lovers, but this one really stunk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a trash!","review":"This is without a doubt THE most borring book I've ever read.

It's sad, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I have not read a Danielle Steel in a couple of years, as I was burned out on them, and now I know why. The characters are unrealistic, the story is the same-beatiful person that everyone loves has problems. Blah, blah, blah..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....again.","review":"Again, I find myself disappointed with a Danielle Steele book. Is she rushing to complete too many books in a year, or has she lost her magic touch? I have read all her books, but definitely think her earlier books were by far her best. I have not purchased a D. S. book since \\"The Ranch\\", so great was my disappointment in that one. Instead, I trade with friends or go to the local library. Please, to whom it may concern, have Ms. Steele go back and reread her earlier books. Maybe she can recapture her art of storytelling without having to repeat herself throughout the book. Then I will purchase another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danielle missed the mark this time","review":"I am an advid Danielle Steel fan and \\"pre-ordered\\" her new book so I could feast on it ASAP! I was in for a huge disappointment. The story is sweet but could have/should have been sold as a short story. It left me feeling cheated, having paid full price for a hardcover book that was clearly a rush job. If you feel you must read it... do yourself a favor... wait for it to hit your local library or USED bookstore"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Stayed with Me","review":"This was my fourth or fifth Danielle Steel book to read and I think I loved this book much more than the rest. This story grabbed me and wouldn't let go. It stayed in my mind for 3 days straight after I first read it. The characters and their love story was the most heartbreaking thing I have ever read. He was married to an unloving wife which made him miserable and she was a young girl who didn't know what love was...until they met. I give this book 5 stars because it kept me interested and wanting more when I finsihed it. It isn't one of Danielle Steel's longer books, but it has a very compacted and dramatic story. When you start the book, it is told from the point of view of a character who is not named, but she is the pivitol beginning and ending of this story. It is the middle of the book that focuses on the two main characters who make up the love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have never read anything by Danielle Steel and picked this up to see what the fuss was all about. I found it very disappointing and full of holes. Also, she repeats everything so many times that I feel she was trying to fill the pages. It's not a particularly long book as it is. If you were to take out the repetitions, it would probably go about a quarter of its length. I may one day read something else by DS, but this definitely has turned me off reading further right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful reading","review":"It's a wonderful story and very well written. It would have been better if the book was longer so it could go into more details (character-wise and historical) about the last months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the real Danielle Steel?","review":"I love Danielle Steel's books, at least I used to. I couldn't wait until a new one came out. Lately, I have been very disappointed in her style.Granny Dan was a very slow moving, boring book. I forced myself to read it, as I finish a book when I start one. It was hard to do so though.What happened to the Danielle Steel of a few years back? We want her back!!!I've told others not to waste their time reading this book. Hopefully Danielle will pick up her writing like she used to do. Is she trying to publish too many books, and therefore, not putting her \\"all\\" into them individually?Sorry Danielle, but this one is very lacking.A dissappointed fan...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"The rush to keep up with her tradition of putting out 2-3 books a year has definitely caught up with Ms. Steel. I'm a long-time fan, and have read almost everything she has written. I have to say I was very disappointed with \\"Granny Dan\\" - the story was obviously rushed and is of a much lower quality than her previous novels. I hope this isn't indicative of future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A less likeable version of \\"Zoya\\"","review":"In keeping with her tendency to cover familiar territory, DS has gone back to the Russian Revolution with \\"Granny Dan\\", a book that leaves you wondering ... well, why? First, the whole concept of \\"Granny Dan\\" -- the beloved grandmother who has died at the beginning of the book having all this secret back history -- is absurd. And as she has done before, by starting the novel by telling you how it's going to end up, DS manages to completely remove any chance at intrigue. I don't have any problem with Ms. Steel covering historical events in her novels -- for example, I love her \\"Titanic\\" depiction in \\"No Greater Love\\" -- but I do get increasingly irritated with her characters being relatives of the Romanov family or other such royalty. How about writing about a completely unknown, totally unconnected person who lived during the Revolution? That might show some real insight into the struggle -- and I'm sure you could get a love story in there too."},{"rating":"1","title":"REVIEW","review":"This was an o.k. book. In my opinion, it was not better than ZOYA which had more detail. I was so excited when it first came out. I was somewhat disappointed when I finished it. Do not buy it.

I haven't read a good one from her in years. Maybe it's the assistants that she is relying on or maybe she is just trying to chrun them out too fast but I'm one reader who doesn't think she'll be going back to Steele again. Sorry to say that a master has fallen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh!","review":"I have to say that I did NOT like this book. The potential for a good book was there, and the plot could have been wonderful, but it was poorly structured and sloppily written. Sometimes I think Danielle Steele just rushes through her books and spits out whatever she can so she can get on with the next book. And what's worse, she has a large enough fan base that she can do it and still make bunches of money. Anyway, this book did not touch me on a personal level and i don't really think it deservs all the rave reveiws that I read. There wasn't enough elaboration or dialouge to really touch your heart and at the end, i was really glad it was over. The story was too farfetched and the end just kinda left you hanging like the author had gotten bored with it. So, the only good thing i have to say about this book is that i got it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I decided to try reading a D.S. book simply because she's a big name and has bestsellers. What an awful book for me to start out with. Danina wasn't an interesting character in the least. The male character, the doctor whose name I can't remember because I couldn't find it in my heart to even finish the book, completely took advantage of Danina. I believe the doctor was about 38 years old and Danina was about 18 (?). It's been some time since I've read this book, about a year and a half, so I might be a few years off with the age difference, but I remember it being close to 20 years. I found the age difference repulsive, but also the book was very slow. I don't recommend this book at all. I have heard that some of her older books are good reads so I'm going to try them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitly not her best","review":"I thought it was real predicable.

It was difinitly not her style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chess Openings Bible","review":"This is pretty much the quintessential reference guide for chess openings - it has been called the chess \\"bible\\" by many players. Any serious chess player needs a good openings reference book in their library for reference purposes. But remember this book is an overview of EVERY opening so it doesn't spend too much time on each opening for that you need to buy individual books on individual openings. But this book starts each chapter/opening with a brief overview of the opening, it's history, the main ideas of the opening and the sub-variations. Then it list columns of variations that you can memorize (good luck!) or play through to get a feel for the main ideas in the opening. And lets face it, if you make mistakes in the opening you will likely feel them the entire game so surviving the opening is important! I wouldn't bother with this book if you are rated below say 1500, it would be a waste of your study time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated and Outdated","review":"A good book if you want a lot of superficial variations and lines to play that have a good chance of being outdated or maybe even busted. 30 or 40 years ago, during this books halcyon days, this type of compendium info was a blessing, but with the advent of on-line databases and PC databases, this book has become a dinosaur and is destined to become somebody's doorstop on a blustery day.The book's real value may be only for stronger players (2200+) to see what outdated and recommended (but now busted) lines some unlucky sap will play into so as to be led nose-first into the slaughter-room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference at a great price!","review":"If you can't afford a GM's library, then this one book openings encyclopedia is a must for you. Nick de Firmian is excellent as always. I still have the Batsford Chess Openings Volume 2 that he wrote with Kasparov and I must say that de Firmian knows what he is talking about. Alas, this will give you a basic understanding of most openings, and might get to some dept in others, but don't expect it ro substitute your own study and analysis. Still, I highly recommended as it contains a wealth of chess openings information."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible of Chess","review":"The MCO series is not for the faint-hearted. First and foremost, it's NOT for reading, it's a reference. It's also a gigantic tome, exhaustive, and brutally dense in material. It is, however, absolutely essential for someone who asks: \\"What's wrong with that move?\\" MCO-14 analyzes every possible move from every possible line of every possible opening to give the reader a way to track down any possible mistake anyone has ever made. DO NOT buy this book if you haven't played much chess. DO NOT buy it if your chess is poor and you're looking for improvement. However, if you've reached the point of asking \\"Why?\\" when reviewing a game, if your chess is strong and you want to make it stronger, MCO-14 is absolutely essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sanus Systems Shelf","review":"The VMAVB Component Shelf Wall Mount might work for you if you have multiple components to stack on it, otherwise it is too large.

Having a single mount to fit a variety of items can be difficult however this item gives a good foundation. I think I am going to cut a piece of 1X and put a decorative molding on the fron to give it a nicer look but more for functionality. Also glass gets nasty even in the cleanest house.Overall construction is very good. Nice and tight fit and finish. Did without the plastic cover for the cords however.

It does not include a class shelf to set AV component on. However, I think a class shelf is unnecessary as it restricts air flow anyway and is just anther thing to clean. This thing is sturdy and easy to mount. The only thing keeping it from getting a \\"5\\" is the fit and finish. Screw holes were a little off center for securing the shelf to the wall bracket. I would also like this to be modular and allow multiple shelves to be linked together and allow cables to pass through. Also the price is a bit high considering the simple design and very litte materials invlolved in production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good... Sturdy...

The book is basically scanned and re-subtitled under the illustrations. It does not work well at all on my reader and is a waste of money.

I remember the other children taking the books from the library -- they loved them -- but I just didn't see what was so great.When my daughter was born, a friend of ours bought this book as a present. I didn't read it to her until she was about 2, and that was only at her request. She is now 4 and she still loves the stories, and believe it or not, they've grown on me.Many people have complained that these stories and illustrations are not the originals, but that's just fine with me. It didn't take away from my daughter's enjoyment either.If you are an avid fan of the original Curious George, this may not be for you; however, I enjoy it and think the stories are perfect for bedtime.

When It arrived we were surprised at how nice the book is. Very well made with a nice hard cover and really nice heavy stock pages. Our oldest loves the curious George movies and ipad games and this turned out to be a great addition. We read it to him before naps and bed time and he gets all caught up in the stories as we go. After two stories, roughly ten minutes to twelve minutes worth, he is ready to go nighty-night. Very happy we got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd for iPad","review":"While my 3 year old son doesn't notice, the choice you have to use this on an iPad is to pick from reading the text or to have the picture big enough to notice the details, because you can't do both without constantly having to zoom in and out. Overall, if I had known it was this complicated, I wouldn't have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a well made ebook","review":"As another reviewer noted, this is a poorly laid out ebook - just scans of the pages (including the text) with the text added again below them.

Truly amazing music with a deeply spiritual base."},{"rating":"2","title":"In not as many nouns and metephors","review":"In not as many nouns and metephors as Amazon's description of this album \\"The Prayer Cycle\\" is an odd album. Odd in the sence that there isn't much else like it as far as pop/alternative artits go. Alanis (as you might have read previously) sings in both Hungarian and French. Her voice is best complimented with that of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's.

Every unit has simply stopped working and had temperature current, high and low as well as humidity current high and low all stuck on the same readings regardless of battery changes or clearing. Other units have had the displays fail either partially or completely. The chief user complaint is the buttons frequently become caught under the unit housing when resetting the high and low readings.

Any monkey wrench will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"We've been debating about buying this chair for a LONG time. My husband has sat in them at Hampton Inns and at the training centers he goes to. He would come home and rave about how amazingly adjustable and comfortable this chair is. But...after looking at the price we thought No way would we spend that much money on a chair. However, after months of thought, we finally decided to go for it. And, it has exceeded every expectation. My husband struggles with back pain after sitting at his desk for long periods, and that is no longer an issue. Also, the mesh seat and back are much cooler to sit on for long periods as opposed to our leather office chair we had. I would highly recommend this chair to anybody. It is adjustable in every configuration possible. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavily flawed and overpriced","review":"This chair is initially comfortable when you sit it in for short periods. However, it does not stand up to extended sitting. It has multiple flaws that should not exist in an $800 chair.#1) While the mesh seat is comfortable towards the back of the seat, there is a support beam underneath it in the front that prevents it from flexing. This puts pressure on your hamstrings, which becomes very uncomfortable after a few hours.#2) The arm pads are as hard as a rock.#3) There is a plastic seam on the edge of the seat that scratches your legs when you turn.#4) The back is not very flexible.#5) It is constructed with a large amount of plastic.#6) There is no way to lock the arm pads in place.Try sitting in one for a few hours before you buy one. Do not base your judgement on sitting in it for a few minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Add","review":"This product from Backstore advertises it is the \\"fully loaded\\" Herman Miller Mirra chair, but as you scroll down to product description, it is in fact the \\"highly adjustable\\" model.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Good but it Isn't","review":"This plastic back chair may look good and have a few adjustments but the synchronized mechanism offers little support for women who want back support. The seat pan on this chair has hard edges and it is similiar to its sister chair the Aeron. Both have been known to cause deep vein thrombosis in some of the clients we have provided ergononic assistance for. Think about it, a plastic back chair with minimal seat depth adjustment and an open hip adjustment that makes you want to sit away from the back of the chair with no real lumbar support can hardly help you begin a good foundation for support with your lower extremities. If you want support don't chose this chair its horrible and we recommend against the purchase of them along with the Aeron 9/10 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and uplifting music for the spirit.","review":"Sam Levine music is great for the spirit and soul of people.

Any good youth coach understands that the youth players well-being comes before winning at any cost.

The Lassie part of the film is corny, and the rest is so typical of that era's movies that it is pure fun: the dramatic background music by Andre Previn; the sad,stoic orphan boy; the famous singer aching for her lost child!

It seems as though the Ataris simply dug some disposable old tunes out of the closet and just threw them on here to make a quick buck. None of the material really stands out as anything worth listening to, and fails miserably in comparison with the usually enjoyable, melodic emo/rock crafted by these guys. Addtitionally, the recording quality on each song is not up to past standards. Useless ID is a band that offers nothing that hasn't been done before, and bares an eerie similarity to almost every melodicore band, especially No Use for a Name. Their songs are forgettable at best. In the booklet, it is stressed that \\"a new ataris album is coming real soon\\", thus proving that this is simply FILLER.

It smelled so badly that I decided to leave it sitting on My counter to air it out. It's been 4 days now, checked it every day and it still stinks really gross! This material might be latex free but I'm not sure I'd want to use it when it stinks so badly!Now I find out this item can NOT be returned. Hate being stuck with products I don't want!!

For the price it more than delivers. Its firm, not too soft and bendable and I had no problems using it to its fullest because of this. My only minor problem is the suction cup barely works.

Even among the growing popularity of kenjutsu and iai in America, there are very few English books on the subject. Even fewer are the books that give you a decent insight into a particular ryu and it's history. Lowry not only captures a good historical overview of the Yagyu Shinkage ryu, but intertwines some of the philosophical aspects of the art through his own education of the school.On the negative side, most of the book is history of the Yagyu Shinkage ryu. While he includes reflections on his own training, I would have enjoyed hearing more of that along with the history. A line of inheritance of the Shinkage ryu would have been great. A great book among the few out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Lowry","review":"This is a great read for anyone interested in learning about the history of the Yagyu Shinkage Ryu of swordmanship.

I have been a fan of Dave Lowrey's books and columns for many years. This book reads like a novel, even though it is more of a biography of the author's search for the real meaning of Bushido. Just as in many ancient martial art stories, this one begins with the author's quest to learn the martial arts from a Japanese couple living in his area.The journey from novice to expert in Kenjutsu (Sword art) is a long hard road, but the author makes each step an adventure in reading. In conclusion, this is a book for all serious martial artists who desires to learn the true meaning of Budo.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J.

Our previous Venturer/Durabrand player's sound was much better.The picture is hard to see if the screen is not pointing directly at one's eyes. This is even a problem for shorter or taller passengers seated directly in front of it in a car. The only way to adjust it up or down is to adjust the front car seat to which it's mounted. Fortunately, we can still output the signal to our old DVD player for another passenger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets PIPING HOT when charging - unsafe, very unhappy","review":"Very disappointed with this item. It doesn't hold a charge for more than 2 hours at a time. Once plugged in and charging, it gets unbelievably hot - my toddler picked it up and dropped it while hugging his hands to his body like he burned himself. I thought he must have overreacted when feeling the warmth... but then *I* picked it up and thought - wow! something is wrong here! It would have burned his sensitive skin if he happened to have been watching it when propped on his belly/knees like usual - if he had sone so while plugged in. VERY disappointed. Would have requested a refund from Amazon, but in the Xmas rush we tossed the box, don't have anything but the unit and accessories anymore. Will be contacting the company. - Mom to John, age 4"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 3, 1 Worked","review":"Bought 3 for my kids at my local Toys R Us after seeing this online at Amazon. Luckily I tried them before Christmas morning (after reading a bad review posted here). After fully charging, the first one started fine and played a movie for about 12 minutes, then the screen went black (and never came back). The second one only played sound (no picture), and the third worked great for the 30 minutes I tried it. I took all three back and got a refund (I couldn't afford to take a chance on the good one going bad on the second movie).

BTW it does that by itself...All of the sudden it stopped working and the on indicator light just flashes constantly...The item price at the time of purchase was $199, now its on sale for $119 I believe...either way too much...Stick with a brand name (Sony etc) portable Dvd player and buy it at a store in person, to facilitate easy returns, and get the extended warranty if kids will be handling it...ANyone wanna buy a broken DVD player?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Player with Problems","review":"I charged this DVD player a week before Christmas, and then wrapped it. When my kids opened it, the battery was dead. I recharged it and then tried to put in a movie. The movie would not load without pushing down very hard on one spot on the top.

It's so compact, you can stand it up, hold it, or hang it from the back of the car seat. The one I purchased came with a case, an A/C plug and a plug for the car.

I gave it to my son for Christmas and charged the unit for the whole day. The player worked fine for a couple short trips in the car, probably a total playing time of 1/2-1 hour. Today my wife told me it wasn't working anymore. When I plugged in the AC adapter, the red \\"charging\\" light came on and within 15 minutes, the green \\"full\\" indicator lit. When I turned the player on, the screen flashed briefly and immediately died. When the \\"full\\" light comes on, if I unplug the adapter and plug it back in, the \\"charging\\" light comes on again for a 10-15 minute period. This kind of tells me the (unreplaceable) battery pack is shot. It could be due to the car adapter since a couple reviewers mention car adapters not working.

My son's player stopped working before he finished his first movie and my daughter's machine broke the day after Christmas as I was coming back from Toys R Us with my son's replacement DVD player. The screen on the replacement machine fell apart in my hand as I was taking it out of the box. Toys R Us was great about giving me a full refund on both machines so that I could buy a name brand DVD player for my children.

One for my son and one for my daughter for Christmas morning. I too- charged both as the directions stated so they would be ready Christmas morning. They neither one worked Christmas morning. I read the directions closer and realized that they needed to be charged up to five times and completely discharged up to five times before they would fully hold a charge. So almost a month later of fully discharging and charging, my son's will hold a charge, but my daughter's still will not hold a charge. I am also very disappointed at the carrying bag that is sold with this. I thought it was a bag. It is not. It is just a case that you put the DVD player into to strap it to the back of the car seat. It does not hold any of the accessories or any extra dvd's.

This DVD contains many great comparisons and factual background that goes deep into each issue being presented. However, it lacks professionalism in presentation techniques. That is, the music supporting each category is second rate, canned music, unlike what I had expected. The History Channel presentations are always well presented and because I have many of their presentations, the latest being \\"America, The Story of US,\\" I am spoiled. I like anything I view or prepare for presentation to be professional in all aspects. Now this does not take away anything positive about the comparisons and the weapons that are compared; they are very informative and enlightening. I learned something from these comparisons, but the music was distracting because it is what I would expect to hear in an old black and white film in the early days of televison."},{"rating":"1","title":"All about hype, less about being good.","review":"To be honest I don't really understand why the ECMAs gave this record so much attention in comparison to such stellar must-own albums like \\"You Are What You Love\\" by Melanie Doane. \\"Davnet\\" is folk-pop dribble with so many snoozers on it it's not really worth the selling price. \\"Another California Song\\" and \\"Traffic\\" are probably the only two songs with potential mass appeal while most of the record is acoustic ballads or midtempo attempts at songwriting which fail to develop to their full potential. If you like the \\"hit\\" singles you might like the record, but I only slightly liked them and they are the only songs which I can listen to on this record without skipping to the next track half way through. This record is all about East Coast hype and not about actually being good. Seriously, if you're looking for smart pop, check out Melanie Doane. She always delivers and unfortunately rarely gets the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Scent In A Compact Package","review":"Old Spice is a pleasant scent, although there are more contemporary colognes that I prefer, like \\"Realm\\" and \\"Altitude.\\" This is a good choice for travelers, though, as the bottle is small and is long-lasting.

The price has tripled since my last purchase; at which time I paid $6.96 each and I purchased six. The price has now escalated to $19.95 each in the space of months. Some one, either Amazon or Proctor and Gambel, needs to take a close look the marketing of this product since it it not available in any store and the price online is outrageous.

I have been a junkie of binaural entrainment CD's - I just like to see what people have done - and for me, the music here is counterproductive. It is, for me, too lively for deep meditation.

This happens even in some of Kelly Howells other cds. That long pause of reflection in silence, is broken and makes you JUMP. There are definitely a few of those in here. Cosmic Rain -track 3 (Open Higher Consciousness) has some sound effect of water dripping in an echoing cave. It doesn't start until maybe 12 mins in. The waves of music are broken by these crisp semi-loud drops that, to me, don't need to be there. It makes me jump EVERY TIME. I want to skip tracks like these all together.I don't have enough of a 'higher consciousness' opening during or after the use of these tracks to make them worth it. Its just the same calming frequencies from other CDs from her. Go for a guided meditation instead and skip this one.

The main fault lies in Long's often times hard-edged, rhythmically unimaginative approach, which deadens the character and saps the poetry out of most selections. We know that a hard and inflexible approach is what Scriabin himself most abhorred in performances of his works. I get the impression that Long is not in touch with Scriabin's highly individual, mystical sound-universe. The approach is altogether too straightforward and prosaic, although not lacking in liveliness and drive. In addition, there are actual rhythmical and notational misreadings: for example, in op. 3 no.7 ms.66 or op.3 no.9 ms.30. Why save a little more with this Naxos release when Long largely misses the point and other versions (Le Van, Feinberg, Pizarro) manage to bring out the essence, the emotional depth and mystery of these works ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"I felt like I was prisoned in a small room without any window, without any fresh air, at first I was bored, pretty soon, I become asphyxiated.

This book was presented as one of the most entertaining of these mistakes, because although the author used the at-the-time new photo printing technologies, she didn't use it for original sources (manuscript illustrations, etc) but for pictures of contemporary models in her interpretations of medieval clothing. The results are extremely funny. I expect similar problems with the other eras covered.

These were squires, Lords, Earls and other titled persons who lived lives unencumbered by the need to work. Today's Internet millionaires don't know when to quit. They should walk away from work to pursue hunting duck, quail and pheasant on their large estates. Some of them would also pursue gardening, literature, and painting.

So far, that's a joke.

Lawrence's \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" came as an unwelcome surprise. The edition itself is excellent, with a fine introduction, authoritative text, maps, notes, and bibliography. But the cover (and a gratuitous list of women the author is alleged to have shagged) is more than disgraceful. What conceivable purpose does this serve?

The number of typos destroys meaning and reduces parts to drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Sexy and Simple","review":"I was afraid this book would turn into an erotic Pride and Prejudice with drawn out subplot and hollow or pretentious characters. They were pretentious but I felt a kinship with each. The social life a wealthy person often experiences in this age is cut down to a few essentials and the characters are well chiseled so they are simple to track. The erotic scenes were surprisingly tame or cut short. There was far more philosophy about life, people, and sex than I anticipated. I enjoyed these sections as much as the sex, though for different reasons. The eroticism is more based on the uncomfortable moments of being naked together or initiating sex. These awkwardly unfolding moments gave a sense of realism mostly gone from modern erotica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Lady Chatterley","review":"I read 30 pages of the book, and put it down. The author does not make me care about Lady Chatterley as a person. I want to feel some sort of sympathy for a character, even if she makes mistakes.Frankly, Lawrence should have wrote this under a pseudonym and marketed it as erotica/pornography. It would have escaped the censors at the time and he would have made money off of it, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Famous because it was banned","review":"I picked this book up in honor of banned book week. It seems to me that this book gained more notoriety off the fact that it was banned than because it was a great piece of literature. I had to keep reminding myself that it was set in the 1920s, as the writing style was more reminiscent of a Victorian era novel. Furthermore, Lawrence portrayed his characters as if they were in the Victorian era. The characters were not well developed, thus making it hard to have sympathy for anyone in the story. The end was disappointing as it simply fizzled away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but comfy","review":"The foam never came to the full size of the mattress-it is couple of inches short on each side.

This summer I sublet an apartment for a couple of months and ordered a Serta 3-pound memory foam (supposedly a memory form) mattress topper. It was already on the bed when I arrived at the apartment. I immediately felt that it was not actually memory foam. Then I looked at the actual topper and found that it was just foam, which is quite different from memory foam. I definitely would not recommend this particular brand. In my opinion, the label \\"memory foam\\" was a false label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing ever!!","review":"I'd like to preface this review by saying that I had back surgery 6 months ago and have been waking up with severe back pain every morning ever since. The doctor told me this is normal because I had a 2-level fusion and my back gets stiff during the night.I actually purchased this mattress topper for the very uncomfortable futon that's in our guest bedroom, to make it more comfortable for guests. But first I tried it out on my own bed for a night and was AMAZED at how comfy it was, and guess what else? I did NOT wake up with any back pain! None!

The reason I am saying this is that reading the few bad reviews, I was hesitant, but after sleeping (LOL) on it, I decided to go ahead and get it. Well, thank goodness I did! It is wonderful! As for the smell, what smell? If I put my nose right down on it, I can smell a little bit of a chemical smell, like any foam, but when sleeping or lying on it, I can smell NOTHING. I pulled it out of its casing and laid it on my bed and it laid right down. It was not wrinkled up or crushed or spotty. It feels like a million bucks and I am so glad I bought it. I broke my ankle and cannot climb stairs to get to our bedroom, so I have to sleep on a rented cot in my living room that has a HORRID mattress. It is so much better with the foam.

I researched online for a couple days looking for mattress pads because I truly wanted a tempurpedic...but when I saw this one for 44 dollars and free shipping I jumped(cus shipping is a Killer over here). They shipped it the same day I bought it and I recieved it in about a week. It came neatly packed and I do admit it smelled kinda like cocoa butter but it fit perfectly on my twin size mattress and it was the most comfortable sleep Ive had deployed.

Doesn't bother me otherwise. Typical of foam mattress pads - will go away with time.Was not as firm to the touch as I anticipated. However, when my weight is spread over the pad, as opposed to pinching it with my fingers, it is just fine. I would like it 5 stars worth if it was somewhat more firm but it does what it is made to do.I thought the reason I had been sleeping so poorly was the noise from the huge generator near the tent.

Then when I started to listen I realized the Skull disc was all rap and the Bones disc was rap with rock choruses. I liked that. The only bad thing is that a lot of the songs sound the same but I don't mind. I think I like the Bones disc because it's rock and rap but the only drawback is that it has only 6 songs. I wish there were more songs on the Bones disc and actually on the Skull disc too because I liked that one too. Overall I loved this cd and I think you all should buy it. If you have kids I'd buy the edited or kiddie version because this has a lot of swears, especcialy the Skull disc.

It is still what you expect from Cypress Hill; you still can swear that you can smell the weed coming out of the speakers. Cypress Hill puts down 10 solid tracks into wax. But there is more: The \\"Bones\\" disc, an EP of six rap-metal songs is one of the best example of true rap-metal this side of Rage. With help from (Rage drummer) Brad Wilk, the boys from Fear Factory, and Sen Dog's metal band, SX-10, this metal disc is a great example of the real rap metal. Real heavy, and real raps.

If you like rap or rap/rock, you have GOT to check this stuff out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable rap album but didn't care for the rock stuff.","review":"The album was for me a matter of personal taste in fact. I believe that DJ Muggs brilliant hip-hop production with its typical fare of stringy and tinkling pianos help to reinforce the imagery and violence of the underground gangster life. I relished the skulls disc. On the other hand, being a hip-hop purist, I really didn't enjoy the rock disc all that much. I presume that it was a wonderful experiment but I really wasn't so hyped on the actual execution. I wish that Cypress Hill finds a new direction in its production and that it turns to a heavier hip-hop style like the way that the Wu is evolving. Rap superstar is a must hear however."},{"rating":"1","title":"No hits on this Skunk Weed","review":"I love cypress hill but cant stand this album. Its just plain horrible to listen too.

But, the only good songs are \\"Rap Superstar\\" and \\"Rock Superstar\\". And, after hearing \\"Rock Superstar\\", i don't listen to \\"Rap Superstar\\" anymore. the difference between the two is that \\"Rock Superstar\\" has everlast at the begining instead of eminem, there are some really cool guitar riffs, and there is an extra verse that is awesome! But, that is the only track i listen to. My reccomendation is to either find those 2 on single if you can, or just download them online and save the [money]. If you are a diehard fan, however, pick it up just to fill your collection, but not for any other reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst cd ever!!","review":"Cypress Hill's Skull & Bones is the worst cd I've ever heard. I recommend that you don't buy it, because if you do it'll be a waste of money. The only good song on this cd is Rock Superstar, Rap Superstar is alright too. I would give this cd 0 stars, but one star is the lowest rating. If you want a good cd buy Ja Rule- Rule 3:36, Too $hort- You Nasty, or Limp Bizkit- Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Im not big into rap. Not much hip hop either. But Ive always liked Cypress Hill. I own Cypress Hill III,IV, Stoned Raiders and Black Sunday. Thats some good stuff.This album was way too flip out and go nuts style. Its like thats all they were going for. I thought Can I Get A Hit was kinda cool...Skulls is the Rap CD, and Bones is the Metal CD. Id have to say Skulls is not my kinda rap (my kind being similar to the albums I mentioned I owned), and Bones is pretty bad metal. Some of the metal is cool, but bad for the most part.I liked Stoned Raiders, but I think it was the album that said \`Were tired of chillin, we wanna freak out.\` Thats what this album is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skull And Bones","review":"Four albums deep, Cypress Hill has been criticized heavily lately for still sounding exactly the same as they did when they first came out in 1991. Well, this was their answer; a half rap and half rock album.Muggs also experiments on the rap side and the result is, well boring. The rock side might attract new fans to the Hill, but for anyone who doesn't like rock music...this is only a waste of 6 tracks.So if you like rap/rock combos, this might be for you. If not, there is nothing here worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has this World come to","review":"I couldn't believe my ears when I first put this CD in my stereo. The first thing I did was curse at my roomate for telling me to buy the album, before I actually threw the CD case at him. I've owned and enjoyed every single Cypress Hill CD so far, especially Black Sunday, a Rap classic. The new Cypress album is just a poor attempt to sell some albums to the same kids that listen to Limp Biskit and junk like that. I had hoped that Cypress would have changed, for the better, either musically or lyrically, but they sold out, and that's really bothering me. I'm gonna go listen to some Outkast, peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"No bones about it, this rules","review":"Alrite, first off... Let me say, that if \\"Bones\\" had a couple more tracks, and got released on its own, it'd get somewhere around 72 stars... But until then, this CD rocks. You guessed it right, I'm not a rap fan... But be that as it may, this is one of the best CD's in my collection. Now if you ARE a rap fan, you'll love this too... It's got killer tracks on either cd. While \\"Rock Superstar\\" is enough to get hooked, the track that stands out the most for me is definately \\"Can't Get the Best of Me.\\" It's a great song to get pumped up for anything... Overall, this is one great CD, and you should go buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for the \\"Bones\\" disc","review":"I rarely listen to rap albums, but Cypress Hill is one of the few rap groups I listen to. Actually, they're probably the only rap group I listen to. Skull & Bones is a double album seperated into 2 discs - Skull, which is mainly rap, and most of the songs are OK at best, and Bones side, which is a Rage Against the Machine style Rock/Rap disc. This is the better, um, half of the album, and while there's only six songs, they're all really good, especially Rock/Rap Superstar (two versions on each disc, and they both sound exactly the same), one of my favorite new songs. Cypress Hill really did a good job with this CD, and I hope they do more albums like the \\"Bones\\" side..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cypress Hill is brakin some skulls and bones","review":"This cd is awesome.I like 10 of the rap songs and only 1 of the rock songs.So I would say the skull disc is alot better.But if you like rap or rock or both than this cd is a must by.i would of gave this cd a 5 but I don't like most of the rock songs.This cd is brand new and i suggest you get before its old.Peaceout and keep bawling"},{"rating":"1","title":"Musically their worst...","review":"Cypress Hill, of course, has nothing new to talk about in this album, but no surprise there. Lyrically, they are still very good. Musically, however, there are maybe three or four songs out of SEVENTEEN that are worth listening to more than once. The second CD is composed of six hard-rock tracks. I think it's safe to assume that Cypress was thinking about certain \\"musicians\\" like Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Korn, etc. and are simply trying to compete. Instead of sticking to their roots, Cypress Hill attempts to \\"branch out\\" into territory that they aren't known for and can't do very well. Their first four albums are much better musically, but maybe it's no surprise. They weren't worried about making hard rock tracks back then. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL ON IT BUT...","review":"one more time cypress prove that they still have the capability of doing something good .

Some blocks I could use other patterns for same block, but when I had to use this author's directions it was horrible. Very time consuming and took all pleasure out of making the block. I was determined to make this quilt for a friend and did finish it but I would love to have a ceremonial burning of this Burns book."},{"rating":"2","title":"underground railroad sampler","review":"I found the book easy to read and understand the directions.

Interesting history, clear instructions, helpful information on historical reproduction fabrics. Really enjoy doing sampler quilts. Hope they do more quilt books like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best First Quilt Book Ever!","review":"I chose this sampler for my first ever quilt, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Quilting friends have heaped high praise on the quilt, and I know it is because the directions were so easy to follow. I will be looking for other books by these authors for my next project!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated...historically and practically","review":"I am an experienced quilter and collector of books related to hand pieced quilts tracing back to the days of slavery and the Underground Railroad. I jumped to purchase this book because of the title and because I have successfully used other Burns' books/patterns. The intructions for each block were unnecessarily complicated. The pictured quilts were lovely, but I'd prefer to see them without the attempted \\"staging\\" of history - each quilt presented by the same woman in period costume. It just didn't sit well with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underground Railroad Sampler","review":"This is a great book. The quilt goes together quickly and looks great! Eleanor also gives here technique for flying geese which is different that all the other techniques for making them, and they always come out perfect.

I just love how it opens as well, like a switch blade :D It is really very effective and never once have I had a bad cut with it. I even got the free leather sheath they offer for registering and It did indeed arrive. I love my cutter, It sits inside my Coolidor with my cigars keeping it in good condition as well as the leather sheath. Man does that leather like it in there... so soft..:D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cutter","review":"I love this cutter. It is by far the best one that I have ever owned. The only problem is that I stressed out the spring by opening and closing it all the time. I went to Vegas and kept opening and closing it as I played the tables. It still opens, but it no longer springs open. I returned it and got a new one. They come with lifetime warranties so its a real win win. If you are looking for a good cutter for a cheap price, this then get this cutter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Choice","review":"I bought 3 of these to have by different humidors around the house. I found the $2 guillotine cutters you get in grocery store checkout lines stay sharper and cut better. I've also owned a couple Xikar butane lighters and found them to be inferior to inexpensive butane lighters that replaced them. So far my impression is that Xikar products are grossly overpriced and inferior to competing brands selling for far less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable Cigar Cutter","review":"This cutter feels solid and I expect it to last me a lifetime. The matte black nylon handles do not scratch or chip, but still look sleek. I have dropped the cutter a few times, picked it up and everything is tight, with no chips. As far as cutting cigars this thing is a champ. Blade is razor sharp. I have used it on many gauges and shapes and every time they come out perfect. Just make sure you snap it shut with a good deal of force. Even the best cutters can mash a cigar if not closed quickly. The locking mechanism makes it very easy and safe to carry in your pocket, and since this thing is so light you barely know it is there. After cutting through 75 or so cigars and a year of use there is not a sign of rust or blade dulling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cutter","review":"I've tried a few other, cheaper cutters before and so far this one is by far the best. It has a nice heft to it, is very sharp and feels like it could last a lifetime if properly taken care of. I am very happy with this cigar cutter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good cutter","review":"This cutter is very nice and has a great design. I would merely caution anyone buying this cutter that they should keep it away from water. I used it around my pool and it got some drips of water on it. the next day it had multiple spots of rust which are difficult to remove"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal Debut","review":"This debut by Ira Sher was like nothing I've read before. It took me several pages to get into the groove of the author's writing style - he demands a close reading, choosing to pack in a sentence, say, what other writers take a paragraph or two to convey. But, the prose is gorgeous, the imagery beautiful and haunting. The book is about a boy's father who is chosen to be the first \\"non-astronaut\\" to walk on the moon. When his father goes \\"missing,\\" the reaction is not exactly what you'd envision. The novel captures the lost innocence of a previous era, where America held wide-eyed wonder at man's accomplishments, yet it also foretells the squander of the crass and shallow emotionalism and misguided intentions of today's frenzied media exploitations. The novel is not for everyone: I would definitely classify it as \\"post-modern\\", for the ending is anything but tidy, but that is, perhaps, exactly what the author intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!","review":"It's a taunting mystery. It's an ode to disillusionment. It's a heart-breaking story of a father lost and a son discovered. It's a thinking man's history of a country stretched to its limits with the exploration of space and the exploitation of the soul. It's an intense, poetic deconstruction of the spirituality of humankind.Is it challenging? Yes.Is it worth the effort? Beyond a doubt.This book will forever change your inner voice, and inspire you to live a smarter, more thoughtful existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentlemen of Space","review":"A beautifully written novel by a talented new writer. I highly recommend it....especially for those who like a little mysticismmixed into their storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greedy Kindle Pricing","review":"Why is the Kindle Edition of this book so high??? $3 cheaper than the hardcover is NOT what I signed up for when I purchased my Kindle. GREEDY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to form","review":"At last, a new album from System 7. It's a few years since \`Golden Section' and it seems that time has been spent wisely, reassessing the group's sound and approach. The drum'n'bass influence \`Golden Section' didn't quite match the standards set by previous System 7 albums, so it's great to see a return to strength on this album.First track \`Manik Shamanik' is the best on the album. A lush intro followed by a smooth house beat which works into a warm, rhythm track. What is most evident on this album is a return to the 4/4 beat, the classic System 7 style. Some tracks are very hard trance songs, like \`7 O\`Clock\`, not totally to my taste. Elsewhere is the beautiful, warm Balearic-esque sounding \`Sal Del Mar', the stunning, calm, break beat song \`The Abyss' and the closing track is another wonderful song, the soft piano house of \`Chiringuito'.But, on the whole, this is a welcome return for one of the most consistent and quality dance acts."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I received was not what was pictured","review":"The picture shows the complete set for installing hanging files.

The concluding notation advises the hostess not to give the mangled remains of the luncheon to her husband for dinner.At best a gag present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great shape","review":"Arrived on time, decent price, but book was dirty and since I had intended to give as a gift, I was unable to do so.

He has to read \\"Friday Night Lights\\" for the same reason.I can stand it, but barely. Makes me wonder about the author. Why would anyone go to so much trouble to invent all this gobblydegook?Actually, although I really do HATE the genre, this book is well enough written to keep me going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaching good avoidance.","review":"This book is good if you want to take years fixing your dogs problems and avoid every problem until then. I personally can't avoid every 'unperfect' dog until then. It goes over desentization (not rocket science) but doesn't give any good answers to what to do when your dog is having issues. I'm not a fan of the 'just run the other direction' theory. It's not good if you want to actually address your problem and avoids the topic of when it's puppy-ness or real aggression concerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful guide to a tough subject","review":"I heard Pat speak on the subject of dog agression last year at the Pet dog trainers assocaition. This book fills out the notes from that session. An incredible assest for trainers dealing with all levels of agression in dogs. I have used the methods with good sucesson three client cases. Reading this gives trainers more options for dealing with feisty fido's that show up with unhappy owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow these instructions - they work","review":"This is a slender booklet with a specific purpose it meets well. McConnell provides easy-to-implement strategies with gentle reasoning behind them. Her focus is on changing undesirable behaviors by giving the dog an alternative, one which is taught using positive reinforcement and incremental learning. I found the ideas here very beneficial for my Feisty Fido, Sydney. Feisty Fido meets its stated purpose well and in ways that are helpful to both the dog and his or her human. Four stars is only about the limited scope - by design to be sure - not of any criticism of the book or author. If you have a Feisty Fido, by all means read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"This is a great book. I found that it's most helpful when combined with How to be the leader of the pack also by McConnell. What worked for my dog was combination of the two books and some in home training. It took several months to get very far, but once she started getting better she started getting better every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for leash reactive dogs","review":"I got this book for my large, leash reactive dog. I have been working on the strategies in this book with my dog and have seen big improvements. I love that it uses positive training methods to help my dog be in control and successful when he sees another dog (or anything that heightens his anxiety) . This book was highly recommended to me by our dog trainer, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is feeling frustrated when walking their dog. It is a quick read, packed with TONS of valuable information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read if you have an alpha dog!","review":"Patricia McConnell has become one of my very favorite authors of training guides. I have read so many books, and most didn't help me for specific issues that pertain to my German Shepherd Dog. While he is the smartest, most loving family dog we've had in over 40 years, there are major difference between Labs and GSD's that require us to completely change our training approach, while avoiding signals that allow him to think he can take over as leader by default. I have also read her other books, and am currently reading \\"The Other End of the Leash,\\" which I highly recommend, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"This book was recommended to me by a trainer to help with my leash reactive dog, and it gave a lot of really good pointers. I used to be a dog trainer so much of what it talked about was a review for me, but I still learned a ton and got a lot of great new ideas to try with my dog. It's also nice to have it written down so you can make a checklist of how you're going to work with your dog. Even if you are going to a trainer (which I highly recommend for ANY behavioral issue) I think this is a great knowledge base to have and I am starting to read all of McConnell's books. When I was convinced I had to go to a shock collar, she showed me another way. I am please to say that my dog is making progress with these techniques, but it is a slow process. This will not be a quick fix, but it will be a lifetime fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket","review":"It's great to see Astaire and Rogers finally getting their due with two boxed sets that represent all 10 of their films. This set represents the first five chapters of the greatest romance in movie history and shows the two performers growing from self-conscious youthful exuberance into the polished teamwork everybody remembers. With each film there is a fairly breathtaking advance in every area -- from acting and directing to sets and makeup, and of course in music and choreography. All five movies have wonderful things in them, but the standouts are \\"Roberta,\\" a masterpiece of sparkling musical comedy with a brilliant score and phenomenal dancing, and \\"Top Hat,\\" which remains the definitive Astaire/Rogers movie. Even \\"Follow the Fleet,\\" burdened with a tedious script and leaden direction, comes alive in the superb musical numbers. If you have to choose between the two A/R sets, the other may have the edge, but this one is equally indispensible."},{"rating":"2","title":"godd product for men","review":"This is a very good product and works good.

The mailbox did not include a bracket to attach the mailbox to the post. No biggie, what do you expect for $7.95, right? On the mailbox packing container, there was a note that said that they recommended the Solar PLMB molded mailbox bracket. You would think that the holes on the bracket would have aligned with the holes on the mailbox given this recommendation. Well, two of the holes lined up! Two out of four ain't bad, so I give the bracket a two...or is that the mailbox that should get a two!! Nothing wrong with the bracket (per se) or the mailbox, just the people who did the QA on the two items (quality assurance)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect For High Traffic Areas","review":"If you live on a 25mph street in a subdivision, then spend a few extra bucks and get a sturdier mounting bracket. If, like me, you live on a high traffic road where replacing a downed mailbox is something you have to do multiple times a year, then this is a great product.It's not a rigid mount. The mailbox will move a bit when you open and close it. This flexibility is a negative to some, but to me it's a huge positive. Since the plastic flexes and breaks before wood or metal, it means that I don't always have to replace the post, or even the mailbox, when someone takes it down. Sometimes I just need to replace the mounting board, and the fact that it's a plastic board means that's a relatively cheap repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie/Good Vendor","review":"The movie is delightful.

As I read more, I came upon the food pyramid and was referred to a later chapter. Disappointingly, I found separate food pyramids for Asian-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and African-Americans. I was shocked to read some of the content of the food pyramids and found it to be extremely offensive and prejudice. Lumping an entire race into a different \\"food consumption\\" category is unbelievable and very untruthful. For this reason alone, I stopped reading the book halfway through. The book has a copyright date of 2002, which makes the food separate food pyramids even more appalling.I have found more helpful information for soon to be pregnant women on Internet searches, especially in terms of nutrition and fitness.

I benefited greatly from this knowledge, and have met many women who wished they knew certain things before their first prenatal visit. This book will prepare you, mind and body, for the beautiful journey ahead. The portions I found most helpful were on diet and nutrition, which discuses your pre-pregnancy needs, and how that changes with pregnancy. Following that is a portion on medicine, herbs, teas, etc. that will impact a healthy conception and pregnancy--I turned back to these chapters many times even during pregnancy. This book is very practical, concerning your body's cycle, your bodies needs, what to avoid that will negatively impact pregnancy, and what will benefit you as you prepare."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is useful but all claims have not been proven.","review":"This book really freaked me out. I learned a lot, but concluded from my readings that no one is fit to have a child and that everyone interested in conceiving should have been raised in a bubble. The book uses the theory that you are better safe then sorry, but all of the claims are not backed up scientifically. My recommendation is to read the book and not take it too seriously, then make a prenatal appointment with a gynecologist. The doctor will put your mind at ease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book was useless. It is a great idea to have a book about getting ready for conception however this book fails to live up to the task. I think my biggest complaint with this book is that the book is dull and really doesn't go into terffic detail about how life changes after a baby. Which is something you should think about before having a baby. It also lacks helpful and practical steps to take before getting pregnant. Topics such as determing gender and pregnacy after 35 aren't even mentioned. Instead the book focuses on diet and being fit.

But if you're looking for useful information on what you can do to increase your chances of conceiving quickly, you won't find it here. The authors only devote ten pages to the subject of \\"how to get pregnant\\", offering a very watered down version of the conception/fertility information you will find in other books such as The Mother of All Pregnancy Books by Ann Douglas and Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler.

It would have been helful to read a more humorous, yet realistic approach to preparing for pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple can be good thing...","review":"I found the book to be a little too simplistic, but then again maybe making babies is a simple thing.

Moral of the story...Eat right, Exercise...Don't drink, smoke or do drugs (over the counter included)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rawther Odd","review":"What I find astonishingly odd about this book is that Eloise's mother invites her to Paris. Eloise and Nanny, tres excited, fly to Paris. They see all the sights. Never once do we see Eloise's mother. In fact, Eloise and her Nanny stay in a hotel by themselves. Odd. Very Odd.But it's fun to see and hear Eloise learn French, and I enjoyed the humor provided by the illustrations. There is too much repetition, but the character of Eloise is tres engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merci, Beaucoup!","review":"I'm so glad this was reprinted!

Eloise is stalking through the plane to Paris and notes \\"absolutely no one slept.\\" I vividly remember the charm bracelet she saw. The expressions of the people on the plane are memorable to this day. So when I shared it with my grandson, I was pleased to hear peals of delight as he recognized the outrageous behavior of a child on a plane. Now that children are often strapped into special seats on planes, the fantasy of the roaming child is particularly enchanting. The drawings throughout the book contain such detail that the reading of it yields a happy half hour of shared discovery. Love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cest moi, Eloise!","review":"This is my favorite Eloise book. As an Eloise fan and a dedicated Travel-buff, this book is a perreniel favorite.My sister and I had a battered copy that had belonged to my mom. Little did we know that it was a first edition. Unfortunately, with the cover missing and many of the pages creased and loose, it certainly didn't look like much.That didn't matter to us, all the pages were still there, and we read that book, along with Eloise and Eloise in Moscow, over and over again. How happy I was to see that these books have been re-printed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am so happy this book is finally back in print!","review":"I first discovered this book about 11 years ago in Paris. I read the French version to the children I cared for. What a wonderful children's story. Ever since, I have often imagined what it would be like to be Eloise (ahem, that's Heloise in French) wandering around as a child in Paris for the first time. Imagine the magic! It's what little girl's daydreams are made of! My French children loved the book and carried it with them everywhere proving that this book is universal in its appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paris Is Rawther Amazing","review":"Eloise gets a telegram one day from her mum inviting her and Nanny to come over to Paris. Eloise can't wait. She falls onto the French capital like an American storm and goes just about everywhere. She dines, sightsees, meets locals, gets a dress made just for her by none other than M. Dior, and she eats so much she gains \\"rawther\\" a lot of weight. In the end, Eloise misses the Plaza and is happy about her return home to New York. In a nice touch, in the doorway above the famous old hotel Eloise and Nanny call home, a big banner hangs, and it reads, \\"Welcome Back Eloise!\\" Eloise has gone full circle and we feel we've taken every galloping step along the way with her. Yet another fun and charming volume in the Eloise series from Kay Thompson and Hillary Knight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Under the Influence?","review":"It reads like Eloise has a severe case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). She orders \\"three straight Johnny Walker Black\\" (scotch) from room service and says \\"Oh my Lord\\" an astonishing amount. She uses the words \\"cawn't\\" and \\"rawther\\" and a plethora of made up words. A passenger on the plane is said to \\"smoke 3 packs a day and laughs rawther loud\\" and there isn't a smidgen of punctuation in the entire book. Yes, it does have French words and illustrations of Paris, but that can be found in many other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive Jazz pieces","review":"This is a great cd to put on when having friends over for drinks.

Other artists with great contributions to the album are Fatboy Slim, Natalie Imbruglia, Philip Steir feat.

At first, I was a little skeptical because of the additional work needed to prepare the shake and powders were just intimidating to me. However, the experience forced me to do some research and actually turned out to be pretty tasty. First off, I used almond milk instead of skim because I don't really like milk (and the effect it has on me...) and because of the benefits of almond milk - the nutrients, etc, as well as avoiding the potential dangers of non-organic milk (look it up. Hormones, etc). Delicious! My advice is to fork over an extra couple bucks and pick up the Blender Bottle -Classic Mini 20oz Blender Bottle Purple. VERY helpful. I tried just mixing it up with a spoon the first time and it was almost impossible to blend up, not pleasant.

However, Gothic is a drone IMO i.e., Hellfire. They've taken the music from 'dark' to 'bleek'and more boring.More than likely, \\"Touch Me\\" with Chrissie Hynde will blow the drone interpretation away! Ah, this rockin' mainstreamer <--NOT, Chrissie, is what rock is fundamentally all about, and given the Pretenders' cover of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Roomful Of Mirrors, it'll be right on! I'll choose \\"Touch Me\\" from the covers right now.No one else can do Peace Frog nor Soft Parade like the Doors - that's an absolute! And, not all Doors' music is that entertaining nor meaningful anyway so if one likes droning so be it, but if one likes rock 'n' roll, go for Chrissie, and perhaps the other so called 'mainstreamers' will have grasped the idea, not like Gothic - simply picking up on the dark element of the Doors turning it into drone."},{"rating":"1","title":"to dark not good bands","review":"Being a devoted doors fan I check up at on the doors official website pretty often and in all their articles the tribute album was portrayed in a different light.

The new ones are all wrong -- both the dish drainers and the drainboards. The good old rubber-covered metal ones are the best. The new style, with the stupid hole in the end, where items can fall through into the sink, is just plain idiotic. The drainboards only come with the runoff area going the wrong way. They don't fit my sink and counter, and the dishes have to be racked back-to-front, instead of side-to-side. The traditional side-to-side method makes sense, but the new way makes you have to reach over some dishes to get to the others, making it easier to break some of them, especially if you have overhead shelves or cabinets nearby. Side-to-side is a logical progression. I think that none of the designers have ever washed dishes by hand.

Instead of learning how to say \\"I would like\\" and \\"She likes\\" and \\"they are bringing me this\\" etc. etc., all it teaches you are questions. \\"I would like to see the menu\\" and \\"can you direct me to the toilet?\\" are such phrases that you would learn upon listening to the two tapes provided, and such is the dynamic nature of the French language that there is a multitude of grammatical aspects to the language. One cannot pick up French just by listening to questions.So in short - don't buy these language tapes 'cos they're a waste of money and time. If you want to learn the language, take a class.

Basically all the rest of Raekwon's flow lacks that shine. I know Raekwon can spit some fire so I was kinda taken back... I hope he saved his best for Cuban Linx II and 8 Diagrams.The album as a whole is scattered and non-cohesive. Production was in between not very good and decent.

But what a waste of money... Not only was the book dull and obvious, but it was also pretentious. Do not expect to find anything similar to a mistery novel or even a detective story.

Two friends had recommended Auster to me and this was the first book of his that I picked up. However, when I started reading and found out that \\"Paul Auster\\" was a character in the first story, warning sirens went off. Occasionally, a writer can pull off the whole insert-yourself-into-your-story thing. This is not one of those times. The story read like a like a pretentious effort by a first year MFA student who really wanted to tell a \\"deep\\" story that had \\"meaning.\\" Aside from some interesting passages (mild spoiler) about religious history in the new world, I found the story to be rather boring and the effort at some deeper meaning to be banal and transparent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best trilogy ever","review":"The three different stories are all dark and thrilling psychologically.

I didn't find the main character in the first book very believable, in that he seemed to be rationally driven, but at every step he made such stupid mistakes.I also found Auster rambles on and on for pages at times on topics that are only loosely connected with the storyline. This can often be done well, but he does it by telling rather than by showing, which I find to be one of the biggest differences between a good book and a bad one.I was quite surprised at the many positive things I've heard about this book. I suppose it just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Modernist Take on Noire Novella","review":"Mr. Auster's Trilogy is strong in stylistic innovation but sadly lacking in imagination. His themes, plots and characters reveal a writer with a broad exposure to European literature, but the sum total of the work feels repetitive, impoverished and too smart for his own good. I lost patience for his empty characters devoid of specificity. At times, it seemed like endless, nonproductive navel gazing on the life of being an artist/sleuth. It reminds me of a much weak version of Martin Amis' Times Arrow, which I rather liked, for all its flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"pseudo","review":"I might be ignorant, but this book didn't appeal to me at all. I read it during my summer holidays, and it wasn't bad entertainment. However, I don't like the plot of the three stories, and especially City of Glass is a bit too \\"pseudo\\". Some passages are like reading Umberto Eco, but without his brilliance and more important without importance to me as the reader!I rate this book 2 stars; 1 for Auster's writing, which (without doubt) is good ,and 1 for his description of New York. I've never had the pleasure to visit the city, but in this book it comes alive.My conclusion will be: If you want mystery novels stick to Raymond Chandler, and if you want the rest stick to Umberto Eco ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant modern fiction","review":"I found \\"The New York Trilogy\\" excellent. It was my first reading of an Auster work - and it was quite simply stunning. The first thing that impressed me was his prose style; it's easy to see that he also is a poet for some of the passges in this trilogy are simply products of an aesthetically dazzling mind! But Auster is more than a poet on prose, he is also - and I know it sounds like a cliché! - profound in his probings of the human condition; I'd say the central themes of these novels are man's ghostlike existence, the nature of the artist and illusion/reality.

There is a point in THE LOCKED ROOM, towards the end when everything coalesces and when I got to it, I became, at once, so enlighted, so frightened, so impressed, and so scared that I almost had to vomit.

The trimmer itself is quite good and uses much less string that others we have owned. However, the charger has now failed. I actually put a meter on it found it was putting out 1.8 volts instead of 18 volts and the red light never comes on anymore. I was able to use the charger for my B&D electric drill of same voltage and it is now successfully charging the trimmer batteries. I checked the output of my old charger at 19.0 volts. Of all my battery operated tools, this is the cheapest design charger I have ever seen. I found prices from $14.55 to $24.00, which is honestly about $10 to $15 more than it should be. I am going to contact B&D to ask why so many reviews are negative and ask too if they have an improved model available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement","review":"This purchase was made to replace the original charger that came with a B&D; hard surface blower.

Things which you and I may take for granted are included in every book of Paye's I have read. With this let me say a little about the book listed. As usual Coach Paye is very thorough. The system is based on a sound philosophy. Any coach using this system needs to have it in place at lower levels of his program. Without this it would be difficult to teach the whole system. Though many parts of this sytem can be implemented in a single season. Coach Paye also addresses this in his book.

Before the pop-oriented divas such as Faith Hill and Martina McBride hit the scene and stole the thunder from real country music, Patty Loveless was on the verge of becoming the female country star. She is a star in her own right, by all means, and this collection does her catalog justice. It's an enjoyable compilation with touching ballads and catchy upbeat country songs both.

But there are some great songs on it as 'My Mind's Eye', 'Always Near', 'Goddess' and 'Shiva Descending'. I would advice getting a copy from these hard to get earlier albums but also 'My mind's Eye' or the somewhat harder rocking album 'The Glamour' are great albums to have in your collection.

The book is written in prose flatter than Twiggy (remember her?). The work also a not-too-subtle condemnation of small town parochialism--towns of the hinterland that will protect their own, even murderers, but do-in strangers, like Forester, in a Los Angeles minute...The novel becomes almost funny, or rather, pathetic. To think that Forester (he \\"forests'\\" death) would care what happens to evil Nickie, his ex, or to Greg, his would-be murderer, strains verisimilitude.

If you want a light romance(she and the prince do bed down once)enjoyable characters, plenty of laughs and action, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most rhythmic, sensual blues ever!","review":"Absolutely the best music ever invented for exotic dancers.

On the contrary, the LOVE, ELVIS album is a testament to Beegie's great talent. She plays the selections with outstanding taste in nice and easy swing interpretations, and the arrangements for the trio are excellent. I have all of Beegie's albums, and every disc is a gem. Her latest issue is a tribute to the music of Johhny Mercer. Do not hesitate to pick it up, as well as the Elvis tribute. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports fans of all ages will love this!","review":"I purchased this for my son's 8th birthday. I was SICK of typical toys and didn't want to bring anymore \\"junk\\" into the house. Given that he is a sports fanatic, I hoped he'd enjoy this and not be too young for it.Well, he LOVES it and spends hours each weekend pulling the stats from the weekend's games and recording them onto the board, while following his favorite teams, the Dallas Cowboys & Miami Dolphins. My husband loves it too and sometimes they argue over who will get to fill it in. My son is ADHD and really doesn't enjoy any \\"sitting-still\\" type activities, but this Game Day NFL Standings board will hold his attention for quite awhile and it helps him with his ability to focus.

But this is the kind where the numerals are arranged always facing out from the center. Which means that where you expect to see a VI, you see an I^. So when I look down and see I^, I have to try to figure out what that means, and by the time I realize it means VI, it is no longer VI. Or I start contorting myself so the numerals are face up and easier to understand but sometimes I pull something and it hurts. Some watches are arranged so the digits are mostly always facing straight up and they're much less confusing. Also, there is no volume discount. I mean, it's not like you're going to wear the same Cartier watch to work (where it might get ink and ketchup on it) and then out to the opera.

He should have fired his agent. His Detective Jerry Beck character is one of the more unsavory protagonists to ever grace the silver screen. When Beck vomits on a perp you get the feeling that the only place \\"Dead Bang\\" has to go is up. The only thing that redeems Beck is that he is allegedly better than the cartoonish white-supremacists that he is tailing. The film also wastes the talents of Tim Reid as a sherriff, William Forsythe as an uptight FBI agent,Michael Jeter as a police psychiatrist who Beck intimidates, and Penelope Ann Miller whose sole purpose in the film is to share a perfunctory bedroom scene with Johnson. About the only thing that redeems this film is that director John Frankenheimer stages a fairly decent showdown scene with the supremacists in the catacombs of an Aryan church."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION: There are two bands named \\"Doubting Thomas\\"","review":"It is hard to rate this CD since it was not the one that I was looking for.

The guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse. Example: \\"Hey World\\" begins with how much it sucks to be 13.When I saw Pelican in concert, they were opening (?!?!?) for A.R.E., so I decided to give them a second chance. The sound guy must not have liked what he heard, because the bar chatter was louder. \\"Louder\\" I yelled, so that I might find something redeeming in their music. \\"Yeah, SUCK louder!\\" Someone else yelled - I had to agree & give him a high-five.

They just wind up sounding stupid, with nothing to say and an awful way of saying it.As for the music -- big dumb electro. (Didn't Bis already explore this nonsense anyway?) I suppose if you didn't live through the original New Wave this might seem interesting to you, but to me it sounds like a poorly produced knockoff of bad, slick dancey new wave.

With such a large family, they agree that it would be easier for everyone if they flew the Rolls Royce over too as it could accomodate all of them on their excursions. When they finally arrive at the small, shabby hotel, the owner, Madame Dupont, wrongly assumes that anyone who could afford to drive such a magnificent car, has to be a Mi'lord and treats Pop as such. The usual mix ups with food, drink and language occur and when the owner discovers, by means of their passports, that Ma and Pop aren't legally married, it's put down to the eccentricities of the English aristocracy.

The title track alone shows that he is in tune with what is going on around him, and his toasting style, both forceful and frantic, best illustrate the feelings on the streets.This lp is certainly his best effort to date and will not take purists (which I consider myself) long to see similarities between Bounty and Peter Tosh.

Then buy this book, and make it all yourself.This book has great projects, the designs are easy to follow, and the descriptions take you through the build step by step.Aside from general home mainenance -- installing a new doorknob, putting up a wall shelf, etc. -- I had never actually built anything until getting this book. In three separate weekends in January I was able to make an Adirondack chair and ottoman, and a arts & crafts looking outdoor endtable to go with it. Plus, by making just those three things, I've already recouped my costs for the tools I needed to buy to build them.This book has been great for me (a woodworking BEGINNER), and has inspired me to build and learn more about making furniture.I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who is either interested in getting into woodworking, or just wants some good, easy plans for outdoor furniture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do some research before you write a book","review":"Books like this one really pisses me off.

Refusing to let this stand in his way, Sherman pleads for a divorce but his wife, a devout Catholic, refuses to give into his demands. If she will not agree, she will have to be removed.

If he were giving this review, I'm sure he'll give it a 5.

Most of us have been to a carnival at least once in our lives and have imagined what it is really like once all the people are gone and the lights go out. This book tells us the behind the scenes scoop of this particular carnival and the sudden appearance of a pack of coyotes that end up terrorizing Sunnydale. As always in all the Buffy books, Buffy and her friends come out on top but not before tangling one on one with a new breed of monster. Even though I am older than the expected audience for this book, I am a fan of the show and really enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read......","review":"I really liked this book. I read them in order, so this was number 3 for me. I love the show and this, to me, would have made for great episode material.

It's about time they give him some credit. And yes, he is my favorite, because of the sarcastic remarks. :0)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coyote Moon, a five ticket ride","review":"John Vornholt creates a haunted setting for this spooky story.

However, this is detrimental to the overall sound because it is not very cohesive at all and most of the covers are pretty horrible. One of the better covers is The Dashboard Confessionals, \\"Jamie,\\" which is actually pretty suited to the lead singer's voice. \\"Surf Wax America\\" is pretty horribly covered, just a bunch of screaming, which is disappointing since the original Weezer song is so exciting and fun to listen to. Overall, this is a pretty disappointing record because the reason most of these covers are passable is because they try so hard to sound like Rivers Cuomo and the rest of the band. Covers are supposed to be distincitive of the artists trying to recreate the songs. I would recommend you to not buy this CD, but download these songs from iTunes or something if you want the cover version:- The Good Life- El Scorcho- Jamie- Only in Dreams"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had better....","review":"I was horribly disappointed at this weezer tribute album. I was expecting it to be so much better. Weezer is an awesome band, and the bands who play on this cd are pretty good themselves. The only songs that I could bare to listen to were the ones redone by midtown, the ataris, dashboard, and the stereo. The other's were hard to listen to- they so severely butchered weezer's songs.

It makes excellent background music for gatherings of friends, and as there are no lyrics, it does not intrude on conversations, but it allows one to drift back in time to their own memories of the Fabulous Fifties and enjoy music which really WAS music.

But, what you may not know is that he's very stylistically diverse and had influences from all different genres of electronic music. This cd set really exemplifies that diversity. The great thing is that it's not categorized. You don't hear the same kind of music track after track. There's tremendous jungle influence as well as old school techno.

The reviews for this \\"Glitter & Glow\\" edition on Amazon all seemed positive, so I placed an order just in time for Christmas. My daughter was thrilled. I have to admit, the glow feature is really cool! Just 30-seconds under a light bulb, and her tummy, nose, ears & feet (white areas) glow brightly; the rest of her body (the pink fur areas) also emit a feint glow as well. I was a little bit disappointed at first that the white/glow areas are not furry, and the material is somewhat scratchy, but since my daughter doesn't seem to mind, it's all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"Many books on algebra lose sight of the basic underlying ideas when the author gets caught up in the formalism. Formalism is good but, as Bourbaki has demonstrated, it isn't always the best thing for teaching newcomers.This little book is a gem. I bought it on a whim - curious that such a format would be applied to such a subject. I was pleasantly surprised. It pares the subject down to the minimal essentials without losing anything of central importance in the process. There are books that cost 10 times - even 20 times as much that don't do half as good a job.IF you take the trouble to actually read the book, listen to what the authors are saying, do their exercises and THINK about what you are doing, you can learn an awful lot very quickly. The authors know how to blend formalism with intuition - a mark of the true teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fine introduction","review":"I'm learning group theory in order to use it in physics. I found this book very good for a first introduction to the subject. It starts with pretty simple stuff and then proceeds with more serious matters. I find the example very clear, and I especially appreciate that full solutions to the exercises are provided, so that you can check your own findings. There are a few easy to amend typos, and I think the demonstration on page 46, theorem 20, part (2) is false. Finding another demo was a good exercise !I went through that book twice, before moving to Burn's \\"Groups : a path to geometry\\".All in all, it deserves 5 stars because it succeeds in delivering the reader what it promises."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is ok.","review":"I would not advise buying this book.Most students buy this book only because their lecturers say it's a good book; afterwards they discover that the book isn't as good as was first claimed to be.The first ten chapters are well-written, but the following chapters are difficult to understand.

Almost everything I read in this magazine are things I already know. It seems like each issue will cover a lot about one subject and not much else. For example, one issue will be full of almost all grooming articles, another issue will be almost all about senior cats, there is the kitten issue that comes out every year ect ect. Now if your a new cat owner this magazine would be nice way to get basic knowledge about caring for cats. But for long time cat owners I am sure everything you read in here will be something you have heard before.

I'm also very unimpressed with their Cat Channel online board they advertise in Cat Fancy and cannot recommend it to others. They seem to have poor management of their online board especially on weekends so inappropriate posts stay there for a long time and a professional magazine advertising their own online board in their magazine should have their online board perfected before offering it. Also Cat Fancy pushes a ridiculous high renewal rate for their magazine, but if you go onto Amazon, you can get a renewal rate of almost half the Cat Fancy renewal price. So I have come to the conclusion that between the Cat Fancy magazine, their poor online Cat Channel board and the high renewal rate Cat Fancy charges, they are not interested in keeping their readers or online members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra Help for Cat Owners","review":"I purchased this magazine subscription when I brought home my third kitty, a Persian.

But, I've gone through 3 bags out of 6 and so far, I think I've found a total of 15 chips that were larger than one square inch. Obviously, it is likely a shipping issue that broke most of the chips, but the impact to me is still the same: a bag of chips that are very difficult to eat.I think my local Sam's Club has these more reasonably priced, in larger bags, and I'm more likely to get unbroken chips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title of this video describes the appropriate audience","review":"I purchased this DVD for my 3 1/2 year old son thinking it might help him learn a little bit about the game of golf, with some instructions on how to swing. However, this DVD turned out to be a bunch of kids driving around in miniature battery operated golf carts doing what ever they want, and chasing some guy dressed up in a bad wolf costume. Also, if you want your kids to learn some golf etiquette, this is defiantly not the DVD for you, the children on the video for the most part are left to do whatever they want on a golf course, including driving the carts around on greens. No educational value, great for babies who want to watch children swing clubs hap hazardly and watch an ugly wolf run around."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD sucks!","review":"I want my money back!

It does nothing to teach kids about golf, the proper way to play or behave on a golf course. It looks like it was cheaply put together and the production is second rate. I do not recommend this DVD or any in the series. There are plenty of other golf and sport DVDs out there that do a MUCH better job, so dont waste your money here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"Too much detail, no maps or anything to give the bearings of where things were happening.

I didn't like it much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theme","review":"I have already entered a review but this concerns the theme of the record. Tuonela is the 1st Amorphis record with a clear meaning: it is a voice of prosperity in the face of frustration, want without the means, cunning knowledge and beauty that remains unnoticed. A recommended buy, the record flows like a river."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stare Into the Abyss","review":"If you are a metalhead that gets an adrenalyn rush from fast paced furious drumwork and insanely speed driven lead guitar than this album will destroy all the others in your collection. Speed rythym and diabolic lyrics are the key to Amorphis'rampage of the metal world. Your world will never be the same !!!!! P.S. Not really, but that's what a lot of people want to read. Since this album is in the vain of Elegy, but moreso, it cannot fail. Melodic enchanting lyrics that touch the soul and a musical quality that is almost hauntingly a folkish metal conversion. Uncomparible to anything, but definitely worth the listening time. ...A Must Buy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the death vocals?","review":"After hearing Tuonela and seeing Amorphis live at the NJ Metalfest, my opinion of them has dropped drastically. Tomi Koivusaari should have continued to do the vocals for Amorphis. Tales from the Thousand Lakes is one of the greatest albums of all time. To see them totally remove (except for track 5) the death metal vocals from their latest release is very disappointing. I liked Elegy a lot but they've gone too far with this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying!!!!","review":"is as simple as that: this work is annoying because of the excessive use of the cry-baby pedal, that just get in my nerves. it's a shame, this was an excellent band (elegy is the finest!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not incredible","review":"To fully appreciate this album you need an open mind. A lot of people will come from the death metal background and say that they are selling out...but they're really just progressing to a different sound. Who wants to hear five albums that sound exactly the same? Of course it's going to draw a larger audience after giving up the death vocals. That's a given. Anyway, I think there are some great songs on here. My favorites are \\"The Way\\", \\"Greed\\", and \\"Summers End\\". The musicianship is good, as is the songwriting, but after listening to Opeth, which is my favorite band, I can't say this is a great CD. A lot of the music seems simplified. It's often the extra instruments like the flute and sitar that give this an edge. A good release, overall. If you liked Elegy, there's a good chance you'll like Tuonela."},{"rating":"2","title":"T H E<--->B E S T<--->O F<--->T H E<--->B E S T","review":"You think that you know what's metal about?! Check out this CD..After you have listened to it, you'll know what's metal all about. Trust me. Amorphis represents true metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it","review":"Am I just not hearing this right? This was my first Amorphis cd. I got it because I enjoy Opeth and Lacuna Coil and I thought that maybe this band would be along those lines. Well, I was disappointed. Even though they have a Theatre of Tragedy ring to them I found that they have too much of an 80's long-haired rock band metal kind of sound. I didn't find them amusing at all. Maybe I would have to listen to this cd about 10 times before it would grow on me, but I'm not about to find out. I have other more important cd's to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Amorphis?","review":"I can't believe that a great band such Amorphis comes back with this piece of crap album.What happened??Maybe these guys were short of money and they needed to change their style in order to fit more with the Alternative fans.I cant believe that after their great Artworks such \\"Tales from the Thousand Lakes\\",\\"Elegy\\" and prior releases,they can fall so down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you guys ever listened to Amorphis before?!?","review":"I can't believe some of the rave reviews I'm reading about this album. Amorphis has now done what seemingly most other bands do when they finally make it big: they mellow out way too friggin' much. I can't believe there are hardly ANY death vocals on this album!! They just aren't the band I used to know back in the days of \\"Tales...\\". I love Amorphis, but this was a HUGE disappointment. Like I said before, I don't know what you other guys are smoking, but this album is horribly boring, much less \\"a masterpiece\\" (geez, not even). If they continue in this direction, their next release should be a fuzzy stoner rock album. But I won't know, cause I'm adding Amorphis to my collection of sold out bands who turned into pussies. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because \\"Tales...\\" and \\"Elegy\\" were so damn good that they deserve something at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible album from an excellent band","review":"How disappointing is this? Amorphis seem to have put experimentation and production before songwriting. This is a band that made its name with dynamic, original riffing and there isn't one to be seen on the whole album. Now we have banjos and flutes. Although these instruments add something to the music, Amorphis forgot to write decent songs in the first place. I have no problem with Amorphis abandoning their death metal roots for a more melodic sound, but there aren't any memorable melodies. Pasi Koskinen is a woeful vocalist and and even worse lyricist - some of the stuff here will make you laugh. In a word: bland. There is a myriad of bands that do the same thing far better...try Katatonia, Anathema or Green Carnation for melodic, progressive metal that leaves Tuonela for dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you","review":"You can see the theme of Tuonela on the cover of the album, which shows a withering leaf. Most of the songs are about the decline of things, with a lot of autumn and winter imagery. So it's a little mournful, but with spirit rather than weepiness. Musically it reminded me a little of Metallica; reasonably heavy and not too complex, but it doesn't get very repetitive and the riffs are to support the lyrics rather than being the only attractive part of the music. The lyrics are very intelligent and imaginative, and with a little rewriting by a native English speaker they could have been truly poetic. This is one of the few metal albums I wouldn't be embarrassed to be caught singing along to."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLY CRAP!","review":"This is Amorphis' best album, and one of the best albums I have heard in a long time. It sounds almost like Pink Floyd in the middle of a deep depression while addicted to steroids. It is different than they're previous albums...but it's still heavy, and it still rocks. Don't believe me, listen to \\"Greed\\" and then tell me what you think. Top 3 songs: The mini-trilogy of \\"Tuonela\\", \\"Greed\\" and \\"Divinity\\". For those of you who enjoyed \\"Tales...\\" and \\"Elegy\\"'s folk-inspired songs, this album will not dissapoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Change for the worse....","review":"In word word, this is a very disappointing album. It seems the band have found a new direction with Pasi in vocals, and have discarded their death metal roots in order to play more prog rock. This is not always a bad thing, but Pasi's voice, while unique, is dull. Gone also are the great musical sequences and ripping guitar riffs which made this band great.If you were a fan of their earlier music (Elegy, Tales from a 1000 Lakes), then don't get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"Amorphis this time really impressed me, I've always been a fan of this band buty I never liked it too much as a gore band, just the cd with the \\"Light my fire\\" version. Trust me, passing from a ver heavy gore band to a calm clean band is not easy, and they've doine it well. A great cd from a great band, what could we expect? 4 1/2 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow i like!!!!","review":"Great sound. Very melodic, beautiful, just plain WONDERFUL music. These guys are great, very talented, and Pasi is a great vocalist. i love the overall relaxing feel of the music, there really is alot of emotion behind it. i recommend this not only to metal fans, but also to fans of music in general. i know you will definitely like it. even my dad does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly novel work","review":"This unique struggle, of two fugitive POW's between themselves and also against the unseen, relentless helicopter pilot who pursues them, is well worth reading. Barry England's first novel remains a tour de force and should resonate in the reader's mind for quite a while. It is indeed a \\"novel\\" in the literal sense. I've never read anything quite like it before or since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what it seems","review":"The cover photo and written description of this book are great, but buyers should realize there's no \\"Look Inside!\\" feature, and the description correctly doesn't say anything about music. The book contains written descriptions of numerous songs, plus lyrics, but no music (notes, chords, etc.) to go by, except for ABBACCA-type verse descriptions, or references to tunes common to 1923 but now long forgotten. This book's a great historical archive if the reader's already an accomplished folk musician who knows century-old tunes from memory, but difficult to appreciate for the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This is a pretty good movie that has a different plot then what I've seen in the past! Robert Deniro stars as a policeman, whose son is a suspect for a murder. His son's girlfriend(Eliza Dushku, who does a fine job at it) comes by to see his dad and drop of the baby, then she takes off, I guess she didn't want to see her boyfriend again!!

De Niro usually does good pictures and refuses the stinkers. But I was really let down by film's ending. It needed to wrap up 4-5 of the storylines that it started. The viewer is left to make up his/her own ending and guess what happened to all of the rest of the characters. An episode of Law and Order tells as good of a story and does a better job of dealing with the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"I struggled to watch this film because it had pretty good actors, but a very bad, dull and boring plot. The excitement level was at zero, and so was the suspense. The director and producer of this film did a very bad job, and made this film difficult to watch. The trailer was so good for this movie, but the movie was nothing like the trailer. I can describe this movie with one word... BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DeNiro is only star in this so-so crime drama.","review":"This film is disappointing, considering the acting talent used in it. The story is about a cop whose son gets into some trouble, and is supposedley framed. His father, the cop (DeNiro) must try to stay within the boundaries of his job while at the same time clear his troubled sons name of the crime. It is not very suspenseful and the end result, regardless what avenue they take, is dull. There is no wonder for who really committed the crime, who framed who, or who will come out the victor in the end of the movie. It just falls flat and it's to bad that DeNiro wasted his time and talents being in this film. If you want some great crime drama films that push this to shame, try recent movies like Along came a spider, Man on Fire, or Collateral. Deeper plots without the predictable outcomes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Garbage","review":"I thought this movie would never end. It just kept dragging on. This was not a good roll for Robert DeNiro. I was expecting action and adventure but all I got was drooping eyelids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sins of the fathers","review":"Robert De Niro plays a policeman who is haunted by his father'sexecution and by his own role in deserting his wife and son. He tries to compensate by being the best cop he can be, but has to face up to the fact that his son's drug problems seem to stem from the lack of a fatherly presence in his life. When the son is in the wrong place at the wrong time, he commits murder, and the father has no choice but to pursue him. De Niro shows his conflicting emotions in a way that only he can and goes through a moral dilemma of loyalty to his son versus loyalty to his job. The acting is good and the premise is an interesting one. The ending, however, does not live up to the rest of the movie and seems just too easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"City by the Sea","review":"This movie is Fantastic!!...Starring Robert DeNiro, Frances McDormand and JAMES FRANCO.....Filmed in Asbury Park, NJ ...near where I live, it is sooo well acted, so believeable and a good story.....I highly recommend this film...Patty"},{"rating":"1","title":"False Positives","review":"I purchased the 3 pack and used them one day after another.

It was a strange book. Sometimes it seemed like the author was in a drug induced state when writing certain scenes, like the suspended dining room with alligators below. Some book club readers enjoyed this book, but for me it was just too out there. I didn't finish it and didn't actually get what the point of the story was as it kept leaping from one fantasy world (or mental state) to another without any links. There are lesbian references, like the different take on \\"The 12 Dancing Princesses\\" who get married and all leave their husbands for women or mermaids.

Winterson's pretentions to philosophical and mystical profundity - her continual reference to the subjectivity of time and space, to our fluidity of self - were merely simplified rants on postmodern platitudes. Her ridiculous feminist ideology - ie, women are good, men are bad - is a backward step for feminism.

However, that being said, my first experience with the trimmer was excellent.The weight of the trimmer is good, although, it's possible that some people may find it slightly heavy.Assembly was the only difficult part. The metal U-guide did not want to snap into place no matter how hard I pushed. I had to use a hammer to get into place.The main handle/trigger design is excellent, and features a hook that you loop your cord around so it doesn't unplug itself. The 2nd handle is infinitely adjustable.The one-tap cord release works perfectly every time. The cord and 4.4 amp motor are very strong - enough to carve through dirt when you're edging.Overall, this Toro trimmer is a bargain, and comes from a great company with a great history of lawn-care equipment. Except for the difficulty in assembling it, it's practically perfect.Martin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spool/line Advance Dont Last","review":"Works great for a few minutes but after some advancing, the spool tends to lock up...which you might think would work better if you didnt screw the cap on so tight...but then the little eyelet that the line feeds thru can fly off (and you have to order that online and wait a week). Which I did. But, that doesnt solve the problem...neither does WD40. Last time I used this, it took an hour to trim my short walk because I had to manually advance the line every 8 feet of work. Please do not buy this machine. I wish I had spent 3x more money to get something that simply had more than a 30 minute life to it. Such a shame that I need to throw out a perfectly good engine/handle setup because the spooling mechanism is so poorly engineered/manufactured. I looked for aftermarket replacements but they dont seem to exist.

I did not have this exact model, but I have 2 models -- the 12in and 15in, that were new last year. On both models, every 60sec the string broke (happens), but the string would get jammed in its own crevice of the screw mechanism, or would disappear back into itself. This required hand-untightening the string chamber. However, if hand-tightened, often one cannot untighten it 60sec later -- leave hardly tight. I don't own a gas trimmer, but I went online and spent $30 for replacement teeth for my friend's trimmer so that I will have access to his -- that bad. When I was a kid, I used a string trimmer and occasionally had to advance the string (2-3 times per yard). In 25 years, what has TORO done to FAIL SO MUCH on such a SIMPLE electric motor application?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor burned the third time I used it","review":"I was just out using my Toro trimmer for the third time.

It now cuts the line shorter because the part is a bit different and now it's a 14 inch trimmer instead of 15 inch.

I have to carry it over to my neighbor and he uses a pair of big pliers to hold the spool so he can unscrew the cap. What a nuisance this thing is. I have bothered my neighbor so much I am embarrassed. The cap that slipped into the slot on both sides was easy to unlatch and replace. If you do not much strength in your arm/hands \\"DO NOT\\" buy this product.You might wonder why I didn't complain earlier; I thought with regular use the cap would become easier to loosen, alas not so; if anything it is worse than it was when new. So, for two full summers I have relied on my little 13 inch that I paid $30 for probably 8 years ago. I have a very large yard and it takes me quite awhile but I eventually get it done.

If you are not careful this eyelet will disappear before you know it and basically renders this trimmer useless, which means all the money you spent on replacement parts is now all-for-not.I highly recommend you steer clear of this product.PS-We bought a new and different brand of trimmer today so I have some used TORO replacement parts if anyone wants them.

Condition is very important, and Herb Keane, in hisA Price Guide to Antique Tools, does a good job in discussing condition and its effect on prices.Once you read some basic tool value books, you will want to advance to specialized books centering on brands, locale of manufacture, or type of tool.

That's not to say that this book is completely without merit or that others may not enjoy it. Rather, it just was too tedious for me.There was one chapter I found particularly interesting and that is the chapter regarding our awareness of time and, perhaps more accurately, our awareness of ourselves in time and its relation to anxiety.

However, like the other parents, I believe that this puzzle was poorly constructed. The paper peels off from the cubes, which is very surprising for a Melissa and Doug puzzle. I wish I could find another puzzle just like this one, but I don't want to waste my money on another puzzle that will fall apart like this one did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - not what you'd expect from Melissa and Doug","review":"My 2 1/2 absolutely loves this puzzle and has no problem putting it together.However, the construction/quality of this product is horrible. The blocks are too heavy, so be careful if it falls onto a little ones foot. And because they are heavy, they hit together and the stickers are coming off the blocks. I'm so disappointed in this product. It looks like we've had it for years, when we've only had it for a couple months.This is not one of Melissa & Doug's better puzzles. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but poor quality","review":"The puzzle is cute and challenging, so my almost 3 hear olds will play with it for awhile as well as using the pieces as building blocks. However, the wooden tray splintered apart after just a couple of days. I have since glued it and they only use it with supervision, but it is a shame that the quality of this product is not higher. It makes me question other Melissa and Doug products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best puzzle EVER","review":"My daughter has this puzzle and absolutely loves it.

There has to be a better way to put the pictures onto the cubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Product","review":"This is a very neat idea but the quality is poor.

They played a great mix, and had excellent energy and jammed really well together. Generally songs would start out pretty loose, with maybe only a beat, or unique sounds. Then one of the band members would take it and build on it, and the others would jam, building really complex rhythems and compositions. It may not be for you if you prefer mellow, defined, \\"easy\\" Jazz... but if you like pieces which crawl around, and thrash, and whisper and spit, exploding and surprising... then I would recommend Ponga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for your money","review":"When listening to the album, think about this: all material is improvised.

It doesn't actually teach you how to do anything. It just gives you all these complicated examples and they start out with the hardest verbs. When you're trying to learn Spanish verbs, you must know how to conjugate each verb. It doesn't even explain how to do this at all. The vocabulary flash card section is about the only thing I've been able to use but I even noticed a few errors with that. I already learned quite a bit of Spanish in school so I only bought this to brush up on what I already knew.

I also like the bit when the grandma thought fast when the boy was in the Grand High Witch's room (which is number 499). It was frightening when the boy was with the witches and they found out he was in the same room as the witches and he was spying on them without their disguises.\`The Witches' is such a good book because of the way Roald Dahl writes and explains what is happening in the book.

It is clear that the author is writing from a point of view of ignorance and hate. It promotes stereotypes and the hatred that results from his uneducated opinion. No matter what your views on Paganism might be, this book also celebrates misogyny. Children are prompted to be suspicious and distrustful of their female teachers and even their mothers. This is a loathesome way for the author to sell his uninformed opinions to the public - through children."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Book Matilda","review":"The book I am reviewing is The Witches by Roald Dahl.

In the story a little boy is told all about witches by his grandma. She would explain how to watch out for witches. After all the stories the grandma told, the boy comes face to face with the grand high witch and doesn't know what to do.A character that stands out in my mind is the little boys grandma because she stays all calm after finding out her grandson was turned into a mouse.

Secondly, we never find out Our Hero's name, not even his parents or grandmama! Thirdly, a mouse? Stupid. If you want \\"real Dahl\\", read the books that most people call \\"Dahl's Greatest\\": \\"James and the Giant Peach\\", \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", and \\"Matilda\\".

As a fellow Pagan, I have this to say: it is NOT TRYING TO TEACH CHILDREN (OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER) TO DESPISE PAGANS!!!!! I first read this book in second grade, and absolutely loved it. The thing you offended Pagans are missing is this; that right-minded people- of whom there are many- make a DISTINCTION between 'Wicked Witch of the West' witches in the media and real Wiccans.

I read the reviews in which raters gave this book a one star or two star. All I have to say is that this book is a FANTASY book; That is why the author can portray people as being witches. (In general, every piece of literature has a protagonist and an antagonist as characters) It is not to offend anyone, it is to expose children to fantasy and allowing children to use their imagination. As a teacher, I have this book in my classroom and the children go crazy over it! They can not get enough of this book! They do not take this text seriously, they think it is silly that woman dress up, children can be mice, etc. I would definitely recommend this book!!!

I already have plenty of those, thank you very much. Notice that the box says the Doomsday figure is exclusive to this package, so if I want it I have no choice but to spend extra money on figures I already have.And a transparent Amazo? What kind of sense does that make?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me the first two records instead...","review":"Okay, some of this is awesome: the ballads Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love and Life Without You are the best; Change It is a great blues-rocker, and his guitar livens up even weaker material like Say What! and Come On, pt. 3. Still, this is a thin album overall. Lookin' Out the Window; Look at Little Sister; You'll Be Mine and Empty Arms are among Stevie's worst. Stick to the first two records instead, plus maybe In Step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with 3","review":"Stevie was the unsurpassed guitar master of his generation, and there are some wonderful tunes on this album. That said, Stevie really lost me here when he added the bland keyboards of Reese Wynans into the mix. Before it was a tight trio, but with the keyboards the sound meanders. Do we really need a middling Reese Wynans solo after Stevie rips it up? No."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bigger sound with a new member.","review":"With the addition of Reese Wynans on the keyboards the band get a fuller sound & new inspiration. As Reese adds some great keyboard playing to the music it lets Stevie concentrate on his singing a bit more, with very soulful results. Opening with Say What!, an instrumental on which Stevie plays with two wah pedals, the album goes through every song with a renewed passion for the music. Included on this one are songs like Change it & Come on (part III), but all the tracks on the album are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated of SRV's albums...","review":"Many is the time I've heard somebody pick on Soul to Soul. I rememeber when it came out, some critics predicted that Stevie had lost that something that made him so great earlier on. I'd just like to say that they are REALLY wrong. Soul To Soul is a humbler, gentler album than the others, a bit more subdued, but every bit as awesome as In Step or Texas Flood. The songs are traditional but catchy. My personal fave is \\"Lookin' out the Window\\", the most underrated song on an underrated album. It's worth noting that this is a great party album too- seriously, put it on in the background sometime, it's perfectly conductive to the part atmosphere. The Bonus tracks and new photos/liner notes round out this excellent package. Ignore some others' advice and pick up Soul To Soul. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guitar playing","review":"Soul To Soul features what is probably Stevie Ray's most impressive guitar playing. Say What! is one of my favorite SRV songs, an awesome wah-wah guitar piece. It also has Ain't Gonna Give Up On Love, a SRV original tune which is a fabulous old-fashioned blues song with excellent blues guitar. Great album and a must-have for blues guitar lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bonus Material!","review":"A fun album from Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, though probably not quite his best. But it is probably his most straight forward effort, with a lot of medium paced, rockin' blues. Not too heavy. Not to hard. Just cool.\\"Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love\\" is an exception to this, with its wailing guitar work that makes it an album highlight. And \\"Life Without You\\" is a great track to close out the album...soulful, with some great melodies and a nice guitar fade out.Not his best album...but a good listen, nonetheless!Album sounds great, so high marks for the remastering.I can't imagine a fan of rock n' roll or the blues who doesn't like \\"Little Wing.\\" Whether it's the original or covered in tribute, the song just speaks to people, and so it's nice to see it included here, as part of a pair of Hendrix covers. This, alone, is probably the best addition to any of these SRV remasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevie Ray Vaughn: The Man Who Would be King.","review":"Stevie Ray Vaughn, the man who could say a thousand words with just one note, gave a new meaning to the blues. The \\"bad boy\\" from Oak Cliff, Tx changed the blues world and will be remembered forever. From the roadhouses of Ft. Worth to the legendary Carnegie Hall in New York City, Stevie Ray brought the houses down in a wirlwind of heart and soul that only few have posessed. With influences like Albert Collins and Albert King, Otis Rush, Lonnie Mack, and of course the Granddaddy of blues, BB King, Stevie Ray Vaughn was truely a man born to play the blues. The tragic helecopter accident which took Stevie Ray away from us took more than just a blues man, that August night took the man who would've been king. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good album from the greatest blues guitarist","review":"This album shows you what damage drug and alcohol abuse can do to a person. While that same abuse was a part of some unbelievable work prior to this, this is the down side of the arc.His playing and song writing here is uninspired. This is nothing compared to Texas Flood, Couldn't Stand the Weather and In Step, and those three are nothing compared to his live work (not Live Alive though). It is almost painful to listen to this knowing the hell Stevie and the band were going through.The only bright note with the reissue is the inclusion of a smoking version of Little Wing."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT THE HELL!?","review":"What am I missing here? This is an incredible album, even without the bonus tracks that make it beyond incredible. I think some SRV \\"fans\\" resent him making an album that has cross-over appeal. Hell, I would say \\"Change It,\\" \\"Lookin' Out the Window,\\" \\"Look At Little Sister,\\" and \\"Say What\\" are as good a songs as SRV ever did. But there are a lot more great songs as well. And he does throw a bone to the blues/jazz crowd with the songs \\"Gone Home\\" and \\"Empty Arms.\\" Of course the two Hendrix bonus tracks will blow you away. I will repeat what someone else has already said, Stevie played Jimi better than Jimi played Jimi. To people getting into SRV, trust me, this is a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful","review":"I work for a non-profit that does regular mailings. This was donated to help make the mailings easier, but I spent more time trying to load the stamps than stamping. I had to peel two off first, as noted in another review, to thread it through the mechanism, and then the stamps jammed. We had a donation of over-long stamps (the state flags), and they didn't want to go through at all. In the time I spent futzing with the load and getting a couple of stamps out, I could have stamped half my envelopes for the mailing (about 60). Even pulling the stamps out of the old-fashioned cylinder dispenser is faster. It looks cool, but it does not deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Use","review":"It's a good idea for a gadget; too bad it doesn't work well. It's challenging to load the stamps into it. It's difficult to align the stamps onto envelopes. The stamps jam in the roller. The empty backing is supposed to coil neatly into the compartment designed for it, but it wrinkles, buckles, and jams instead. I do NOT recommend this dispenser. Go for a simple plastic one, if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work. Period.","review":"After I bought this for use at work, the receptionist told me she had already bought one a while ago and it didn't work. I tried hard to prove her wrong. Actually two of us tried to prove her wrong but the item is extremely hard to use. The directions have an incorrect step and there are too many rollers within the unit that make the unit heavy and awkward to use. I had stamps all over my envelopes except where I wanted them. I even had one stamp on my desk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This is simply not worth the bother. Takes longer to load a roll of 100 stamps than put on by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"We mail 50-100 letters a day.Unfortunately, this is a good idea, but wasn't implimented right. Stamps would wrap around inside and eventually jam. We reverted to the $1 plastic stampholder provided by the post office.The vendor was prompt. shipping was fast. Product was far below par. It is not their fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very complicated solution for a simple problem","review":"It takes a fair amount of dexterity and practice to use this tool. It tends to roll over the edges of the stamps and may cause problems with the postal sorting machines. I spent a lot of time pressing the stamp edges down with my fingernail. I would not buy again. Look for one of the simple dispensers that holds the roll and the stamp peels into your fingers as you pull the backing strip. This device is too complex. It requires that the roller be positioned perfectly and the pressure on the handle is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"This stamp affixer does not work well with stamp rolls with backing. The excess backing starts to roll up into the wrong wheel, causing the roll to get stuck. Also, it is no faster than just affixing the stamps manually. A complete waste of money - don't bother!This company took a long time to ship my order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I purchased two of these and ended up tossing them in the garbage. They were cumbersome, difficult to use. I ended up simply going back to hand application. It was faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats stamps","review":"I hate this thing. I ended up returning it because it pulled the stamps off the coil and down inside the wheels of this item. You're better off getting a simple plastic holder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much $$ for too little help","review":"Although I could get this little gizmo to work sometimes, it is quirky and, over the long haul, not worth the trouble. Once a stamp gets lodged in the mechanism, which can happen pretty quickly, everything is knocked off and it ceases to work properly. It relies on stamps being perforated to an exquisite level of perfection and cut exactly straight. Of course, they hardly ever are, so stamps get jammed. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for actual stamps","review":"Don't waste your money or time on this tempting contraption. I do a lot of mailings and thought this product would help me save time. All it did was frustrate me beyond belief. It takes an inordinate amount of effort to get it to \\"work,\\" which it doesn't really do. Trust me -- you're much better off peeling and applying your stamps by hand. I've written the manufacturer an e-mail letting them know that their product doesn't do what it claims. Hopefully they'll improve it before more suckers like me throw away their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, this thing is junk!","review":"I work in an office that sends 100-150 pieces of mail per day, and affixing stamps by hand has grown quite tedious. I saw this little gadget and thought it might be quite helpful and might even save me a bit of time.I couldn't have been more wrong!I think the best verb to describe using this machine is \\"battle!\\"It's a battle to get the stamps loaded. It's a battle to attach each stamp. It's a battle to keep it from jamming, with the backing paper folding over on itself and causing the stamps to stick inside the machine where they cannot be retrieved.After using it for just one roll of stamps, I give up. The Premier EZ Stamp Affixer has won this battle. I will be returning it, and I expect a full refund.

Even if every second or third stamp didn't rip or stick together, it would still be slower then applying stamps by hand. Even loading it is difficult. You can have a few dozen stamps applied by hand in the time it takes to load. The only purpose of this thing is to sell and make money. The 5 star reviews here are completely fake. If you really want to spend money on this, just give someone $20.00 and save yourself the grief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This applicator is slow and difficult to use.

I prefer the unit tethered."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice booster","review":"versatile booster..moderately priced..like that it adjusts so that you can adjust the adult seat back when child falls asleep and the booster moves with it to enable child to sleep without head flopping around.

It has made memorizing the planets, their order, and other fun facts very easy. While it's not \\"perfect,\\" (who can keep up with Pluto's changing status anyway? ;), it offers plenty of valuable information for elementary aged kids like mine.

It always cuts smooth as glass. Problem most people have is with the gaping hole around the blade in their table saws. Use a zero clearance throat plate, backup board with the miter and make sure the blade is at the right height. Another trick I use to get minor chip out is blue painters tape. Holds the fibers in place until the blade passes. This blade cuts almost as nice as my $120 Forrest WW10407125 Woodworker II.

Every time I sit through this movie, I end up feeling like I just woke from a nightmare... not just metaphorically, but like I am lying in bed and just awoke and was having a dream I didn't want to stay in, but didn't want to leave, either.Another fan at my workplace will often come up to me and say \\"What ya know, Henry?\\"...Don't show this to small children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"like a torture for the very first time ...","review":"come on, you 5-star-reviewers, remain on the carpet, as we say in germany ... this is not a masterpiece, but maybe a good joke of david l. watching this film is (to me) like going to the dentist for 2 hours or like having to eat huge portions of snot with vomitus at the restaurant.there seem to be people who enjoy this kind of activities ... please, feel free and do not be offended.when i saw it in the theater, most members of the audience where pale young people wearing dark clothes. i asked one (beautiful) young black dressed lady sitting next to me, how she liked the movie ... she simply answered: 'wonderful ...'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distilled Ugliness: Avoid","review":"I unfortunately saw this film with two younger friends in about 1980 in a small theater in Eugene, Oregon. We hoped to better understand our culture through cinema and to critique the worldview of the film. It was a mistake, although well-meaning.The film is, as another friend of mine at the time said, nothing but \\"distilled ugliness.\\" There is no point to it, except perhaps to inject nihilism into the soul. Many scenes are outright hideous (I would never describe them to anyone) and the overall effect is oppressive, dark, and despairing. Having a a meal afterward with my young colleagues, we sensed this heaviness and had to pray to break the spell.Yes, some will say we missed all the artistic nuance, and so on. No, we were repelled by the repellent. If you want a creative encounter with the possibility of meaninglessness, then consider an early Igmar Bergman film, but not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Erase this from my memory...","review":"I thought I would sit back and enjoy a cult classic,as everyone claims this movie is, one Saturday afternoon. Instead I was punished with this worthless movie. The lead Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) does a wonderful job of playing a nervous misfit.

The movie leans too heavily on the symbolism, which just leads it to be disturbing and awkward. Most of the movie I was so anxious or disturbed by the images or long silences that I had to take a break. I had to look up the meanings behind the complex symbolism before I got what ti was tying to do, and found that it wasn't nearly worth the agony I went through in watching it all the way through.

The story and the symbols continue on and on and never seem to tire of new interpretations. Henry is haunted by his own problems and contemplates the most ultimate of self-destructive behaviour. I think this movie deserves a premier place in cinematic history as the most visually and symbolically rich film of the latter half of the 20th century. It's a masterpiece that I believe is duplicated in Lynch's recent movie Lost Highway. LH is essentially a re-make of Eraserhead but obviously murder, in Lynch's eyes, doesn't quite capture the depression and horror of suicide. Both movies take place within the mind of the main characters. In the end Eraserhead is by far the better movie and the better story because it was ground breaking. You can't rate this movie on the scale provided. It surpasses the scale for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"eraserhead","review":"My favorite movie of all time, but I don't see how that makes me some kind of a far left Socialist as the previous reviewer implies of anyone who thinks that, in fact I'd consider myself right long before left if I had to pin myself to either.

When returning the second one the very nice service rep assured me they would pull this from the site and get to the bottom of the confusion. As far as I could see, this never happened. They also issued me a $15. Credit for future purchases. My biggest beef is that when I received the e-mail notifications for my credits on both items, the reason for the credit was stated as \\"delivered late\\".

What can one say about a nightmarish film noir which vividly portrays one's most nauseating, nerve fraying fears in relentless stabbing strokes of black and white? This is what the truly \\"lost\\" would find amusing and stimulating....\\"lost\\" meaning all those wretched souls who will one day descend, permanently, into a reality much like this one.

If you feel disoriented in our industrial society and feel detached from any of the truths deriving from nature and her processes, this is the movie for you. This movie is like spinning wildly in the middle of 125th street in NYC--you feel lost, sick, out of balance and there is nothing real, nothing natural around you, so that you cannot but wonder if your own thoughts are real or natural. This film goes well with Coppola's Koyanisqaatsi. Oh, one last thing: Believe it or not, the most bizarre scenes are those that Lynch edited out, including one where Henry opens a drawer in his bureau and finds only a mound of mashed potatoes with peas in it. who hasn't that happened to?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some folks are better off becoming painters","review":"David Lynch is odd. Odd and he's very talented. Eraserhead is a jumbled mess of mixed visual metaphors and adolescent tripe. Poor Jack Nance. Jack could be the sweetest guy in the world. He was (briefly) my apartment manager during the making of Lynch's Dune. He appears as lost in Lynch's film as Lynch clearly is himself.Is it art? Sure. Is it good art? It teeters on the fine line between dorky and cool. I can't say I recommend Eraserhead. There are moments that recall the absurdity of Dali (when he was still an important painter). Visually stunning but ultimately as vapid and empty as any amateur art project.For those folks that are interested (Lyncheads all I'd guess), Eraserhead is available at David's website. It's somewhat expensive but the print looks great although the narrative is as murky as ever. Lynch is a very talented director when working with the right screenplay. This just doesn't happen to be the right one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number 249","review":"This is the 249th review of Eraserhead. The word \\"surreal\\" is used often and inappropriately.

It's amazing how Lynch can conjure emotion from almost nothing. He always goes for the jugular in Eraserhead, going exactly where you don't want him to.How to describe the movie? It's a nightmare.

All through the movie you pretty much get,a guy sitting in a room with a baby screaming at the top of it's weird little lungs.This movie will totally creep-out most people,and those that it doesn't,might want to ask themselves,if they're one egg short of a dozen,and they are cracking-up.

The viewer will be horrified by the deformed baby getting sick or the lady in the radiator squishing things with her feet, but there's nothing else this movie offers.The ERASERHEAD DVD also has David Lynch talking about the making of the movie so Lynch fans will definitely get a treat, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"I don't see why other people think this movie is good.

If Kubrick liked it, it only makes it more clear why Kubrick himself can go off into some strange unexplained tangent in some of the films he does.I enjoy watching obscure films, but this one showed no sense of direction. I can't see how anyone would want to watch this one twice, or more.There is such a non sense of direction with this film that they didn't even bother to break it down to separate chapters.

Unfortunatelly this recordings are not really the earliest (\\"Mister and Missisipi\\" from 1952. well that is something to hear!) but anyway young Cleo was charmingly full of enthusiasm and decidedly kept her british accent all the way.Songs are very well-known and very wisely chosen as the matter of the fact (maybe not commercial-wise, but they definitely stand the test of time) and particulary in the last song \\"Sugar\\"- sung by Cleo's idol Peggy Lee in original - young Cleo sing like a dream.Very beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CHILLINGLY COOL EARLY CLEO","review":"I'm thrilled to see this collection on CD; I've owned it on vinyl since the mid-70s. I bought it as a cut-out at a discount record shop on lower 5th Avenue in Manhattan. I was already a Cleo fan; this superb record gave me a new insight into the lady. She's incredibly young here, but exhibits an uncanny intuitive style, making each song her own forever. She's backed by Johnny Dankworth, and I don't know if they were even an item at this point in their lives, but what chemistry between two consummate musicians! I love the evocative mid-cenury feel of the arrangements. Each of these songs is a three act play in her hands, and the voice is like crushed velvet.

On this one, a Canadian woman got some of her friends together and recorded the songs from her favorite movie. Surprisingly, it's actually quite good. All the singer can carry a tune, and they are backed up by professional musicians. The CD includes all the songs from the film (including some that were left off of the soundtrack album), plus some bits of dialogue from the movie.

But avoid this mess at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry all involved this could have been made by K-Tel","review":"Back in the 70's a great movie was made by Robert Altman and a fantastic cast of actors. The songs for the most part were written by the performers themselves much in the country music tradition. Creating and playing character in this movie meant more than memorizing lines (there are tons of ad lib lines in the movie) but inventing a performer and his or her music catalogue as well. Now for this well meaning tribute album. These artist are certainly talented in their own right but why, why, why did they feel mimicking the original soundtrack artists would some how make this a CD worth buying? It must have been a blast to record this CD unfortunately it's a not so fun to listen to. Imagine a 21st century interpretation of this unusual Hollywood does country musical score. Even if this approach failed it would have earned some respect for the attempt instead of loving yet misguided tribute."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great thriller!","review":"This was my first book by this author and I couldn't wait to get to the rest of his novels.

If \\"Brady\\" was so obsessed with revenge, he did a poor job of showing it; it's hardly considered revenge when you put your enemy into an expensive luxury home while paying for his children's private school tuition.

It is poorly written and the shifting point of view(sometimes within a single paragraph) is extremely annoying. The author's habit of having the narrator inject his own commentary is also incredibly irritating. I am a Creative Writing major in California and I have read better stories from beginning writers. The only saving grace for this book is the fact that if there are editors out there willing to publish this drivel, I can look forward to being published as well, easily.

Dilla to \\"My City\\" by Oh No to Saukrates \\"Nice 2 Meet U\\" was not bad. It was more than decent, but Frank-N-Dank's unspectacular lyrics and content did not help out. I don't think there was one track on this album that was decent. I was disappointed in Kardinal's contribution who is a well-respected rapper. It was mostly trash and my favorable bias towards underground artists could not make me show leniency to this album.Don't buy it. Don't even download it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, I like these!","review":"I used the 3-blade cartridges from Gilette but didn't like them because they gave me more irritation. I have a sensitive skin. I think the actual blades are made from the same sharp metal just 2 here Vs more in the newer cartridges (though I'm not 100% sure). I prefer these because they give somewhat less irritation.Most of the time if I have to pass a certain area of my face more than once it's because the shaver wasn't aligned properly to the face and not because the blades aren't sharp enough or there're not enough of them. Number of times I passed a certain area of my face didn't seem to matter if I used the 2 or 3-blade cartridge. So if I pass the same area twice that makes it total 4 times on 2-blade cartridge, rather than 6 times if I used a 3-blade cartridge. I suppose that's why I get less irritation with these. But everyone's got a unique face so your results may vary :)Oh by the way, for shaving gel try: \\"Aveeno Therapeutic Shaving Gel\\" it's the BEST I've found so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful compilation of ancient views of biblical stories","review":"Lots of short excerpts from ancient texts show how biblical stories were interpreted and expanded by ancients.

It's a great alternative to carrying a bunch of lenses when traveling. The trade off for the versatility is the mecahanics at times.

His storytelling skills, interesting characters, and interesting subject matter all prove to make one excellent book. Very rarely does a book give me chills or goosebumps, but this one certainly did (Especially the surprise ending!).

Anyway, this is a must for all spy-novel lovers and gives a very fascinating, and maybe even realistic, insight in the Gulf war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Class !!","review":"Frederick Forsyth's research has always been awe-inspiring, but this novel exceeds all expectations.Peopled with vivid characters, brilliantly displaying Forsyth's incomparable, knowledge of intelligence operations and tradecraft, moving back and forth between Washington and London, Baghdad and Kuwait, desert vastnesses and city bazaars, this breathtaking novel is an utterly convincing story of what mayactually have happened behind the headlines."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mesmerizing book","review":"A true classical espionage story.The Allied forces launch a desperate search for Saddam's secret weapon.

I was immediately engrossed! Unfortunately, my husband didn't have a book along for the trip. On the second day he picked up FOG and started reading it while I was making dinner. For the next week we both shared the book for 1-hour at a time inbetween doing our sailing chores. The plot was so tight, the characters so real and well written that frequently we were fighting over whose turn it was to read THE BOOK. We finished the book after a week of staying up until midnight. Since that trip we bought another Fist of God (hardback)book as well so we never have to share reading it again. This is a book that belongs in the library of every lover of current world events, thrilling writing with a heart stopping plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forsyth Does It Again!","review":"In his novel 'The Fist of God,' Forsyth tells the story of the gulf war with the (fictional?) threat of Iraqi nuclear capability. The story is multi-leveled and centers around British and American attempts to sabotage the production of an Iraqi atomic bomb. The characters range from a British commando behind the lines in Kuwait, to a Mossad agent romancing a European banker, to the butcher of bagdad himself, Saddam Hussein. Along the way, the reader is treated to Forsyth's unique style that keeps the pace moving from page one. Like the novels of Tom Clancy, this one makes you wonder just how much the author knows about the inner-workings of Washington, London, and other centers of power throughout the world. How much of this novel is true? I don't know. But I do know that for anyone who loves great action and well thought out thrillers this is a novel that is sure to please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"The characters are dimensionless and symbol-like.

For an adult, this is a fine product. The neck of the bike is very difficult to put together, and adusting the brakes is a daily thing. As far as for children I would not buy or recommend this product to anyone under 15.

Pepper after he'd been busted down to private), to his late-sixties slide into psuedo-hippy mysticism.Every thing he did showed his, uh, \\"creative\\" process, which went something like this: listen to the latest thing, attach yourself leech-like to the trend, and exploit it with passable approximations of the \\"new sound\\", which is the reason that all of his output sounds extremely dated now."},{"rating":"1","title":"No baloobalot here","review":"I was disappointed that the \\"Open Your Eyes (Baloobalot Hot House Piano Dub)\\" by Rhythm Scholar was not on this CD.

This CD features the original, folkier versions of those songs and it totally DESTROYS the flow and overall mood of the album. I do appreciate having the original, folkier versions of \\"Catch the Wind\\" and \\"Colours\\" but I would have MUCH preferred to keep the flow of the original album.

Also, shockingly, the version of Colours is the solo, Dylanesque 2:44 version, whereas the earlier CD had a 4:10 version with backup vocals on the refrain (\\"that's the time...\\") which everyone learned at camp as a call-and-response.

The reason I gave 4 stars was because of Davis's constant blaming campaign toward Longstreet whenever things went wrong for the Army of Northern Virginia(mainly at Gettysburg). Somehow its seems like a common theme observed with some of Lee's biographers. This book is a must read those interested in the history of Civil War as well military history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gray Fox: Immersion into the mind of an American hero.","review":"Davis does for Robert E. Lee what few biographers can do--provide the reader a present-tense sense of General Lee's emotions. In the Gray Fox, Davis shows Lee's stoic character, gently melded with a loving heart. Perhaps most important to the fledgling Confederacy, Davis demonstrates how Lee, like no other, could remain supremely cool and calm while under intense pressure as well as during those \\"moment of truth\\" decisions upon which the future of the Rebel nation depended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not User Friendly","review":"I am a finance profesional and found this product difficult to use, there is a lot of double entry and many simple task that are done the hard way, like entering deposits which unlike quicken is not done in the registar but in a deposit window, and then it is way to easy to get a deposit entered twice which in my short ownership has already occured at least five times. There are some excellent principals at work throughout the program and the ability to prepare invoices, and statments is essential for a business owner however their could be even greater ability to custimize reports. All in all I have been very unimpressed with this otherwise highly rated product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Books Pro 2005 Review- Tony","review":"Excellent tool for small business. Takes a while to get the correct use of it, particularly what accounts to use if you do not have an accounting background. The quick tours are vey helpful. The number of transactions that have to be carried out are a little tedious, but so it's keeping accounting books."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks great but not user friendly","review":"This is very difficult to use if you are not selling wiggetts but a service. Hard to see the big picture or delete invoices. A problem at every turn. I am disappointed as I thought this was going to be great. I ended up getting an accountant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhh these guys do not even try","review":"I have been using QB for 7 years and every year or so they force you to upgrade (buy a new copy) becuase they stop supporting online banking.I have recently purchased Microsoft Small Business 2006 which I am going to migrate my cursed QB files to it and I will finaly have some decent software.Problems with QBIt will not install sometimes - depending on the Windows installation it the install will crash.The Updates will crash periodically.It does not allow you to export reports to excel unless you have a Pro edition (Thanks)Also the interface online integration is circa 1990'sI have recently upgraded to MS Money 2006 which rocks!!!GOOD RIDDENCE QUICK BOOKS !!!!!1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickbooks Pro 2005","review":"My accountant said I should use quickbooks for my business. It turned out to be a very bad choice because the software does the manual tasks of paying bills etc. but gives you little useful information. I have a service business in a very competitive market and I could not get critical information that I needed to run my business.I had to go to the accountant and his staff to get the business information required to stay competitive. In the final analysis, I quess this is why the accountant recommended the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Package for the Money","review":"Quick Books Pro is a good value for its cost. It is far superior to Quick Books especially its cost accounting ability. Unfortunately many users don't take full advantage of its features. Not only does the cost accounting provide valuable information, in service oriented business the use of the time card and allocation of employees' time to various jobs gives a truer cost of a project than estimates. I really recommend this package if you are a small business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot use on Windows 7","review":"I have no idea how this program works, because it will not load on Windows 7. Further research shows it may work on Windows 7 Pro, but that is not what I have. My previous version of Quickbook was great, and exactly what I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"QuickBooks 2003 and 2004 have more going for them","review":"I've been a QuickBooks fan since starting up my company and realizing how much of a tremendous help QuickBooks was. I started out with QuickBooks 2003 and just a little while ago, I thought it was the time to upgrade to the latest and greatest. Well, I have to warn you that the latest, isn't the greatest. I still like QuickBooks 2003 much better, and in fact I sold my copy of 2005 on eBay and am continuing to use 2003. A lot of really handy features were removed from 2005, and many of them were the best features, like the E-Filing and E-Pay. I think I'm just going to stick with my current version of QuickBooks until Intuit gets on the ball again and puts these features back when they release 2006."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better software out there.","review":"I agree with the above users, there are better software out there. Please look around and be more futuristic. QuickBooks is for very small companies only. It slows down when the size of your database goes up. I tested some software and found some really good, with reasonable price: BusinessWorks, Small Business Manager (microsoft.com), Quick Business Manager (bisaim.com),Vision Point 2000 (ACCPAC), BusinessVision 32 (Softline).Good Luck in your search."},{"rating":"1","title":"quickbook pro","review":"extremely poor technical support. I had to contact sales to get the answer because, Alex,Andrew,Adam all living in India could not answer the question and appeared not to really understand the question.I asked them why they use american names they said the company thought we the buyer might be more receptive if they use good old USA names. The program it self is fine I have been using it since 2002 but when a problem arises there is no support to count on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has the basics, but much could be improved","review":"I have been using QB Pro 2004 for over a year now. My main complaint is that online banking has been broken since installing (It's a credit card and a checking account...fairly simple, but can't get both to work at the same time. My QB-certified accountant can't get it to work either...if you want boring details, email me!)You've already read about how bad the phone support is...my experience was no different, and they want to charge you for everything.Hey Intuit, why not make sure the software that your customers purchase WORKS at least ONCE before charging for support?I can't believe after all these years that some other software giant can't crush these guys with something basic and workable. After reading reviews of all the accounting packages, it still appears that QB is the \\"least worst\\". ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"QuickBooks Deception","review":"When you look at the sales site for Quick Book Pro you will see the promise of a \\"rebate\\". Unfortunately, they fail to mention (at least where it is obvious) that you must be a former owner of the product to get the promised rebate. I would have waited for it to go on sale somewhere if I had suspected deception. I did not find out that I was excluded from the rebate until I tried to file online for it. When I called QuickBooks to complain, there only offer was for me to return it for a refund. I told them I felt they had been deceptive and did not respect them as a company. I also ask why their new customers were discreminated against by being excluded in such a fashion. I did not get an answer. So beware of promised rebates, there may be hidden qualifications to meet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fewer features and awful support.","review":"I'm still trying to understand why Intuit is trying to sell a new version of QB with key featurs of prior versions removed. The removal of E-File and E-Pay is the final straw and for that I've rid myself of QB and switched to Small Business Manager (Microsoft). And let's face it folks, software you buy today is for both the functionality it provides and the support which backs it up. You wouldn't buy a new car if there was no way of having it serviced and you don't want to do the same with a critical piece of software used to operate your business. So when my requests for help fall on the ears of some guy in India who takes over 45 minutes to try and resolve my problem by putting me on hold and never even offers a work-around, let alone a solution, I have to wonder why I'm even bothering with fighting this losing battle. For me it was easier to simply move on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I may never know if the product is usable......","review":"...I just installed quickbooks 2005, and have attempted to transfer my Quicken 2003 to Quickbooks 2005.

High priced Customer support plans promise 10 minute max wait time. The wait time is never under 2 hours. The support personnel are off shore and ill equipped to deal with many questions.

About 10 years ago, I bought Quicken for a business I started then. A year later they offered me an upgrade...for MORE than I paid for the original version. Their customer service person gave me a lecture in the software business, and since then I swore I'd never buy another Intuit product.I was give a trial copy by my new accountant, and it seems to work well, but I need payroll. So, I logged on and was going to buy QuickBooks Pro 2005 here at Amazon...UNTIL I read the reviews of the HORRIBLE customer support, obviously outsourced to India.No thanks Intuit. I'd rather use a paper ledger than buy your product.Get some customer service and I'll consider you."},{"rating":"2","title":"2005 QuickBooks","review":"I have been using QuickBooks since 2003 and have always enjoyed this financial software. I use Quicken for my personal finances, but QuickBooks is far superior. The 2005 version is very similiar to pervious versions, but they have made it extremely user-friendly. I have a member of my staff who is not very computer savvy, but she has done very well with this QuickBooks program. The only complaint I have has been with the installation onto my new laptop computer. It was extremely difficult! I called the customer service line to get help and the man that helped me was quick in diagnosing the problem. He walked me through the entire installation process and was very friendly. That is why, even with the installation problems, I still give the 2005 version of QuickBooks 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better!","review":"I know there are a lot of reviews slamming this product, but they are mostly unfounded. I have been using each new release of QuickBooks Pro since 2002. I have to say that every new version improves upon the previous one in many ways. For example, this version makes it MUCH easier for me to reconcile my merchant account transactions with my bank statement. It can even organize your transactions in batches and allows you to download any merchant account fees associated with those batches. This alone was a great reason for me to upgrade and was well worth the money spent. I even got a nice $100 rebate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upgrading from 2004","review":"When I tried to upgrade from 2004 to 2005 I ran into a problem because I didn't have Flash 7.0 installed. Actually I had a later version of Flash (9.04) but of course Quickbooks couldn't handle that. Here's the fix: go to the Adobe site and download the uninstall program from them. Uninstall your flash player and then Quickbooks will then proceed. Good luck.

Unfortunately, this will be my last purchase of an Intuit product after having been a loyal customer for 12 years. Why? Because I'm being forced to upgrade by Intuit or lose my ability to run the payroll feature (which I already have to pay a $200/year subscription fee to use). I have enjoyed using both Quickbooks and Quicken, but forcing me to upgrade at gunpoint is not something that sits well with me. Sorry Intuit, but time for us to go our separate ways. BTW: thanks Amazon for offering the upgrade $50 cheaper than direct for Intuit...one more nail in the coffin for Intuit and one more reason to remain a very happy Amazon stockholder."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLINE BANKING BUG !!","review":"The data received from my Financial Institution had savings data combined with checking data.I only wanted checking data, but the program will not let me delete savings data from the file, or reassign it to my savings register.Tech support disconnected me twice, spent over two hours on the phone and this issue was not resolved.Intuit customer support is very poor & verrry slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! E-File and E-Pay Removed","review":"After I installed and converted my file to the 2005 format I was informed that the E-File and E-Pay features were removed in version 2005.

Well, after trying to use it for two years now, I'm ready to burn it. It's a great software for people who do their business by the projects, but it's not good for retail sales.

Then a different representative said this was incorrect and to send the copy back without opening it. I did this and they refunded the shipping. That's it. No one ever told me that Intuit does not refund extra license fees, they just kept taking my information and promising a refund.

After doing so (easily), I used the product for one week when it stopped responding. It turns out that my data files had been corrupted. The 2005 format is not compatible with previous versions, so I had to recreate a week's worth of checks, payments, payroll, and desposits - a task that took the better part of a day. I pity a larger business that could easily spend much more time than I.After waiting on hold for 2 HOURS, I was instructed to e-mail some files to QB so that they could fix the errors and mail them back to me in a usuable format.. guess what - it's been 2 months and no one has responded to that, or several subsequent, e-mails...
