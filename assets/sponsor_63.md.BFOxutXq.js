The first one of these I purchased was no good out of the box. DigiAcc was nice enough about replacing it. The replacement battery was good for a couple of months, but now it won't hold a charge either. The first one was made in China which may indicate that it is not an authentic Canon product. The replacement is made in Japan, but as I say, it is no good either. I thought perhaps I had a bum charger, but that has been cleared too. I'm not going to bother getting another replacement, because I'm sure that too will be junk. I ordered another battery from a reputable camera shop, and so far it seems to be doing the job. If I have to buy too many of these things, I might as well upgrade from the Canon Rebel XT to something new and improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with short life!","review":"I spent the extra money for the Canon name brand because I wanted a long-lasting battery pack. Well, I've had this one less than 6 months and it only holds a third of the charge that my \\"generic\\" one holds! I was surprised, I thought for sure the short-life battery was the old generic (which I've had for almost 2 years) but no, it's the Canon-branded one!

I have used it several times since I got it, and so far, everything is working great with it. It has \\"held\\" the charges very well and the \\"fit\\" is perfect with the camcorder.

It has all the qualites of a good chopper but it cannot chop. That is, tomatoes, cilantro, green onions.The simple reason is the sharpless of the blades for out-of-the-box product. My estimation is no sharper than the average butter knife. So the blade simply bounces off cilantro and the other vegetables. More precisely, the blade impacts the vegies in a way similar to a mallot. What is left is a glob of mashed vegetables and nothing chopped.Somewhat 'fortunately' for me, I bought two thinking that I would cycle them through the dishwasher. So at least I can return one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless or defective","review":"When the Zyliss arrived, I removed it from the shipping box.

It is one of my favorites and I actually prefer it over Goldberg's other, \\"Playing Out Of Your Mind\\". If you are an athlete specifically looking to improve the mental side of the game and aren't a big reader, then POOYM is the digest version of what you'll find in \\"Sports Slump Busting\\" (although I still think SSB is the better written version), but if you want a complete understanding of the whys and the wherefores, SSB is the book to purchase.I consider this book a good read for an athlete trying to understand their performance issues, for a coach that wants to help their players perform better and for parents who might want a better understanding of their athlete's problems. All three can contribute both positively and negatively to athletic performance and the book will explain how to avoid the negative in favor of the positive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"There is a reason this book is rated so low compared to others...

Instead of helping men see an understand the way a man should operate in daily life, the author spends time basing men for dressing the same way as \\"eminem\\" or using eminem as a attack on the entire male population as if to say that all men follow eminem or think the same way. The author also spends time on gays,Some ideas on love were good, like the fact that sex today is just an hobby rather than an expression of love.....but the author doesn't focus on the code at all. He has some issues with todays culture, that don't address the issue of what it means to be a man at all. A rant, and anger, and a lot of combination of issues to make a point.

I really need to get the books to compare them with the videos, but I think each video version brings their own strengths and interpretations to the complex and troubled Detective Wallander. I started watching the BBC version from the Masterpiece Mystery replays, then found the others from Amazon on Demand. I get the BBC version from my Prime membership, but did purchase One Step Behind (Lassagard) and Before the Frost (Henriksson).

In the last episode Voyager emerged very near earth and there is no way it would have taken it a week to reach it. After that part the book kept going down hill.

Eventually, Golden's approach to telling Homecoming (racing from scene to scene without developing \\"a need to know\\") became predictable and unsatisfying. Above all else, Golden never anchored her novel to what matters most of all: the main characters. In other words, Janeway, Chakotay, Harry, Doc, Torres, Tom, Seven, and Tuvok hardly come alive.

She rushed in a chance to clean up loose threads in all the characters I feel are attempts to try to satisfy all the needs of the fans because the show ended so abruptly.

Christie Golden is by far one of the best Star Trek writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time","review":"The series finale left too many questions, this book starts to answer many of them. For all the JCers out there, the best news is that the mismatched romance between Chakotay and Seven of Nine came to an end early in the book. For those who thought the end of the Borg was too easy, you will love the plot twist.Some questions about the fate's of our favorites have started to be answered, but the second book is a necessary read to find all the answers.

A good start to the series follow-up books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threadbare","review":"I'm only 100 pages into \\"Homecoming\\" and I've come to the sad conclusion that it's a children's book. If this is Pocket Books' relaunch for \\"Voyager,\\" it's stalled on the pad.Christie Golden's text is insipid. She never delves too intimately into the characters' thoughts, feelings and actions. Descriptions of the various mileau are bare-bones. It's a carcass with nothing edible.Several storylines are wrapped up surprisingly quickly, and it's too bad. Many fans were disappointed with how the TV episode of \\"Endgame\\" concluded. They wanted to know \\"what happened next\\" to their favorite characters. Unfortunately, even 100 pages into \\"Homecoming,\\" it's less than satisfying. I was surprised by how \\"quick and dirty\\" everything was. It was like a \\"Voyager\\" episode trying to sneak past a previously established plot point just to tell another story.Well, on second thought, maybe this \\"relaunch\\" is right on track after all ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A large serving of cheese, anyone?","review":"I think Ms. Golden just wanted everyone to know that she's seen every Voyager episode.

The story has a lot of potential but it fizzled. I was more than a little disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential. Expected a lot better from a veteran ST author.","review":"The book started off great. I was immediately satisfied that the author was wise enough to kill off the Seven-Chakotay relationship.

Janeway gets her ship and crew home at last, only to have members of her crew abducted for political reasons. There are sneaky Starfleet agents, the inevitable Borg-threat retread, the equally inevitable holographic plot retread, and worst of all (and the main reason I knocked a point from this review) the ultra-bloated inevitable TWO-BOOK PLOT retread.Don't read this book if, like me, you think Barbie of Borg is a mistake; unfortunately, she figures VERY heavily in this book. One only hopes that Christie Golden will have permission and good sense enough to allow Seven of Nine to die."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Homecoming!","review":"They waited 7 long years to get home and then look what was waiting for them----THE BORG. They were in the midst of taking over Earth. Haven't we had just about enough of THE BORG during the years with Star Trek. I know I have. I thought being in a different quadrant they would have encountered many DIFFERENT species, but not so much. Then they get to Earth and we meet up with the BORG again. So BORING. It took them 2 books to tell this tale, but they could have done it with ONE and just gave updates on what the crew was doing now off of Voyager. Very disappointing all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Extreme Disappointment","review":"I love Christie Golden's writing (esp. her \\"Seven Of Nine\\" novel and her novels for the \\"Buffy The Vampire\\" series) but, sadly, because she is an obvious Janeway/Chakotay fan, it bleeds into her writing, and she ignores established Voyager canon. Ms. Golden should have re-watched \\"Endgame\\" (as well as \\"Human Error\\") before writing this book, which is no more a satisfactory ending to Voyager than \\"Endgame\\" was...even less. Thankfully, especially in this case, Trek novels aren't considered canon to the show. It's obvious Ms. Golden has merely entertained her own fantasies, which belong better in fan fiction than a published novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened to Dave & Tracy's story?","review":"This book held my interest, although the line of work Kim and Tracy were in made me cringe when, thinking realistically, there were any number of ways these women could have been sued!That said, the characters were interesting enough, but I was disappointed when Dave and Tracy's relationship just dropped off the pages. Other than Tracy's random appearances, she and Dave were nowhere to be found. I guess I expected the overall story to be \\"theirs\\". They resurfaced near the end of the story and then only briefly, mostly in the past tense.

The knight came unassembled with its parts attached to a plastic frame, and I wasn't able to get all of the sharp edges sanded down with the included file.The way it folds into an egg is pretty cool, and my son adores it, but I think I'll be sticking to LEGO toys in the future. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden gem","review":"Ronald Shannon Jackson hails from Texas, and he went to his home state to record this 1988 disc.

It's pretty good (\\"Evoking\\" and \\"Psychic Greeting\\" aren't as good as the others) but the CD is hampered by the sound. It was recorded in such a way that the guitars and alto saxes blend together into a mush. Considering the instruments have similar tones and are doubled, a more distinctive recording would have helped immeasurably. Not only is it a rare CD, but the musical gems are buried in the recording.

I asked him about a course he was teaching, and if this book would be used, and also if the course would offer any CEU credits and this was response I received:\\"No.\\"I thought, wow how incredibly polite, and how it must have taken years of training in compassion to take time out of a busy career to spend such time drafting such a kind response to someone who was an interested, and possible consumer.I had to agree also when I read the review, couldn't agree more about the book. This didn't cover enough, explain understandably, and should for this money have added a workbook.

On top of all this, the albums seems to have a true theme and the motif is masterful right down to the scrambled song titles on the Record Jacket.

The wu are the most talented group of rappers ever to touch the mic! It's just amazing how GZA delivers his clever, witty punchlines.

RZA was at the top of his game when he produced this album and guest stars like Killah Priest and Inspector Deck shine. Most of the songs can be listened too and five are particular standouts. Shadowboxing and Seventh Chamber are the Wu at their best and are two of my favorite songs of all time. Labels is a great song too with a good chorus.

This is the best Wu-Tang solo album, bar none. It has the darkest overtones, RZA's production is deeper than it had ever previously been (and never will be again, as far as I'm concerned), and GZA's lyrics just knocked me out of my chair. It was chock full of metaphors galore, technicolor ghetto tales, and anyone who says \\"Labels\\" was less than brilliant needs a speedknot upside the head.

This book is a wonderfully put together novel, and I can't wait to order the next book in this series from my library.Overall, it's not a book I love enough to buy, but it was definitely worth reading.

Aliane's character seems way too unrealistic for my taste; I like to be able to relate somewhat to the characters, personally. plus it feels sort of rushed, and at the same time very slow paced. Nothing much exciting happens during most of the book; it's just about how perfectly Aliane came figure things out to protect the Balitang family. AND nothing ever seems to phase Aly; not even when she's taken and sold as a slave. She's just all \\"Oh it's no big deal, I'll just get away once I'm sold 'cause im so smart.\\" Seriously, that's how she acts most of the time.

In order to win this wager, she would need to stay in slavery to the Balitangs for the remainder of the summer.This proved to be a much harder task than she expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good!","review":"Ok,I've been reading Tamora Pierce's books for a long time and they're all great!(I own all of her Tortall books and read all of her circle books~~~also i've read all the tortall bokos at least 10 times each!)It was a bit confusing in this one because she went a bit further into the politics and cultures.Personally I do like the other books more but this one was still great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trickster's Choice","review":"Trickster's Choice is really a book for all audiences. A mixture of fantasy, adventure, intrigue, and a hint of romance... what more could you want? An interesting and compelling read, Tamora definitely doesn't let us down. You don't have to read any of the lioness series to enjoy this book. Although there are references to the main character, Alianne's, mother, Alanna's, past, it won't confuse or overwhelm you.Tamora Pierce weaves an intricate plot that leaves you begging for more. I would recommend this book for ages 11 and up. If you enjoyed this book, I would recommend reading the sequel, Trickster's Queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of my favorite Tamora Pierce books!","review":"Aly, trying to get away from her famous mother for a few days, goes sailing, intending to visit friends. She sails into a piratefleet, and she is sold as a slave to Balitang House in the CopperIsles.When the Balitangs are sent into exile,she goes with them. She makes a wager with a trickster god that she can protect the two half-raka daughters of the house,and it isn't until laterthat she learns they both fit the description of a coming queenin an ancient prophecy.Aly is assisted in her protection of the girls by the crows, and one (Nawat) becomes human to help her. The elder daughter, Sarai, is courted by the Rittevon prince'sbrother, Bronau.When Aly, trained as a spy, meets Bronau, shesenses trouble...and it comes.Extremely good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good. Really.","review":"This book is really good. It's plot twists are unexpected, yet always for the better. It's a story about proving you can do what you want. it has a strong woman protagonist who is very witty and fun to follow. At first, i didn't know it was a series, so i was very dissappointed with the ending, not understanding a thing. But now i realize it was a series and i'm mad because i can't find out what happens till the next book comes out and who knows when that'll be?But, it was really good, sometimes a bit slow, but weather on, because it really is amazing. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"In my opinion this was a bad piece of writing on Tamora Pierces part. In the past she has captured us with extrodinary tales that have taken writing to a whole new level, however I feel that in this book she has taken away everything that once made her books so wonderful. The plot was slow and boring, there was nothing that the character did that really captured my attention, although I like the idea of someone following George's footsteps,I thought this book could have played out much nicer. It lacked the suspense and emotion that is normally shared with one of her books. I hope that her next writing gives us a little more magic and fun than what was shown in Tricksters Choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't take it anymore","review":"This book was definitely not my thing. I could not take it anymore. It was wordy, actionless, and very difficult to read. I expected a fabulous read, but it took me 4 weeks to get me to page 150, whereas it usually takes me two-four days. I had to return it to the library. I am so glad I did, because I read the next book I got in a week! Trickster's Choice is not as wonderful as it seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writtin With a Twist: A Bad One","review":"When I was younger, I loved Tamora Pierce. I devoured every book she wrote with an innocent intensity only characteristic of children anymore, but now that I have matured more, I read this book, expecting it to be fabulous like the others. I was wrong. Not only was I wrong that this one was not fabulous, but I was also wrong about all the others being fabulous. Tamora Pierce is excellent with plot, but her writing falls a little short of the mark. While I was young, I had no judging eye for well-written books and what young children really like is just something that keeps me captivated. The problem is, now when I read the books, every sentence falls flat with a groan of agony. This book is not good. Now if all of you just think I am an annoying adult, it's not true. I'm talking about realizing this now, and I am thirteen years old. If a thirteen year old can recognize bad writing, shouldn't you be able to?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Yet Completed This Book.","review":"I am so bored by this book; it is just so hard for me to pick it up. I have read other books by Tamora Pierce, ok only the Alanna series, but I thought that series was really amazing. When I saw this one and found out that it was Alanna's daughter I was so excited. I started reading to a pretty good conflict. Then I am completely bored by the constant dragging on about the story. I keep hoping something exciting is going to happen but it doesn't seem to ever happen. I guess it's your choice if you want to get this book or not. Looking at the other reviews I see a lot of them really liked the book. In my opinion it was one of the worst I have ever read so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Entry","review":"I found this a very disappointing entry in the Tortall series. The early intervention of the gods robs the book of any tension because we already know how it's generally going to come out. Aly herself is a rather flat character; she just walks through the book without much of anything to challenge or endanger her. I also found it very hard to believe that George would teach her spying skills when she was a child--certainly not without Alanna saying something about it. The ending just seemed to ... stop, without any real resolution. If I get the sequel, I'll wait until it comes out in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't WasteYour Time Or Money","review":"Because I was under the impression Tamora Pierce was a good writer, I was disappointed with this book. I'd never read any of her other books, and have no plans on doing so after reading Trickster's Choice. The story is dull. The character's are dull; they're not even original. There's too much narrative (telling) and not enough showing. Slow paced...a lot of what she wrote just seemed to fill up space. The author seems to think it's more important to describe every character's eyebrows (perfectly shaped eyebrows, etc.), than on making an interesting story. Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good, but not the best of Tamora Pierce","review":"First off I would like to say that was a very good book that I enjoyed reading, but it definately did not measure up to Song of the Lioness or the Immortals. the main reason I think is because it lacked action until the very end of the book.

I cannot wait to read the next one. I just ordered it online so it should come soon. *hope*Tamora mixes her great skill at story telling with the adventures of a girl that could be any one of us. She has the same problems as any teenager rather than becoming one of the more \\"super-heroy\\" types of some of the earlier Tortall books. I love it when I can read a book that takes me several days and not grow bored with any aspect. I have already re-read this book twice and am beginning my third read.This is what fantasy should be.

We did get a few \\"buds\\" to grow after a long, long time - like nine months of waiting. After the buds appeared, the growing stopped. It was difficult to see the buds with the dome, so the dome had to be removed to see the buds.

We, gay men, are just as confused and in mental turmoil today as we were when John Rechy wrote this novel. The impact this story makes is a must.

Part of this stems from the contrived 'future-tense' narrative style, but that's just the best example of the overall 'contrivedness' of this story. Cyberpunk doesn't have to be about futuristic technology at all (see William Gibson's \\"The Gernsback Continuum\\" and Greg Bear's \\"Petra\\") so long as it carries the cyberpunk sensibility. \\"Hardwired\\" doesn't do that.

The only one good song on here I would have loved to use as background for a family slideshow. If they like the song they might have bought the CD, however, it was such a pain in the a** to try and use his music due to the encoding that I took the CD and gave it to my dog for a chew toy. He didn't like it at all, however, I am sure Peter Cetera should be used to that at this point in his career and should be grateful that anyone would be interested in copying his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST HAVE!! It's a MASTERPIECE!","review":"I love Christmas music & this is such a treat! I cannot say enough wonderful things about this CD. Peter Cetera & Tony Harrell have come up with a pretty phenomenal piece of work!!!! The arrangements are really fantastic & exciting! The original songs are classic. I look for a couple of those to become a year after year tradition. Every song really paints a picture! You can certainly tell that a lot of hard work must have gone into this.

I enjoy the black and white Popeye and there wasn't too many of them on this disc. I never did care for the color Popeye, and this is mostly what is on this DVD. I gave my copy away to the Library and bought the black and white Popeye that is from 1933-40. Must better DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cartoons not given the treatment they deserve","review":"This DVD features 9 classic Popeye cartoons, but the prints and sound on all five are of terrible quality. It looks like they took some old prints designed to be broadcasted on television in the early 1960s and did nothing to remaster them. \\"Popeye Meets Sindbad the Sailer,\\" the 1936 classic known primarily for its use of color, is inexplicably in black and white! The picture on many of the cartoons looks strangely off center too; some of the left of the frame is cut off leaving a black empty space on the right side of the frame. Not recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit, smooth & quiet brakes","review":"My girlfriend's Del Sol was shaking violently when the brakes were applied, and since I could feel the pulsation in the pedal I knew that the rotors were warped.Used Brembo rotors for both the front and rear with Raybestos Advanced Technology brake pads.Although I still need to overhaul the calipers, the rotor and pad replacement alone made for exceptionally smooth braking and an unbeleivable difference in stopping power."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUNZ OF MAN BURNS COMPETITION TO DEATH!","review":"SUNZ OF MAN'S ALBUM HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST FROM THE WU-FAMILY SINCE WU-TANG FOREVER.

She also talks about her life, past movies, future plans, and how she got her career started in Hollywood.The movie itself is quite bad. A few topless sceens of Julie, and a couple of cheesey action sceens. My recomendation: Use the money to buy her latest book, JULIE STRAINS GREATEST HITS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Film Ever?","review":"It's hard to beat PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, but this super turkey comes close. Pure garbage. Even Julie Strain's enormous assets (none of them related to talent) cannot keep the adult viewer's attention for more than a microsecond (teenage boys may be exempt from this). The budget is non-existant. The same sets are used again and again and again, and look more like poorly made high school drama backgrounds than anything approaching real. Yes, Julie is repeatedly nekkid, but she has no acting ability whatsoever, and it is painful to watch her and all the actors struggle through something more resembling trash can refuse than a screenplay. Hopelessly, impossibly bad. And yes, not a single \\"battle queen\\" to be seen anywhere! Watch at your own peril!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So bad it's Great","review":"Well, well, well. Bad plot:check, Lots of senseless nudity:check, Horrible acting:check, Bad fights:check, Julie Strain: roger we are ready to move out. This may sound like a horrible movie and it is but the dialogue is great. Not great as in good but great as in \\"I can't act\\". The facial expressions and sheer lack of talent (except Julie) are priceless. Seeing an actor start to laugh as he says his lines with pride is classic in my book. The look on almost everyones face makes it seem like they are lost and unsure of what they are doing. To see people behave in this way is just funny. Kinda like real life.(You do meet some charactors out there.)But in all seriousness, If you want to relax and watch something thats not complicated then this is about as bad as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"brain freez","review":"I love Julie Strain, because she fun to watch and has a great body for a B film actress.This film is not the best production it's very sloppy looking and that's because it's very low buget.Julie Strain is not a very good actress she has a limit to what she can do.The film it self don't have a plot that's meaning full, the action in the film is totaly not there no body tries to write a good scipt no one tries to put a good action scene in this damm film .If you are going to buy this on 'DVD\\" just buy it for the great body of Julie Strain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie Strain at her Best","review":"First off, I am a huge fan of Julie Strain. She is in my top five hottest women in the world. This movie actually has a plot that isn't to stupid to follow. There is just enough of Julie naked to keep you watching until the plot unfolds and then you might actually care about what's going on in the movie. She is, of course, a bad ... and a babe and in this movie she shows some emotion. Julie is not some bimbo, like Anne Nicole Smith who couldn't act if she had to, it seems like Julie is really trying not to be just another T&A piece. I do want to mention there is nothing wrong with some T&A, the harder the better. If you are a fan of Julie Strain or even action movies then I would Definately look into this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"My wife liked it, not so much myself","review":"This should perhaps be reviewed by those under 13.

I bought this book for that purpose, but what I found myself doing was bringing the book home week after week so that I could experience the activities personally.Writing is an incredibly personal activity that isolates one from others. This book brings writers together collectively to that lone writer and helps her to know she is not alone, and it helps that writer to try some new ways of tapping that well of creativity...even when the supply is running low.There are a lot of books out there on writing poetry, but few are as inspiring and helpful as Ms. Behn's.

I had tried everything including countless doctor appointments and many treatments. My friend told me about PCA. He said it was the best on the market for Adult acne. So, I figured, what do I have to lose? I bought it and used it every morning and every night. It took about 3 days when I noticed the redness, the puffiness, and the acne were starting to diminish. I continued the treatment and starting adding other PCA products such as the facial wash. I loved it. I have finally found an affordable, medically grade high product that actually works!

With the emphasis on the roll. I'm not going to break down this thing song by song 'cause it doesn't need to be. Throw this baby in and just listen till it's over. It's special music. Judah Bauer and his buddies have found a groove that is sorely and sadly missing from rock n roll these days. Rock n Roll is meant to be dirty and sloppy and these guys don't seem to mind the smell.

It contains a wealth of interesting, informative data ranging from Cased Images (1839-1869) to Photography on Paper (1839-1900). Included are details about Daguerreotypes, Ambrotypes and Tintypes, Image Cases, Calotypes, Wet Plate and Albumen Prints and much, much more. It provides over 200 examples of various types of images found on today's market. Featured are 200 black-and-white photographs and 16 full-color images. Also provides manufacturer's marks, collector resources, a complete glossary, and a lot more. If you're interested in early photographs you'll consult this book often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at first...but really drags on.","review":"I enjoy Victoria Holt's mysteries--they remind me of Mary Stewart and Mary Roberts Rinehart in that they're charming and romantic. However, this historical novel is neither. The protagonist, Elizabeth I's cousin and adversary, is annoying. She also repeats herself--over and over and over and over again. The book could be half as long if the repetitive bits were edited! I actually couldn't finish the book, which is rare for me, because I got so fed up with the totally unlikable characters.Try Holt's mysteries--they're fun. But this novel is just a bunch of drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite buy","review":"Readers will love all these stories in this collection.

I love good, well-written erotica and I was eager to add to my collection. But I found the situations to be extremely contrived and the sex to be bland. And I am sorry, a dragon may be mythical, but sex with a dragon is still beastiality. Not that I found it shocking, but I just don't find that it has any appeal. At all. I stopped reading after story number two. If I haven't found it arousing by then, then it is in the trash. Maybe if you are into fantasy novels (as in the kind with other worlds, elves, etc.) then you will find this to be to your taste. Otherwise, it isn't worth the trouble of reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I see potential here.","review":"For a strait to dvd cheap horror flick, i was impressed. I could tell that much care went into making this film. There are campy moments here and there, but this movie has great build up and it totaly delivers in the end.

It has a smart and sympathetic lead charcter in Neil Stryker. The movie has some really memorable lines (I won't give them away). It doesn't take itself too seriously, and has a good yet understated sense of humor. You'll see good acting, GREAT special effects (especially the time portal), suspense, time travel, a mad scientist, horror, bloody bits, and an evil cult. What more could you want from a movie?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic and feel good story","review":"This is a typical Marion Chesney book : girl meets boy ... then girl discovers she loves boy but different complications arise to keep them apart and to keep the plot interesting. In the end, however, love prevails and Cheney gives her readers a happy ending. There are just a few racy scenes to add interest but nothing smutty. A very enjoyable story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooden and Flat","review":"The Dreadful Debutante is not one of Marion Chesney's best books. Her books, especially the themed series, tend to be a little over the top in their heroines and plot, but that is part of their charm. The characters in the Dreadful Debutante were more like romance novel caricatures and the plot seemed to be filled with events that are supposed to be funny and exciting, but which are not because you've already read them in ten thousand other romance novels. Neither the heroine nor the hero kept my interest. Mira was immature, a little stupid, and pretty irresponsible. We are supposed to believe that these very characteristics are why the Marquess of Grantley falls for her. I would skip it - it's not very satisfying even if you just want a fluffy romance read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The movie was great, very good and cute! As far as the soundtrack goes, the only songs I really listen to are:Charmed LifeE is for EverybodySheets of Egyptian CottonNight of Love, andMolly SmilesI especially bought this because I like Jesse Spencer and I wanted to hear him sing. I really like the way he performed all of his songs.

As a nation of immigrants, we struggle to appreciate the sacrifices made by those who made the journey to these shores, to understand what motivated them and what their life was like before they emigrated. I'm Irish, born and raised, but have lived in the U.S. for almost a decade so my perspective on this \\"journey\\" undertaken by the author in search of his parents roots is something I can easily relate to. I was initially disappointed with the earlier chapters in the book - they seemed to lack direction, were repetitious, and cried out for editorial direction but by the end of the book, I had realized that these are stylistic mannerisms of the author. The journey is less important than what the author learns along the way. Glimpses into Irish life are realistic, although tinged with sadness in places. Read this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So inaccurate it's not worth your time","review":"On page 71 the author says that Irish is a Germanic language like English. It is NOT! It is a Celtic language very distant from Germanic languages like English. The author goes on to say, \\"The English language is very ancient in Ireland. Despite what people say, English as a language is not something that was \`imposed' on the people by outsiders.\\" That is the most blatantly false statement on the Irish language I have ever read. Anyone who knows anything about the Irish language knows what the author said above is absolutely wrong and damaging to the Irish language. These statements alone should tell you NOT to buy this book or even check it out from a library. After reading that I put the book away.

I look forward to future works of this author, fiction or otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"After reading the glorious reviews on your site, I read the book and was totally disappointed. The book does not read like a novel. The characters were not developed and there was no interaction between the characters. The book preaches at you all the time and to imply that Jess was punished by God for his infidelity with cancer the author must not know God's grace. There seems to be no continuity, just random thoughts joted down. I read the other reviews and wondered if no one had the heart to be honest so that you may grow as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"First of all, if you are looking for an exact match for your broken mirror - look elsewhere. I hope the seller will change the item description because this (driver's side) mirror is not for a 1993 Honda Accord 10th Anniversary 4-door Sedan.I ended up putting the mirror on. You have to adjust it by hand since it is not an electronic mirror. The inside cover won't fit due to the mirror's joystick which sticks way out allowing you to adjust the mirror. The inside of the mirror has some styrofoam insert which seals the mirror from the elements. You won't be able to put that on either.My car is really old so I don't really care but it does not feel great to get ripped off. There were no instructions in the box either. Perhaps I am the fool for thinking this was exactly what I needed. Already waited 3 weeks for it to be shipped and don't feel like driving around without a mirror any longer, so I am going to keep it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't put your feet on the floor, there may be a snake there","review":"John Sheridan has crafted this thriller for those who can enjoy being frightened and thrilled at the same time. The African native mamba, is as deadly as any, and more aggressive than most,of the poisonous snakes. Aboard a transatlantic flight Captain Steve Custer is challenged to the max by the reptile, which was placed on the aircraft by terrorists. If you have a fear of snakes, this book will require you to keep the light on and continue reading through the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mamba drips venom and suspense","review":"John Sheridan has a winner with this spine-tingling tale of man against beast, in this case a poisonous snake with a bad attitude. Smuggled aboard a London-bound aircraft by terrorists who leave a trail of dead accomplices in their wake, this bad boy gives a whole new perspective on the fear of flying. With nowhere to go but down, the Captain and his crew (or should I say what's left of them) do battle with this cold blooded killer. I enjoyed Sheridan's wit, his attention to detail (the man knows his snakes and aircraft), and the way he developed his characters (the love interest between the Captain and an aging soon-to-retire flight attendant, the sophisticated herpetologist, and the drunken Senator) all of whom made this harrowing flight grippingly realistic. If you like on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement, MAMBA is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be made into a movie.","review":"This book by John Sheridan places terrorism in a whole different category as we know it. Mamba had me sitting at the edge of my seat through the entire airline flight and beyond. A page turner you won't put down. If you're looking for a book filled with incredible suspense, drama and a touch of romance ... THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! The creative flare of this author evokes a roller coaster of emotions out of his readers. This mind boggling thriller should be formatted to the big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome read for waiting single females","review":"I read this book about four years ago, and then re-read it a couple of years after that. I absolutely think it was wonderful, and I, too, feel as though this was meant for me. There are so many Christian women who see having a husband as a goal to achieve, they give little thought to whether they are preparing themselves and waiting for the right man to come along. Michelle's words inspired me to stop worrying about when this will happen, and concentrate on what I can do to make myself happy now....and put myself in the position of being a happier wife. After all, we attract to us what we are. Although younger women may feel put off by some of her writing, I would recommend this book to any woman (Christian or otherwise) who is putting her life on hold (consciously or unconsciously) until her mate comes along. Come on, girl prepare yourself.

A must-read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly Dissappointed","review":"Perhaps because I bought into all the hyped associated with Michelle McKinney, that I was so dissappointed by this book. For me it lacked depth, and failed to say anything new to the more serious singles in Christ. It also had flowery poetry that was distracting and only drew my interest even further from the book. If you lose the poor poor poetry, the book MAY BE worthy of of two stars. Next time, I'll pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that.....","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.

Reading her book was like talking to my best friend who knew all my innermost secrets. Ms. Hammond's godly wisdom is awesome! I am finding peace and joy living single and sold out for Christ! And when I find myself struggling and becoming impatient, I pick up the book and read it again! Her biblically based advice and the study guides for each chapter have helped me to learn to value myself and see myself the way God sees and values me.

This movie is about a young man on a mission to find his father's killers who have become successful businessmen in Australia. This movie will leave you on the edge of your seat as the story takes new turns as it goes on.

I am a fairly good birder in the US, but knew that I would not have the chance to do more than spot really common species in China. This book is watered-down ornithology and of no use as a field guide. The pictures are of poor quality. The \\"check list of the birds of China\\" is useless, as it does not identify individual species, rather it simply gives the number of species in families.The only other guide I could find is very expensive and heavy -- unsuitable for a traveler.

Dislocated and strange space and time that should belong to an unknown universe. The ruins like broken structures depicted 'as is' via certain perspective, is really attractive. Places like contention camp and work camp for offenders, psychiatric institute, bathroom, the eyes of prisoners & transsexuals etc further increase the mysterous tension in your visual interpretation.The cover photo is a masterpiece. Imagine, the room inside Moscow psychiatric institute is shown as a performace like theatre setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detention Camp for Young Male Offenders","review":"A dark and intensely disturbing exhibition.

I have an abiding interest in the Trojan War, ancient history in general, and Homer as literature, myth, and possible fact. This was not the book for readers like me.It reviews the events of the Illiadm but intersperses them equally with \\"insights\\" from the psychic Edgar Cayce. If you like and believe Cayce, I suppose, this book could be interesting, but if you're merely a Homer/Trojan War buff, it's worthless and infuriating. The author has Cayce telling several people they are the re-incarnations of Trojan war soldiers, and even negates Homer, by saying things like Hector was in fact a brutal dictator, something I defy any textual confirmation for.There are lots of different kinds of readers out there, but if you are interested in the Trojan War as history, literature, or archeology, this is not your book. It's silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunz of Man is the best Wu shoot yet.","review":"From Hip-hop to hardcore, Sunz of Man has it all.

These books written based on movies are usually rank garbage, but this was created by a master, that is very clear. The writing just soars, it is moving, it is scary, it presents the characters as complex people, the descriptions are wonderful.Frankly, this book belongs between hardcovers. It should never have been issued like this as a knockoff book, even though it is based on the script. This is a completely enthralling and fabulous piece of thriller writing.

Of course, as in most action, destructing movies, the dialogue was ok, and this book accentuates it. What I did like about it were the lines that jake Gynthall refused to say during the filming of the movie becuase they were too corney.

Streiber has no knowledge of physics or other sciences, but cares not a whit. In this extremely poorly written (lack of) effort, Streiber purports to describe a climatic calamity on the order of the recently lamented movie. It is amateurishly written, marked by no real single plot, and absolutely worthless as either literature or science. But people will probably buy it and buy into it, while books by real scientists, such as Richard B Alley, gather dust on bookstore shelves. Barnum was right.

Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"Why do people bother reading novelizations of movies? Just go to the movie. Typically novelizations are exact replicas of the movies. The \\"author\\" (ie. scribe) is tossed some version of the script and told to churn out a book in time to get to the printers before release of the movie. The Day After Tomorrow is no different.

It was obviously a desperate and misguided attempt to make kids think Shakespeare is cool. Newsflash: Shakespeare was a genius and this book is rubbish - tedious, pedantic, dull, badly written.

But any of his books would be a fabulous gift for your favourite child, because no one makes history seems as relevant, as personal and as fun as he does. Whatever your interest, Trease has probably written about it--revolutions French and Russian, Napoleon, Cavaliers and Roundheads--and of course, Tudor England, most famously Cue For Treason. There has never been a better fictional adventure written for children and adults who like history and I challenge all to read this book! If you can't find it, be patient, it's worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cue for Treason- excellent book","review":"A pity this book is now so difficult to get hold of.

After the first one, I devoured the rest. Up to that time I always said I didn't like history [classes, in school]. But after reading Trease's books, I became interested & tried Meader, and others.We moved away, & I lost the author & titles. But recently I went hunting. My favorite Trease books were the ones about Shakespeare (Cue for Treason), and his pair on Garibaldi. With neither author nor titles, I've had to hunt hard, & read a lot of children's books. But when I found Cue for Treason, I knew I'd found the right one. After 30 years, I still remember the story well [that right there tells you it's a good book!].Trease was a good historian [even if his political views were off :) ]. Better yet, he makes history come alive. Look for ALL of his fiction.

I think the reason i liked it so much was because, in history they tell the horrible story about slavery all the time.

I would have chosen someone with blond hair and fair skin, since both Marcel and Marie's coloring would not have been so fair if they had Peter Gallagher and Cecile's skin chemistry and hair color.

This movie is one of very few erotic movies that alludes to extreme sexuality and sensuality without the explicitness of porn movies. It has aged very, very well.The main character is well portrayed by the beautiful Silvia Kristel. She is both weak and strong as a person and as a sexual being. I felt that she very well portrayed the uncertainty that accompanies the joy and mystique of sexual freedom. This movie is about sexual freedom but presented in a manner that I find hard to describe. It is presented in a romantic and idealised way; subtle in parts, explicit (comparatively) in others.I give this movie 5 stars as I think it's exceptional for the erotic genre that it fits into but also because it is a well articulated and presented story."},{"rating":"2","title":"adult dvd","review":"A diffrent older adult DVD than Im used to but still found it intresting to watch. worth buying for the price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb display of beauty, sensuality and eroticism.","review":"A hot and outstanding piece of erotic art.

Arsan, played by Sylvia Kristel, goes to Thailand to join her husband, and finds herself in a number of erotic entanglements with various folks. (Of especial note: Christine Boisson, also at the beginning of her career.) As is to be expected form this sort of film, you're not going to get much in the way of technical excellence or brilliant scriptwriting; the focus here is on flesh, flesh, and more flesh, tied together with the most tissue-thin of plots. If you like that sort of thing, of course, this is one of the most important movies ever made. If you don't, it's the start of a plague.

The story is easy to follow and you get a good history of the elves in this book. The action scenes are good and well written. What you do not get is all the charter baggage that you get with so many FR books. You do not get charters that struggle with personal inter daemons that you know that they will beat by the end of the book and do the right thing. These charters are confident from the start and do what must be done to win the day. Also this book is not some dark tragedy that seems to be in vogue with FR books lately.Richard Baker has done a great job with this book.

Our baby is only 18lbs. and 25 inches tall yetthe harness fits so tightly that we will have toget another carseat in the next couple of months. They must have used a dummy baby with nothing on when they determined that it's good enough for a baby that is 29 inches tall.

When I received it, it was the CS3 version. I called the seller who told me it was the same book with a \\"few new details\\". He also said it was Amazon's fault for listing it incorrectly. He told me I should keep it and use it for a while. I opened it that day and it was NOT the same book with a few new details! Some of the menu items were not even available.

I was barely finishing my fifth year in elementary school when the final episode aired.Even though it took Universal so long to release the DVD, I'm still hoping the next seasons will take no more than 6 months between each other (...).I think this TV series was so well done that is must be a classic. It entertains adults and children alike with an intelligent plot that leaves something to the viewer (unlike most of the shows there are out there nowadays).For fans it's a must, and for people who want intelligent well done entertaining TV this is definitely worth the money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"I have been waiting for awhile for quantum leap to go on DVD.

I loved seeing the show again, but the price was high for only 8 eps. Works out to about almost $6.00 (U.S.) per episode. I was not able to find the \\"Hidden Messages to Leapers\\" promised on the box. Also, there is a pocket for a booklet, much like the box sets of Babylon 5, but there is no booklet.The episodes them selves were fun to watch. You can see how things changed between season 1 and 2. It was funny to hear Ziggy refered to as \\"he\\" when in later seasons Ziggy has a female voice.The box is nice, loved the vortex look.

It took this one far too long to make it to the long list of series TV sent to DVD's. The extras on these Season One DVD's make the whole thing even more endering to me. It seems as though Don B, Scott and Dean were not just a producer and actors showing up for a job every day. They gave their all. In some ways a very costly price for all of them. Quantum Leap is the product of what they paid. And much to my delight, I can now enjoy it any time I want too. When Season 2, 3, 4 and 5 is avaialble, I'll be in line to get my copies.The extras I would love to see are some bloopers, interviews, the specials done by E!, Behind the scenes, wrap parties and fan videos. Yes, I want it all back again. Just like it was new.Linda"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 8 episodes?","review":"I really think the price tag of 44 bucks for 8 episodes is a rip off.

I highly recommend QUANTUM LEAP: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A HIGH PRICED RIP OFF","review":"Before you buy the first season of this excellent show, realize that you are paying for ONLY 9 hours of the show, actually less than that since an episode is typically 48 minutes long.

The show was supposed to be about their encounters with new species in the DELTA quadrant and yet the producers were so clearly not able to come up with enough NEW aliens. We got stuck with TOO MUCH BORG in the series and NOW it even carries on these books. I wanted to know what each of the crew was doing now. VERY DISAPPOINTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing sequel","review":"I suppose that if you've read Homecoming you have no choice but to read the Farther Shore. Unfortunately, I quickly felt that I was reading this sequel out of necessity rather than for pleasure. The problem lies with Golden's emphasis on secondary characters. I'm sorry, but I didn't buy a Voyager book to read about Harry's girlfriend and all of her cohorts that Voyager's crew hasn't seen for the past 7 years, if ever, to the neglect of the crew. The plot eventually comes back around to our heroes, but by that point I was just about ready to put the book down and forget about it in favor of the Voyager DVD set. And that's a shame, considering how much I enjoyed Christie's Homecoming. Here's hoping the author's next venture follows the Homecoming model rather than that of the Farther Shore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voyager against the borg, with a federation twist.","review":"This is book two of two (Homecoming was the first), and it closes the plots from the first book, (Borg on earth, what to do?).

If you are a Voyager fan, you will like it, for all the other Star trek fans out there, you might like it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't come close to living up to its potential","review":"I was disappointed by part one and hoped that this book would round up all the elements of the first and make them make sense. It failed to do that and worst of all, the author failed to make me care about what happened to Janeway and her fellow conspirators. The ending is bland and forgettable. Here's to hoping that CG will do the characters justice in some future book and (crossing my fingers!) finally resolve the Janeway-Chakotay relationship, which has been broadly hinted at in the two previous \\"Voyager\\" novels by CG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I bought this type of cover for the first time and its a great product.

Well..... maybe unless you need to trim the bed rail covers flush with the edge of the bed. On mine, the rail covers extend past the bed rails, and the Tri-fold clamps need to engage the metal rails. It is easy, but count on more than ten minutes for the first install. I also needed more weather stripping and called Lund. They shipped another roll the next day.Love the top. Bed is dry and secure, but the top is easy to fold back for taller items. If driving on dry, dirt roads, prepare for dust in the bed. Not because of the cover, just the design of the bed itself.As others have stated, it would look better if the sides were not square but matched the shape of the F-150. But that would probably require a unique design and additional stocking - and higher costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truck Bed Cover Rates High","review":"I purchased and installed this cover several months ago.

It's not a life that he chose, but one that he was jettisoned into when he was forced to run away from an abusive foster parent. The plot thickens when Johnny lands on the cold midnight streets and alleys of Atlanta. Here, Johnny's core belief in his own worth as a human being is tested and he finds a simple goodness in a few runaway friends and in himself. He realizes that he can be more than a bought item that adults use and then dispose of without the slightest regard for him. The writing is gritty, edgy, full of violence and anger, but tempered with an almost poetic undercurrent that lessens the meanness and pain. The characters step from the pages fully developed and so believable that the reader cannot help but recognize these children as once being their neighbors, or maybe even being their own. This book will stay with you a long, long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Money","review":"My twins were really excited about the shape sorter at the sitter's. When I saw this Baby Einstein shape toy I was excited. They love the Einstein animals and it seemed like this toy would be great for teaching shapes, colors and animals all in one. Unfortunately, this is my least favorite of our \\"Einstein\\" products. First, the shapes have stickers on them, which my 14 month old twins immediately chewed off. Now we can't see the animals. The shapes are basic and are easy to match up; however, due to the angle of the turtle's shell, it's very hard for the girls to press the shape into the space hard enough for the music to come on. They get very frustrated with it. They quickly learned how to push the tiny button located in each space, to make the music go. Really, this toy is nothing but a sound machine. If you're looking for a shape sorter, I'd find something cheaper and more basic."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch out for the stickers","review":"I bought this item for my 6 month old son.

LOUD!","review":"I received this as a shower gift before my son was born, but didn't really encourage him to start playing with it until he was able to sit up on his own because it is made of hard plastic. The Turtle is heavy enough to hurt someone when my son slings it around. The shapes fall out, and there isn't anywhere to store the shape so the are all over my house. The only real entertainment my son gets from the Turtle is pushing the \\"Shapes, Colors, Animals\\" button OVER AND OVER AND OVER. For now, it keeps his attention. But it is the loudest toy he has by far and there is no volumn control. I am concerned when he plays with it on the floor and lays down beside it becase the sound is really loud for little ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"The turtle as a learning tool was very desirable, however, the shapes do not stay in their appropriate place and my toddler becomes easily frustrated.

It has no on/off switch and no volume control (hearing \\"SHAPES, COLORS, ANIMALS!!\\" will make you batty) and the shapes fall out of the turtle too easily, in my opinion, which typically means the turtle is in one place and its shapes are .... wherever.Another annoyance is that the animals that the maker has chosen to feature seem a little arbitrary to me. Maybe it's for variety that a koala was chosen over more common animals, but at 12 months (now), my child probably needs to start with the basics. I am especially annoyed because this toy was recommended to our relative by a salesperson at *a large toystore* who should have known better. I can't help but wonder if this was foisted upon unsuspecting and inexperienced toy buyers. Avoid this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely annoying","review":"My mother bought this for my son and, after just a few days, the thing was grating on my nerves. My son quickly learned that he could simply push the big yellow button on the top and get a big reward of music and lights (while I get a headache from the same words and song over and over). He has no interest in putting the shapes in their places, in fact, when a shape is put in place, the toy just states what it is with no music. The button on top is way more fun to push. &#60;br /&#62;<br />This may have been easier to take, but the toy is also VERY loud with no volume control or on/off switch other than taking the batteries out.&#60;br /&#62;<br />In theory it is a great idea - teaching colors, shapes, and animals - but kids are not encouraged to put the shapes in the appropriate slots since they get an easier reward by just pushing the big button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't be for 6+ months","review":"Like an earlier poster, my 9 month old ate the stickers - I was very disappointed that a product marketed for his age that would do that.Also no volume control or off button.

The large sunshine button on top is the only thing that interests my daughter and it just shouts, \\"SHAPES, COLORS, ANIMALS!!!\\" over and over!

I was relieved but annoyed that they would put stickers that come off on a toy for the age range 6mos+ when we all know everything goes into the mouth. Baby Einstein told me they are no longer making this toy but not for the reason I gave, the rep said she didnt know why. The manufactuer also told me their contract w/Baby Einstein is up however, they are sending me a replacement Baby Einstein toy.

For one, it's not really New Age, it's more like Celtic Folk. Pardon my candor, but there's a difference. Most of us who listen to \\"New Age\\" think of Vangelis, or Tangerine Dream, or the Andreas Wollenweider circle of artists. If you like Celtic style New Age then you might enjoy it. Number two, it's their band name. There is a problem with that name in the industry, with 2 other specific groups who have used that name for many years. Changing the spelling for legal use is very, very cheap. I find that a direct reflection of the kind of group they are. That alone inspires me to put the disc back on the shelf and browse for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Clever","review":"This album is my first introduction to the world of Stew, and I am definitely hooked. My taste in music varies widely, but I tend to go for faster, more electric sounds over all. \\"Something Deeper Than These Changes\\" is extremely mellow and accoustic, and I absolutely love it. The lyrics are incredibly clever, such as \\"Statue Song\\", and often endearingly sweet, as in \\"The Sun I Always Wanted\\". Back up vocalist and co-producer, Heidi, gives a wonderfully light contrast to Stew's rich, deep voice. This album's sound is somewhat simliar to John Cale and Leonard Cohen; however, I really hate to pin him to a particular sound or era. It's the kind of album that goes well with a long car drive in the rain."},{"rating":"2","title":"instantly begins growing","review":"This is my first introduction to the music of Stew and I can honestly say I am hooked. This album, from first listen instantly begins to grow on you. I find myself listening to certain tracks over and over and gaining more insight after each listen. Personal favorites include the brilliant Statue Song, the melodic sadness of Way of Life and the masterpiece Kingdom of Drink. If amazing production, beautiful vocal arrangements and clever lyrics are your cup of tea then pick this album up - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innocuous ditties","review":"Stew's songs (solo and with TNP) vary wildly in quality -- except for the ones found here, which are remarkably consistent.

When first purchased, after a short break-in period, this waffle maker was great. After a few years, sticking started to be a problem which became worse over the last year. Finally, we had to abort a waffle breakfast because of severe sticking. Close inspection showed that the Teflon coating on the plates was peeling off. I hope no one got a waffle with that \\"supplement\\". I did notice that the coating was quite thin. Maybe you should only expect to get about a hundred batches from a Teflon iron before replacement, but I really hate to participate in a disposable economy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zippee Waffles!","review":"We love our new waffle iron!

This weekend I made one of the recipes in the instruction manual and everyone in the house loved it so much I made a second batch to freeze for office breakfasts.Pros:- Waffles were uniform and cooked well.- Easy to clean. I prefer the plates not to be removable as that creates other problems. If you spray a little cooking spray on the plates before you turn it on the waffles and any left over residue come off with a snap.Cons:- The cord is REALLY short.Other than that I couldn't really find anything wrong. The instruction manual is great. I did find that if I used the entire 1 1/2 cups of batter recommended by the manual it would come out the sides so I reduced it to 1 1/3 cups and it made perfect square waffles. I plan to use this a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"We purchased this for our son's 13th birthday - he really loves waffles. It does a great job, and we have had no problems over the two months that we have used it. The timer works well, and as long as you spray the surface before each use the waffles never stick.

Sure enough, the waffler cooked the rear two waffles exactly as programmed. However, in every batch, the front edges of the forward two waffles turned out WHITE, mushy, & difficult to remove! It was also impossible to comletely fill out the waffles without the mix running out over the front into the unprotected electronic controls. I called Cuisinart to make sure I'd used the appliance correctly & their customer service representative could only conclude that the waffle iron was faulty. For this kind of price tag, that's outrageous! It was shipped back within 24 hours. We're reverting to an inexpensive model, which we'll just toss & replace every few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great waffle maker!","review":"We bought the Cuisinart WAF-4B Belgian waffle maker after reading all the reviews.

Unfortunately that show must have been one of the hour long comedy specials on HBO.

I admit I was scared because the Duran Duran one sucked. When I took it home I was completely taken. I fell in LOVE with this tape. Now I cant quit playing it. The way the artists covered the songs were amazing. Not any of them sucked. One of my favorites has to be Master and Servant. It was excellent. It has got to mean that Depeche Mode is definetly a good band and the people that made these songs did such a good job. If you are a true Depeche Mode fan and want something different, then buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst covers of Depeche Mode songs ever","review":"I was hugely disappointed, with the effort brought forth by these artists. Aside from the Cure, the songs were boring. There was no energy in any of the lyrics or to the beat of the songs. How could they disgrace such a good band with such a lousy tribute album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Terrible - a huge disappointment","review":"I love Depeche Mode, so I was really psyched to get this album. I totally dig the Pumpkins and especially the Cure - so that further motivated me to buy it. Well, about the only good covers were by the Smashing Pumpkins and The Cure, and they weren't even that great in the first place. The rest - no offense to any of the bands - sucked. My advice: skip this thing and buy actual DM CD's (especially both singles albums: 81-85 & 86-98 - both excellent). (while you're at it I also recommend the Cure Galore and the Cure: Staring at the Sea) Overall, I was majorly bummed with this \\"tribute\\", and Im ashamed to even give it 1 star because it is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of an insult, actually.","review":"Some (not all, thankfully) of Depeche Mode's best songs have been remade by todays leading MOR bands, and the results are almost obscene. Germany's excuse for Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, does a particularly bad cover of \\"Stripped\\", it sounds like a rude noise coming from them, while the Smashing Pumpkins do a laughable version of \\"Never Let Me Down Again. The rest is a mixture of second rate rock songs, which don't even have a bit of the brilliance of the original songs by Depeche Mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my God this thing is awful!","review":"Never have a heard such a basterdization of one could once be called good music. Rammstein's \\"Stripped\\" is done about as poorly as would be possible. And Smashing Pumpkin's version of \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" is simply the worst rendition of a great song. Don't be a hero and try to sit through this one. If you like Depeche Mode, buy the Singles Collection.

SONGS SOUND BETTER WHEN LEFT TO D.M.","review":"Being a huge fan of Depeche Mode, I was very excited to hear about this tribute CD. I was even more excited when I found out that The Cure (actually, Robert Smith) and Smashing Pumpkins were to contribute their talents to the album. But when I listened to this CD, I felt like crying. I soon discovered that nobody--not even Robert Smith (my idol)--does Depeche Mode songs anywhere NEAR as well as Dave, Martin, and the others. The artists who play on this CD, although very talented on their own, ruthlessly butchered all of my favorite songs while I helplessly listened, horrified. It sounded like a contest to see whose band could do the most damage to a perfectly good song... if I were in Depeche Mode, I would not be honored at this \\"tribute\\"; I would be insulted. If you have a D.M. itch to scratch, I recommend getting \\"Some Great Reward\\" or \\"Violater\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst tribute I've ever heard!","review":"For a DEPECHE MODE tribute album this is sad. The only good versions worth listening are the ones done by The Smashing Pumpkins, ThE CuRe, and the Deftones. The rest is all garbage. Example: Rammstein, I would expect something good but they sound like cave men. This album should have never hit the stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to song #1 and #4","review":"This was far from a tribute. It was, however, a collection of no-name bands using this project as a means of advertising themselves, not as a tribute to anyone.

Is this the same guy who openly criticized DM for many years?"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you're buying this based on the cure song... think twice!","review":"the cure song is total rubbish... perhaps the reason robert smith had to do the song all by his lonesome: the other members openly hate DM... in fact, even smith has made it a habit to rip on DM for many years... then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song... for shame... another reviewer said the smashing p. song was junk (laughable?) but i disagree... i think it's much better than the original song... but i've never been impressed with DM, in the slightest... the sp ver. has a better groove and the vocals are better delivered... again, the cure song sux... c'ya (ps i only listened to those 2 songs... then sold it to a used cd store... the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"what can i say ? this is a tribute to one of the best groups ever, depeche mode and songs were really well chosen, the cd is awesome"},{"rating":"2","title":"for some, but not for all","review":"I'm not a huge Depeche Mode fan, but I really like this tribute album.

NON-DM fans WOULD appreciate this cd - more so than DM fans. Most of the tracks on this cd are ear-splitting and annoying. Sensual has turned into Angry.

Not to mention a miniscule supporting roll for Dangerfield that was worthy of an Academy Award in my book! No, I am not a sick person who laughs at car accidents or mass-murder, nor do I condone the actions of Harrelson and Lewis as socially acceptable.

NBK follows the killing spree across america of mickey and mallory knox. what makes this film so special is the intence story that only tarentino could produce with the brilliant directing of oliver stone. NBK directors cut is even better than the original, adding extra footage that really should not have been edited from the original release. the only problem i found with the vhs is it lacks the court room scene. this was a great dissapointment, because after reading that section of the script, there was nothing i would have liked to see more than mickey's cross examination. overall though a brilliant film, that just keeps getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nautral Born Writer","review":"Tarintino is a genius he helped write this movie and it was great!

At least show them in a final battle, getting blown away like Bonnie and Clyde. But no. Stone had to go one more and in the last shot, I am assuming a few years in the future unless these two are also child nappers, shows these two sickos driving a van with their kids in the back. Not only do these two get away with all of their sick crimes, but they breed and are now going to teach their kids this sick behaviour. I dont mind horror films.

I literally had a headache after this film (Stone employs all the different film aspects: 35 mm, 8 mm, B/W, animation). I wasn't impressed by the \\"media's sensationalism of crime\\" message that was subliminally put forth. Subliminal nothing. You're knocked over the head with it!Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde. Their crime sprees and murders are documented by Robert Downey Jr who plays a tabloid television reporter.

Pitched at the intellectual level of a retarded slug, this reprehensible, self-important, mess of a movie isn't even in the \\"so bad it's good\\" category.

They succeeded.Now, while I say that the movie is purely written to satisfy the American audience's lust for violence, I also like it; I was raised with bloodshed, rape and other forms of \\"entertainment\\" thrust upon me until I found it to be normal.

I've seen \\"Natural Born Killers\\" when it first came out in theaters back in 1994. It was a good movie. I've always heard that there was a lot of violence cut out of this movie until the Director's Cut of Natural Born Killers came along years later. I finally saw the Director's Cut last year and it was much better than the theatrical release back in 1994. According to Oliver Stone (the movie's director), there was 150 cuts left out of the theatrical version and it's been restored in the director's cut. I think \\"Natural Born Killers\\" is a good movie, But with the director's cut, It's even better especially with a lot of graphic violence restored and additional dialogue. I recommended the director's cut over the theatrical version. I really think it's that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Quality Varied; Good Audio Soundtrack","review":"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.

And, I'm not sure if the black and white scenes were supposed to look as bad as they did.The audio soundtrack (Dolby TrueHD 5.1) was good.The movie about put me to sleep, but, it was late, and I was tired.

Stone projects his usual manic energy, has been operating commercially for decades by romanticizing alienation. The Director��s Cut features a brazen & self-serving explication. Introducing a film that can only be defended as a swipe at professional use/creation of violence as popular amusement stuff (sufficiently effective to twist/.../influence human animals), Stone blithely insists that his own popular amusement stuff is QUITE different, merely reflects us as we are... is NOT aimed squarely at a prevailing taste, perhaps media-assisted, that he claims to abhor.

That's especially obivious in the end, when the media literally gets killed in person of the reporter.One should keep in mind that Mickey and Mallory are not killing machines without any conscience just by that. First, their incredible harsh childhood lead to their killing obsession (they are victims in this matter). Second - and that's one of the most important scenes and themes in the movie - they change their minds when Mickey killed the indian. It's a turning point. (that's why the court scene has been cut out, showing too much brutality AFTER the indian-experience).The jail-interview is in my opinion a very sophisticated, interesting and provoking one; but of course that's just a personal opinion.I didn't like the movie at first sight. But it has the ability to grow and show lots of aspects at second sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Along with \\"Fight Club\\", this is probably my all-time favorite movie.

No, I'm not talking about the violence, while it is violent, there are movies with much worse violence than this. I'm talking about the way it was made. Oliver Stone did quite a good job with making this movie truly an experience in a way few movies are. It switches between color and black and white and random, and is often seems almost other-worldly. It is very good, and often very funny with a lot of good satire. This is a movie you should see, it's one of my favorites, but you may not like it. My only real complaint is the lack of use of the brilliant nine inch nails song \\"Burn\\" from the soundtrack (NIN is one of my favorite bands) in the movie. It is only used in one small part at the very end, when we see flashing images of Mickey covered with blood, fire, etc. This is a great movie, although, again, it's not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this contraversial film","review":"I love this contraversial film, it was a real headline runner when it came out.

It tries to poke fun at glorifying violence, but gets wrapped up in its own violence and loses its effect. Tommy Lee Jones, so brilliant in Under Seige and The Fugative, works way too hard in his role, as does Woody Harrleson. Amazingly, Woody plays a different sleazebag with perfect aplomb in The People Vs. Larry Flint- perhaps he learned his mistakes from this film. The only performance that is worth watching is Don Rickles, but his is a small role and not enough to save the movie. It is violent, noisy, and far too unbelievable even for a satire.

The plot: the \\"media,\\" news media that is, plays up serial killers Harrelson and Lewis as heros. The performances are great, but Stone's direction of the film is just awful.

THis is the movie where Stone apparently lost his mind, and succumbed to the popularity of Tarantino at the time (in its appice), so he accepted to shoot this sick piece of garbage.Shame on Woody Harrelson for accepting to be in it. As for Julliette Lewis, she practically made sure that she will never be able to act in another role than that of crazy and disturbed women.If Stone wanted to criticize the press and the people's thirsty for violence and instant \\"heroes\\", I imagine that he could have got his hands in another screenplay, other than this atrocity.I',ve already watched a number of ultra-violent movies.

Oliver Stone has done great films such as Platoon and Born on the 4th of July. He has made good films like The Doors and U-Turn, and then he has done misfires where he doesn't seem to be able to keep his focus, and this movie is a prime example. What was intended as a scathing commentary about the media glamorizing violence in itself ends up two things, glorifying it itself and a self parody. It is really a shame the performances in this film are brilliant, Woody Harrelson is the stand out, but Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Downy Jr. are really good as well.

He's more inventive, and cannier by far, and he understands these characters better.Stone took what may have been a fine story, and turned it into an exhausting mess. I truly did not like it. I gave it two stars because of Harrelson and Dangerfield and Downey, worth the price of admission when the film was released, maybe worth a Netflix rental, but NOT going in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie!","review":"This movie was fantastic!

Although he, himself, violently took the script away from Quentin Tarantino and changed almost everything except for the names, did a good job, I recommend this film to many Olvier Stone fans.And if you pay attention, you don't see as much violence as you think. Oliver always has a way of doing that.

Starts off just fine, but the entire concept and style of the film becomes so repellent and boring that its supposed \\"satirical\\" meaning gets flushed right down the toilet, and all were left with is black intensity (which some people actually found fun). Yet, this was one of the most critically acclaimed films of 1994.The DVD is as good as anyone could hope.

I remember sitting in the theatre, looking downwards when coming to another boring inevitable murder, and then turning to a friend, and saying: someone's going to take this movie seriously and go on a real life murder rampage. I was right. Unfortunately. Sometimes you have to be responsible for your work. Stone recklessly made this garbage only to make money. He should have known that some whackos would take this seriously and go out and kill to be popular.I remember the scene where some demonstrators were holding up signs saying 'Kill me' or 'Murder me', and thinking how utterly stupid this movie was, and how stupid Stone thinks his audience is. I feel so sorry for those real life poor innocent people who were killed by the teenagers who watched this movie repeatedly and then were killed. They didn't have to die.

Graphically, mindless, stupid, and pointless violence makes up this film. NBK might be credited for the reason you dont see Woody Harrelson in any good movies any more. Actually none come to mind anyway. Oliver Stone is over rated, which is an understatement, because most actors and directors are these days. Oliver Stone, Tarrintino, and Araki and others come up with a series of violent sh-t and \\"offensive\\" images to show you, knowing that most viewers will be so \\"outraged\\" by it they'll forget the pointless plot.

So if you dont enjoy graphic, bloody, mindless, violence, over and over and over, then dont see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst film ever made?","review":"Oliver Stone's attempt at a psychedelic rendition of BADLANDS comes off as an empty shell of a film, and 4 HOURS of it is intolerable. Sure, if you're into seeing Ashley Judd and Denis Leary in parts that effect the film in no way whatsoever or see Stone get even more childishly grotesque in the decapitation of Tommy Lee Jones, then I guess this widescreen edition is for you. But unlike his exceptional TALK RADIO and JFK, here the essentric, paranoid director takes sensationalism too damn far and never comes back: he has nothing new to say. Instead of exposing the hypocrisies of our country or frightening ways the media turn killers into heros, he just goes into a foray of violence and ends up w/ a big pile of MTV-influenced, masturbatory nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNBELIAVABLY BAD","review":"This so-called \\"polemic\\" director, who already gave us the masterpiece PLATOON, the entertaining \\"ANY GIVEN SUNDAY\\", the intriguing \\"JFK\\" and others, reached the lowest part of his career in this lousy picture, one of the worst thing I ever watched. Of course his \\"good\\" intentions were clear: criticize the American press love for news of violence, etc, etc. But the way he chose to do that was outrageous: half way through the movie, you can't watch it anymore, so bad it is, so bad taste, so ridiculous.

Add to that the total lack of talent from Woody, and the totally inept diection of Holywood's most over-rated director and you have one of the worst films to come out in the last 50 years.The film industry should be ashamed to ever let this piece out if the can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsettling and unpleasant","review":"Although I'm sure Oliver Stone's intentions were good in attempting to show the banality of media hype and desensitizing of society, NBK, in my opinion goes too far. This movie is ruthless in its \\"in your face\\" attitude regarding violence. Apparently Oliver Stone wanted to use shock tactics and this he accomplished. No wonder society is in such an upheaval. Mr. Stone did not help society with this unsavory offering, he merely added to its demise. Attempts at humor throughout the film are, possibly, meant to temper the violence, but sadly falls short. I don't recommend this movie to anyone with healthy sensibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers stands out unlike any other film you will ever see.

I say \\"suppose\\" because I'm not sure-this movie, though stunning to _watch_ (the different colors and film stocks are a treat for the eyes) has a huge gaping hole where a screeenplay should be. The key problem isn't that the title characters are so repellent-it's that every other character is equally repellent, and for the same reasons, which makes them all interchangeable. There is no real characterization (despite the efforts of a mostly superb cast) and so by the end, it really doesn't matter who lives or dies-which makes for a flat, uncompelling film. I give it 2 stars for the visuals and the acting-otherwise, it's forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natural Born Killers","review":"Disappointing. Oliver stone ruined this movie. Classic Tarantino story line but without his direction and overall vision. Wasted genius when Ms Lewis' character recollects about her father and the viewers find themselves lost in a corny 1970's sitcom. The murder scenes lacked weight, after the scene you were left wanting more but you never got more, you got less and less. The murders were focused on the murderers, instead of the people being murdered. This took the emotion and the pain away from the victim and put the spotlight straight on Ms Lewis and Mr. Harrelson.

Stone is not really American in his feel for cinema, but European. I personally think that is why he makes so many Americans uncomfortable.20 years from now, people will still be discussing \\"Natural Born Killers\\", as well as the rest of Stone's work.

I just saw this film for the first time and it is unlike anything you have seen before, the editing is so fast that your head will be spinning while you watch this. A lot of people complained that this film is a mess directed by a hack. I personally think Oliver Stone is one of the best directors around. \\"Natural Born Killers\\" is a very hyper movie it never stops for a second, Stone switches from Color to Black and White to 8mm to animation, it employs virtually every visual cinematic trick in existence. I think it was actually very clever by Stone to use different film stocks, the most violent scenes in the movie are in black and white and that lessens the impact of the violence.

But, I feel like I should pretend to like it more than I do, just so you'll think it wasn't that good.The changing film stocks make a resounding statement about society. But the red, neon messages projected onto the characters' faces that say things like \\"demon\\" and \\"too much TV\\" went right over my head! What was Mr. Stone trying to say here?

It also looks at the media attention paid to them and the celebrity status they achieve.Stone was obviously trying to make a point in this movie, but it's lost in all the tasteless violence and poor dialogue.

To make a point that midia and people love violence? Come on, he did not achieved that. The movie is just a gore feast, a disguised B-movie, and I'll tell you what: he lost a fan here, because I've never watched another movie by him again after this turkey.I say: This movie is pointless, absurd, generic, ultra-violent. One simply can not have the arrogance to say that he used violence of this level in a movie, to say that he is against violence!!

It has a very average plot of a psychotic couple going on a mudering rampage and having the media making them into celebrities. What image of American society are we supposed to be given here. It lacks originally in scripting, cinematography and directing. The acting isn't anything special either.

I blame it on the director.For some reason, Oliver Stone chose to give his version an \\"arty\\" feel (perhaps to give it his distinctive touch) and there are a number of places in the movie which seem \\"strange\\" to the point of spoiling my enjoyment.

Stylized grandeur overwhelms the watcher; effective scenes like the killers' brief awakening to humanity with an Indian mystic is lost in a tirade of foul collages and flashing memories. Here the director is indulging his talent but missing the point in doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone presents the theme the wrong way","review":"'Natural Born Killers' theme is, ideologically, a dead-on accurate theme. Unfortunately, Oliver Stone presents it in a rather odd way. He says that it is a statement that the media (cinema included, I assume) has taken violence too far. How does he go about illustrating this? By making a movie that is one of the most violent films in history. I believe his point would have had more impact if he told it from the view of the victims and their families. Then, the audience would be presented with people who have to watch as the killers of their loved ones are raised to star-status rather than following the killers and therefore empathizing with the wrong characters.BUT...Just because this movie gives a scrambled theme, doesn't make it bad. Technically, this movie is always a visual treat. It is exciting, funny, and the acting is wonderful.

There is something wrong with this version and the shaking. I don't know how the error was made and don't trust it's a single issue. It has to be the way it was processed. This is the most messed up transfer I've seen to date. If Oliver Stone ever agreed to messing up his own film, he has well outdone what Steven Spielberg did with the 2002 version of E.T.

And it does, when it works. I would say it is better than Tivo some of the time. It is cheaper, has more features than Tivo. Only problem with me was it would crash the whole system if trying to watch live or recorded tv, although it recorded fine. Maybe this was a problem with my hardware, but whos to say? The problem is, they have email only tech support. So after waiting 3 business days, you will get a generic response, asking you to try something that you already tried 2 days ago. I have 11 computer certifications, so the problem wasn't anything simple. SO I am breaking down and getting a Tivo, which I should have done in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Your Tivos","review":"First off. I'm an advanced computer user. This software is a pain from start to finish. There are known problems where some recordings play twice the size of the television making it useless to watch them. The capture card you buy from their site give you an incredibly bad picture for analog cable users (Tivo looks 5x better). But worst of all, Beyond tv will try its hardest find some reason NOT to record the shows you tell it to record. For instance, one time it decided it no longer knew what directory to record the shows to. Other times it just didn't record stuff, and didn't give a reason. So basically you have to check up on it every day to make sure it is still working. what a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to work ok before the recent upgrade","review":"Used to work ok. In retrospect, it's never been worth what they charge for it, but it was ok. It took a long time to load, sometimes would hang up, etc. - I have more than adequate RAM, processing speed, etc. The recent upgrade to 4.81 is however a nightmare.

Brother customer service was horrible, they say there is nothing they can do, I asked several times if I was the only customer upset by this and at first they would not answer. After speaking to 3 supervisors, no one would offer anything. They finally said that they recieve many calls about this.

My only complaint is that it won't print standard business cards. The third quality level out of four (\\"Fast Normal\\") is adequate for most of my purposes, which saves on ink. Also, it works great with refilled cartridges from Rapid Refill. Doesn't tend to jam up often. My intent was to save space by not having separate machines for each function. Others cautioned me against buying a multifunction machine on the grounds that they do all the functions but don't do any of them very well. Since I don't often copy, scan, or fax, high quality for those functions wasn't necessary, but it's nice not to have to run out to make a copy, and the printing is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother MFC-420CN Plugged ink is the norm","review":"I am not through the original set of ink which comes with the printer and it is already plugged.

If I had read the reviews here, I never would have bought it. But I have it now. I have had one since they came out almost 3 years now. I added it up. In that 3 years I have printed about 250 sheets of paper. And I have used 12 ink cartridges. That means I am getting an average of 20 sheets per cartridge.

But later on, I realized how Brother uses this machine to make you buy more cartridges.I don't print regularly but when I wanted to print, inevitably this printer tells you that the ink is empty( as this printer with OCD has sucked up all the ink cleaning it daily).Then I scram to the store to get the cartridges, which are not cheap and you would be forced to buy the packs as buying individual ones would cost you twice as much. Worse, it will not allow you to fax or scan when any of the cartridges are empty(As a work around, I used to initiate the scan from the computer)I would not even give it away for charity as I don't want other people to spend all their money buying ink cartridges every few months.I certainly would not recommend this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer Clear","review":"I have owned at least a dozen printers and this is the absolute worst! When it does work it is incapable of reading the ink level. It will consistently tell you that you are out of ink even when you have replaced all cartridges.

I followed the instructions for setup and during the ink cartridge initialization the printer stopped working and gave me an error message, stating that it could not complete initialization. After following the troubleshooting instructions in both the manual and online multiple times, nothing solved the problem. (Scarily, the primary explanation in the troubleshooting manual for this error message is simply that \\"there is a mechanical malfunction\\" with the machine.) This one's going back and I don't think I'll take my chances with Brother again.Thank goodness Amazon makes returning defective product so easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great... When it worked","review":"When I first got the printer it worked absolutely fine, except for eating up ink a little too quickly. Then after about a year I was plagued with constant paper jams which took a lot of time and effort to correct. Now magenta won't print, probably due to an ink clog, and nothing I do will fix it. Everything I print in color looks horrendous. I would advise you not to buy this printer if you're looking for reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good on paper, but not in person","review":"The biggest problem with this device is its paper tray. It has the flimsiest and most awkward tray I have ever seen, worse then what I had on my $29 Lexmark Z13! On top of that, it barely holds 100 pages. If it wasn't for this Ii would probably give it 4 stars.The flatbed scanner and paper feeder are also flimsy, but on par for a unit in this price range.The network interface works pretty well; you can basically use all its features from a networked computer you could with USB (even send faxes). The only network limitation I have found is that the memory card reader seems to be read-only via the built-in FTP server (I haven't really looked to see if there is a password or something to unlock)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Value","review":"One of the best products for the money I have ever come across.If you need a multifunction machine with network capability, this is it.

This Brother feeds multipage faxes great. Now the bad news, it will completely stop everything if any color is empty, no chance of going black only or gray scale, it stops. When it says a color is empty there is still a noticeable amount of ink still in there. I'm used to HP's that leave just a trace on the sides of the container. Nowhere on a Brother cartridge does it list the volume of ink contained within. So you have no idea how much you are buying. Paper tray seems very cheap and flimsy, it has no pusher to push the paper forward. It does miss-feed envelopes fairly often. I'll just say this will most likely be my first and last Brother printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"clunky interface, memory hog, constantly replacing ink","review":"this was purchased to be used as a secondary printer in a small office. purchased because of price, built-in networking & color feature. it has been at work for over a year & i'm not at all happy with it.unable to network using \\"built-in\\" interface. doesn't matter because i can't seem to find a universal driver that will work in place of the \\"printer manager\\" interface which saps memory resources. purchased because the ink seemed inexpensive, but it seems as though i'm constantly replacing cartridges despite sporadic use (<500 pgs./mo.).it prints nice & has a small footprint, but if i had to do it over again, i would have gone with another hp workhorse."},{"rating":"1","title":"My second Brother printer failed","review":"I have had a MFC-5840CN and now a MFC-420CN and both have had clogged Magenta ink jets.

Test prints showed progression of clogging for both printers was identical. I'd guess maintaining a high humidity environment is important.Ignoring the magenta ink problem,,,, bother printers work well. The scanner and paper feeder are very useful.Funny thing. Installing the driver for the MFC5840-CN from CD worked well enough if you installed twice. The driver downloaded from the web site never installed at all and the Brother Technical support knew about the issue.... all tech support had to do to improve the situation was put a copy of the driver shipped on the CD on to the web site. Why tech support never did that is a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever due to stupid ink management","review":"I recommend NOT to buy this unit.The reason for this is, that as soon as one ink cartridge is low (not even empty), the unit stops working. On their website Brother mentions that it was designed that way to ensure quality printouts and protect the heads. In my opinion the only reason is to force you to buy the expensive cartridges.Even if you only print black & white, you still need the other 3 cartridges. The problem is, that the automatic cleaning process drains the ink. This means even if you NEVER print a single color page, you constantly have to replace the color cartridges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality heads","review":"A few months after I bought this, the black print head stopped working.

Control buttons are NOT intuitive and manuals are poorly written. Ink is MUCH more expensive than I thought - you only get about 1/2 as many pages as the marketing says you get from each cartridge. When any one of the inks gets low, it won't print at all. Non-OEM ink cartridges don't work. This printer in total has been down about one day a week throughout this 6 months.

You run out of ink in a few months even if you are not using it. With no ink you cannot send or receive faxes (even you are out of yellow and the fax report is printed black).

This indicates to me that two separate components have failed within each of the bad drives. I bought these based on the Maxtor name and value ($/Gb) for the drives. Not only have the drives failed, but so has Maxtor. Their support is virtually nonexistent on their web support page (www.maxtorsupport.com), which directs you to their \\"knowledge base\\".

In fact, seems I was lucky to get 4 months out of it; many haven't even made it that long. What's more, Maxtor didn't even ask me for any details before authorizing the return, which leads me to believe they're well aware of what a dog this drive is.My guess is they've made it so quiet by shortchanging the cooling of the drive. Before it failed, the case would get so hot you couldn't touch it. Sad really, as until this, Maxtor drives had always performed well in my experience. The replacement drive is still OK, but I've since bought a DVD burner for backing it up, as I've no faith this one will last either.

The blackheads only went away after using another brand of acne wash. The fact that I had a small breakout a day after using the scrub could have been purely coincidental, but it was enough to stop me from using it on those areas. I still use the scrub on the rest of my face, firstly because I paid for it, but also because it's a decent face wash. It exfoliates the skin well and leaves it pretty soft, and it smells great.

I realized that I purchased this clock specifically to have a large analog clock that would never be wrong (the correct time is an issue of occasional contention where I live), but I spent about $30 more than I would have for a similarly sized non-atomic analog from Wal-Mart. Not only that, but the thermometer only ever showed 58 degrees, whether sitting in a warm car or hanging in an air conditioned hall. Total waste of time and money. If you buy this, it'll be a complete crapshoot as to whether you're getting the clock some have gotten to work for them, or its evil twin.

The workout is VERY short. I mean, I am out of shape, and I think the only reason I was sweating was from laying on plastic for 15 minutes. I must say it does help you to target muscles pretty well. But I would not recommend it if you want any sort of cardio workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners","review":"The workout is divided into sections of abs and buns and thighs, but it's best to do the whole thing at once. It's pretty short and there is only a warm-up at the beginning. I found the abs workout to be pretty easy and not long enough. Some of the legs and buns exercises were difficult, and I could definitely feel them. All in all though, the calisthenics part of the DVD is pretty short. About half of the DVD is devoted to stretching. The stretching is great and it really feels good. Most major muscle groups are stretched, and there's a fun little section at the beginning where you bounce up and down while sitting on the ball. I would recommend this DVD to beginning exercisers and as an introduction to using a stability ball. All the exercises are relatively simple, and the instructors are easy to follow. This is a quick workout that's good to do at night, because it is relaxing and doesn't get your heart rate up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for bad backs","review":"I recently bought this video to use with my stability ball and am very happy with it.

I have another of Karen's videos and it is shot on a beach with fabulous scenery and it just changes the whole tone of the video. This one is just blah with a boring set and boring music.

The workout is 25 minutes long, and doesn't come close to breaking a sweat. (The abs and legs routines are about 10 minutes each, followed by 5 minutes of stretching.) I'm reintroducing myself to exercise and thought this would be a fun way to start, but it's not, especially since i feel like i'm not accomplishing anything. (I suspect intermediate and advanced exercisers will feel even worse.)Karen Voight is a better trainer than most. She doesn't suffer from hyper-perkiness that can irritate exercisers. However, her counts often feel \\"off\\" to me, which is either a result of bad editing or bad musical selections. All in all, this isn't worth the money I spent on it.

She used it for several weeks as a pen during potty training (NOT as a crate, this definitely isn't meant to truly contain a puppy safely without supervision)until she got tall enough to almost jump out. We then used it outside while we were on the porch to contain her, and now use it as a long fence/barrier (by bringing the sides close together in a parallel fashion rather than expanding it out into an open pen) to keep her in our line of sight in the living room. Right now we have it set up as a fence at the bottom of our porch steps so that we can relax and enjoy the whole porch together. Again, it's not safe to use as a true barrier or containment when you're not supervising, but it's a great little helper to us. One complaint- it can be a pain to open the gate because it has to be perfectly balanced to lift in the correct alignment.

It reminded me of Smetana a lot. Some other stuff on this CD is quite atonal. My ears did not enjoy Ullmann's string quartet at all; I know it is all important music to listen to to learn about the holocaust, but I think Ullmann's opera \\"Der Kaiser\\" is much less atonally grating to the ears. Klein is a wonderful composer, and I enjoyed his atonal sonata on here much more than Ullmann's atonal string quartet. However, overall, I would say buy this cd for Klein's String Trio and YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.

Obviously if you compare the two, it just doesn't measure up. You have to look at \\"Hannibal\\" as its own film rather than a sequel. If you look at it like that you will find that \\"Hannibal\\" is a very well written, acted, and directed movie.

The whole movie was lead up to the big ending, which turned out to be not so big.

The end is the most disgusting thing I have seen in years. What saves this movie is the brilliant performance of Anthony Hopkins. He should be nominated for an Oscar.

This movie is both thrilling and amusing.My only worry is that some could see this movie as the glorification of a serial killer. It isn't blatantly said that what \\"Hannibal\\" is doing is right in the movie but all the indicators are there. \\"Hannibal\\" attacks only people he considers sinners. The majority of these people aren't shown in a favorable light for the viewer. He saves \\"....\\" And the ending shows him in a favorable light.

I dont want to give away too much, but there is a rather disturbing scene with some wild bores that may have well been left out, or maybe re-thought before included in the film. Then the infamouse (or soon to be infamouse) dinner scene was to the point of down right stupid. The last 20 minutes turned the legend of Hannibal into a \\"goofy at best\\" slasher flick. I mean to the point of movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. The acting was awsome. I really feel that Anthony Hopkins did an excellent job, and so did the supporting cast.

Rarely has so much talent been wasted. The pacing was slow and the characterization was weak. Julianne Moore was fine as Clarice Starling, but the character was much too passive. Basically, all she did was get dumped on by her superiors while waiting around for Hannibal to show up. I'm one of those who enjoyed the book, and I'd like to read more about these characters.

I actually think it was better. I just watched Silence, after watching Hannibal, and the first one just isn't as good. I thought Julianne Moore equaled the performance of Foster, and I don't think the movie was too gory. This movie was not about Buffalo Bill, it was about Hannibal, hence the name. Would you not expect it to be a bit more graphic? He slices, dices and eats people. Why in the world would someone with a weak stomach even think of watching it? The storyline is much more difficult to follow and predict. Excellent suspense. Silence really didn't leave me wondering too much during the movie, but I could not predict what Hannibal was going to throw at me next. It's almost like a well produced Lynch film. Great movie. However, the second disk is an absolute waste of time. I don't even know why they bothered. Hannibal is just an evil man that is impossible to hate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as the book...","review":"I had awaited the arrival of Hannibal on DVD ever sense I had read Thomas Harris's sequal to Silence of the Lambs. If you plan on seeing this flim, I recomend seeing Silence of the Lambs first, and if you liked the movie, read the book Hannibal. You'll be surprised, because Harris had a different ending.The DVD is packed with an entire second disc that is filled with extras worth watching, the movie is great (but not as great as the Silence of the Lambs), and consider it worth your time and money. That is, if you like movies that will make you think, and not be able to sleep for a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! Stupid!

The Punnic Wars being one of the key battles for supremacy of the Mediterranean. Rome had one city standing in the way of its domination and that city was Carthage. There were three battles. One of the battles involved a Carthaginian general named Hannibal.This movie had me a bit confused as I was waiting for the climatic scene with the elephants crossing the Alps. Especially since parts of it were shot in Rome. Nor did I see any Centurions for that matter.Anyways, I didn't really care for this movie.

For all our belief that we are more progressive than our ancestors this is exposed to be a lie.

Sir Anthony Hopkins was awsome as predicted, and Jodie Foster's replacement (I can't believe she would do this movie!) Julian Moore, was a great actress, playing Starling's part as well as Jodie!I must say I was delighted with the film's Score, a beautifull piece of artwork that fit perfectly with the moods of the film.Most people complain about this movie not being a very good sequel to the famous Silence of the Lambs, and its because it's not, this movie is not a sequel, but a second, (third in the book series, and soon to be movie), part in the Lecter/Starling adventers.This is a great movie with a fabulous scrip and score, as well as fantasic acting by all the acters/actress'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy It for what it is.","review":"I was a little disappointed with the movie adaptation of the book. I think they left out some very crucial elements from the book that should have been left in the movie. Despite the poor adaptation from the book I still really enjoyed the movie alot. This movies is not Silence of the Lambs and in now way does it pretend to be. This movies has a whole different style story to tell. I think the first movie was more Good v.s. Evil where in Hannibal all the characters other than Agent Starling are all evil in their own ways. I thought the movie was very enjoyable. I would give it 5 stars if I had not read the book, but only 3 to 4 since I read the book first. The movie is good by itself but the book was far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genious is followed by normality","review":"\\"Hannibal\\" was the second possibility for Hopkins to play this amazing, all people around the world shocking character Lecter. But he fails. All the genious that takes place in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", all the frantic and bizarre movements of his face, his hands and his body, are now followed by a normal acting, no shocking anymore, drawing quite a caricature of this character.

Life isn't a happy ending. I think the reason so many were unhappy with \\"Hannibal\\"(the film) was they wanted another \\"Silence\\" and it didn't happen. This is an entirely different film and shouldn't be compared to the greatness of Demme's \\"Silence\\". No, I never got scared like I did during the original.Who cares?! It's a bit campy but Hopkins and Oldman hamming it upis a wonder to behold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"well, the long awaited sequel to silence...

Ridley Scott did a great job with the film location and the directing. Anthony Hopkins, yet again, did a great job as the bone-chilling Dr. Hannibal Lector. I also believe Julianne Moore did a good job acting out Clarice Starling. The Italy scenes were wonderful and Mason's home was beautiful. The movie had some spots that were gory but what can you do, it helped in understanding those parts. So if you dont want to make Hannibal mad, go buy this movie which has a great dvd. The dvd includes just about 15 deleted scenes, multi-angle views of how they shot certain scenes, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and much much more.

Anthony Hopkins again finds a way to escape and inflict more damage on society.

Then he is in someone's room slicing them up. Then he is eating someone's brain for breakfast. Would you like eggs with that, Hannibal?

Instead we get a very long, borning opening that I must admit, I fell asleep in. Hannibal doesn't kill anyone until one hour and fifteen minutes into the movie. And no matter what anyone tells you, the movie does not have that much gore. I have seen a lot worse. I didn't really care about the killing, but there really is no suspense at all. I didn't care what hannibal was doing in Italy or what C. Starling was doing. When I saw the preview I thought the whole movie was going to be a \\"catch me if you can\\" movie. It wasn't that at all. The best part of the movie is the ending, which had the most gore. Anyhow, I thought Ridley Scott would have done a much better job. I like all of Scott's previous flims a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheres Anthony Hopkins, Coz i want my money back","review":"My now, wife paid for me to get into this movie, and am i glad?

Clarice saving the man she fears only to be stuck at a dinner table and watching Hannibal feed a man his own brain? That scene was very sickening and hard to watch but I just couldn't tear my eyes away. The only let down is that this movie doesn't let you get to know Hannibal more.

If I could give it less stars, I would. First, I absolutely love, LOVE, \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". It is an all-time classic. \\"Hannibal\\", is a weak excuse for a sequal. Hopkins and Moore were great in the parts they were given, but the suspence that made the first film so great is completely absent in this one. \\"Silence\\" was a big movie that felt like a wonderful small film. It was artistic, enthralling, and spine-tingling. \\"Hannibal\\" is predictable, boring, and laughable.

What does the movie studio do? Try to duplicate the success as quickly as possible to strike while the iron is hot, and create a sequel. And like most sequels, this movie doesn't live up to the original.Even veteran actor Anthony Hopkins cannot save this movie, in spite of his wonderful performance. Julianne Moore replaces Jodi Foster as FBI agent Clarice Starling, who squares off against Dr. Hannibal, who taunts her from across the Atlantic ocean in obscure ways.I can almost imagine how the script outline took shape. The story seems to be the product of anxious Hollywood pitchmen frantically throwing out ideas to a studio executive, grasping for success.

He is a true actor but I was a little surprised that he took this role.Silence of the Lambs was a psycological thriller --- it toyed with your mind and left much to our own horrific imaginations. This left nothing. You knew exactly what was going to happen before it happened (even if you hadn't read the book). It was all shoot 'em up action and gore with very little thought.

Maybe not the best, but satisfying at least. Since the title of the film is actually 'Hannibal' I knew it would mainly be surrounding Hannibal Lecter, so I wasn't expecting a great deal more from it. However, another point which I also have to get off my chest, is the relationship between Clarice and Lecter. Now, being a huge fan of Silence Of The Lambs, I did think Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster had good chemistry. But in Hannibal, I was completely blown away by Hopkins and Julianne Moore's chemistry together. The only disappointment was, in my opinion, there weren't enough scenes between Hopkins and Moore to express this, and probably change the minds of the audience. The other cast members, such as Gary Oldman whom played Mason Verger, also did a great job. Overall I thought the film was definately worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"The movie starts off waaaayy to slow.

I was extremely impressed by the attention paid to the DVD (as another reviewer mentioned) by MGM - it's nearly flawless. Some parts of the film are deviant - even grossly disgusting - but that's the point. Hannibal is a diseased individual, and excessive gore is how the depiction of the character's mental state was achieved. I thought this visual representation was done quite well, even if it was just a crutch primarily reinforcing the merely acceptable screenplay/writing.

No one except a washed-up detective recognized him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross AND dull!","review":"It's hard to be both stomach churning and boring at the same time but this film manages to find a way. \\"Hannibal\\" has three of the goriest Grand Ginioul moments in any splatter film: Mr. Lecter hangs & disembowels an Italian detective at the same time; some hungry worthogs dine on another group of villans (leaving nothing to the imagination); Hannabal feeds an FBI agent his own brains! However, you have a long forgettible ride before you get to any of that. Hardcore HG Lewis fans are going to use the fatfoward button a lot. The rest of use should just stick with \\"Manhunter\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gutsy film thats better then the first.","review":"you heard me. this one is superior to the original. dont get me wrong the original is one of my favorites but this film is superior in every way. I think Juliane MOore is a better Starling then Foster. if you read the books Moore brings out Slarling characer brilliantly. she took a big risk to replace foster and pulled it off brilliantly. Hoplikins, who is one of the finest actors ever, steals the show. lector is still the man. killing. slashing. super cool. He is one evil motherf--ker and hopkins shows it. Ridley Scott is an awesome director and he proved it her. a beautifull film throughout. I think the reason this one is better is because its over the top in every way. and the film aknowledges that. lots of the scenes are sick but who cares. to close my aurgument as to why this film is better i will quote one of the actors working on the film \\" The first one was inside you head, this one is in your face\\". true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have stuck with the original ending...","review":"I'm not going to go into what the original book ending was to Hannibal, but the ending chosen for the movie was a copout. As for the movie, that would be my only complaint. Moore held her own in a role that doesn't call for much depth an insight, as this is Hopkins' show. One of the real bright spots is of course Gary Oldman as the main antagonist Mason Verger. The makeup is fantastic and his sadistic portrayal of the character is dead on perfect. All in all, better than Manhunter but a notch below SOTL. If you are going in expecting Silence of the Lambs Part Two, you will be disappointed. Hannibal is on the loose and the psychological interplay he had with Clarice in the first film won't work as well here as action does. A fun film with a very funny, but disappointing, take on the ending"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily disgusting","review":"This movie is simply foul, with a poor storyline and grotesque visualizations. Pick up the Silence of the Lambs for a good thriller, but pass this one up if you plan on eating anything in the next two weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total GARBAGE!","review":"Ive never written a review about a movie. I felt the need to do so here because it was such a completely appauling POS. I cant think of the correct words to describe this movie. Maybe \\"symptomatic\\" or \\"unhealthy\\" does more justice. Unfortunately, the fact that I thought it was so disturbing (on many levels) is a reason why many people might actually like it - sick people. With such movies being pumped out by Hollywood, there is absolutely no surprise kids can walk into school and blow away their teachers and classmates (and why our society can so easily tolerate it). The actors involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves. I for one will never watch another movie by this director or with any of the actors involved. I wish I could \\"unwatch\\" it. Shame, shame, shame. Yeah, graphic violence and over-the-top gore is real good for society. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about not meeting the hype","review":"This movie did not even begin to meet the hype that it was given. Infact, I am almost convinced that Silence of the Lambs was an accident. Manhunter was bad and Hannibal was worse. The story in this movie made little sense to me. The entire last sequence with Ray Liota was just simply for shock value and to me added absolutely ZERO to the plot or the story line. Another funny thing is this. When the police arrived at the end Jullianne Moore had no handcuffs on even though the keys to them were missing and Hannibal had to cut off his own hand to get away. Overall this movie was a complete miss. Silence of the Lambs is the premier movie in this series. Infact, it is the only one worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal Is The Worst Sequel Ever Made Since Halloween III","review":"Hannibal, the sequel to Manhunter and The Silence Of The Lambs, is by far the most disapointing movie ever. The ending was the worst part of the movie. I don't want to ruin it for you, but those who read the book will be disappointed. Now, don't get me wrong. I like Juilianne Moore. But, when you think of Clarice you think of Jodie Foster. It also ditches the psychological horror theme and goes for the more noir meets Italian Drama. It has a few wierd parts in it, but it was nothing like The Silence Of The Lambs. I suggest if you watched the first two, then you may want to rent the sequel. Othereise, save your money for the remake of The Red Dragon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too overpowering","review":"This is an extremely well done thriller. The acting is superb. The story is fresh. Well, as fresh as a sequel can be. My only problem with the film is that they really pushed the edge with the gore in this movie. You definitely do not want your children to see this film. Some of my adult friends have had trouble with the scenes in this movie and I am sure children would have nightmares over it. I really liked the movie, but I wish they would have held back a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding me...","review":"This movie is definitely NOT at all a good book to movie transfer. There were SO many changes from the book, not to mention the fact that there was a new director with a completely different style which butchers the original feel of Hannibal's character. \\"Hannibal\\" did not ring true as an addition to this series. \\"Red Dragon,\\" the story which precedes \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" was awesome compared to this. The ending of Hannibal was just re-writen to please the American audiences who can't seem to deal with the outcome of the novel, I suspect. you have got to be kidding me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal; actors without a proper script","review":"Sequels are rarely better than the original (The Empire Strikes Back is an exception) but most often they are not this disappointing. What will let you down the most is the poor script; too many important scenes from the book have not been used, the final confrontation between dr. Lecter and Starling is ridiculous, it lacks refinement and there are simply too many one-liners that are simply not funny (even though some were obviously intended to be). Great actors (Hopkins, Oldman, Giannini and Liotta) but Moore does never convince as Starling. Jody Foster could not have saved this movie but she might have made it a bit less hard to swallow. Buying this movie is not the best way to spend 20+ dollars. Read the book or get Silence of the Lambs on DVD, in case you havn't got that yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Should Have Paid Us To Watch This","review":"I expect sequels to be somewhat close in calibre to the movies they are following. Well, HA!!! With this one, that expectation didn't even come close. To me, all this movie accomplished was gore & digust. What a shame that such a spectacular actor (Hopkins) agreed to lower himself and the character to this level. In my opinion, people should have been offered top dollar to waste their time and view this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mythoughts","review":"Excellent movie especially in full screen edition and recommend it to all that enjoy psychological thrillers and why they do not adapt all of the movies in the 1:33:1 format as an alternative purchase from widescreen format for those consumers who prefer it I will never know"},{"rating":"2","title":"HANNIBAL- did it 4 me","review":"Hannibal - was an interesting epic of a movie, the shere presence of adrenalyn , gore and great acting made this film a pleasure to watch. T he script was exellant and may of the phrases will be remembered as much as the T2 lyrics \\"i'll be back\\" but i will let the audience find that out 4 themselves. Anthony Hopkins is a star adding quirky, black comedy into places where he is tempting the audience to guess at what happens next. The first film was horrifying but the final 10 minutes of Hannibal was pure gore. The cliffhanger ending is leaving a sequal open so the fans may enjoy another Hopkins Masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distasteful Garbage!","review":"I am ashamed to have seen such an antipathy of a motion picture. Was this film directed by Ridley Scott even with a try to produce? Aversion! Hannibal Lector (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is hiding in a reclusive location. Sweden? Italy? Don't know. I could care less. The movie moves at an excruciating slow pace and Clarice (played by Julianne Moore this time) seems stiff and moves around like cadaver). Ultra ennui! She has searched for Dr. Lector for many years and she should've has closed the case after \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", a good movie. This movie is truly sickening with its amount of gruesomeness even Jason Voorhees would find lewd! The deformed man that wanted to get revenge on Dr. Lector was just extra malady! By the way, I don't want to get near a pig pen ever! After watching this freak show, I lost my appetite for the rest of the day and ended up not eating for a month. If this is your kind of playground, then by all means dig in! Distasteful, no yummy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha! A Sequel! To what?","review":"Well, if you have read the book, do not, I repeat, do not go see this movie. Yes, the actors did a lovely job. Of course they would. Anthony Hopkins is in this. But, the script strays from the original text, which is beautifully written. And on top of all that, the writer or writers, for I have forgotten who was the final writer, took out key scenes. Not once does the audience find out why Hannibal eats people; they had him, Hannibal, HIT Clarice. Never, in a million years, would Hannibal Lector hurt in any way the one thing in the world he truly cared for. Then, for those with weak stomachs, BABIES, do not see it, for someone gets eaten. What a surprise in a movie about Hannibal Lector. Anyway, see the movie so it gets sales, but do not expect to like it much if you have read the book. Otherwise, enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd recommend","review":"First of all, don't expect a good sequel. This movie is nothing like \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". The original was a very suspenseful psychological thriller, the duration of which you spent on the edge of your seat. This movie is average in the thriller-like category respect. As a matter of fact, everything about it is average, which might have gotten it 4 stars. However, the character of Hannibal is not the same person we met in the first movie. He's different, less interesting and original, more like a common criminal. So, we're down to three stars. However, the ending is Horrible. I can't emphasize it enough. It's sickening and disturbing. It's also gratuitous. I like horror movies, I've watched many films both physically and psychologically disturbing. But this went beyond it and seemed to have no point. Thus, I end up with a 2-point rating. Too bad, \\"Silence\\" could have had such a good sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing...and I blame David Mamet.","review":"I've read Hannibal 3 times now - it's one of the best books I've read in AGES, and to see the screenplay butchered the way Mamet has butchered this, is just so horrible. I was looking forward to seeing this movie for so long, after having enjoyed the book so much. What a disappointment. The characters (the ones they didn't omit, and ESPECIALLY Hannibal himself) are flat & poorly developed. The storyline has been sped up & hacked to bits to accommodate the Hollywood standard of a 2 hour film.To be fair, I believe Ridley Scott should share some of the blame for this film's shortcomings. All done & said, this film was really poorly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal","review":"Granted I'm tired with the phrase the book was better. However, in this case the movie did a grave injustice to the character Clarice. What happened to her in the book was the best surprise ending I have read or seen in a long time and the movie made sure to change it and ruin the spirit of the novel; in order to ensure that sequels will follow. But what else should we expect from Dino De Laurentis. Ridley Scott was shown up in the Alien series and he dropped the ball again here too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Sequel","review":"Waring, do not expect this movie to have the same deep impact that Silence of the Lambs had on its viewers. This movie will not make any top 100 list or win any awards. What it is, is another generic thriller just like a Kiss The Girls, or Along Came a Spider. It has an FBI Agent hunting down a wanted Serial Killer who does \\"really Bad things.\\" If this movie had nothing to do with Silence of the Lambs, then no one would have gone to see it and word of mouth would have caused the movie to be pulled out of the theaters within a few weeks. If you want a gross out killer movie with a deeper plot, check out American Psycho, which is much better than this one.....D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black comedy at it's best","review":"When I watched it in the theater I heard comments like \\"it was too gross\\" \\"this wasn't scary\\". Of course it's gross. It's about a cannibalistic serial kill that is on the loose. The lambs have been silenced and not it's Dr. Lecter's turn to have the fun. Just listen to his lines. It's a great, gross-out comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"I just bought the DVD this morning and it's wonderful , it's packed with extras and neat little options,Regardless of what some may say about Hannibal it's the perfect movie about the Cannibal with culture and style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"I just bought the Dvd this morning and it's wonderful,it's packed with extras and neat little options,Regardless of what some may say about Hannibal it's the perfect movie about the Cannibal with culture and style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype Rules...and fools","review":"I am not going to compare this film to either of the others that have gone before because that would be the wrong thing to do. Taking it as a stand alone film, in which the principal player is one of the most sinister characters in movie murder history, it was just very poor. There was nothing particularly wrong with the acting, the sets, the direction or any aspect of production really, it was just a bad story. With the potential of weaving a superb tale around Hopkins excellent character, it instead turned into a total wasted oppotunity. I had actually read the book beforehand and thought that the story was poor. Unfortunatly, poor books translate into even poorer films. Don't beleive the hype, see it before you buy it. It is very likely you will save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal should eat this movie","review":"But it would probably give him indigestion.

Scene transitions are poorly developed. It is gross simply for the sake of being gross. Anthony Hopkins was true to the \\"Hannibal\\" form but, Julianne Moore as Agent Starling was no Jodie Foster. She looked the part but no other personality traits carried over. Casting would have been improved had Ms Moore played a different agent. Finally, the movie was fairly well photographed and the DTS 5.1 sound was OK. But, overall, the film alternates between being sick and sicker. No wonder it was a box office flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly Bad","review":"This is surely one of the worst wastes of talent ever served up by Hollywood. Ridley Scott shoots some pretty scenes. Julianne Moore is beautiful, as always. Hopkins is game. Unfortunately, their efforts don't add up to anything. Blame the writer. I've read Hannibal (I'm ashamed to admit it), and If there had been any oversized wild pigs around, I would have fed it to them gladly after turning the last page. Pretentious dreck.

By the time it reaches the final \\"dinner party\\" scene (I'll spare the details), it's not so much gross as it is ridiculous. Julianne Moore is very good given the thankless task of filling Jodie Foster's shoes as Clarice Starling, but Sir Anthony Hopkins becomes a parody of himself as the titular Hannibal Lecter. It's not his fault, mind you. Thomas Harris and Ridley Scott just forgot that what made Hannibal the Cannibal so menacing was not seeing what he did so much as imagining what he could do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, Disturbing, Pointless","review":"This movie contains the most disturbing scene I've ever seen on film.

It misses the uniquely gripping feel of \\"Lambs\\" and devolves into scenes of fright and terror meant to shock and revulse in the worst, gratutious way. Hopkins' performance seems thinner in some spots but almost a caricature of his Oscar-winning performance in others. Moore holds her own, but I think the film suffers from the producers' presupposition that no matter what they put on screen would benefit from the critical and popular acclaim afforded the first film.

It is nothing but a vulgar little slasher movie. The beautiful Italian setting and the music are cynical, calculated but, ultimately, failed attempts to add a veneer of depth and sophistication. Hopkins hams his way through the appalling script and Moore's constantly impassive facial expressions suggest that she was slipped an overdose of botox. The shock-horror elements of the \\"story\\" are crass in the extreme. The thrilling suspense of the first film has been replaced by make-'em-barf excess. One disturbing facet of this film is the sneakily unspoken suggestion that, at the back of it all, we should somehow be cheering Lecter on as he eats the brains of Ray Liotta's boorish character.This movie has absolutely nothing to recommend it.

Anthony Hopkins is again a convincing Hannibal Lecter but Julliane Moore plays an uninteresting, bland Clarice Starling that shows little sparkle. There are some genuine moments of tension and suspense to find here, though as a whole it\`s too flawed and not very captivating. The baroque feel is an edgy and well-accomplished idea, creating some tension, darkness and weirdness that unfortunately don\`t work very well in the end.

If you have a weak stomach, don't watch this movie.

Scott does a decent job adapting the screenplay from Harris's novel (initially titled Morbidity of the Soul). What inclined Harris to write such a grotesque ending? I'm glad Jodie Foster turned down the role. I'm also glad I rented this film instead of buying it. Hannibal has the most over-the-top sick ending I've ever seen in a film/novel.

The movie was interesting, but, only half of the gore seemed to work. The last gory scene, where the brain is shown, sent me detouring from the story to what were the filmakers thinking???? NO GORE SHOULD SEND YOUR MIND AWAY FROM A MOVIE, BUT SHOULD BE USED TO SEND YOU DEEPER INTO IT. Gore is a tool, which is abused in Hannibal. The savers of this movie were the actors. The script wasen't very bad, but would have been scarier with less gore. Also, it wouldn't have been hard to put in a little more thought. The 2 disc set though is deeply satisifyng for special features with multiangle features and tons of trailers and posters and making of features.

This movie just isn't dark enough. It has the requisite gratuitous violence, but not the creepiness.Silence of the Lambs made me feel uncomfortable. It was eerie and dark throughout; the movie had a sombre tone. That tone is missing in Hannibal. Dr. Lecter seems to have lost some of his pizazz in this movie.It could have been better, soooo much better, but it isn't. Rent this movie, don't buy it. It is worth watching if you've seen Silence of the Lambs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannibal stomache is STILL growling!!","review":"Dr. Lector has the need for flesh!

They are basically running with just one thing, which is best represented by the song \\"Fighting For\\", a sort of 80's rock pop with attitude song that's really just \\"OK\\", not great.You'll find listening to the other songs that they pretty much go right down that road, but that they lack even the mid level quality of songwriting that \\"Fighting For\\" has, leaving you feeling like you've been listening to a high school group, especially in the lyrics. Many of the songs are even in the same keys, making the CD kinda drone along without any dynamics from song to song.....I was pretty disappointed, but from what I hear these guys are really a LIVE band more than anything, so seeing them live might be a lot more fun than wading through this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"ego check at the door","review":"a friend of mine is a bartender at a dance hall in texas, the lead singer of Cross Canadian Ragweed ordered a beer from him and acted like he didn't have to pay, when my friend inquired about getting the beer money, the guy replied \\"Do you know who I am?\\" My friend, said \\"No\\".

This album blurs the lines between the blues, country, and rock even more so then their previous CDs. The stand out track is \\"Final Curtain\\" a song about still standing with the woman he loves even after everything else he knows has fallen apart. So many bands today don't have the talent this band has on their worst songs, let alone on their best tracks. The only badnote on the album is track #10, a cover of George Thurogood's \\"Who Do You Love.\\" Not that it's a bad cover because it isn't, it just wasn't a good song to begin with. Another great song is Dimebag, CCR's ode to the late, great Dimebag Darryl of Pantera fame, but it also laments the loss of another great musician, Kurt Cobain. All in all, any true music fan will want this cd to round out their collection of great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"back to slang","review":"what a dissapointment.Iwas reallywaiting for this cd but when i heard it its a shame.Iwas waiting for another euforia at least but all i got was those silly songs about love and love whats wrong with these guys? im seconds thoughts Slang is much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Def Leppard-Lite","review":"I am and have been a big Def Leppard fan.

They've gone adult-contemporary. This sounds like an album my mother would like. They were headed in the right direction with Euphoria, which wasn't very consistent, and was by no means the next Pyromania, but at least it contained a handful of good rockin' tunes.

There is not one cache song on the whole album. You can't sing along with any of the of choruses. These songs would be horrible live. X reminds me of Slang. Def Leppard has this new idea where they feel they have to change their style. Joe Elliot has criticized AC/DC for never changing their style. Yet AC/DC now has a bigger fan base then Def Leppard and gets 5 times more air play on the radio. Def Leppard should try sticking to what their good at.

Just knowing that they're putting out music has been reason enough to buy whatever they release. But when I listened to this album (multiple times, just to see if it would grow on me), not a single track stood out. It still sounds like them, but their attitude seems like \\"Let's get back on Top 40 radio\\" instead of rock stations. Even then, most of these songs, if any, wouldn't even make the cut on a top 40 station. They said that Aerosmith's latest - \\"Just Push Play\\" - was an inspiration, and that album wasn't very good! I'm still a fan, though. After all, 9 other great albums says a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average release","review":"Well its 2002 are the Leps back in our face?? not exactly there are 13 songs on this release and most sound either like ballads or are very popish sounding. While Joe's voice is in peak condition I can't say the same about the rest of the guys they sound too much like a lounge act now. Thee is in fact a couple stand out tracks Now Gravity and scar. This was only a halfway decent release from these guys. While I wish it were still 1987 or 1983 for that matter I'm glad these guys moved forward with their sound. I am a DIE HARD fan of the early stuff which is their overall best output of music but change isn't all bad. I'm glad I only listened to samples BUT I may buy it used I wouldn't pay full whack for it. (the same can be said of slang from 1996 I did not buy that one either but I might used of course).

Def leppard have clearly evolved on music terms and i dont seee any reason why def leppard are \\"going against there fans\\" with songs like NOW and the beautiful long long way to go makes this album worth hearing.

For those who like their harder sound you probably won't care too much for this CD. For those who like their softer stuff this one is for you. Personally I'm in between. I think X could have had a couple of more harder songs, but I do like some of the softer ones on the CD. The first single \\"Now\\" is very good except for the chorus.\\"Everyday\\" and \\"Long Long Way to Go\\" are 2 slower songs that are very good \\"Four Letter Word\\" is my favorite though. It is a more traditional sounding Def Leppard hard rocker. All in all X is a pretty solid CD. It's no Pyromania or Hysteria but I do like it better than Slang and Euphoria."},{"rating":"2","title":"X marks the spot for DL of 21st Century","review":"I bought the album yesterday and have been most impressed with it.

They did a most excellent job of sticking to their \\"roots\\" while updating a bit to appeal to a broader audience.

A wonderful testament to what Rock and Roll should always be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better...","review":"I'm rather disapointed with this album.

The only song that STARTS to rock dies as soon as it reaches the chorus. 4 letter word? K-I-S-S? Come ON! That is so L-A-M-E. This album never takes off. It leaves you wondering what happened to the band. I guess they're trying to get in on the quick and snappy sweet world of boy band music. And what about all the songs about LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE?

I ran through the songs looking for somthing to grab me and sadly nothing did. If your into ballads this is for you. If your into rock, this is way off mark. I guess Brittany Spears producer helped with this album, if that is not an indicator? Anyway, Def Leppard sounded tired and slow on there album. Needless to say they are not Aerosmith by any sense.

Get smart Leppard, do as Poison, Vince Neil and the others who have come back to entertain us have done and focus on the past. These ballads worked when there was one or two on a CD. Now that's all we hear anymore. True fans of early Leppard need to hear something like Photograph, High and Dry, or Pour Some Sugar On Me, so that we know you can still rock. Otherwise change the band name because this isn't Def Leppard, and for those of you that think this band or any other band need should change to reflect the times, guess again.

Garbage.I can't compare it to any other sound. It doesn't sound like Leppard, either the hard-rocking days or the post-one-armed drummer days. I can hear several influences on the album, though. There are hints of NSYNC, Tommy Lee, Linkin Park, Chicago, Air Supply, Journey, and many other older poser chick rock bands and several more modern day teen pop rock bands. It is obvious that Def Leppard are now trying to \\"change with the times.\\" It's apparent they are trying to blend with all the modern day shallow, one sound, no-talent teenie pop rock idiots.

The band has evolved with the times, and I have grown along with them. The ballads \\"long long way to go\\", and \\"let me be the one\\" are among the best they've ever recorded.

And I listen to samples of this cd and I think it [is not good]. It sounds nothing like the music that made them as big as they are today. In my opinion it has more of a Dave Matthews Band sound to it than past cds like Histeria. If they want to win over fans(and me) then on your next album make it sound like Pyromania or Histeria or even Adrenalize. If you don't then I and probably a lot of other people won't buy any more of your cds and will just reflect back on a once great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Have Been Between Pyromania and Hysteria","review":"Def Leppard's tenth studio album having catchy 80s power pop vibe is a nice album if you are a fan of the genre. It is surprisingly mellower extension of the last album, Euphoria.I had expected more hard-edged sound but I may have to wait that from the next one.Grumbling aside, it really have excellently catchy songs and you will be sure to love it if you love Def Leppard in the same manner as Survivor, Billy Joel, Aerosmith, Cheap Trick, and Electric Light Orchestra. But my best pick is not on those catchy gems such as YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, UNBELIEVABLE, LONG LONG WAY TO GO, EVERYDAY but CRY, and SCAR.Best fit for mid 80's power pop fans but if you are looking for hard-edged DEF LEPPARD maybe you can skip this and wait for a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leppard Light","review":"Coming into this album Joe Elliot said that Def Leppard would be trying to take a cue from bands like Aerosmith. And while not similar in sound this influence is evident. Leppard has toned it down. X delievers less guitar solos and high pitch harmonies and gives the listener more pop songs. This could be a bad thing as we all crave flashbacks to the days of Pyromania and Hysteria, however Leppard does pop very well. Some of thier more pop track such as \\"You're So Beautiful\\" and \\"Everday\\" come together nicely and tracks like their lead single \\"Now\\", \\"Torn To Shreds\\" and \\"Scar\\" show shades of classic Leppard rock tracks. All in all a solid effort. The group's 10th studio album shows that they still can play with the best of them and this album surpasses most other recent offerings in the pop rock genre. Albums like X show that Leppard has the ability trescend their era and move into the ranks of other ageless wonders like Aerosmith and the Stones. A good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"X-def leppard","review":"Hello! Wake up, def leppard ! I have been your loyal fan since \\" On through the night.\\" I have always loved your works until this X- thing which sounds very soft and spongy to me. I mean having pop metal/rock sound is great, but this whole X-album sounds like backstreet boys mixed with Britney Spear to me. And sorry I hate backstreet boys to the bone ! ... For this album, the only thing that sounds like def leppard is the chorus part which is the only great part about this album. Changes are great like what you, guys did in Slang. Again changes are great as long as the soul remains the same. By the way, I think the band photo on the inside with Band members, jumping high on the air looks kinda perverted to me. But I will keep on following your next album. If it still sounds Britney Spear-ish like this X-thing, I guess I have to quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album pains me","review":"A DL fan of old, I was at their concert the weekend Pour Some Sugar On Me hit #1, and Joe turned 30. Ah, the good old days. Steve Clark's death several years ago had a bigger impact on this band than anyone realized at the time. Have you liked an album of theirs since he died? Yes, Retroactive, but that doesn't count because he wrote/recorded music for that. Sadly, this album- like the others- falls short. There's a lot of airplay for \\"Now\\" and I had high hopes. Maybe, just maybe....If you're on the fence about whether to buy, remember they're not a heavy metal/hard rock band anymore. Like them for who they are now, not for who they were. Music reminds me of Adrenalize, the last DL album I bought. Dear God, is Joe rapping in \\"Gravity\\"?I like \\"Love Don't Lie\\", \\"Now\\", and \\"Scar\\". Old fans probably will too. Reminds me of what they used to be... but give me Pyromania any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Four Letter Word is somewhat vintage Def pop but the rest sounds like Def Leopard playing fake garbage like camp rock.

They even play with Taylor Swift these days, Def Leppard the original shat out manufactured crap rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album since Hysteria","review":"I really don't understand the negative reviews that some people have written. I was afraid that I would buy X, put it in my CD player and would hear Adrennalize and Euphoria again.(two albums that were good but were obvious attempts to copy Hysteria).What I got was a refreshing Leppard album. Some call this album mellow. I am a huge fan of Creed, Goo Goo Dolls and Matchbox 20 as well, and I think they have adapted well with the times and captured the sounds of today.If you are looking for a band that is living in the past, afraid to change with the times then look elsewhere. What you get here is a great rock album inline with the top rock groups around today.THIS IS AN EXCELLENT ALBUM WE LEPPARD FANS OF THE 80'S CAN ENJOY WITH NEW LEPPARD FANS OF TODAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"screw Def Leppard","review":"The only band in the world who can mix 80's cheesewith the talentless 90's I'm sick of Def Leppardand their armless drummer, I hope they all lose a couplelimbs.

Nothing on this disc rocks at all, its just a collection of cheesy, third rate power ballads that don't compare to classics like \\"Love Bites\\" or \\"Bringin on the Heartbreak.\\" This disc has none of the edgy, headbanging intensity found on \\"Pyromania,\\" \\"Hysteria\\" or 1999's \\"Euphoria,\\" and the only really good track is the opener \\"Now.\\" It seems the rocking, melodic metal band that was once Def Leppard has finally traded in their rock n roll for AM radio shlock. Don't buy this album, instead go back to the classics and rediscover how good Def Leppard used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"Perhaps the worst studio album Def Leppard recorded. I listened to the disc 1 and traded the cd in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing to say the least","review":"Def Leppard really lost it with this CD. Unlike Euphoria, which had a few good songs, X only has about 3 or 4 songs actually worth listening to. This is not the Def Leppard we are all used to. Most of the songs on this album have the same feeling and are very mellow and weak (not to mention a little familiar at times). If you are a casual Def Leppard fan you should stay away from this CD. However, if you are a fan who needs to have all the albums, buy it and stash it away someplace where you never have to listen to it again. I am very disappointed with this album. It gets 2 stars for the four songs that are actually good. Hope this is it from them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME???????!!!!!!!!!","review":"Im not even going to waste my time typing out a long message about this awful album....All i'm going to say is i'm a very open minded person when it comes to music, but my god this album is beyond awful and a discrace to the def leppard legacy!!!! Stay clear of this album if you are a true rock/metal/def leppard fan!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not their best.","review":"As a long time fan of Def Leppard (since 1982) I must say that I'm very disappointed in this album. First of all it sounds way too poppy. Britney Spears could've recorded this and there wouldn't be much difference. Secondly some of the songs are written by the same people that wrote hits for Britney Spears and N'SYNC. So what does that tell you about this album. When Def Leppard writes their own and produces their own album it rocks. Clearly their best days are besides them but that doesn't mean they have to suck either. Sorry guys but this is one bad album. There are a few bright spots but otherwise it sucks. Even Slang was better, and that's a stretch. Try finding \\"Mutt\\" Lange and produce some better material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably Def Leppard","review":"On first listen to this CD, I thought it was pretty good. Once you listen to this CD at least twice, you will find it to be your favorite. It has a nice mix of what I call \\"not being able to sit down\\" songs to awesome ballads. If you are in any way depressed, give this a go \\"Four Letter Word\\" and you will be feeling great. I just hope that I can get the chance to see Def Leppard in concert, they are just unbelievably great."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're back, finally","review":"Though I had some misgivings that the band for the first time recorded a couple of songs they did not have a hand in writing, I find this album to be a lot of fun and it sounds current, rather than microwaved 80's self-imitation that plagued Euphoria and Adrenalize. This album is full of catchy songs and may be a little poppy for many longtime fans but the grooves are infectious and you can feel they had fun with this record. Standouts are Now, Unbelievable, Long Long Way to Go (this ballad could be a breakout hit like Aerosmith's Don't Wanna Miss a Thing), Torn to Shreds and Love Don't Lie. With the promotion they are doing and with the quality of this album, this may finally be their comeback. Lep rules. Always have, always will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid: Def Leppard Maturing With Their Fans","review":"This album is a polished and thoroughly enjoyable outing from the best thing (Liz Hurley and Catherine Zeta-Jones aside) to ever come from Britain's entertainment scene. The album *won't* rock your socks off - this is basically a relaxing and smooth release that helps you to mellow out, rather than rock out. Hey - Def Leppard's done plenty of rocking. This album doubles their number of great ballads, while adding a slick twist with relaxing, yet upbeat, pop/rock tunes.If you're looking to headbang, sorry - you won't find the next 'Pour Some Sugar On Me' here. If you want some Def Leppard just having fun, with catchy melodies (that's melodies, not rockers per se) and a great sound, this is a solid listen. Better than Euphoria, in my opinion - sounds more polished and not quite as broad in musical styles. They have a definite over-arcing melodic, softer side on this disc - and I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT AS HEAVY, BUT STILL ENJOYABLE SONGS","review":"I'm sorry, I like this album! I know alot of Lep fans are let down by it, but I like it. Yeah, they've gone softer, but it's not as bad as Britny Spears or N'Sync like so many people are carrying on about here! Besides, Def Leppard writes the best ballads on the planet, they always have! And on top of that, there are a few heavy songs on this album not to be looked over, listen to it and judge for yourself. It's a great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lep is back!","review":"Def Leppard's back - and as good as ever! All the critics I've seen hated this album mainly because it wasn't Hysteria. Well, Hysteria's well over 10 years old and the world, not to mention the band, has changed. This is a great rock album - it's not metal, it's not pop, it's rock! The songs are all good and everyone has their favorites and misses. And, hey, no one does a power ballad like Def Leppard. Keep up the good work guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best since Hysteria","review":"This is a very solid album. I've been a Leppard fan from the beginning, and I rate this album right behind Pyromania and Hysteria. The album is very pop oriented, but personally, I don't want to see them trying to produce Pyromania all over again. Songs are some of the best-written Leppard songs I've heard and all have great replay value. Standouts to me are You're so beautiful, which reminds me alot of Animal, Everyday which reminds me of a mid-tempo Hysteria, Long Long Way to Go which is a classic Leppard ballad and Scar which has classic Leppard riffs and chorus. Also really enjoy Gravity, which kinda has a Slang or 21st Century Sha La Girl feel to it. However, all the other songs are very solid also. If you've been a Leppard fan, you'll enjoy the album. If your looking for heavier stuff similar to Pyromania or High'N-Dry, then don't bother with this ablum."},{"rating":"2","title":"25 YEARS AND STILL GETTING BETTER!!","review":"This is one of Def Leppard's best albums ever. \\"X\\" is a cross between the huge harmonies, the catchy melodies, and pop-worthiness, of \\"Hysteria\\" and the \\"I don't care what anyone thinks, I'll play my music the way I like it!\\" attitude of \\"Slang\\".

Nothing really rocks on here at all. This is nearly all sappy radio ballad stuff. If I wanted widdley-woo (and sometimes I do), I would have pulled out my Enya CDs. I don't need Def Leppard to do that for me. I wanted to rock, but it just didn't happen with this one. After a second listen, I still couldn't find anything I liked about it.

They were in their heyday in the eighties and made some great rock music back then. However, it seems like ever since Steve Clark died, they've never been the same. On this album they sound more like the Backstreet boys than Def Leppard. It's almost like they forgot who they were. What happened to the huge choruses, screaming back vocals and loud arena anthems? They sounded great in the eighties, but now, they've lost the edge. What happened guys?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my God...","review":"This is not the Def Leppard I know and love.

DEF LEPPARD, either give each other a swift kick in the ass, or simply turn off the mic, roll over dead, and give me some AC/DC and Ozzy --- just about the only known survivors of guitar-based 80s hard rock, heavy metal, or whatever we called it back then.

'X' shows alot of maturity by Def Leppard, both in song writing & style. Those of us that have been fans since the early 80's are older now, and so is the band! I really like the fact that this album shows a new, more mature sound, but still rocks! \\"Torn to Shreds\\" is reminiscent of the old sound, as is 'Now'.

I know, I know, I know - they shouldn't be stuck in the past rehashing the same riffs, but given that we are in 2002, you'd think that rock would sound alot more modern and futuristic; instead, nearly every current rock band rehashes tired sounds from the '60s and '70s (why don't bands copy sounds from the '80s? In a strange way, most music from that decade sounds alot more futuristic and forward-looking than most current music) Anyway, I hate to knock a band that was a big fan of for 15 years, but this CD nearly killed my interest in them.But hopefully they'll rebound from this album like they rebounded from SLANG when they released EUPHORIA..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hair Metal Fan","review":"This Album does not hold a candle to the earlier Def Lepp albums Pyromania and Hysteria, nor does it even reach the level of Euphoria or Retroactive.

The Swiss are not known for great works of art or music or for educational accomplishments outside the fields of medicine and biochemistry/pharmacology or for feminism or even sensitivity to women, and so a book by an American author that pokes fun at these deficiencies serves only to aggravate its subjects' phobias.

A fascinating compilations for early sight and sound of young Coltrane's talent. Above all, 'Spring is here' is to become another of Coltrane's favorite standards.

Unfortunately, what is being sold is a great disappointment. The Kindle edition is the result of scanning the original book using character recognition software to convert the scan into digitized text. A responsible publisher would follow up the automated scan with a careful editing of the result to remove the inevitable errors. The correction process for this edition was (to be generous)grossly inadequate. The English text is full of errors -- mildly annoying. The equations, however, are often indecipherable or nearly so -- unforgivable! If you are interested in the details of Boole's mathematics, you are in for a lot of work -- work that should have been done by the publisher. If you are willing to ignore the mathematical details and merely want to skim the gist of Boole's arguments, a purchase might be worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucid reading","review":"Descartes made a revolutionary move when he symbolized geometry with algebra and used the methods of algebra to solve geometrical problems. For example, he defined a line with y=mx+b. Similarly, Boole made a revolutionary move here when he symbolized logic with algebra and used the methods of algebra to solve logical problems. That is the whole gist of this book.

She is a 35 lb mix who loves 'stuffed animals' and has several. She 'plays' with her animals - fetches them, carries them around, cuddles up with them, squeezes them to make them squeak. She does not chew them up or pull them apart.But this rabbit fell apart immediately. she pulled out the seam and the stuffing before we even sat down to christmas dinner. My sister-in-law sewed it back up, and all was well, but the squeaker (which sounds more like a duck call than anything) stopped working within a couple of weeks.So - in the end, my assessment is that, especially for the price, this is a very poor quality item.

While JSL has excellent explanations of Japanese grammar, the entire book is printed in romaji, it has vocabulary that is no longer in use, and the order in which the book teaches words is ridiculous. Furthermore, the romaji itself is a system used only by JSL. If you are lucky enough to get a teacher who understands how to teach from JSL and a small enough class it can be a great book, but it is not for self-study and it needs to be phased out of college classes and favor of something more up to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chemistry Professor At It Again","review":"How to resolve the twin conflicts this third book of the series presents? While on one hand it is chock-full of appropriate and useful information for intermediate students of the Japanese language (as are the other two volumes in the series), its explanation of the intricacies of the language read like passages from a third-year collegiate chemistry text. Buyer beware-- there are better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior conclusion of 3-volume text series.","review":"J.S.L.III, like the preceding two volumes, is designed for learners seeking a thorough foundation in the culturally-appropriate use of Japanese by foreigners (i.e., non-native Japanese) in Japan.

Hundreds of coral species are listed, including: sea fans, hard corals, soft corals, and mushroom corals. The book also explains the many diseases that possibly afflict many species. The coral entries have excellent, detailed explanations beside them, concerning species depth, range, and abundance. The photograph transfers are above average, showing enough of the coral for identification purposes. The photographs are of course very beautiful, containing various, colorful hues of these animals. Buy the waterproof, annotated version of Reef Coral ID to bring along in the ocean on a scuba diving trip. The book has been updated twice since it was published, with the original print still floating around here on Amazon.com.

I work in the Ohio prison system and the insight to a riot this book provides should be required reading for all who work in this profession. Mr. Dotson's strength of character and faith enabled him to not only survive this ordeal, but provide a role model to the other hostages. The book is somewhat critical of the Central Office response to the riot, and at times deservedly so, although I should add that being with the department I have seen first hand the growth and improvement from this terrible event. I would wholeheartedly endorse this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Centennial Histroy of the Carnegie Institution","review":"I received my copy of this book in fine condition and very promptly.

I then listened to this CD while exploring Indian Ruins in Arizona and continue to keep the CD in one of the 5 slots in my car.I have a lot of nervous energy and went to Arizona to take landscape pictures and relax.

She was truly blessed with a magnificent gift of voice. Her music is timeless, & ageless. It appeals to a diverse group of listeners. This is a \\"must have\\" to add to your collection or the perfect CD to start you on the magical journey of appreciating this gifted artist. The sad part for us is that she is in heaven singing in God's choir and can no longer share more music. Her voice reaches deep inside and stirs your emotions & you can feel it when you listen to her sing. Give yourself a gift.....buy one of her CD's. I promise you, it probably won't be your last!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomparable Voice!","review":"Eva Cassidy's voice went through me to touch my soul. When my parent's played her CD's for me, the beauty of her voice made me ache inside. When I was told that she died at the age of 33 I wanted to rage at heaven for taking her from us too soon. Eva Cassidy was truly blessed with a voice that sends you with every note, with a range that is limitless (jazz, blues, rock, gospel....). Every song that she sang she made her own. I recommend ANY or Eva's CD's to EVERYONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing voice who signs folk, blues, and jazz","review":"Eva's life was cut way to short she would have been one of the greats.

Things then slow down for \\"stormy monday\\" before slowly picking up again for the great rendition of \\"Blue Skies\\".This album is the only way to truly appreciate \\"Fields of Gold\\" as it was edited for its inclusion on \\"Singbird\\". I have to say I prefer the version on LIVE.If you were to buy this album, then \\"The Other Side\\" then \\"Eva By Heart\\", you would really have the essential Eva CD collection.

They start with polite clapping and by the 3rd tune they are screaming, whistling, and probably dancing on the tables.Knowing she passed away not too long ago, I sit and listen to \\"Tall Trees in Georgia\\" and \\"Fields of Gold\\", and sit there, a grown man, crying with emotion!

But, hoping she is singing in Heaven with all the other Blues Singers. So will see her someday.. When I got it, I laid on the floor, nobody home, and closed my eyes and let her sweet voice melt into my soul. Her voice brings peace to one. I will purchase all of her CD'S and as I listen I will remember a couragious woman with such a beautiful voice.

But this Eva Cassidy Live is easily the best of all her albums, including the compilation one - Songbird. It is so full of expressive energy.

I think I've seen every film Bernard Shakey has made and this has got to be the WORST. I was so disapointed with this video that I wanted to find Neil's address and send it to him personally and demand my money back. Don't waste your money on this one, there are no insights here, and the selections of tunes are uninspired at best. It's almost as though Young and Crazy wanted to make this as crappy as possible.

I can only assume they are full time academics: no other explanation can be offered for their myopia.The book is admirably done, and the freeish rendering of Chinese mythological names is fine. The difficulty is that this is nothing but an extended catalogue, without stories or plot. It's a list. The descriptions are so unbelievably wierd that it's much fun to read for a page or two, but it's all so much the same, that after two paragraphs you've read it all. To call this a major source for Chinese mythology is simply untrue. Those interested in that subject should get a copy of The Journey to the West, or Chuang Tzu, or the stories of Pu Song Ling.

As he always says, he doesn't consider himself a guitarist, but a \\"musician who just composes for guitar most of the time.\\" As it turns out, he has stayed true to his word, and his newest album contains some styles not covered in any of his previous works, namely electronic. In the 3 of 12 songs on the album containing electronic beats and sampling, the electronics only serve to enhance Don's tight rythms and never-off groove that is the base for all his music. Although Robot Monster, in my opinion, does not top Don's earlier effort,(and my favorite of his) Loaded.Leather.Moonroof, it is still a remarkable album, if not only for his adventure into a musical genre rarely paired with finger style guitar.

It's unreasonable to assuming that you're going to walk around like Frankenstein keeping baby from falling.

His stumble caused one of the fabric straps on the Walking Wings to rip totally off - a clean break at the seam. Our son immediately fell to the ground. Luckily, the fall was not hard, as the other strap remained in place. However, other babies may not be so lucky. We had this product a total of 3 minutes before it broke and put our son in harms way.

After I placed my son in the Walking Wings, he had the inclination to lean/fall forward. My attempts to encourage him to walk forward resulted in him crying in pain on the floor, most likely due to the Walking Wings hiking up on his armpit area and hurting his arms. Only after discarding my Walking Wings and teaching my son how to walk \\"the old fashioned way\\" did I find there was an alternative - The Juppy Baby Walker. Similar to Walking Wings, but with one important difference - full body support for your child!The Juppy Baby Walkeris also cheaper than Walking Wings.

This thing is really not needed for the typical kid, given the length of time it takes to go from walking with help to walking solo... but for a special needs kid who may be stuck in that phase for a long time like our daughter I thought I'd give it a try. It really was just not helpful. The support it gave her on the mid section was just not enough and once it became enough it wasn't needed at all.

Before anyone criticisizes this idea think for a minute about kids that have difficulty learning to walk. My son has hypermobility in his ankles, knees and hips so after a few steps on his own he stumbles and falls. As he practices walking while I hold this not only am I relieving strain from my back while I help him, but also there to help him when he stumbles.this is well made, and he doesn't seem uncomfortable in it.I normally would not have thought to try this, but that was before I had a child that struggled to walk.

I can't guarantee that she's going to learn to walk faster than she would have without the item, but I do know that till she *is* able to walk on her own (as she so desperately wants to do) this will keep her happy and feeling much more independent.I just love that I can stop bending over so much and I'm not so worried even when she's \\"cruising\\" at the coffee table/end table since I have the straps to keep her from falling.In my opinion the product seems to be made very well--doesn't seem to be cheaply thrown together."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what i was looking for!","review":"My 9 mo old has been walking around furniture for months and has been able to stand on his own when distracted. he was terrified to let go. this has given him the confidence he needs to start walking on his own. he has a very small body frame and we have had no problems with it fitting. After the very first time using it he was more willing to stand on his own and actually took his first step on his own. i read lots of reviews of people expecting their 6 mo old to start walking. their balance is not developed enough for those kind of expectations. this has been a great product and i recommend it for anyone in a similar situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Loves Her Walking Wings!","review":"Our granddaughter LOVES her walking wings and it has saved grandma and granpa's backs. This is fun and oh-so-helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for your back!","review":"This is so great for that in between time when all they want to do is walk holding on to your fingers, but your back hurts to bend over for so long. I would have given it 5 stars, but it would be nice if there was a bit more support for the chin/neck/shoulder area - my niece LOVED it and was so happy to have her hands free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Them","review":"Great product - Baby started wearing them at about 6.5 months (strong baby already pulling up and able to support own weight for several minutes, she was ~15lbs and 26\\" - I tried the older version on at my sister's house and the baby loved them so we ordered her a pair of her own wings. She's the baby at the beach (at 7 months) loving her wings. She is now 8 months and starting to walk on her own. When we are outside on hard surfaces or pushing the Oompa Wagon she wears the wings as back-up, that way if she stumbles on the asphalt she won't take out her cute face. :) My back was taking a beating before we started using the Walking Wings - now - no problem. Highly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but BIG flaw","review":"My dad bought this for my 9 month old son who loves to be on his feet and walk or chase around a soccer ball but since so young has very little balance even though he is really strong. After an afternoon of babsitting my dad's back was killing him so he thought this product would be great. My son loved the freedom he got from it and quite literally took off in it, but the problem is that bc it's not secure around the torso it can ride up under the armpits. Once I saw his arms turning purple bc of the blood restriction this caused it went back in the box and was returned. I've ordered the Juppy baby walker which is basically looks like big unerwear with straps so it holds him better without the problems of a torso-only walker. Maybe this would work better with a more cautious walker or one with better balance, but if your kid is like mine and wants to go go go this is probably not the product for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for some... not for us!","review":"This is one of those products that can be terrific for some people and bad for others. My daughter didn't do well with it at all. It fit awkwardly, and she kept leaning and falling while using it, much more than without it. It got to the point where I felt that it was dangerous to keep trying, so I got rid of it. If you have any way of trying before buying, I'd suggest doing so-- maybe borrow one from a friend to see if your child takes to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Walking Wings","review":"If you're going to buy this for your child, get it early. My daughter was 14 months old when I ordered this. Between the time I placed the order and it arrived, she went from trying to walk to full on walking. When I tried to put the wings on her, she did not want anything to do with it. So... if your baby is close to walking on her/his own or already tottering, don't spend your money. Once they start walking, they don't want the assistance. The only use I have for it now is if we go to an outdoor park which can have some rough, hard ground (its winter) and it helps her navigate uneven ground without falling. Otherwise, I think its very well made and would definitely be of good use to help a baby learn to balance and walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"saves your back, supports the babe, everyone happy!","review":"if you adjust the straps to your height well, you shouldn't have any issues. supports the baby, and if you're on your toes (figuratively), if the baby slips, you'll catch him by holding him up. he'll spin a little, but par for the course. i love that he feels secure and can plow ahead comfortably without fear of really falling. hold on loosely to continue to teach him balance, and tighten up if he falls (don't hold him up while he walks or he won't learn how to balance himself). great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I had hoped.","review":"The idea of this product is fantastic, the product itself needs help.I was looking forward to using this, since I am so much taller than my daughter and I have a bad back. I was hoping it would save me from bending over too much while assisting her to walk. The product seemed to raise up on her and would end up under her chin. It would help if there was a strap or something that would go between the legs rather than just go around the torso. The design is a bit flawed. She is starting to walk on her own now and we never did get any use out of this product. Wasted money, at least it wasn't expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for outdoors","review":"Just received our Walking Wings and it is a really good idea.

The chapters are not divided into stages of the campaign. There is no explanation of why an operation was carried out, what the strategy was, or even which side had the upper hand. Instead, it's just 590 pages of tactics organized more or less by date. Can you imagine the US Civil War being described this way? The maps don't help either; they are from a stock source and don't show half of the locations mentioned in the text. I haven't memorized the geography of Tibet, help me out! Maybe Harclerode will get a chance to make another edition that addresses these problems, so his work won't have been wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bunch of Abbreviations","review":"Yes \\"A Bunch of Abbreviations\\" would be a more sussinct title .

Yes indeed, I challenge anyone to open this book on any random page and not find a new abbreviated organisation on that page. Or maybe ten. These organisations drop in and off like the wind; MCPL, DHA, FHGS, MPAJU MCP, MRLA, USAF, OPC, UPT,CCRAK,PFLOAG ETC. ETC. ETC. ETC.

The picture that is shown above clearly shows the name brand VIRGIN. I know the title says it wears a new name but once again I go back to the picture it doesn't say that.

The difference is that Weber draws detailed characters on all sides of an issue. His two short stories in this collection continue that tradition, as do his fellow authors. If I had a problem with any of these stories, it was with Green's tale of the Peeps and Manties. The details were overdone and the characterization, the thing I most love about Honor, is found in bits and pieces throughout the book. Still, I would recommend it to anyone wanting more background on Honor's universe. In fact, I would like to see more stories about Stephanie Harrington and Queen Adrienne."},{"rating":"2","title":"the short story \\"the hard way home\\" is excellent!","review":"This book has a number of short stories set in the Honor Harrington universe.

From the beginning of contact with humans through an early adventure with Honor Harrington and her treecat Nimitz, this book is sure to please just about everyone.

The production is awful, obviously. Olde Time Black Metal is an acquired taste, after all. Sounds kind of like a mix between early Slayer and early Burzum. This is not a beginner's black metal album. To get into it, I suggest starting with the song \\"The Sword of Death,\\" and going form there. The latter half of the album is better than the first half, though the whole thing is pretty good--if early black metal is your thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work wonders!","review":"Besides these pills smelling awful and having a horrid taste (to me anyway) they work great!

Chaisson's tone reads like that of a classic self-serving political memior, \`\`I was there. I saw everything. It's a shame that the fools didn't listen to me, because I alone knew what to do.'' In truth, Chaisson gets the details completely wrong in many places, fails to understand what people were really doing to save the mission, and represents a privileged vantage point that he in fact did not have. I have yet to meet anyone who had anything to do with the Hubble who considers this book to be a fair or accurate history. Chaisson's tone is vividly clear in the summary chapter in which he judges the profoundly successful 1993 repair mission to having fallen far short. There is a great history of the Hubble to be written, but this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The reader from Jerusalem is right","review":"The reader from Jerusalem who said that the translation must be from the original Arabic is right.

It is both melancholy and humorous. It is also filled with delightful memories of growing up in the 60's that truly reflect the perspective of the time and not our later, jaded, views of the past. Mr. Steinberg has a great literary talent for scene description and an excellent ear for voice. The feat of maintaining a consistent and engaging voice for Jeremy that conveys both innocence and wisdom is remarkable in itself, but even the more minor characters here have distinct and delightful voices of their own. Mr. Steinberg is a great and thoughtful writer. Donald J.

I'm a member of the \\"dead-father's club\\", and Steinberg's depiction of the thoughts, fears, and emotions that are experienced by grieving children is on target every time. I usually breeze through books, but read this one very slowly...deliberately...and carefully. Steinberg reminded me of the feelings I had as a child, and put them into words more beautifully than I could have ever expressed. Anyone who lost thier dad at a too early age needs to read this book.

All the reviews said they ran small which was fine for me because I'm only 4'11, about 110 pounds. The length was actually perfect for me (so if you're tall, forget it). The only thing that I didn't like about them was it was really tight around the pelvic area, which I thought was weird because of how small I am.

I found it!I am amazed at how much this book continues to reveal to me. It's the sort of book that you can pick up every day and learn something new. Alternatively, it can be used as a reference. Yes - it is aged, but still relevant and interesting in my view.It was written in the nineteenth century and contains the history of the craft, a cyclopaedia of Freemasonry and a dictionary of symbolic Masonry. This book is an incredible source of information and reveals the depth and breadth of this ancient craft.Some of the words are quaint but it is easy to follow and understand. I recommend it to all Freemasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Poetic, beautifully descriptive, engrossing, enthralling... and the best revenge story ever (you'll see toward the end).

I was told by multiple people that I just HAD to read it. I finally read it and am completely underwhelmed.More than anything, this book feels like it was written for the Lifetime Network crowd: people (primarily women) who have a morbid fascination with bad things happening to other people. The story had a chance to put a unique spin on an oft-told tale, but instead it was completely uninspired and felt like it should be sandwiched between a story about a woman who was attacked and wheelchair bound but still won a gold medal and a story about a woman who gets up the courage to finally leave her cheatin', beatin', drinkin' husband.Nothing about this story moved me one way or the other. I didn't feel hatred or love. I didn't cry or laugh. It was a complete waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough written substance to hold my attention","review":"This book was not half as good as I expected it to be. It starts out interesting (with pain and tragedy), but the next 4/5ths of the story is boring, dissected, and with poor character development. I kept reading, still hoping for some interesting descriptions, characters, or closure. I remained disappointed. The ending has one gem of interest, which I enjoyed, however, I would not recommend this book.I have now seen the movie, The Lovely Bones, and enjoyed that much more than the book.

When do I get my four hours back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but overrated","review":"I just finished this book and it took me 2 1/2 weeks (quite a long time for the page length). I, of course, read it because it seemed all of America was doing the same thing. The point of view was interesting, and the story of the grieving family kept my attention. However, for the most part I couldn't wrap myself around this one. Perhaps there were too many subplots and minor characters.Also my expectations may have been too high, but the book seemed to really slog along with really very little accomplished. Also, the \\"possession\\" and the icicle at the end were very anti-climatic.I think a movie of this book would be a real mistake (think Shipping News) but will probably be inevitable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid book","review":"Even the dullest teen would people heaven with more imagination than Susie. I picked up this book hoping it would be at least as good as her husband's recent novel, Carter Beats the Devil which was imaginative, and in places quite deft.When she's not forcing the language and imagery, Alice Sebold has got the characters acting on unexplained impulses which baffle and perturb the reader. It feels like it was written in a seminar course and that too many ideas were developed by the group, and then dropped by the writer who couldn't commit. The author's handling of dialogue was particularly clumsy.By the time Susie returns to Earth for a tryst with her sweetie the reader is incredulous at how lame the ending is shaping up to be. Save yourself the time and money and wait until the movie comes out. It will be a big hit with teenagers everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassed","review":"If an imaginitive response to loss is what you want, read Toni Morrison's Beloved. If a thoughtful response to loss is what you want, read Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried. O'Brien's entire book deals with this theme, but the last story, \\"The Lives of the Dead,\\" deals movingly with the death of a girl. Sebold's book is simply over-the-top, especially when the narrator inhabits the body of a friend. I felt embarrassed for the writer, the publisher, the agent, and everyone else involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"lovely, shmovely","review":"After reading this novel, I couldn't help but wonder, why did Alice Sebold bother? This read like a rough draft with some much needed editing. Frankly, it seemed contrived & tired and unneccessarily brutal. However, the hokey back-to-earth experience and the family reunited proved that even though Sebold tried to work on a tough subject she couldn't leave the \\"happy ever after\\" mentality behind. Make up your mind and quit with the blather, I say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Hyped, Underly Entertaining","review":"I bought this due to the hype and found it written in the style of the 14 year old protagonist. Unless you like middle school drivel save your money and buy a book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"I was given a copy of The Lovely Bones to take on a cross-country flight and ended up reading it straight through on the plane. Not only is it beautifully written, but Sebold expertly captures and conveys the raw emotion of a family in post-tragedy turmoil. Early in the story, the Salmon family is ripped apart by the murder of their daughter, Susie. The Lovely Bones is told from Susie's point of view as she watches her loved ones (and her murderer) from Sebold's unique interpretation of heaven. It is a heartrending story, as any about the rape and murder of a child would be, but it manages to end with a note of hopeful redemption. After many difficult years, Susie's family is finally able to emerge from the depressive wake of her murder, and the entire Salmon family - Susie included - learns how to let go and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gripping and Poignant Book","review":"I approached this book unsure if an author could pull off writing an entire novel from the perspective of a murder victim. Alice Sebold accomplished this and more. The Lovely Bones is a gripping and poignant book. Although it is somewhat sentimental, after all the narrator, Susie Salmon is 14-years-old. I felt the sentimentality was a necessary part of Susie's voice and revealed her character. Author, Alice Sebold, avoided gratituous gorey detail to lure readers into the book and, relied instead on a solid, well-told story. I had a difficult time putting The Lovely Bones down, and after I finished it, the story (or was that Susie?) haunted me for days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!Yawn!","review":"It would be impossible to count the number of books I have read over the years but I could count on one hand how many I have read to the half way mark then couldn't be bothered to finish - this was one of them. It's such an intriguing idea for a novel yet so little was made of it. It seemed to lack energy and just came across as half-soaked.I kept waiting for it to rev up but after reaching the half way mark only to find it still as ineffectual, I lost interest completely. A work colleague finished reading it but I couldn't even work up the curiosity to ask her what had happened in the end, such was my apathy regarding this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost lives up to the hype","review":"There's no way any book could live up to the hype this book has had in the past couple of months. That said, it IS a really good book. Ms. Sebold has created a believable heaven for Susie, and the ways the family members cope with grief feel true. A book that begins with the [way it does] doesn't seem like something you could call a \\"happy\\" book, and I guess it's not. But it is a hopeful book. It's about loss, sadness, healing and love. I think you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Admit it: it's overhyped","review":"The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is not a bad book per se, it's just not a good book. The central action revolves around a family trying to heal itself following the murder of one of its daughters.To Sebold's credit, the \\"heaven\\" scenes are quite well done (e.g., dogs playing and kids with friends and swingsets) and these, in my opinion, are the most appealing portions of the book.However, this is not enough. The Lovely Bones has the emotional depth of a Judy Blume book, yet somehow has managed to generate enough hype to mask itself in a patina of \\"serious literature.\\" Hats off to the Publishers, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY","review":"What am I missing? Why such great reviews? I stopped reading it about 50 pages from the end - forcing myself to try to finish it. I gave up. So disappointing! It just didn't go anywhere.

There are too many other good books out there to waste my time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No literary merit.","review":"An appealing characteristic of the book is the comfort is has given to people (see other reviews), and I applaud the book in this regard. However, viewed solely on its literary merit, not emotional merit, it deserved 1 star. After a quick beginning, Sebold's plot line deteriorates, and the writing style never goes beyond the level of Danielle Steel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally overrated.","review":"This book should have been classified as a \\"young adult\\" novel, not adult fiction. The writing is larded with dreadful cliches and pedestrian observations. If the author had not used the \\"novel\\" device of dead girl as narrator, this book would have attracted no notice whatsoever. That's the only bit of originality, and a slender reed it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"I was listened to it as a book on CD while driving and couldn't wait to get back in the car to listen!

During this book susie is looking down on her family from heaven while trying to lead her family to clues of who her murderer was.Alice gives a certain description of heaven from her point of view. This part of the book would have to be my favorite for the reason that I find it intresting to see what other people percieve as heaven in comparison to my thoughts.I would definately reccomend this book.However this book is very harsh,sad, and can be addicting.

Even so, it was an intriguing story. The narrator doesn't get as deeply inside the characters' thoughts as I thought she could have. Also, the story seems to lose some of its passion and momentum in the middle. Despite this, I still found it to be an enjoyable read, and it's worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longing to stay...","review":"Very beautiful and emotional book. I was captured by the first chapter and could not let it go...much like Susie didn't want to let go of her loved ones.

Then, I read the Amazon reviews, and bought a copy at the bookstore--at full price--ouch!! I do not regret my decision. What a wonderful story! I especially liked the fact that this is the author's first novel, and I like to support new authors by BUYING their book rather than borrowing it! This is a story that will touch your heart and soul. It had special significance for me: a dear friend of mine in high school was murdered, ironically, about the same time that this story took place. How touching to think that our departed loved ones are near us, and watching us at all times. I hope that all who read this review will enjoy this book as much as I have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is God in this story?","review":"I became immersed in the story and lost track of time, by the time I finished this book my day was over! I liked how I felt so engaged in the story that I didn't think too far ahead and try to predict the ending like I often do. However, seeing how Susie's family and friends struggled and failed to return to a normal life gave me a feeling of emptiness. They never could seem to find comfort in things that could truly bring healing into their lives. This feeling became even stronger as I read about Susie's heaven. God was never mentioned. I figured if God is anywhere at the very least He would be in heaven! Needless to say, I thought Susie's heaven was strange and wondered if atheists view the afterlife this way. Overall a haunting book, it put me in a pensive mode the days after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I didn't plan on reading this book because of all the hype around it, but I skimmed over the first chapter and haven't stopped. Perhaps it's a little more compelling because the Everytown, USA Susie's story is set in is filled with the names of places I knew growing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautiful idea wasted.","review":"A beautiful idea wasted. It looks more like Susie did not actually die, she was too involved with the eartly things, the sex, and the mundane characters. I thought we will be taken to a new level of understanding from the heaven, but Susie never left the earth. The book is hard to read and teaches nothing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Lifetime Special turned novel","review":"I'm not going to repeat much of what has been said already.

The idea is dopey, the telling of the story clumsy, and the plot thoroughly unbelievable. I finished it for a book discussion group, but wished that I hadn't. It is one thing to present an adolescent's view of the world and the afterlife for what it is, quite another to present it as a serious framework for a story about a family's tragedy.

Books classified in such a way are notoriously cursory; I suppose I got what I asked for. If you're a person who prefers a thought-provoking summer novel (like me) for prolonged interest and/or inspiration, you might want to think twice before paying the money for the hardcover edition. The characters, although easy to sympathize with, are cliche to the point of ridicule. Everyone reacts in such a way that is entirely predictable. Nevertheless, Sebold's depiction of heaven is enthralling, especially the description of various smells. Don't be misled by my criticism; this isn't a bad book if you can stand relatively superficial, typical characterization and plot development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotional pornography","review":"Sebold demonstrates a stunning capacity to combine all the worst aspects of American culture into a single novel - materialism, cheap religion, shallow psychotherapy, and a vigilante obsession with rare and violent crimes. The literary conceit is that 14-year-old Susie Salmon is raped and murdered, at which point she enters the perfect consumer heaven - untroubled by God or the unfathomable soul, in Sebold's heaven, we must merely say what we want and it appears. From this vantage, Susie exhibits a mind-boggling lack of curiosity about her sudden new ability to spy on her earthbound loved ones, opting instead to relate the cloyingly transparent activities of her family as they grieve her death and hunt down the man they know killed her, even though they have no evidence to suspect him. From the moment Sebold describes a character's smile as \\"like stars exploding,\\" I knew this would be a monumental work of emotional [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it but wished the ending was different","review":"It's nice to know I'm not the only one who doesn't think Heaven is all angels and harps, but it's \\"MY\\" Heaven and what you make it.I loved this book, but wish the ending was different. Not all crimes are solved, but this would have been much better if Susie's remains were found in the sink hole and the murder solved. Other than that, it's a 5 star read.Still, I recommend reading this book.

During the book you find out how evil Mr. Harvey actually is. You find out about his past and how he comes to getting caught.The suspense in this book is not that great. Most of the book is just the neighbors trying too prove Mr. Harvey killed Susie. The book all in all was pretty lame. There is not enough action during the book except in the beggining. I did think that it was clever how the author set the opening paragraph for the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finished yesterday and the characters are still with me ..","review":"I loved this book. I was drawn in immediately and my mind stayed on the book and its characters even when I wasn't reading! The book resulted in deep thoughts about the after life, appreciation for the present and regrets. The author did a wonderful job. I'd highly recommend this to anyone and I plan to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my usual . . . but I liked it.","review":"The Lovely Bones is not the sort of novel that I usually read; I prefer books that either scare me half to death, or keep me laughing out loud. That said, I enjoyed, and found comfort in, the premise. I want to believe that, even if something horrible happens to me on earth, heaven will be life as I wish it. Readers embrace The Lovely Bones because it reassures us that Reverend So-and-So is right: unless we're flat out evil,we'll have eternal life.The overall feel of the book trumps the storyline, however I do have two specific comments. First, I liked it that the killer's fate wasn't what I expected. Second, the Ruth out of body/sex scene confused me. I don't care about these things, because every once in a while, all I want is a pat answer to a weighty question. The Lovely Bones delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this book","review":"I think I really like this book. I might not have understood all of it, but I appreciated all that I could. I was unsure about the ending--something about it was unrealistic. Maybe it was the mother suddenly coming back or Mr. Harvey getting killed by an icicle or maybe it was how quickly the family healed. However, there was much to think about in this book, and I'll certainly read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down","review":"This is a great novel. It was hard to put it down. The character of Susie is smart, funny and a wonderful person to learn about. The family dynamics after the murder is unexpected. The author has the ability to think like a 14 year old girl and understands what is important to her. I really enjoyed The Lovely Bones and I am going to read more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't believe in the narrator","review":"I had a hard time believing this was actually a 14-year-old girl narrating - she felt like an adult to me. Better books with (believable) teenage narrators: Feeling Sorry for Celia, Shadow Baby, An Egg on Three Sticks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel that made me reflect.","review":"With each turn of the page, this book made me reflect on a lot of different issues: rape, grief, and religion. With every chapter, there is a new idea about the afterlife, new information into the mind of a serial rapist/killer, and new insight into how different members of a family handle the loss of a loved one. But the biggest issue that touched me was divine justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving-slow read","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer with the recent abductions in the news that this a relevant and interesting topic. I recently lost a good friend in a sudden accident, and this book made me reflect on that in a heartwarming way. If you have lost anyone close to you it will be easy to relate to. I also agree that it is a slow read in some chapters, but overall I enjoyed the characters and their journey after a life altering incident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"Absolute drivel. I read this because I was bored and this was supposed to be such a wonderful book. I'm sorry, but I just could not connect with the dead victim watching her family disentegrate over the years from her perch in heaven! It really jumped the shark for me when her spirit entered another girls body so that she could experience a sexual encounter with a boy she liked. I understand the author had some bad stuff to work out, but this fantasy was ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scattered and Halting","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book and unfortunately, I found the storylines scattered, the characters underdeveloped and the plot jerky and awkward.It started out well but slowly unraveled and spun off into too many directions to keep up with.I'm left wondering, what was the point?Disappointing, I'm glad I borrowed this one from the library instead of shelling out the money to own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!!!","review":"I HATED this book!! I was so eager to read it from different people's opinion of it. I read it and was SO disappointed! The description's went on and on. I found myself skimming over pages after pages. The idea was sweet; you feel sad for the little girl. But the book never developed. It would skip gaps of life and then all of a sudden, something different would start happening. Didn't like it at ALL!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a waste of my time.","review":"I had to see what was supposed to be so great about this best-selling book. Honestly, nothing is great about this book. A good story is something that makes you to go from page to page. This book was a boring read. It could have ended ten chapters earlier. I do not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a best seller?","review":"I am sorry, I was bored. I waited and waited for the climax to hit.. and then all of a sudden the book was over. They never caught her killer?! Are you joking. BORING! I think I might have to read it again... i think i missed something. I HOPE I did... because there was no point.. no story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ....","review":"What's stunning about this book is the PR and the blindness of most critics who have been doing cartwheels. There is no way at all that this is a convincing voice of a 14-year-old girl. It's too smart, too subtle, too mature, too sophisticated. I could not suspend, no, *crush*, disbelief long enough to enjoy it, and found myself insulted by the author, editor, publisher and reviewers who have put one over on the reading public, which has, sheep-like, made this book a wild success. The book is in its own way as bad as some early Michael Cunningham (A Home at the End of the World) where he has children observing life with the exact same richness of perception as adults. A Reader's Manifesto is absolutely right--reviewers are snowed nowadays by beautiful sentences no matter how opaque, or in this case, how unlikely they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"843rd person heard from","review":"i bought this book after reading the new york times review of it. generally, i trust the opinion of the particular times reviewer who wrote about it. but in this case, i think she went far astray. this is a paint-by-numbers oprah book: it's overwritten, contrived, and speciously literary. i feel a bit bad bashing oprah books because i was actually glad that oprah set the country reading again and i thought she made plenty of good book choices. but...she did also popularize a kind of women's literature that i find irritating and overly precious. and this book falls into--actually, personifies, if you can use that word about a book--that kind of writing. if you're the sort of reader interested in serious literary fiction--the national book award winning kind of stuff--i don't recommend that you buy this book. it will disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable and haunting","review":"Sebold's novel is one of the better ones I've read recently, along with Berg's True to form and The Secret LIfe of Bees (don't remember author's name! sorry!). Recommended, particularly with the other two novels, for book groups. I hope Sebold has more stories to tell. Its only flaw is perhaps the deus ex machina handling of the neighbor, but Sebold's metaphor of bones is more important, and so I overlook that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read before buying book","review":"My perception of a book is to somehow enrich experience during and after the process of reading. I felt robbed of every moment spent to finish the book for the sake of finishing it. I found her characters flat, the plot typical, and the sub-plots Charles Dickens at best. Moreover, there were moments when the writing made me cringe and embarrassed for the writer. I realize this is a harsh criticsm but I felt annoyed at the loss of time spent reading this book. The only thing lovely about this book, indeed, are its bones, that is, the catchy cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and disturbing","review":"I did not even finish the book. I found it terrible and disturbing. I am very surprised that so many people recommended this book. Why would anyone want to read about such a disturbing subject such as rape, murder, and the families grief? It seems almost masochistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life after death?","review":"The premise of this book is appalling! A heinous crime is somehow made palatable by giving a murdered girl a \\"life\\" after her death. I read about the first 50 or so pages before deciding this book was deeply disturbing. It is made more so due to its popularity. What is wrong with people's analytical abilities? I guess it belongs to the same category of books as The Virgin Suicides. Disturbing and disgusting! Lets celebrate life and goodness where it exists, not death! Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous book","review":"I think Sebold's central message is: if you get raped, go ahead and rape someone else, and continue the circle of horror. Nope, nothing irresponsible about that! That's your book report for the day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Book Cover","review":"I was planning on giving this book as a gift, but when it came without a book cover, I was very disappointed. The book obviously looked used, even though there weren't any marks on the inside. The description did not indicate that the book would be coming without a cover, and when it did, I had to change my plans."},{"rating":"1","title":"theres nothing lovely about this book","review":"This books starts out heartwarming, then horrifying and then sad, then it becomes downright stupid. it explains none of it acid trip logic.it more than deflated, it crashed and burned.I ve never hated a book so much in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype about?","review":"This book missed the point somewhere along the way. There was so much potential to this story. However, it just made it to mediocre. There is too much filler and incidental information written. It would have been so much more exciting to be quick and to the point and to keep those characters moving in more compelling ways. It starts off just fine..and then becomes too boring. A great disappointment. DLD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I bought this book because it was one of the bestsellers in the bookstore and thought it must be something very good. But it turned out to be very disappointing. I even thought of giving up reading it when I have gone through just one-third of it. But I decided to read further, thinking (and hoping) that the story may become more interesting. I'm now nearly through the book and find the development as boring as it has been at the beginning. The description of the characters and the incidents are too long yet too shallow to touch my heart. The author tries hard to show how much the family loves their lost Susie and especially, how desperate the father has become. The impact on me is unfortunately far from successful. Just a lengthy description without feelings doesn't work. The book is too boring for me to recommend further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommend, with reservations","review":"This book is just okay. I finished it in two sittings just so I could be free to move on to something more stimulating. If you enjoy tears, sappiness, and emotion-fests in general, by all means read this book. This book is definitely in the teen-girl fiction school of pop psychology. If you want two dimensional characters and supernatural smarm, look no further. There are some redeeming qualities: Harvey is a creepy and well-drawn force. Also, Sebold's idea that there is not a strict separation between the living and the dead is pretty profound and worth more consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Bones","review":"Everyone should read this book just for the insight of what life might be after we leave this world. I also enjoyed how things were looked at in so many differant angels. I had trouble putting it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky was Better!","review":"After reading Alice Sebold's memoir, Lucky, I rushed out to pick up her first novel. I had read how she had started writing this book and was forced to stop and write Lucky first so she could move past her own experiences with rape and focus on Susie Salmon.I was disappointed. Sebold's style in Lucky is raw and real but her style in Lovely Bones seems contrived and capricious. Although I connected well with Susie, the other characters in the story were flat and uninteresting. I would highly recommend Lucky as an alternative Sebold pick for all those who felt let down by this bestseller (and for those who loved it!). It is an incredible account of a serious crime with lots of dark humor but minus the murder and syrupy sweetness of Lovely Bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped!","review":"I agree that this 'novel' is completely overhyped (which is exactly the reason I winded up with it in the first place). I never got past Chapter 7 or so -- with not even a clue nor desire to know how it ended. I just can't understand why it keeps popping up in articles, magazines and the like. It just seems to me that any work of literature that is lucky enough to get the right media attention can magically appear to be a work of art. Not so in this case; I'm befuddled."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sketchbook rather than a painting","review":"Unsatisfying and manipulative. Learning this was a debut effort explains a lot.I didn't feel the narrative voice was convincingly close enough to a 14 year old's and I suppose the omniscient parts about what her mother/father/siblings/friends are feeling can be ascribed to the heaven vantage point.I found myself asking \\"what was the author intending?\\" more than I should, especially considering with a really compelling story, one forgets about the writer's existence entirely. The plot seemed to be advanced mainly through a desire for justice rather than interest in individual characters and the ending was just too Touched by Angel for my taste.There are so many better authors who can show rather than tell.I wonder if this book is so popular because of the subject matter, and to find fault with it is somehow an indictment of personal grief?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"Everyone was gushing about this book so I read it to see what the fuss was about. i have to say the idea of a murdered girl narrating from her own desired idea of heaven is an interesting one, however there are major frustrations when we read about those left on earth. Susie's sister Lindsey seems to mature far faster than is normal (losing her virginity at 14?). Also Mr. Harvey \\"gets away with it\\". Though he ends up dying in a freak accident, nobody in Susie's family knows. We're left with no closure at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"I thought this book was fantastic! I was completely immersed in Susie's (after) life, and whipped through this book in two days. A part of me was sad that it was over. I recommended it to everyone I know, and have a waiting list for people wanting to borrow my copy. The description of Heaven being a place made especially for you, with familiar sights, sounds, and even smells was an idea that provoked an immense feeling of peace within me. Fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S A MUST READ!!!!","review":"This book, 'The Lovely Bones' written by Alice Sebold, is a must read. It is filled with characters that you can relate to, and tons of great details that make the story interesting.The main reason that I liked this book was because it was told on the perspective of a girl who's already dead. I had never read a book like that before, and it was really cool. She tells you about her life up in heaven, and how her family is coping with her death down on earth. The whole book takes place over a span of about six years, and whithin that time you really get to see the characters develop and grow up. The author also uses a lot of details that make you feel like you're in the story.Overall the book was very good. The beginning brings you in right away and makes you want to keep reading. The pace slowed down a little bit towards the middle but picked up again as the story finishes. I would definitelly recomend this book, it has a surprising ending that completes a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming and acheing. A must read book.","review":"\\"The Lovely Bones\\" a fiction novel by Alice Sebold is one the most touching stories ive read over the years. An epic and heartbreaking tale of a young girls murder and her family's courage to get through it. Quietly the young girl watches her family from heaven, as they drown themselves in clues and memories until her murder is solved. Life never ends, a message the story teaches you from the very begining. I highly recommend this to mothers and daughters as something to read together to share and learn from. You'll never want to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much hype","review":"At first i was excited to read this book having heard and read so much about it but it turned out to be disappointing particularly the character of Susie Salmon's mother, Abigail.

I thought the author made a very superficial character, weak and undeveloped.

It was a rather beautiful story about a young girl that gets murdered and how the family copes with, first, her disappearance, and then her murder investigation. All throughout the book the young girl looks down at the life of her family from her heaven. I think this book was well written and offered the reader a fresh and different perspective of heaven than I had ever heard of. It was easy for me to get into the story, and I even to related to the characters well. However, at the end of this book I was slightly disappointed. I felt like something was left unresolved in the story. Nonetheless, that doesn't stop me from considering this a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearls of wisdom","review":"I really loved the book and give it 4 stars only because of some character flaws that made me feel a little empty at the end (especially Susie's mom). Alice Sebold said some beautiful things about death and how the dead hold unto you until their through with you. I liked that and won't forget it. She also gave me insight into the mind of the serial killer when she said he had \\"wild and bottomless lust.\\" In many ways she writes like Joyce Carol Oates. Very observant and deep. I will remember Susie and the horrible Mr. Harvey for quite a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish writing camouflaged in a teenager's voice","review":"Intriguing plot but not particularly original. The voice may sound authentic in the beginning. But as the mystery unfolds, it's obviously that the writer was camouflaging her lack of style and transition in the narrative of a teenager."},{"rating":"2","title":"kept thinking about it","review":"i loved this book. i bought it in an aiport and read it on the flight home. i was sobbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read!","review":"In the over 2,000 books I have read, I would have to say without a doubt this is the best one. It moved me and took me on a ride with Susie. Alice Sebold is an up and coming writer for a reason, I have no doubt she will surpass some of the best authors of our time. She writes almost passively, but in a way that you feel as if you are discovering something with the characters in her book, the way you might look at a best friend and together the two of you are thinking the same thing at the same time, a realization you both don't have to speak, this is what Alice Sebold creates with Susie Salmon, like the fish. And I won't ever forget this book. I will be surprised and awe-stricken if I can ever find another book that can hold a candle to this one. I don't know where this book came from or how Sebold's first fiction book was able to do what established authors have been trying to do for years, but I pray she keeps on doing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Sebold did a wonderful job, I think, writing something extremely fresh. To have an entire story told from the viewpoint of a person who has been ripped out of the story was ingenious. Just as ingenious was to start the book with Suzie's murder. It was so gruesome and horrible that if we had already developed compassion for the characters we could not have read further. Much better than diluting the brutality of the murder for the comfort of the readers. Because of her technique, I was able to feel the pain of the survivors.Another thing I loved was how she explored the individuality of heaven. Brilliant!Great imagination! Great way to tell a story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In a Summer of Kidnappings....","review":"this book is especially touching, even heartwrenching. Alice Sebold, of course, did not know when she labored over this beautiful, haunting book that killed kids would be headlines this summer of 2002. Especially the Elizabeth Smart case, unsolved, resonated for me while reading this. A really powerful read, and I add my 2 cents to the many others who loved it. Whether it would have affected me less without this zeitgeist, I have no way of knowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"In her book Alice Sebold preyed on my primitive motherly fear of something happening to my child. She did this to keep me reading through her mundane, drawn-out, wordy narrative. She could have written this whole story in two chapters, but chose to pull me into her story by fear and then keep me in \\"reading purgatory\\" for chapters on end. I read so much waste before I could grab another tiny little morsel of the plot. I wanted to know what ultimately happened to Susie Salmon and Mr. Harvey. I found myself reading for the purpose of getting to the end of the book. When I finally did get to the end, all I could say was \\"it was a waste of my time.\\" Don't read this book...NOT WORTH IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I finished this book...","review":"I didn't like the book, at all. I thought there were several character flaws. Susie was a dry, sarcastic character, which I found to be more rude and disconnected... I couldn't grow to like her. Her younger sister.. I thought her to be too mean spirited in the beginning.. and felt she cared less about Susie's death.. the only consistency was the parents..Boring.. dark characters.. a gloomy and grey story. I couldn't grasp the \\"love\\" of the story, that so many others claimed to have experienced, after reading this book. Allot of flash backs, and even before Susie was viciously murdered, she seemed to have already been an unhappy girl... This book was recommended to me.. and I'm going to save you the time and trouble.. that I didn't get the opportunity of. I DO not recommend this book.

What starts off with a decent hook and a rather clever idea of heaven, quickly decends into a morass of syrupy narrative, unbeliveably trite dialogue and cardboard characters.

I could see this book marketed as a light read for the teenagers, mostly female, but certainly not to any reader looking for a book that is \\"destined to become a classic.\\"Here is a small sample of the writing that set my teeth on edge:\\"She pulled Len in to her and slowly kissed him on the mouth.

I finished the book for the same reason. I found the book to wander along, jump around and be hard to follow. The character of Susie was too laid back to believe. The descriptions of the different \\"heavens\\" began well and then would dissolve leaving the reader wondering if the writer fell asleep during that part of production. The sentiment behind the book is there, though veiled thru the many, many, many characters and their comings and goings.

I enjoyed the first half of this book, but hated the second half. The 1st half was interesting, and almost believable. It doesn't have to be exactly factual - it just has to be believable. But the second half was slow, slow, slow... and the ending?? Well, I won't give it away, but it felt like I was reading a supernatural mills & boon!! It was TERRIBLE!! Completely unbelievable, ridiculous, and wrapped up in too neat a little package for me at the end. Two stars for the 1st half, but nothing for the second.

So I flipped over to the ending, scanned it and put the book away.The prose was lovely if a little tiring at times, and too many scenes were unbelieveable and even disturbing. A girl in heaven watching her mother's adultery? A camp counselor assigning the theme \\"how to commit a perfect murder\\" as a project (in theory, mind you) for junior high kids? A mother, already having had one child murdered, leaves her small boy in a mall play area to meet with her lover?I had treated myself to a stack of books for my birthday -- wish I had my money back for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"lovely bones","review":"I would have to agree with the lady from Texas--this book isn't really that great.

Also, I knew the motion picture was coming out soon and I like many other readers enjoy reading a book prior to viewing the movie version.I was instantly hooked after reading the sample chapters for this book which is surprising for me because I generally put my leisure reading off, but I couldn't do that to do this book. I really loved chapter to chapter and although some were more like \\"filler\\" chapters most were entertaining.It's a bookworthy selection for most age groups and those who are still intrigued and bothered by child killers & their victims & their family.

After all, it was all over the TV and media as a wonderful and unique novel. At first, during the description of the murder and its immediate after effects, I was very intrigued. But towards the middle of the book, I began to feel let down. This is it??? The end of the book had a very unrealistic flare that made it seem \\"written to be made into a movie.\\" Too bad. It had potential. Also, if you pick it up thinking it will give an entirely new and wonderful idea of what heaven is....then, you may be disappointed. Nothing really enlightening to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"This may be the best book you'll ever read this year.Alice Sebold tells a chilling story without histrionics or sensationalism, and her self-discipline makes the story all the more poignant.

Yet it doesn't bring you down the way that some books do about such grim subjects. It is uplifting and hopeful despite the sad situtation of the lead character Susie. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Child Describes What It Feels Like To Have Been Loved","review":"I think the vast media attention to crime and serial killers is a shame, so when I read the back cover of this popular book I thought, \\"Oh, no!\\"The book was not about evil so much as about loss, regret and caring for others. The main character was such a much loved child, and her sweet portrait is so fully drawn, that it is hard to read her story and not be left feeling hopeful.The narrative carries you along in the same way as a good mystery novel does.This book is entertaining and involving."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome, unique book","review":"I dunno about the people who say this book is bad, but I thought this book just truly was amazing and inspiring. The tale is a sad one, but the presectives that Sebold gives on such a touchy subject are truly interesting. It also gives a true look on people's reactions to death and life. I would definetly recommend to read it, it is one that you won't be able to put down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Kind Of Book","review":"...The first chapter sets up the reader for some major disappointment. Susie is telling us about her murder and yet there is no emotion for her or the reader. It seems that she is just an observer in her own death and not even a horrorified observer. The lack of emotion and important details continues throughout the whole book. The murderer isn't even that interesting! For a story about a murdered girl, there is a lot of fluffy tales of the happenings on earth(Starting after chapter 1 and going to the end of the book), such as a sister's romance and a budding friendship between 2 classmates. There are many tales of sex as well, which seems completely unnecessary. Overall I gave this book 1 star because I was upset that the hype got to me and my book club.For every 1 star there is a 5 star... so this is just 1 opinion for which there are millions more to choose from."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely View from a Private Heaven","review":"For any parent of a murdered child this fresh book will bring comfort along with tears and joy. Written from a perspective of a young teenage girl, newly murdered, and her journey from her ties to earth, her observations of family and the tracking of her murderer in search for justice for herself and for her grief stricken family to her progress in \\"her\\" Heaven. In the literary world this viewpoint is new and enlightening. Every reader will find comfort in the thought that \\"hey, this could be.\\"Susie Salmon is a character we will not forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"Now I have read the worst book of my entire life. This book had no redeeming values what-so-ever! Believe me, it is a waste of time. The characters were shallow, and you really could care less what happens to them. The story didn't flow right, and was all over the place. She would introduce characters (Ruth) and then you never knew or cared what happened to her. And her idea of Heaven, for gosh sakes, Woman, read the Bible! Who wants to live a life for God only to end up in a place like what she describes Heaven to be! Please don't waste your time like I did, and pick a better book for Book Club. Life is full of enough despair without adding more to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"I ordered this book along with \\"Lucky\\" by the same seller. I never received it. I wrote to inform the seller and Amazon. I was credited the amount of purchase. I have since reordered it and waiting for it to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I cannot believe the hype this book has received. Utterly boring and unreadable. Undoubtedly one must be religious to enjoy this silly, seemingly un-ending piece of supernatural tripe. America is not so different from its Muslim counterparts in embracing all this other-worldliness - whether \\"heaven\\" or \\"martyrism\\" with 72 virgins - it's all the same ridiculous superstition. May reason someday prevail, and only then will there be a chance of peace amongst nations.Another gripe - soooo PC. The dark-skinned Indians were so much more beautiful than the whites - plus she could bake the vastly better pie. Ray was angelic. His mother was superior in all ways. When will silly white writers stop genuflecting to the darker-colored? A look at racial crime might be in order. As in 99% of inter-racial crime is black/hispanic on white. Do your research you silly white liberals! Research crime stats! You then just might - maybe - find that the victims in this nation are white, not black."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"** SPOILERS**I usually write reviews about books I have enjoyed reading, but I was so disappointed with this book that I felt compelled to write a review. First of all, those that liked the book have to keep in mind that not everyone is going to buy into the hype and be completely taken by it. It was the movie trailer that sparked my interest in the book. The book started out promising but half way through it was nothing but drivel. I didn't like how she jumped from one character to the next. Susie's mother seemed like a bored housewife that decided to change her life by leaving her family for a few years. I can deal with the fact that they never found Susie's body, but having her killer die in such a pathetic way and not bringing him to justice was the most upsetting thing for me. I found it lame and trite and don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most implausible ending EVER","review":"The premise was poetic and in the beginning an astonishing read....but something happened to the narrative at the half way mark that made me wonder if the author was suddenly rushed to finish. The introduction of a ludicrous plot point at a summer camp added to the utterly lame and contrived ending and in the end absolutely RUINED the book. In her interview on NPR about this book the author mentioned working on another book at the same time. Perhaps that is why this The Lovely Bones seems rushed at the end. All of the poetic anguish at the beginning seems to have been sacrificed in the rush to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones is different...","review":"The story is told by the victim. I found it hard to get into at first, but it became more interesting as I continued to read. It's easy reading and isn't a really thick book. I found it enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"how is this such a good seller?!","review":"i didn't enjoy this book! parts were disturbing... and boring. i didn't even think it was worth finishing, so i stopped. other people i know who read it said it was depressing and not very good. i have no idea what the hype was about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"This book got great reviews so I was quite excited to read it. As I read I felt that it was at best good, but as I neared the end I couldn't believe the bizarre turns the book took and I found myself skimming paragraphs. Had certain parts of the book (e.g. most of the afterlife) been omitted and the characters been developed better this book could have been very good. I'm truly surprised that many people could have enjoyed it that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Original!","review":"Lovely Bones was such a great book, unlike other I have ever read. It is full of intelligence and thought and you really have to admire the author for putting that much thought into it! It was really interesting to read about death from another person's perspective and then to also get the perspective of the characters in the book! My only complaint is that some concepts in the book were not explained enough, such as the whole idea of Susie \\"breaking through\\" for the first time, and the concept of accepting her death and moving to another level in heaven. It was a complex thought process by the author, but maybe after a few more reads it will become more clear! I really recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a thought provoking and orignial read. Guaranteed, it will be different than anything else you have read recently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it, ALMOST","review":"Somewhere online, I read a segment of this book and was anxious to read the rest of the book. It held my attention right along and I enjoyed it very much. The kind of book I looked forward to getting back to everyday. Until near the end. It got quite contrived. (Not wanting to ruin it for anyone else...)The chapter with the physical scene with Ray & \\"Ruth\\" felt tacked on. Almost like Ms. Sebold was told she needed to spice it up a little in case they made a movie of it. ... On the whole though I enjoyed the book. She handled a delicate topic well with interesting views."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lovely Bones is not so Lovely","review":"Awful book. Ms. Sebold should just quit now. There is no story line and the ending is god awful. I am an avid reader and this is the first book in my life that I had to skim through because I could not take the boredom any longer. Do not waste your time on this embarrassing addition to the bestsellers list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminine Drivel","review":"I got two words for you, Alice Sebold - be bold. I know it rhymes, but so what. When I read The Lovely Bones, I felt like tossing my cookies, if you know what I mean. Let's face it - this is a chick book - nothing more and nothing less. It's about as P.C. and feminine as you can get. After a while, I began to skim through the less interesting parts - i.e. the whole book - and found it utterly predictable in its theme and outcome. I'm sure it'll be made into an equally horrific and abominable movie - so just wait 'til then, unless you really want to throw your money away or are forced to read this for some godforsaken women's book club.I'm sure Alice had good intentions, but, as is often said, the road to hell also was paved with good intentions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book and future literary classic.","review":"This is such a wonderful book. I could not put it down until I actually finished it. Do yourself a favor and read it. It will take you to a place you never knew existed. RC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits every emotion!!","review":"Wow! What a spectacular read! I usually take several weeks - months to get a book read, but this one I could not put down. I read it in 3 days and what an emotional rollercoaster. Like so many others, I thought \\"what an awful premise to a book\\". Having 2 young girls myself, I felt the subject of the rape and murder of a young girl to be too dark and depressing. This book was anything but that. It tugs at all of your emotions and can bring tears of joy as well as sadness to your eyes. There is nothing better than a novel that can really get to you deep inside, and this one does that and then some."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Book? I beg to differ","review":"I personally did not like this book. Everyone said it was great, so I checked it out from the \\"teen-kids\\" section. I think it belongs in the adult section of the library. It rambled on and on and was too slowly paced. I felt the author included too many irrelevant things in the story and it was too graphic. Even so, I liked the author's depiction of heaven and what went on. The ending was a little bit of a letdown, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written story of a young girls spirit after death","review":"New and interesting look at death, told by a young girl who is murdered by her neighbor, and ethereally hangs around afterward to watch after her parents and friends. Unable to communicate, she watches as they suffer the after effects of loosing her, and watches as her killer goes unpunished. We follow Susie, as she follows them, and tells us of her regrets, things she wishes she had done in life, and what she wishes for her parents and friends in their lives without her. Only four stars instead of five, because toward the ending Ms. Sebold let the \\"fantasy\\" part of this book slip a little too far. I enjoyed the story as Susie told it from her afterlife, but when she ventures briefly back into this world, I felt the reasoning was off and the concept unacceptable and a bit silly. All in all, a pretty good book, worthy of four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Disappointing . . .","review":"This book was a wonderful & interesting story told through the eyes of a young girl who was brutally murdered. Her \\"heaven\\" and her past earth life are beautiful intertwined to make this both sad and uplifing at times.My only disappointment was not the ending itself, but as the book came to an end. In one of the last chapters, it seemed the author took a page right out of \\"Hollywood,\\" (since I can't divulge any of the plot in my review, I can't divulge the movie, unfortunately!). It clearly deviated from the originality of the story & gave it a \\"schlocky\\" feel at this point.Normally, I read the books I love over and over. This one will be donated to the public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Contrived...","review":"\\"Lovely Bones\\" seemed more to be a book written to be a bestseller than a book that was written and happened to become one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"phony book","review":"-the premise is a good one-- a book narrated by someone recently passed over -too bad the writer isnt up to the task- this book is contrived and manipulative --- all books manipulate the reader of course-- but brilliant books do it with a certain grace and believablity-- this is a prurient bunch of nonsense- with no real meat to it-- i hated it and couldnt even finish it- dont waste yer time-----"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"Ms. Sebold, congratulations, you have just made it to the top of my \\"AUTHORS I WILL NEVER READ AGAIN\\" list. After finishing this book I booked a flight to Haiti, found myself a Voodoo priestesses and placed a hex on you, your agent, and your publisher! Prepare yourself; I suspect you'll be experiencing some otherworldly discomfort shortly.This was fluffy, incoherent nonsense that I will use only when I have a desire to puke. I'm ashamed of everyone here who gave this book more than two stars. If there weren't so many of you I would have added you all to the hex."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell for they hype","review":"I got the Kindle sample and was not impressed but talked myself out of my hesitation because the book had received so many positive reviews. I should have followed my instincts. Each page was a bigger disappointment and totally unbelievable...a mother who lost a child runs off and abandons her other children is not something a mother would do....a 14 year old girl who is raped and murdered has a chance to come back to experience life and chooses to come back to have sex with a boy she barely knew is not something a rape victim would do. I am really confused as to why so many people enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing. Too much going on.","review":"I've heard of this book, of course, for several years. I finally decided to read it after seeing previews for the movie. The way the book starts is promising. The first few chapters (and last few chapters) held my interest but I kept waiting for something more to happen. Actually, I kept reflecting back to the movie previews which make it seem more like a thriller or intense drama. That's not what the book is like. The book is more about an exploration of the grief process--in about a half a dozen characters. There's just as many subplots in the book which is too many! I think Alice Sebold should have picked 1 or 2 characters and and plots and focused on them. Instead, she tries to do too much and loses the effect she wanted to create. Overall, I think the book is a waste of time. Just my opinion, but I think the movie might be more interesting than the book--how often does that happen?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good effort!","review":"Susie Salmon tells her story from heaven after being raped an murdered. She describes how her family is coping with the terrible events that unfold from her murder and how life in heaven develops.The book presents a well depicted vision of what heaven is like but the most important acomplishment is the unveiling of what a family goes through as a consequence of such horrible events.The only flaw I can point is that there is a point in which the story moves forward in time very fast creating a gap that would have been better filled with a more thorough depiction of what was going on.Overall a very good read, definitely worth your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LOVELY BONES","review":"This was a well written book. It makes you notice how important family is and what coping with death or murder is like for family members. Alice Sebold does a great job setting up the storyline and her descriptions of character and events throughout the story made it easier for me to visualize them. The storyline was good but I didn't like her descriptions of how life in heaven was. She described heaven as like living in the dorms in college. This book would have been better if Sebold focused more on the mystery of Susie's death. If you're a reader who enjoys reading about mysteries and drama, I would recommend this book to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"a murder-drama from heaven's vantage point,","review":"Lovely bones would appeal to most readers looking for an enjoyable easy read. The narrative voice is that of Susie Salmon, brutally murdered at 14, now suspended in her version of heaven . She longingly watches her family (as they unravel in the aftermath of her death) and the lives of others whom she had touched ....a blossoming crush, an awkward prescient loner ... and of course her murderer. It's a potent & moving combination of Susie's unfulfilled hopes and dreams, family drama, the frustrating prolonged hunt for her killer. Don't let the grim subject matter put you off because Sebold's Susie carries the story well. Lovely Bones lost out on my fifth star due its cliched moments in the later half - a real pity. Nevertheless it was such a page turner, both refreshing and thought-provoking. Worth a good weekend at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly moving story","review":"This was an incredibly moving story. It is difficult to write about a situation such as that encountered in the book and avoid cliches and recycling of previous ideas. Sebold uses a beautiful creativity and freshness in her writing and blends palpable sadness and grief with hope and personal growth into a very remarkable book. This book was difficult to put down, and the ending is quite satisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad But Good","review":"With all the reviews you probably already know the story but I will add to what has been previously written and say this is a horror story with a message of hope and I have not thought the same of heaven or our dead loves ones since.If you are a hardcore skeptic looking to pick apart yet another popular book you will probably succeed in doing so.But if you are looking for a good read that does not have the happiest ending, you have found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heaven can wait","review":"This book uses an unusual point of view as a perspective on a horrific event and its aftermath, but in the end, I felt like I was the one being manipulated. I looked forward to finishing this book more than any I've read recently, just so I could move on to something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"discontent","review":"well this book is a great read until you get to the last three chapters! it seems like another person wrote the end of the book. Maybe Alice just got bored? In anycase if you want a good ending this book is not recomended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!!","review":"This is the best book I have read in a long time. It is well written and interesting from the first line. You fall in love with the main characters immediately. You cheer for them, hurt for them, and worry for them. This book will make you laugh and cry. I highly recommend it and can't wait to see what Alice Sebold with produce next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick question","review":"Interesting premise that kept me glued but can someone please tell me why a serial killer who lives in a hovel and drives a patched up car would have a stack of monogrammed white cotton sheets with which to build a tent?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS......","review":"Why is it on the NYT bestsellers' list i have no idea, other than a interesting concept of posthumous narrative, there's nothing more to the novel than gratuitous emtional fluff. I can't believe i bought this book. If you are into that kinda stuff, and have nothing better to do, maybe u can consider buying if from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is the story of a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon who was raped and murdered by a neighbor and family friend. Throughout this story Susie is watching her family and friends from Heaven. She has to watch her family suffer and deal with her loss while at the same time she is trying to move on so that her family will do the same. This is a very unusual book but very well written and it made me want to read it for hours at a time. The author's creative twists really make this book one of a kind and the ending is delightful. Overall this book is very well-done and I would definitely recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Slow","review":"I was psyched to read this book because I heard that it was great, but when I actually started reading it, I thought it was boring. It's interesting because it was from Susie's point of view but it was a little slow in places and the flashbacks could have been placed a little better"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the hype","review":"The writer had a wonderfully unique premis but failed to capitalize on it. My book club (10 women) read it and we all thought that it had been over hyped. It wasn't awfull - just not great either. The first chapter is a \\"10\\" then each one that followes is less until you are realy happy to see it end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started Out Good, But...","review":"I started out really liking this book and would have actually recommended it. But, then I started reading the last quarter of the book. What a cop out to end the book the way she did. A first grader could have seen it coming...which makes it all the worse in my opinion. The very ending with Mr. Harvey was the worst of it in my opinion. What had been a very well written book turned to a wrap up of the book that was meant to make the reader feel better about what had happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"I thought this book was really depressing. It opens with Susie's murder. She is murdered by her neighbor and the whole focus of the book is how Susie and her family deal with her death. The book is narrated by Susie who watches over her family and friends from heaven. I found the book so depressing because the version that Susie has of heaven is not one that I want to go. Her heaven is everything she ever wanted except for the fact that she can't have her life on earth. That is of course what Susie wants the most. She watches the lives of the people she cared about as they deal with her death and she is impotent to help them through anything.The book would have been better if Susie's body would have been found and there was some sort of closure. The book didn't have a happy ending... you just don't know what is going to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating and Heartbreaking","review":"The story being told by a murdered 14-year-old in the prime of her life is so beautfully put forth that it is both captivating and heartbreaking to the reader. Susie is lingering in between heaven and earth looking for some sort of closure to her vicious and untimely death. A beautiful rendering of family and loss, yet insightful and sad. A must-read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the hype","review":"Whoever marketed this book did a great job.........it is my opinion that it is way over hyped, much too highly rated and doesn't deserve the attention it has been getting. As I moved through it I couldn't help but think that I would have taken the story in a different direction. This happened often. I found that much of the book spent too many words on subjects that were of no interest to me, whether fictional or real. I was enthralled for the first two chapters and it was downhill from there and by the end I was really skimming to get it finished, always thinking that any minute it would reach out and grab me. It never did. Can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make No Bones About It","review":"Please don't waste your time on this un-original sensationalistic novel. Unless you were enthralled with the OJ trial, it will not interest you. Borrowing special effects from several movies (b-movies), it has nothing uplifting to say about the human condition. I only completed it, because I was expecting something to redeem it. Alas, I was disappointed again. Since it was a best seller, I can only equate the interest to the OJ spectacle....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some fine writing, a flimsy device","review":"Though Sebold's scenes of the family's grief and mourning of Susie Salmon are convincing and often wrenching, her depiction of heaven as a subdivision, where everyone has their own place and intake worker, seems silly and false. Sebold's setting up rules for the place (the dead cannot interact with the living) and then breaking them twice (the final time a teenaged deflowering) is artistically flabby and dishonest.Like most bestsellers, this book has been praised far beyond its merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustrating pleasure to read","review":"This book is difficult to read if you have children. It also reminds those who do have children that life does have to go on regardless of what happensm during a lifetime. The read was enjoyable because the story was believable and told from the perspective of a young adult. It was interesting to see the lives of the characters unfolding and frustrating because of the way it ended for the killer. This is worth the short amount of time it took to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I had such high hopes for this book, after all it seemed so ethereal, right up my alley. The story context sounded great! Boy was I cruelly disppointed. I had a very difficult time understanding the style of writing, it did not flow. I am an avid reader who has read all sorts of books from various authors, however the writing style was just a struggle. Sadly I will not buy another book from this author but I do wish her good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titillating, creepy, then boring","review":"I was anxious to read this novel, because it has been on the bestseller list for 44 weeks, which must be some kind of record. But I can't divine what people like about it. The first chapter is almost cheaply titillating and creepy, and then it becomes very very predictable. Alice Sebold, I think, is a keen observer of the obvious. \\"Nothing is revealed,\\" as Bob Dylan once wrote. The NY Times reviewer gushed on about it being a heartfelt and keenly observed insight into family relationships. You can't prove that by me. It just goes to prove the old saying that one man's meat is another man's poisson, as a friend of mine used to say in France. This is definitely more fish than meat. (No disrespect intended to the fish.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a creative read, puts a nice spin on heaven","review":"This book reminded me of the Robin Williams movie, \\"What Dreams May Come\\" It was a very creative look at heaven. It was comforting to know that Susie wasn't in pain, that she was around her family. They knew she was there, they could feel her. It got a little strange in one part, but if you liked the movie \\"Ghost\\" you will be okay with that part.I like to be able to get lost in a book and this book did it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and cliched","review":"Unless you're a sentimental middle-aged housewife, don't believe the hype.This book is trite and completely ordinary. The voice is tired, the characters are cliched, the plot sags, and the aftertaste is that of water. I persevered past page 70 -- indeed, I finished the book out of sheer will, trying to see what in the world was so remarkable and moving about it. But it remained utterly bland and uncompelling. (The mom is sad. The dad is sad. The sister is sad. The murderer is bad and sad. Things Fall Apart.) No creativity AT ALL was involved in the writing of this book. So Susie narrates from heaven with courage and acuity? Big deal. Where's the spark? The resonance? The complex, three-dimensional characters? All I see is a contrived, sappy attempt at poignancy.But sheep would fawn over this book. And they have. It sure does \\"pull\\" \\"at\\" \\"the\\" \\"heartstrings.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This book grabbed my soul","review":"The best book I've EVER read (I 've read hundreds) and it will be difficult to find a follow up. I cried from page 47 'till the end, feeling the sadness and joy these characters felt, forgetting the book is fiction. I think that for anyone who has lost someone near to them, this novel can be healing, as the author is so articulate in her descriptions, you feel like you've been there before and have felt what they felt. Amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love this book","review":"After seeing such high recommendations (and intriguing low ones), I borrowed this book from a friend. There are some lovely moments of poetic language and imagery, though others come off as forced and awkward. Many characters and situations seemed tacked on and are never fully developed. The characters, even Susie herself, failed to strike an emotional chord--that is, except for the killer. I felt the bile rise in my stomach with every mention of his name. His end left me cold and unsatisfied--I shudder to think what his heaven might be like, yet I am never told if he gets his just deserts in the afterlife. I also found myself annoyed at several errors. There were no 130 prismacolor sets in 1973! Nor are sarees worn with pants! For a truly fascinating account of a teen's journey to healing, read Laurie Halse Anderson's stunning award-winner, Speak. It will capture you to your very core."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good despite a few flaws","review":"Since each week seems to bring another tragic news story of an abducted and murdered teenage girl, you couldn't ask for a novel on a more current topic. Beyond the book's timeliness, however, is an absorbing and compelling story that I found I enjoyed more than I was expecting for a first-time novel. The book has its faults, of course, but overall it's a creditable effort, and except for a few purple prose passages I could have done without, it's a well written, suspenseful, and moving story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy read - compelling, thoughtful and very sad","review":"When I first began to read the book, I couldn't put it down. It was a beautifully written sad story about loss and grieving and ultimately having to let go. I found that towards the end, as suspenseful as it had been the entire way through even though we knew who the killer was from the beginning, the story fades and becomes just another unbelievable tale. All in all, I enjoyed the book but wished that there was no Ruth but instead just the family and their lives - I wanted to see them going on with their lives even after such a tragic loss. Also, everything was too perfect at the end as we all know life never is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hallmark sex murders","review":"So I was another of the millions who felt the simply MUST read this book, if just to keep a toe in the zeitgeist. So many people, including friends I respect, loved it. By the end of it, I was thinking if maybe I should be rethinking my relationships. This was the worst book I have read in a long, long time. Hackneyed prose, hackneyed characters, nothing to redeem it whatsoever.And it could have been so good! There was the potential here for a sort of murder mystery from heaven, the potential to explore our questions about What Comes After and the devastation of those left behind in a new and intriguing way. But the author gave us nothing but a premise unfulfilled, a pack of palliative lies, and some of the worse writing about sex to come down the pike in years.Alice Seabold is rich, rich beyond her wildest dreams - good for her. Don't feel you need to contribute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book after hearing so many people rave about it, but I found it incredibly disappointing. As mentioned by another reviewer, I too had to force myself to finish it - I kept hoping that the book would redeem itself by the end, but the writing was not strong enough to follow through on what, initially, is an interesting idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"As I read the last chapters of this novel, I heard music playing in my head--the kind of music that springs from hope and promises new beginnings. By showing us life from death's perspective, Alice Sebold gives new meaning to what we consider to be everyday moments. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has suffered an unexplainable loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book.","review":"This may be the best book you'll read this year; perhaps the best book of 2002. Alice Sebold tells a chilling story without histrionics or sensationalism, and her self-discipline makes the story all the more poignant. If you want a first-hand experience with what writing should be, treat yourself to The Lovely Bones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guy who hates Oprah Book Club but loved this book","review":"Based on hype, bought this book. It is thought provoking (what is death, what is heaven) disturbing (the evil of the murderer/rapist) touching (the portrate of adolescent love is right on) inventive (the whole notion of a narrator in heaven, who can observe current and past life everywhere on earth is an irresistable twist on the omnipresent narrator). Most of all the story is very good and interesting, and is told almost entirely without the sort of overwrought prose which too often infects books like this. In short, amazingly, this book rings true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down - A remarkable story","review":"This is a great book that should be read by everyone. From the moment I picked it up it became difficult for me to put it down. As I continued reading the story I became more and more interested in each of the characters...it felt as though I had known them my entire life. I look forward to reading more of Alice Sebold's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Sensitive","review":"If you don't like the idea of a grisly rape and murder of an innocent girl, don't read this book.The only thing worse than giving you all the gory details of the rape, murder and body disposal, is spreading out the details throughout the book. At least if you read a story with a murder, you can usually skip the gore at the beginning and then relax and enjoy the plot.The Lovely Bones, between the gore and distraught parents and family members, is not a pleasant read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!","review":"If you are going to read this book I suggest reading the first few chapters, skimming through the middle, and read the last few chapters. I can't believe I wasted 4 days on reading this book. I'm going to watch the movie, but after reading the book I don't have high hopes for that either. I can't really say why I didn't like it without giving away the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the Lovely Bones?","review":"Very good until the ending. I wish I had stopped reading before the last 2 chapters. However, I guess life is not always tied up nicely in little bows."},{"rating":"1","title":"{review}","review":"{my thoughts} - I must confess I watched the movie before I had read the book. The movie left me in a daze slightly confused as to what was actually being portrayed. I read the book in order to try and straighten out that confusion I had been left with. The book helped to create the imagery that I was not getting from the movie. It also gave me whole story aside from the bits and pieces that were put together in the movie. All and all I would have rather read the book and skipped the movie. It's a really nice read and it paints and interesting picture of what Heaven may possibly look like. It also shows that with a little determination and investigation it is possible to solve a murder.{reason for reading} - I had watched the movie and didn't understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie","review":"I think the author did a great job of narrating this story from the viewpoint of the murdered person. She's got perspective and some emotional distance from what happened to her. Very interesting and a little eerie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredibly Different Point of View","review":"I picked this book up and could not put it down. The very first sentance captured me. It was very moving and I can not wait to read it a second and third time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad to say it was a let down","review":"After reading about how wonderful this book is, and seeing its fabulous placement in the bookstores, I bought a copy for both my mom and I, thinking it would be great. After all, the premise is orginal, compelling...But neither of us could finish it. I made it to chapter 5 and my mom made it only to chapter 3. The protagonist, Susie, goes off on so many unimportant tangents, and the narrator (Susie, again) is portrayed to be omniscient--delving into everybody's thoughts--which I found hard to believe, and a bit irritating.Kudos to the book for the original storyline, but, for us, it was way too difficult to maintain interest in the storyline with all of the fluff.I'm happy that Sebold has been able to enjoy tremendous success with her debut novel--the dream of every aspiring author--but I found myself extremely disappointed, and I would not recommend the book, especially in hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting journey...","review":"This is one of the few books that I can honestly say kept my attention... I couldn't put it down! The book is written in first person, from the point of view of the murdered girl, Susie Salmon. The story gives you a look into the mind of Susie, who is watching the events on Earth from up in heaven. It shows how one family copes with the loss of their daughter, and how a community copes with the loss of a friend. It also shows how time is an eventual healer. The book takes you through the lives of these people, including the murderer himself, and how their lives end up.The only disappointment is the last 10 pages of the book. I thought that it ended too quickly, and that there wasn't much \\"closure.\\" I felt slightly empty, but for the most part, this book was interesting and will make you think about life and what may come afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads Like Poetry","review":"I loved this book. It reads like poetry in places and like a masterful mystery novel in others. It paints a detailed picture of the afterlife from the point of view of a murdered little girl. From \\"her\\" heaven she follows us through the sobering, surprising and suspenseful reality of her families lives after her death. This story is told with such sensitivity, it may move you to tears. On a brighter note, you are sure to meet a new friend during your commute by merely holding this very popular book. It is widely read for good reason. It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulitzer-candidate book","review":"This book is written on a highly interesting and intellectual level, exploring the dimensions of both the living and the dead. The fact that makes this book superior to others of its genre is that it is written from a unique perspective, that of a dead girl in her version of heaven, viewing the lives of all those who were important and remain so, while she was living."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the book.","review":"I thought this book was disturbing and wonderful all at the same time. My heart ached for the parents and brother and sister left to find their way. It is definitely an original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story...","review":"This was a different approach to a dramatic story of a serial killer -- it humanizes the victim and has great insight as to the stress those connected to the horrible crime suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and disappointing","review":"If this book had not been chosen for my book club reading, I would have abandoned it in the first third of the book. I'm sorry I wasted my time finishing it. It is a shallow tale with shallow characters, none of whom are appealing. There is too much wonderful literature out there to be spending time on this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"After hearing great things about this book, I decided to read it. It starts out about a girl who is murdered and can watch what's happening on Earth from Heaven. The book takes this narrative point for a while, switching back and forth from Earth to the girl. After a while though,the narrative stays on Earth, rarely going back to the girl. It gets very boring at this point, because they basically stop the murder investigation and the book just becomes about these people's lives. Very unsatisfying ending. I high DISreccommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Page-Skimmer!","review":"I read this book rather reluctantly. My roomate gave it to me months ago and I had no intention of reading it, but curiosity got the best of me. I wanted to know if it was really as good as everyone was making it out to be. Needless to say, I was let down. It did not hold my interest and I ended up skimming through many parts of the book. The last two chapters were so corny and far fetched it was almost laughable.It wasn't the subject matter that bothered me. The story lacked a sense of cohesiveness. It was very disjointed and I felt that most of the characters were poorly devloped and not very believable. I don't understand why the literary world has placed so much esteem on this book. Does the author have friends in high places? That is the only explanation I can come up with. If you are looking for a page-turner (with a satisfying ending) try A Thousand Acres by Jane Smiley or White Oleander by Janet Fitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I hated this book! It started in an interesting way, and I thought it would be wonderful. It soon rambled off into kindergarten pnilosophy. The action is extremely slow and focus jumps around without apparent reason. The ending was very disappointing. There are no likable characters. The narrator at first seems likable and certainly sympathetic, but the reader soon becomes impatient with the snail's pace of the action and the pointless digressions. I stuck with it the book even though I was tempted to give up many times. It was a waste of time and money. I feel qualified to judge because I taught literature on the college level for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"A good concept poorly executed. It opened promisingly and heartbreakingly -- those of you with adolescent daughters might really find the opening discomforting -- but quickly bogged down with weakly-developed characters, confusing time shifts and plot lines, and simplistic platitudes about love and loss.Unlike some of the others here, I didn't find this book spiritually hokey, I simply found it juvenile. It had the underdeveloped feel that I get when -- stuck for something to read -- I pick up a book that my 12-year-old daughter is reading. I don't regret reading it, butI wouldn't recommend it to anyone else as a great book to read.Sheri Reynolds covered similar ground with 5 star results in \\"A Gracious Plenty.\\" I'd recommend that you read that book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising, but an ultimate failure","review":"Sebold can write, but can she synthesize a plot, develop characters in a meaningful way, and create a well-rounded tale? No.The family dynamics illustrated after their daughters death felt like a strained attempt to create characters out of the famous stages of dealing with grief (denial, anger, depression...).The heaven Sebold describes is incredibly superficial (every wish is granted), unimaginative, and sentimental.Sebold tries to tackle far too much--too many characters and their emotional states, and she obviously adores nearly all of them, considering by the end, everyone's lives have become disgustingly and predictably ideal.The book does not come to any resolution, fruition, or conclusion, nor does it have any underlying message that I could glean from its pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimental pap","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend whose judgment I ordinarily trust. Unlike her promise, I couldn't wait to put it down! I don't mind well-written fantasy - say, Hundred Years of Solitude - but this just isn't close. It is cute, sentimental, a challenge to anyone's ability to suspend disbelief. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy book, shallow charcters, and not much of a story line","review":"I do not believe that this book got a rating beyond one star! I did not find this book interesting, in fact, it was very creepy and depressing. I bought this book for the interesting details of heaven. The author failed to bring this alive...she made heaven seem like a cold and lonely place. The charcters were all lifeless and a bit selfish...they seemed more concerned with themselves...."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not finish and glad of it.","review":"I had high hopes for this one, but I just couldn't finish it. The pacing was so inconsistent, that I found myself bored and skimming whole pages. What started with impact fizzled too quickly and my attention wandered, ultimately leaving me with a strong sense of detachment - I couldn't feel anything for the characters or their situation anymore, not even for Susie, the victim of a horrible rape and murder. In the end, I wasn't willing to keep plodding through it, so I put it down about halfway through. This definitely wasn't the read for me.Note: Since writing the above review, I have read other reviewers, here and on Goodreads, who did finish the book and provided spoilers for the ending. I am relieved that I didn't make it that far because that type of ending would have left me feeling angry and disgusted. I am so glad I didn't stick around long enough for all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! Not an uplifting novel!!!","review":"I really can't stand topics like this and Alice Sebold really takes the cake with her novels. They are horribly depressing. This book in particular. I mean, child rape and murder is such a horrid topic but the fact that the guy gets away with it in the end is what really ticks me off. I sat around with this book hoping for justice, and it just didn't come. I feel like I wasted my time with horrible subject matter only to be utterly let down in the end. Reading this book is like hearing nails on a chalkboard; excruciating. Unfortunately, a relative thought I liked this author and I read her next book too. Equally awful and depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones, A Teens Review","review":"The Lovely Bones: A Novel by Alice Sebold is a wonderful, well written, sad but touching story. It's about the rape, murder, and death of one 14 year old girl, Susie Salmon. It tells how her family copes with her death, the changes they go through, and the changes she goes through. It describes what is in Susie's heaven and how her heaven changes the longer she is there and the more she develops. Finally, it tells what happens to her murderer. Does he get caught for what he did or get off free?I think this is a wonderful but very emotional story. I read it for a school assignment and I'm happy I did. It's a great story but you have to realize what you're getting yourself into before you start reading it. It is sad and somewhat heartbreaking but good. I would recommend it to anyone, just as long as they know how powerful it can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, moving novel","review":"I started reading this book while purusing books at the Toronto airport waiting for a delayed flight. The first chapter was so painful and sad that I returned the book the rack and walked back to my gate.But the story haunted me and 20 minutes later, I had returned to the bookstore to purchase it. I finished it in one day.I'd caution parents of youngsters and teens about the first chapter ... it will make you seriously consider never letting your children out of your sight again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The opening really made me want to read the book--it was edgy and well-written (and as to the complaints of its being grisly, well, of course it's grisly. It's about murder!). But I became increasingly disappointed as I kept reading. The writing degenerated into sentimental mush and got preachy and extremely strange at the end. Integrity was sacrificed for a happy ending. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely Bones","review":"This book is horrible. It was a nice novel up until the last 10 pages or so and then it got really disurbing. She was writing a sweet, funny, touching book and then it got perverted and weird. The ending is not at all what it should have been --it leaves you feeling like you've watched kiddy porn. Don't bother reading this book - left me feeling really uneasy and troubled."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Not to Write a Novel","review":"In addition to the comments my co-readers have already made, I'd like to point out that the book takes place in an unmemorable suburb of a nameless (?) town in ???Ohio? Illinois? Idaho? wherever it is, it's completely devoid of any identifying details. Similarly, what era is the story supposed to take place in? Is it the 50s? 70s? 90s? By trying to be universal, it ends up being nowhere.There's a gauzy wishful curtain over the whole book, with the repentant mom redeemed by her husband's brush with death...For a contrast, read \\"The Corrections,\\" which is vivid and clean and unsentimental, and seems real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely Bones","review":"Alright, for those of you who as me are not the avid reader,this comment is for you. I am still forcing myself to finish this book,that I started a month ago,yes can u believe it. I thought, best seller, sounds iteresting,something different other than Nicholas Sparks (I adore his books), well I believe last I put down the book I was on pg. 90 and it still hasn't grasped my attention. I am very dissapointed in it. I am determined to finish it though,a promise I made before I can start reading the new Nicholas Sparks book, LOL. My opinion so far, waste of time and money, fortunately the book was a gift for me. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"rape=a fun read?","review":"The only people who would enjoy this book are the ones who think that reading a meaningless account of a young girl's rape/murder is fun.For the rest of us the book is horrifying, disturbing, and nauseating. It's also quite frustrating because the author foreshadows some sort of punishment for the rapist/murderer, but in the end the justice is tepid and disappointing.It would be one thing if the girl's suffering meant something within the book, but the author just uses that method of death for sensationalistic value. If she wanted to portray what dead people are thinking, why not have the girl die from something less horrific than rape/murder?Basically, the author exploits the topics of rape and murder and does nothing novel or interesting with them. Her book is a slap in the face to rape and murder victims and the people who love/d them."},{"rating":"1","title":"sentimental tripe","review":"Starting with a horrific crime, this book starts out as a good mystery but quickly becomes a sentimental cloying image of heaven. I was sickened by the crime, then sickened by the rest of the novel. It seemed to be a sort of combination of the movie Seven with the television series Touched by an Angel. Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most depressing book I ever read","review":"I have never read a more depressing book! Her \\"heaven\\" is not a heaven at all---there is no \\"longing\\" in heaven! I am just dumbfounded by all the praise for this book. It is a different viewpoint and innovative in that way, but it is beyond me how anyone could find comfort and hope between the covers of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked","review":"This book was awesome! I reccomend it to anyone at all that wants to read a good book, however give yourself a free night because almost everyone I know that has read it finished it in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificently read audiobook","review":"Other reviewers have expressed the sheer loveliness of this story. Having it 'read to you' by someone as adept at the job as this reader is an absolute joy. It did not feel like someone was reading a book aloud...it felt like Susie was sitting next to me, telling her story.Read the book. Listen to the audiobook. Do one, do both, you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better as a short story","review":"I agree with a lot of the reviews I've read of this book. Sebold's portrayal of life is original, from other books I've read, and beautiful in many ways. I think most people like to think about what life is like after death, and the portrayal in this book is just fascinating, if somewhat hollow. Its organization is sometimes difficult to follow, contributing, I suppose, to its surreal feel. In spite of that, it's a fast and basically light read, particularly in the beginning.My critique of this book is that it was a novel and not a short story. By about a third of the way through the book, I couldn't help thinking that the details were present in excessive abundance. I wished for a faster moving story, and I think this may well have been one of the most perfect stories I've ever read if only it had been just a bit more focused and, thus, shorter. None-the-less, I have to recommend the book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual but not great","review":"In Chapter I, a 14-year-old girl, Susie, is raped and murdered. She narrates the story from heaven. She doesn't make heaven sound attractive, nor does she seem particularly happy there. She is more concerned with the people she left back on earth. The heaven parts and what the author imagined its residents can do were boring and not very believable..... Most of the characters seemed more isolated from each other than from Susie. I didn't see any preparation or motivation for the mother's sudden desire to have sex with the detective working on her daughter's death. The neighbors gathering spontaneously in a cornfield for an impromptu memorial service on the first anniversary of Susie's death seemed corny.There are too many things wrong with this book to list them all. It has a few good moments, ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"The Lovely Bones is a book that stays with you long after you read it. A very satisfying and haunting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break...","review":"this is so not the best book of the summer. The great writing is all that saves an overwise dreary and unbelievable tale. I liked Susie's view of heaven. I did not like the \\"body-snatching of a former friend so she could sleep with a boy\\" scene. That completely lost the book for me. It was compelling enough to read, but it is not compelling enough to be the must-read book of the summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely story","review":"This is a very enjoyable story although its subject matter is sad. I like the way the author ties everything together, a very nice job writing. The parallel stories work well together and the sad emotions are touched on be not dwelled upon. You recognize the sadness is there but its presentation does not detract from telling the story. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating story about love and redemption","review":"The book was captivating and entertaining, even hard to put down. I enjoyed the bittersweet ending, although the final resolution of the plot line with the killer was a bit unfulfilling. Even that kept the realism of the story - everything in life does not wrap up with a neat little bow. My one issue lies in the fact that the story was more of a stream of consciousness rather than a story, and after thinking long and hard, I was left with a bit of a hollow feeling that there was not a lesson to be taken away. I still give high marks to the author for an incredibly well-written story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking","review":"This novel is fantasticly heartbreaking. I would recomend it to anyone who is a dareing reader, and is willing to cry through the pages of the book as Susies family and friends struggle to get by after her murder. I loved this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping, easy-to-read book, but a not light-hearted story","review":"Compared to music categories, I would definitely place this book rather in the \\"commercial\\" genre. But - and that's what I like about it - commercial, easy-to-read with quality.The book deals with the rape and murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon and the way her family copes with this loss after her death. On every move of her sister Lindsey, her little brother Buckley, her parents and her murderer, Susie is watching from heaven.There are moments when you will feel tears getting in your eyes, small details that show how much Alice Sebold knows about the pain and fear she is writing about. If you are looking for a stirring, fine little novel you will not be able to put down easily, go for it. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"Some one in our book club recommended this book.

Needless to say, I was disappointed; I really can't find anything good to say about the book. I feel as though I wasted many hours trudging through it with the hope that the ending would be worth the time. Again, sorry - the ending was just as disappointing as the rest of the story.

The 14 year old didn't seem like a 14 year old. Heaven didn't seem like much of a heaven. Trying to give it a chance, I continued on. Never did any of the characters touch me in any way...Never did I really care. Never did I forget that I was reading a book and that it seemed to be tedious at that. ..Finally, 3/4 of the way thru I gave up and gave it away.I want a novel to surround me, involve me.

After the first chapter I was hooked and bought my own copy the same day on amazon.com. To my dissapointment the first chapter was the climax of the book.

Plus, her life was so normal, their lives are so common there's nothing extra that makes you feel anyhhow."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's different.....","review":"This is a very interesting concept. I'm not sure what the author wanted to do. What type of story she wanted to tell. To me, it did show me a view of life as seen by a young person. While it was interesting, to me not very compelling.

That wouldn't keep me from recommending it. Heavens! Everyone to his or her own choosing, is my thought!But I got a bit tired of the heavenly circumstances and the fact that nothing would really be resolved. And having read the blurb from respected writer Anna Quindlen on the back cover, comparing this book to To Kill A Mockingbird, just makes me wonder who was paying her to write the blurb.The tragedy of this girl's death, horrible murder and rape and slaughter, and the continued life of her serial murderer is sickening. Justice played out by nature is good, even humorous; unexpected, yet predictable.I know this is a best seller, a runaway best seller, but I am glad I did not rush out to get it. I would have been disappointed. Am I glad I read it? Of course! I don't want someone else to make up my mind for me.Would I recommend it?

My wife tells me it got worse and worse. I'm shocked at how well-recieved it was... The writing is sloppy, we're given no descriptions of the characters, and the storyline makes you groan with its cliches. What really annoyed me were the incredibly strained metaphors tossed around, dice in a Yatzee game of literature, spinning like Disneyland teapots in the cosmos of ludicrousness. This was one gem: \\"leaden weights had been tied by anesthesia to the four corners of his consciousness\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sappy, Boring Bones","review":"The only reason I kept reading this book was to have Susie's murder avenged and explained to her family. Which it was not. The characters were unrealistic and unsympathetic. I didn't approve of Susie using Ruth's body to experience sex, as though Ruth didn't even matter. Susie made unwise choices in life and death, I suppose. The writing was hokey, the ending was anti-climatic to say the least, and I cannot understand how this book ever made the Best Seller's list, but then so did The Devil Wears Prada, and that was the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"The book would have been perfect if it ended at the first chapter.

If you like literature: skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"I got this book as a gift and the person who gave it to me used the word\\" hideous\\" to describe it and asked me to tell her my thoughts.Well, plain simple, this is an awful awful book! I could not even finish the book because it was dragging and 150 pages in, it just did not go anywhere. As much as I feel sorry for what happened to Susie, she is just a boring character!!!!I wound up skipped about 100 pages(and apparently I did not miss out much) and started glancing through the tedious paragraphs and when I got to the part of Susie(in Ruth's body) seducing Ray, I just could not take it anymore. You are raped and killed and instead of spending time with your family(while you have a chance to communicate with humans), the first and only thing you want to do is to have sex?!!!!A very pretentious and amateur read. If you dont have anything better to do, still do not give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"When I first started reading this book I remember thinking -- wow, this is good but right now I'm at about the fourth or fifth chapter and I'm getting bored with it. I don't even know if I'll finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"The Lovely Bones by: Alice Sebold, is about a fourteen year old girl named Susie Salmon. Susie gets murdered by a teacher named Goerge Harvey. When she dies she goes into her own version of heaven. While she is there she realizes how her death effected many people. Some of my favorite parts in this book is when Susie's father notices her presence. Another one of my favorite parts is when everyone that Susie knew (and more) made a bonfire to remember her. Those parts were very heart warming.I would recomend this book to anyone over the age of 11. Also if you are someone who doesn't like books that are graphically described then i would not recomend this book to you. If you like touching stories then this is a great book. It also may teach you something about understanding families who have lost a loved one."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the End","review":"As a writer Alice Sebold should be revered as a modern classic wordsmith. Her prose is hypnotic and poetic. She can grab a moment, both tragic and beautiful, and make the reader long to take it in no matter the effect. Especially moving were her sentences about the \\"Abigail\\" photo, and the \\"brokeness\\" in people that can be seen.The story, especially the ending, was my only hang up. I don't want to spoil it with detail but you will know exactly the moment it seems like Alice got real tired of writing. Despite the very humanistic appeal, I hope there are some aspects of Alice Sebold's heaven that are true. Peter Jackson has quite a surgical procedure ahead of him to fix this ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book","review":"I love this book... the topic is so sensitive and Susie Salmon is a girl like everyone, but in a extreme situation. Absolutely recommendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and Life-Changing","review":"A moving novel about a young girl, Susie, who was raped and murdered as a young girl. As she is in heaven she looks down and watches the people she loves, but also her murderer.Alice Sebold was born in 1963. She is married to a writer. Alice studied at Syracuse University and graduated from the University of Houston and the University of California. \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is her second novel that she has written. The first one is a memior titled \\"Lucky.\\"I personally enjoyed \\"The Lovely Bones\\" because of the main character Susie. She has a great personality and so much spunk, I loved how you got to hear how her life continued. I also really enjoyed the fact that Susie was in heaven and told her story from there. I thought that it was a very interesting way to show how her life continued. It was a very original and unique way that made the book even more interesting. I would reccomend this book to anyone that would like a good novel to read and a good story to fall in love with."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone nor would I advise anyone to read it.yes - maybe it's well written but I found the book to be very shocking, upsetting + not the least bit entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Book!","review":"This book takes you places you never knew existed! This is a fairly easy read (read it in 1 day) but it sticks in your head days following... I was pleasantly suprised to see the writer take on so many different tones and explicit beings... you feel with the character.. you become her!

In fact, I like how it started out, but I just lost interest. It just seemed to go on and on without ever really going anywhere.

It's too bad I can't create as much hype for her book. My club is reading ANGEL LOVER by Cynthia Cody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This book was truly stupid. The disintegration of the family theme following the murder of a child is an interesting one - but the \\"device\\" of the girl looking down from heaven didn't work for me - it was just too stupid.

Just read up to about page 75, skip the next 200 pages and then read the rest.What a cliche this book is. It reminds me of Summer Sisters by Judy Blume (a WAY better read, by the way). The mother who leaves her family because of her dissatisfaction with her life. The baby born and named after the beloved deceased. Was Susie's body ever found??? I don't know, because I scanned the last 1/3 of the book. I don't think it was. I don't really care anymore, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME","review":"I struggled through this book because my daughter wanted me to read it. I would have saved the effort after the first 50 pages if I had not been trying to spare my daughter's feelings.Boring...a waste of time and brain cells."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Bones","review":"I am a high school teacher and I like to read the books I see my students reading as it provides another venue for conversation. This book was a good read and it is written from the perspective of the deceased who still has the ability to watch her family and friends deal with the tragedy that killed her. Because of the way in which many kids \\"trust\\" too readily (my space, facebook etc) I thought it to be a great conversation starter.Though written from a teen perspective, I definitely was not bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Poetic","review":"Mesmorizing.I decided to slightly alter my style of writing after reading this book. It wasn't intentional, but I noticed some changes in my techniques.That is how great this story is: enough to seep into your mind and alter your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones, A Lovely Book","review":"This book, though sad and harsh topics, shows emotions and thoughts beautifully woven throughout. Not at all hard to follow and I was captured by it. I read it in just a few hours. I completely recommend this book to people mature enough to handle the sexuality and who won't be bothered by some graphic crime scene-type things (not incredibly graphic, but if bodies being cut up and then a part being found randomly would make you sick, don't read)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written!","review":"This book reads as a thriller/mystery but has so much to say about life and death. One of the best books I have ever read. Beautifully written. At times, very touching, funny. As I was reading this book, I thought, what a talent this writer has. Parts of it almost made me cry and I don't cry easily. I couldn't put it down and was so disappointed when it ended. I look forward to seeing more works from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Lovely Bones was such a powerful book. It's about a teenage girl who was murdered by her own neighbor and is now looking down from heaven watching her family move on with their lives. Definately not a book to read with the kids, though. I was suggest this book for mature 14 or 15 year olds to people in their 60s. A different perspective that really made me think."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be left with a warm fuzzy feeling","review":"A very good book but heartbreaking as well. I still can't understand how the girl came back to earth for a few hours but all in all a very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to the hype!","review":"I was away on business and forgot a book. So I went to the local BN and bought this book since I heard so much hype about it. The book started well, but lost steam for me. I finished the whole book but I do not think it lived up to the hype at all, much less enough for it to make it into a film. The advertisements around this book offered hope, and there is none to offer at the end of this book. I understand that evil doers do not always get caught, but I still felt very unsatisfied. Some of the concepts in the book was a bit too out there for me too. Overall, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found myself rolling my eyes often","review":"There were many places in this book where I found myself rolling my eyes and saying, \\"Oh, come on.\\" The writing is serviceable but not literary. Almost every plot point could be anticipated. I suppose its premise is somewhat original, but rather than feeling much emotion while reading this book, I just wanted it to be over with. Having had a teen-age friend murdered, I thought I would feel something more: my point being, I SHOULD have, but the book just didn't rise to that level. I found it to be simplistic and, frankly, sappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for adolescents","review":"\\"The Lovely Bones\\" belongs in a teenage babysitter series. It pulls its punches from the beginning and asks its readers to suspend both belief and intellect. I understand the romantic appeal to the gushy-gushy set, but unless you loved the movie \\"Beaches,\\" stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"This book is complete and utter drivel. It is poorly written and inconsistant. I don't understand how or why it is on the best-seller list. The author uses every overly dramatic movie-of-the-week cliche in this book. My theory as to why this book is so popular is that some marketing/advertising hot-shot remembered this piece of [junk] sitting on his or her shelf when the rash of missing girls occurred and decided to capitalize on these tragedies. A huge marketing campaign took place with this book when it first came out. There were even TV commercials for it. I find the whole timing of this book's popularity very disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total disappointment","review":"This novel had so much more potential for creativity and spiritualism. Instead, the characters were poorly developed, the omnipotent viewpoint wasted. What could have been a suspenseful murder mystery and tale of healing left me feeling totally empty.The ending was completely unsatisfying and bizarre, too--almost like an editor recommended a rewrite, and the result was two separate stories glommed onto one another.I must have missed something, but the critics' hype for \\"The Lovely Bones\\" seemed totally off the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start fooled me","review":"I have to agree with most of the other critics: this book starts well, in true page-turner style, then it sadly loses focus and ends up fading out tediously, not quite knowing what it wants to say. Obviously written with a movie in mind, complete with soppy-sad Hollywood happy-end. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with this book","review":"I anticipated reading this book based on the publicity surrounding it, and the fact that the film made from it received excellent reviews. This book is possibly one of the two worst novels I have read. I did not feel any emotional attachment to the characters. The story line was quite disjointed, and the ending just sort of happened. This needed to be a longer book, or a better story. It did not hold my attention and I could not wait to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh? Not my favorite!","review":"I was truly expecting more from this book. It took me in in the beginning, but started falling short about the middle. I saw the movie also and to me it would be a toss-up as to which is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I was so sad that she had died so horribly that I could barely read the first chapter. But, I stuck with it and am glad.This book, narrated from heaven, shows the after-math of the murder. What her family, friends, and even those that didn't know her (but knew of her)went through. Their mourning processes varied in time.At times, I did feel that the authors style was a bit juvenile. She often switched unexpectedly from one character to another: I had to re-read parts.I am the author of Summer Born: A Life With Cerebellar Ataxia"},{"rating":"2","title":"My most favorite read in a long time!","review":"I thought this was a great book. I couldn't put it down. Normally I don't care for the subject material, but I found myself captured by the story. It was often sad, but I wanted to read on. I can't wait for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"Sometimes the public is swept up in the hype of a product that delivers less than it claims to offer. The Lovely Bones is no exception. This novel is purported to be an insightful view of death, what tragedy means for survivors, and how those survivors navigate lives without someone they love; instead, it reads like a fictionalized account of a \\"Touched by an Angel\\" episode. The only force propelling this narrative forward was my dim curiosity about what would happen to Susie's killer - hardly the emphasis the author intended, I suspect. Additionally, Susie's experiences in heaven sound not unlike how purgatory is often described. An overly simplistic novel whose runaway success is most likely motivated by its I-Can-Read language and its appeal to sensitive types who watch PAX."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely indeed","review":"What a unique read this was. At first I found it a bit difficult to read. The whole premise of the book, losing a child, was heart wrenching. But once I kept reading, I found it difficult to put down. Sebolds ideas of heaven were wonderful and refreshing. Instead of being sad I found myself smiling. When I finally finished the book, (which was in just a night or two), I found myself missing it! I was intrigued from the moment I saw this book on a book review on tv. If it spoke to you, listen to your heart, you wont be disappointed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Type of Book","review":"I actually enjoyed this book. It was uniquely written and surprisingly held my interest. Though I enjoyed it and think everyone who reads it will enjoy it, I was disappointed in the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Many people recommended this book to me. The first quarter of the book captured my interest with the crime, but failed to keep me going. I skimmed the book very quickly for the second half and put it down. I am glad I did not purchase the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truly touching book","review":"hey all you guys or insensitive girls out there this is not another sappy story this book is really touching and has great understanding of what people go through it is actually pretty acurate i lost my little sister to a murder( shot in head) and the murder has still not been brought to justice this book relates alot and i had my whole familt read it and i recomend it to you. Alice Sebold is a writer who truly knows her stuff. this is a great buy and again i encourage oyu all to buy this boook and read it thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique point of view","review":"I admit I approached The Lovely Bones with skepticism, because I generally avoid even so called \\"literary\\" books involving serial killers, a subject American authors exploit shamelessly. I was pleased to find the treatment of that part of the novel restrained, and overall I felt the novel was indeed lovely--well written and interesting, despite some unnecessary tangents. Unique point of view, even if it made for a somewhat detached story.For another unique and enlightening story about grief, read Fran Dorf's SAVING ELIJAH. In a novel some might mistake for a ghost story, the \\"ghost\\" helps the reader see and feel the mother's despair from the inside, in all its ugliness and terror, which makes for a moving and authentic, if perhaps moreintense, experience. Take it from someone who's experienced such a loss.Grief is anything but detached. It's intense."},{"rating":"1","title":"The glass is half full","review":"This book is very well written for the first few chapters. Alice Sebold does a great job of developing characters and starting a plot line. Unfortunately this book should have been written as a short story, because after the main plot line develops in the first few chapters - nothing new happens. This book remains very dismal until the end. The mood about how a family deals with death is well developed in the first half of the book and regurgitated in every chapter after that. Alice Sebold had many opportunities to liven up the book with some humor, but passed. I would recommend reading the first half of The Lovely Bones and leave it at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short Review, Great Book","review":"When I first began reading the book, I felt like she was too young. Though her adolescence remains with her throughout the book, I find that she ages appropriately, and the main character grows on me.The book was perfectly suspenseful, and character development was done well for most of the family members with the exception of the enigmatic mother. I probably just disliked her.I don't intend to review the book thoroughly, but I would like to give it five stars and recommend it to other readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I loved parts, hated others. I found the end, ended too abruptly. It feels like two books. The first 85% is a suspense/how do you go on, and the last 15% is \\"say what??? I read all of this for THAT ending\\" but overall a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ghastly & The Grisly Become Lovely In Sebold's Hands","review":"The subject matter is grim, and the point of view is odd from the get-go. But don't let this plot mixed with serial murders and angels keep you from picking up what has to be one of the best books written this decade.Anyone who has ever loved, or ever grieved will be touched again and again by this graceful story of a family torn apart, and put back together again, by a daughter's murder. This is a portrait of a family so real you will swear they live next door.If you only read one book a year, make it a truly lovely one: The Lovely Bones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book--The Lovely Bones","review":"This book was really excellent--I read it in 2 days. It was very unique! The characters were extremely believable. It will haunt me for a long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"A meaningless, empty book!!!","review":"This book left me totally cold. It's hard to feel sad about a girl's death when she is the narrator AFTER it. She seemed very alive and not really suffering too much. Especially with the assertion that in heaven you have only to wish for something to make it happen. The story of her murder is equally proposterous. It seems impossible for the murderer to have done everything that he did and never be seen by anyone especially given the location of the crime scene. Her parents reactions seem forced as if the writer had a list of the steps that a grieving family goes thru and went down it one by one checking off emotions. The ending left me completely unsatisfied. It was totally contrived and obviously constructed to tie up any loose ends without thought to wether or not it made sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was just me","review":"A friend of mine literally forced this book on me to read this weekend, raving about it. The bad reviews here have just confirmed my own impression and I'm not going to bother finishing it.The major flaws are a dull, pallid writing style and characters as flat and cliched as the cast of a fifties' sitcom. There is not a single person in here I care about, least of all the murder victim.People ask why this book is such a hit. Because many readers can't recognize decent writing and like the idea that even the most heinous tragedy can be made painfree and feel good; after all, the victim is telling her story from heaven and the people she's left behind are getting on with their lives. If Oprah wrote fiction, this would be it. I loved the title by one of the reviewers, 'Touched by an Elbow.' That sums it up, perfectly.Atleast, this book was lent to me. Paying money for this? Now that's pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"As everyone else on this site, I read this book with very high hopes. It started well -and I was intrigued by the voice and character of Susie Salmon. The idea for the book is also brilliant: the voice of a victim. But after the first chapter or so, the book wanders off into the lives of undeveloped, uninteresting characters. The people are similar to television actors: very rote, predictable and identified through their sex lives. I was interested in Susie and began to feel she was being set aside so the novel could develop the romantic/sexual involvements of everyone else. This is what turned a rather bold idea into a mediocre meandering. Which is sad, because a very brave idea becomes just another formula novel of sex being the only thing really interesting to anybody. I don't know about other readers, but picking up a novel supposedly focused on the rape and murder of a child hardly sets the proper mood for \\"romance\\". Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing concept, but something's missing","review":"Initially, I thought this book would be a very interesting read. The concept of a young girl narrating the story from heaven is very novel. The description of her rape and murder is graphic, scary, and attention grabbing. Unfortunately, by the end of the book, there is not a single reason to care about any of the characters. With the exception of the protagonist, they are flat and unidimensional. And if you don't feel emotionally attached to the characters, then it is very difficult to actually care about what is going on in the book. I read the first half of the book in a couple of days - - and the remainder seemed to take literally forever to get though. I must have missed something because the critics loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bang then a whimper","review":"Chalk it up to to having read too many stellar reviews or having spent the summer talking myself into reading a book about a child raped and murdered, but now that I am finished, I admit, I am disappointed.In some eerie ways, the best of the book rests in its first few chapters. These are lucid, and raw and painfully descriptive--the murder, the early mourning, the landscape...As time moves on, however, the book devolves into an odd light touch. Susie lilts from place to place, person to person, commenting on their behaviors and actions. While you sense her longing to be back there in the thick of it, as a reader, you're not so certain you want to be there.Sometimes, you feel angst and sympathy, even empathy for the characters, but everyone is so lightly painted. It is hard to grasp on to something worth caring about for more than a moment or two. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people like this book?","review":"I had read all the glowing reviews of this book in newspapers and magazines, saw the author interviewed on the today's show, read the mostly 5-star reviews other people gave the book on this website, and heard a friend of mine simply rave about it--so I bought it and could not even force myself to finish it. The premise was so creative and it could have been a great story. Yet, the writing was so basic and not flowing. It was painful. I knew as soon as I read the first silly description of Heaven, including a Heaven in-take counselor, that reading this book was a mistake.

I wish I'd saved my money. To sum it up, the book was monotonous. I was amazed how Sebold could find so many words to say the same thing over and over. The characters were so dry, I actually got thirsty. The ending fizzled. I feel sorry for the dead if they are as tormented as Susie (the main character). This book left me feeling broke and frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to this book because of the terrific reviews. It was definitely a page-turner for the first chapter, then it was all downhill for me. I did not think it was such a terrific description of heaven! I hope heaven is not just wishing you are back on earth or living the lives of those you left behind with them. Not since \\"Cold Mountain\\" have I been so disappointed by a best seller. I would have liked this book better if the murder victim had just helped to solve the crime or recount how it was solved. Everything else was boring and pitiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death of a great premise","review":"I was surprised that this book was so simplistically written. I thought some philosophical and even metaphysical aspects of life and death would be delved into, but this is a sing songy children's book that at times is just plain annoying. The character development ranged from shallow to non existent and the heavenly narratives by the dead girl are weak. If you want some originality and a thought provoking read pick up PREY by Michael Chrichton and CLONED LOVE by Thorne Peters. This novel I thought was just drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"This was a great book. I really liked it, and I'm really picky about books. I willgive out one warning. This book is for people who do not get sick really easy.It's not ALL gruesome, but just a little bit is. This book goes along great withwhat's going on in our world today with all the kidnappings and killings of younggirls.My favorite character was Lindsey Salmon, Susie Salmon's little sister. Iloved the part about where she went into Mr. Harvey's house and she took thedrawing he made of the dug-out.Anyone with a TV sees all the young girls being kidnapped and thenbeing found later, dead in the middle of nowhere. It makes me think as ateenage girl, \\"Hey, this could happen to me.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagery that will stick with you.","review":"Because of the current epidemic of teenage-girl kidnappings, I read this book. Ms. Sebold's novel presents many interesting concepts: the breakdown of relationships in the face of tragedy, suburban fear of \\"the sociopath next-door\\" as well as the hopeful possibility of life after death, even if you don't believe in God (as he/she is not mentioned in heaven). I liked the book particularly for her imagery--after I read the book, I couldn't stop thinking about her descriptions of how a soul passes from here to there--it's comforting."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book.

It seemed to have a nice plot but the build up of the story and the characters was so ordinary. The novel being narrated by the dead girl, there is a subtle undertone of humor in the narration. Whereas, all the living characters have a sense of tragedy and loss enveloping them. However the story failed to evoke any emotion and I felt like a dead reader not feeling anything. It was such a boring reading that I gave up and could never finish the book to the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was I thinking?","review":"It sounded like an intresting book; murder,speaking from the dead, but as the story unfolded I realized I was reading a adolesent romance novel.ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't measure up to all the hoopla","review":"I was excited about reading this book as I had heard so much about it and it had been selected as a featured book on Good Morning America.

I do think the vantage of a girl from heaven telling the store was cleaver, but the store beyond that did not keep my attention. I found it highly predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary Sensuality","review":"This book was great in the beginning and I really loved it. But in the 2nd to last chapter, the descriptive sex scene was unbearable. This part absolutely ruined the rest of the book for me. This book is definitely not for younger readers, and it's worse than an issue of Cosmopolitan even for those older readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another reluctant reader, won over.","review":"The Lovely Bones reminds me of an \\"I see dead people. . .\\" version of something Anne Tyler would write. Although the subject is disturbing, it is approached gently. Alice Sebold writes a compelling story with a compassionate take on \\"what happens after\\" & alongside."},{"rating":"2","title":"*The Lovely Bones*","review":"Alice Sebold is indeed a great author, not bad for a premiring author. This story did captivate my attention that I couldn't even put it down. You grow on all the characters, as if you knew them in real life, especially Susie Salmon who was tragically murdered at the age of 14. This book made me laugh, cry and really think. As I turned each page, the plot thickened and grew more intresting and on the inside you felt hopeful, wishful thinking that they would soon capture her murderer. But be prepared, b/c there's not always happy endings to every story. And that's what I loved most about this book, the reality that life can often deal you, how you often have to think both optimisticly yet pessimistically, and learning to cope in different ways. But I would most certainly RECOMMEND this book to anyone. In fact, I already have. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Let Down...","review":"I agree that the book seemed a bit creepy, being that it's written from the perspective of the dead. The beginning chapters seemed to lead to no where. Several chapters into the book, the pace picked up but Alice Sebold lost me with a scene on spiritual possession. The ending presented no sense of closure. As the reader, you are left asking, is that it??? It ends there??? What a complete utter disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.....","review":"I borrowed this book from the library, and read it fairly quickly and was very disappointed in it. While I like the theory of our loved ones being able to view us and share in our lives from heaven, I found the book disappointing. I agree with the other reviewers that the only character one could relate to was the father. And to think of the mother having an adulterous affair and then later abandoning her family because she couldn't deal with the pain, I wanted to slap her. One reviewer said that she had a \\"heavy\\" feeling when she finished the book, and I agree with her, but I also have a nauseous feeling as well. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated this book","review":"It is depressing. and the last 3rd of the book is utterly ridiculous. Ugh, don't bother reading this, not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Tried to Like It","review":"I had heard how good this book was from so many people...and I really tried to like it.I felt like the author wrote from an interesting and unique perspective, but didn't know what to do with the story once she got it going.The supernatural parts were unbelieveable to me and distracted from what could have been a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Because I let myself be convinced by so much publicity about this book I bought it (they even made a program in NPR). Don't make my mistake. Maybe because my favorite books are historical fiction with good storylines that keeps you glued to the pages, I found this book really boooring. It was difficult to keep reading it because I could not care less about the characters. Its like a \\"7th heaven\\" tragedy mixed with the \\"The Wonder Years\\" (do you remember the series with Fred Savage?). I read 2/3 of the book and I was not sure I was going to finish it; I finished it so I could write this review and warn other people about it. I did not even like the narrative, too simplistic. I won't recommend it unless you are a suburban mom that can identify her family with the one portrayed by the book, then you might like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book gives maudlin a new definition!","review":"Geez - what a book. The only reason I finished it was it was selected by a book club I belong to. What a piece of slop! And the point of it was_____? You tell me. Move over Jonathan Edward, Alice Sebold is leaving you in her wake....What a pointless exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Wow, what a disappointment. To borrow from several previous reviews this book is best summed up as an Afterschool Special - Teenaged Murder brought to you by Hallmark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book starts out fairly intriguing, but this only serves to heighten the sense of disappointment which follows. For a book about death, grief and the afterlife it is incredibly shallow and trite. Susie's heaven is empty and depressing, and the 'climax' is idiotic. Apparently the most meaningful thing the author can come up with is a couple of teenagers hopping in the sack. I find it hard to believe this book was written for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"Thank goodness for libraries. I was able to checkout a free copy and not spend my hard earned money on this. The visions of heaven were actually disturbing to me. I'd hate to think that once I get there I still have the human characteristic of worry, pettiness, regret, longing and unhappiness.By the way, she spent quite a bit of time interacting with her high school love, why didn't she instead find a way to stop George Harvey or at least help those on earth find her remains.I thought the main character was selfish and self adsorbed.If you MUST ready this book and its not a must, go get it at library instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I think the reason this book got such press is the shock factor of the first chapter, the grafic rape and murder of 14 year old Susie Salmon. To be honest thats where the story ended for me, nothing else happened... The rest of the book didnt hold my attension it was an effort just to finish it.Ive also seen the movie, thats why ive given the book a 2 star, the movie was even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero star rating","review":"An agonizing read. The author tried too hard to manipulate the emotions of the reader and instead of being drawn in to the story and the tragedy, the book becomes completely unreadable. Overall, the writing is very mediocre, the storyline trite and sentimental, and the characters completely unmemorable. Plus, Oprah book club pick...of course!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, great beginning, then it just dies","review":"After seeing the movie review, I was more than excited to read this book that I was positive would become a new favorite. Wrong. The beginning was great, it caught my attention, and I wanted to see what happened. The climax though occurred in the *middle* of the book. With nowhere to go from there, the author just drug out the story, filling it with pointless trivia about the victim's family and friends. I kept going though, wanting to know how it ended. Then I got to the end and had to ask myself - what was this author thinking!If you're looking for a murder mystery as told by the victim, this unfortunately is not your book. If you're looking to read about the mundane lives of a family and their friends that you don't particularly care about, happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story line, but not worth reading","review":"The first half was interesting so even when it started to drag in the middle I kept with it thinking it was going to pick up again. It never did.**spoiler alert******************Not only was the second half of the book tough, but how she \\"takes care\\" of the bad guy made me feel cheated. Part of sticking with the book was about finding out what happened to him. I couldn't believe I read the entire book. It was so frustrating to drag myself through whole thing, that the author had just barely strung me along and wasted my time. I promised myself to not read another release by Alice Sebold (unless she does some major growth as a writer). This may sound like a contradiction, but it could be a good movie, because the overall story line is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The definition of Maudlin","review":"Corny and effusively sentimental, with a too-tidy ending that brings justice to all. I didn't connect to any of the characters because they were all entirely unreal in a stereotyped way, much like a 1950's sitcom. The one positive is that I felt compelled to finish it. This book is best suited for the person in your life that collects angel knick-knacks and needs to feel like \\"in the end, all the poor suffering children will have their own gazebo on a cloud!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story","review":"While The Lovely Bones is not the best book I have read, I was not disappointed when I finished the Novel. This Book held my attention throughout the entire story and I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was okay.","review":"I didn't really like it. After all the publicity it got, I was expecting.... more somehow. It started out wonderful, but it really dragged in the middle. There were times when it didn't seem like anything was happening, plot-wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't sustain my interest","review":"The author did a fine job with similes and strong verbs. I enjoyed her writing style. However, after 53 pages I got bored with the story and gave up. The setup was fairly interesting, but neither the characters nor the story hooked my emotions. The fantasy about Susie's heaven was dull fluff. I can't believe this was the top fiction seller of 2002. Was this an Oprah recommendation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Macabre and tedious at the same time","review":"This is a story that indulges a taste for the horrific details of a loathsome crime, the capture, rape, murder and dismemberment of a young girl. The storyline is, on the surface, awful indeed, but the hype surrounding the book led me to believe that the novel rose above that to deliver some uplifting message. Acquaintances who had read the book said it was pretty good.Why?Can people be so insecure about their own mortality that they are willing to grasp at straws such as these for reassurance?This story just made me feel bad. If I could give it less than one star, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment of a Novel","review":"I too fell for the hype. So much has been mentioned over the past few months about this novel and I fell for it and bought it. As stated in previous reviews, after the first chapter or two, where the shock and horror of the experience of the murder and rape of a young teenage girl has you focused on the events as opposed to the writing, you find yourself surrounded by poorly developed characters, a non-sensical story-line and page after page of silliness. This novel doesn't know what it wants to be... a serious crime-solver novel, a teenage soap opera, a romance, a supernatural thriller... too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"If you lie awake at night wondering if you'll see your pet in heaven, then this book is for you. Although praised for its graphic opening, the author paints a very simple picture of complex subjects (rape, murder and divorce to name a few) and has trouble finding an ending. Save your money and take a walk in a park the next time you are seeking answers to life's questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish someone would have told me","review":"This book was absolute pointless nonsense. Ms. Sebold's storyline was sophmoric at best, and a thorough waste of my time. My only reason for finishing her novella was that it took no brains to read and was sort of like a car wreck (horrible to look at, but in its horror, fascinating).I'm sorry I bought it and cannot believe that it was as highly recommended as it was. Bring back your book club, Oprah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Draaaag onnnn","review":"Began great...then dragged on and on. I got bored very fast!! I heard it was supposed to be an amazing book but I could not get through. Did not keep my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't believe this was a best seller","review":"Very depressing book, or maybe just not my cup of tee. Young girl murdered (gruesome) and then watches herfamily from heaven. Would not recommend (sick mind of this writter!)Do not want to get depressed reading a book ~ not uplifting at all. Give me a break (best seller???) Very bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Led Astray","review":"I stop reading books if I'm not grabbed within the first couple pages or at least within the first chapter. I was tricked with this book. I thought after downloading and devouring the preview of this book I'd stumbled across a winner, but after purchasing I was sorely disappointed.Let me sum it up for you. Girl is abducted and killed, family is forever altered and messed up, dead child has weird experiences on the other side. I like movies and books that take on a challenging and devastating topic, but this book lacked any redeeming quality. If you like to take a look into someones messed up life, and enjoy a beginning but no destination, you will love this book. Save yourself a miserable journey and find another way to depress yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"characters can feel more than one emotion","review":"I've never written a review on-line before, but there has been so much hype about this book I finally gave in and bought it. It's a gutsy premise for a book, and , as many others have said, starts off strongly, but when Sebold tries to do the really difficult stuff - tangle and untangle the pain, anger and emotions in response to such a tragedy - she fails. Each character seems to have only one response - Dad is pitiful, Mom is detatched, little sis goes on to leave such a charmed and uneventful life it simply is not believable. I don't want to give anything away in the book, but when events happen that would make Mahatma Gandhi angry and all Dad does is weep you just lose interest. It is the writer's job to make a character complex, but whenever Sebold comes close to something,she pulls back and throws in another character, from the town or a roadside diner or school. It ends up being a very superficial treatment of a very powerful subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"I read this book in less than a day. It is a quick read, but at the same time not a word is wasted. High marks for Alice Sebold in her first novel. The story moves along at a quick pace, and the subject matter is treated with less darkness as one would expect.At times you may not realize how cleverly Sebold has enabled her narrator, Susie Salmon, to slip from first person to third person omniscient. This is truly a talented writer and I look forward to her next work.Some readers may be put off by the ending which seems to be missing the great sense of finality and vengence we all seek, but it is more realistic than you realize. The characters are true to life and very solid. You will recognize yourself, you parents, your friends and your loved ones in one or more of the individuals in this tale. Pick it up today, read it, and pass it on tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Book but Then .....","review":"I'd waited months to read this book (before I'd finally gotten around to getting a copy of it) and dove right in after receiving it. My honest opinion? The first 21 chapters are AMAZING. They are filled with humor, sadness, and a 14-year old's perspective that really brought back some memories of my own (I was a child of the 70s also). However, around the 20th chapter or so, the author seemed to lose direction and the book went from being a sweet story to something resemblimg \\"Tales From The Crypt\\" or \\"The Twighlight Zone.\\" It was a huge let down after reading all of those first chapters that were so beautifully written! I'm not sure what happened in the writing process to make the tone change so dramatically in the end but I'm glad I read it since everyone is talking about it. I wouldn't recommend it to others because of those last few chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a strong story","review":"This book was really interesting in the beggining but it totally fell apart and dragged on in the middle. The ending straight up sucked. It seemed like she just totally ran out of ideas. I don't know, I didn't like it at all. I thought this book was totally over rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karla's Review","review":"The Lovely Bones By Alice Sebold was one of the most interesting novels I have ever read. The story is told from heaven by Susie Salmon,a young girl who was brutally murdered at the tender age of fourteen. The family is torn apart by the tragedy.The marriage between Susie's parents deteriorates, eventually resulting in the mother running away from everything. The middle daughter, Lindsey, is forced to grow up and assume the role of Buckley's \\"mother\\", the four year old son and brother. In so many parts of this book I felt like bursting into tears, in others I could feel hatred boiling inside of me, and sometimes I thought I could almost feel the families joy and wanted to celebrate with them.It was such a great experience. I would reccommend this book to anyone, whether or not you belive in the afterlife."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definition of \\"Coming of Age\\"","review":"The Lovely Bones is a heartbreaking and uplifting read from new novelist, Alice Sebold. The reader is immediately sucked into the life and afterlife of Susie Salmon, a fourteen-year-old murder victim. Through Susie's eyes, the reader is able to observe the life of her family and friends after the tragedy and watch as they mature and continue with their lives. Her life before and after her death was entertaining and somber to read and the characters were well developed. Susie herself is very likeable and I couldn't help but feel for her as she longed for the life of the living, though Susie, her killer and the reader know her life on Earth is over.While some portions of the book may seem over the top, nonetheless the novel is surreal and unforgettable. What's more, the ending may seem too perfect to some but it absolutely works for this book and you would not want the story to end in any other way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginning was great!","review":"When I first started the book I was hooked. Not just because of what was happening to Susie Salmon but all in all it was very touching, and moving. But towards the middle and the end of the book I must say I was struggling to finish. I even put it up for a few weeks and then went back to finish it up. Good but not all the hype that it has been given."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book is about Susie Salmon, a girl who was murdered at fourteen. The book focuses less on her murder and more on her life. You follow along with her as she looks on from heaven at the people that affected her while she was alive. The book made me laugh and cry many times over. It grips you at the first sentence. It was one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunning & Beautiful Story","review":"I was completely blown away by this book. Sebold tells the story from the point of view of a dead girl, beginning with her murder, and ending 10 years later, as the protagonist views her family from heaven. The story is told in an extremely poignant fashion without becoming a tear-jerker or an overly emotional \\"statement on the human existence.\\"The story itself, the plot, the characters, and the narrative style are portrayed very intelligently, though there is nothing pretentious about it.The scenic descriptions are sublime, and there is suspense involved, though this isn't in any way a mystery. The characters are slowly, but fully, developed, and the passage of time is shown with a light hand.I will read every book Sebold writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"If there is one book out there to read, this may well be the one, for it will pull you through a range of emotions that most books can only hope to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlovely Plot","review":"My mother-in-law gave me this book to me to read, which was given to her by her older son, my brother-in-law. It was not a topic to her liking, but she thought I might enjoy it. Like many readers, I found the very first pages engrossing, but the prose got forced,the sentimentality too much, and the switching of bodies for the sake of some sort of happy ending of sexual union did it for me. HUH? The potential strength of the book is that it presents a wonderful opportunity for the kind of internal dialogue warranted by the unique situation of the narrator--she is in heaven and now sees everything from up there. But by allowing her to have this extremely physical experience, the author squanders this wonderful opportunity, so the strength of the book becomes its weakness. I suppose the prose can be captivating since it has the aura of an omniscient, stream-of-consciousness narrator, but then again, there are better stream-of-consciousness books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"Aside from having a whacked-out name, The Lovely Bones is really a great book right up until Susie's fall back to Earth. It made the whole story lose steam. Other than that, I really liked it, especially Lindsey's teenage years and how she deals with her sister's death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet story of brutal tragedy","review":"A well constructed story of tragedy that is pleasant to read. Felt like a lighter version of The God of Small Things in that regard. Good character development and well paced. I particularly enjoyed her imaginative rendition of what heaven is like. I did not cry until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible story...","review":"From the eyes of a child murdered - it is both saddening and at the same time inspiring. The story of a girl watching what happens on earth after she is murdered, it was hard to put down. With 3 kids I still HAD to finish it and did in 4 days. It is that hard to stop reading. I recomend it to anyone who has a heart but also likes the suspense of mystery also."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I had a hard time putting this one down.

Then suddenly I felt that one evening while watching \\"Ghost\\" Ms. Sebold's editor called and said he needed the book. She hurriedly finished leaving out all the depth of her early writing. Susie's \\"return to Earth\\" was totally unnecessary, almost insulting, to the wonderful character that had been developed. The mother's acceptance back into the family felt tacked on as did George Harvey's fate. In short, I don't understand the huge success of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see how anyone could like this","review":"By the time I got to the end of this book I was just flipping through the pages, skimming them for anything that seemed interesting. I had high hopes for this book, but I think, and I believe that any critical reader would agree, that there is no substance to this book. I dogear pages in books that contain some jewel of language that I think pertains to my life or has some insight on human nature. I didn't dogear a single page in this book. Don't buy it. If you must buy it, buy it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"stomach turning","review":"Oprah would've loved this book. You've got your classic female victim: an innocent young girl. You have your tragedy: an ugly rape and murder scene. You have your female triumph: the victim goes to heaven. You've got your weak, evil or helpless males. And then you have a lot of garbage filling the rest of the pages. The family, which wasn't wrapped that tightly to begin with and we, along with our heroine get to watch. Ick. This is a slobbery, sentimental, poorly written triffle. It should have been called As the Stomach Turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"This book should be read only by people with an open mind. What an amazing book. This book gives you a different perspective on life. It made me cry, very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a Light Read","review":"I am enjoying this book and hope to see more from this author! I read it quickly but would not consider it a \\"light\\" read. The characters have depth, and it has honest, believable dialogue. The first chapter covering the girl's abduction is gritty but it reflects events we read about daily in newspapers. The book overall demonstrates that violence impacts and changes everyone. Would be great for a book club because the book touches on many topics for discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish that I could of liked it","review":"I was really excited to start reading this book. It has received so much attention. It turned out to be a big disappointment for me. Maybe it was the reality of it. I am not sure. I don't need reality. I see it every day. I wish I could say something good about the book and I can't. I can't even call the book creative because I feel it was a rip-off of the movie \\"What Dreams May Come\\" that won an Academy Award back in 1998."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE disappointment","review":"The Lovely Bones was a huge disappointment and I am embarrassed to have fallen for the pre-release hype that led me to purchase it.

If you really want to read a book that makes you think and makes you worship your still living The Lovely Bones is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm stumped","review":"I just don't understand how this book rose to bestseller status. The writing is average at best, and the concept too weird to sustain my interest. Granted, the first fifty or sixty pages held me, but after that I put the book down and didn't pick it up again. Maybe timing is the answer to this book's success. Yeah, that's it. Has to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I read this entire book chasing the promise of the really good story this could have been - it didn't even have a good ending when I got there after wading through page after page of tediousness punctuated by a bright spot every now and then. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely read","review":"Enough has been said on this in the many reviews. Suffice to say here that I enjoyed this and I think you will too. The story is sad yet fascinating. The unique perspective given by the \\"view\\" of the murdered girl allows the author to explore the effects of the murder on the family and friends. We know who did it - it is not a detective novel. It is a unique book in my opinion. It is not 5 stars as I was not fully convinced on some scenes and the ending sort of fizzled out. I am not a believer in the afterlife so do not let that aspect put you off. The device of using this as a unique perspective works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Read this after my cousin lent me it when it was really popular a couple of years ago.I couldn't tear myself away from it until I was finished even though it was heart wrenching to read.The heaven that was depicted and the different view points just blew me away.

I waited years to watch it just because this book was so amazing that I knew it could never live upto it.I don't often read serious books but you just have to read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book. I saw the movie first and expected them to be similar. The book however is much more brutal in the description of the attack. I love the book but did not expect it to be so graphic and brutal.

Many instances of dissonance and downright dichotomy in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"More hype than substance","review":"I'd read so many high-octane reviews of Lovely Bones that I began it with great hope and anticipation. Unfortunately, I ended it with a whimper. The engaging premise was ripe fruit left to die on the vine. The book moved slowly and I never felt a great deal of empathy for the characters, except perhaps the father. There was too much nuance; too much literary stylishness; too little that touched my heart or challenged my mind. And I was really turned off by the body-borrowing that went on late in the book. Not exactly sorry I read it, but ....hmmmm... well, maybe I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"There was a lot of rambling and jumping from one story line to the next.

It was very cliche too.Plot of book was creative but not unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Depiction of Humanity","review":"This was a wonderful book. I felt the author really understood emotion and the grieving process. I enjoyed seeing the different aspect of grief and life from the point of view of many different characters.

The first third of it somewhat lived up to my expectations but after that it was terribly disappointing. I felt like the author was trying to sound clever and deep rather than just telling an interesting story in an honest fashion. It was bizzare and not in a good way. I was totally unsatisfied with the characters and what happened to them. There were so many things that I wanted resolved and explained. I realize that life doesn't often give us neat resolutions and explanations, but I just felt like this book needed SOMETHING to redeem it. It was disjointed after the first few chapters, and a better ending would have helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word: AMAZING!","review":"This book is the best! I literally couldn't put it down! Alice Seabold is marvelous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good novel","review":"The first chapter of the book sucks you right in. A friend of mine was reading this and I read the first couple of chapters and wanted a copy of my own, so I got it. It's a unique kind of novel, with a kind of plot that I have never read before, which made for a very refreshing read. I won't say that this book was perfect - but for a debut novel it's pretty darned good. There's enough twists and turns and seeing how different people deal with the aftermath of Susie's death - and how what happened to her has repercussions for years and years to come in unexpected ways.I will be honest, I was disappointed in the ending for Susie's killer. It felt rather anticlimactic to me after all the stuff he's done, but that's also a reflection on real life - for all the murderers and rapists that get caught, there's those who get away with it. Overall a great book, especially for a debut. A solid 4/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I thought the premise of this book had some promise, but I was very disappointed throughout. One of the worst books I have ever read. The writing style was tedious and the narrative often confusing. I despised the \\"reincarnation\\" scene in which Susie, who was brutally raped and murdered at age 14, has sex with an old boyfriend. How did this book get published? Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"No...really?","review":"After hearing all about this book and how great it was, I decided to read it. I'm astounded at how amateurish the writing was. It was like a fairy tale being watched from above. Honestly, I do not understand how this even made it to print. The ending was so anticlimatic. The only real tragedy is I actually spent time and money on this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Strange","review":"I read this book because someone dear to me wanted me to read it. I had no intention of reading it before. I have read a book similar to the premise of this book and I thought that book was enough. I knew from the first chapter that I would not enjoy this book. The victim is not a person I really liked. She was a teenager and her friends are teenagers. Their lifestyle is promiscuous as are most of the characters in the book. I did not grow up in such an atmosphere, so I couldn't identify with any of them. I didn't find the book uplifting or even exciting. I might want to see the movie out of curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 5 bucks","review":"Not near as good as hyped up to be. I was not impressed with the authors style. Prefer James Patterson anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This book was not at all what I expected. I was left sad and frustrated after reading it. I was only able to finish it by telling myself that the murderer would be caught or that her body would be discovered. Unfortunately, even though the writer teased the reader with the possibility of both, neither happened. The reader, through the eyes of the poor dead girl, helplessly watched as the family fell apart. I felt so sorry for her father and just as strongly despised her mother. As for the writing, the sentence structure was so strange that I spent half my time re-reading. Someone asked me if it was because it was being told by a teenager. I could allow for that, except that the school systems back in the 70's still expected students to use proper grammar. Overall a real disappointment that I would not recommend to anyone. I had planned to see the movie, but after reading the book, I won't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family frustration on a lost of a child.","review":"Alice Sebold describes in this novel what she thinks heaven and hell are at the eyes of a murdered little girl.And how she helps give confort to a family who has been affected by blood and evil.It helps us see the reality in which we live in.We must be aware of the people who surround us so no one we love becomes a picture on our milk carton as the 9 year old girl from lonely bones.Great book,very sad story of today's reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Therapy For the Author - Unpleasant For the Reader","review":"If you want to cry and like seeing other people in anguish and pain, this is a book for you. I'm not sure why this is such a popular book? A wrenching murder and then the painful aftermath are studied in great detail. This isn't an experience I would wish for anyone, so why do we need to read about it? I guess I was expecting something more based on the book's popularity. Probably it's my fault. High expectations often create a difficult hurdle for an author to overcome. I hope others found some solace or value in this. It was just a difficult downer for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent...but that's all","review":"I am in agreement with another reviewer who is confused by all the raves that this mediocre book is inviting. I didn't think it was so great. Perhaps this is due to its following Tartt's The Secret History in my reading order, but this was only second-rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Stocking Stuffer!","review":"I felt compelled to offer a simple review of this book after having read some less favorable customer reviews. I have recommended this book to both my family & friends, something that I am not in the habit of doing. I have never submitted a review for a book I've read before, but I do so now to encourage others to be touched by a emotionally charged story about family perserverance, lasting friendship, and perhaps most of all, eternal life. This is a must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I think all the hype behind this book set me up for a bit of a disappointment. The premise of the book had a lot of potential, and I feel the author followed through pretty well. Although I thought the book might go in some other directions, and could have been a bit longer, I nonetheless thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it is a good sign when you feel a novel is too short, it means you wanted to read more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heaven can have it","review":"The fundamental conceit in this book is just too ridiculous- a book from heaven? A sad, depressing story is told in a fundamentally cheap and trite way that washes away any interest in the characters. If there were a heaven, they'd surely be able to do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't count how many times I almost cried.","review":"A very touching book, I got a little sense of Nicholas Spark's style in it but with a little more of a story to it rather than just another love story.This is a perfect airplane book (which is when I read it) an easy read if you've got nothing else to really do.It's really hard to write a review of a fiction book with out giving away parts of it, but you can tell somewhat that it's a debut novel for the author, the writing style is slow at times but the story keeps it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated to Say the Least!","review":"I didn't like this novel at all.At the beginning, I found it interesting enough to continue reading. Needless to say, this was at the very beginning. I was determined to continue reading the book, seeing as I started it and there were so many people raving about it, that I thought it should get better.It didn't.The story drags along. And then, it hits a nonsensical point of no return. I remember when I came upon this point in the book, I almost threw the book down and actually said outloud, \\"SERIOUSLY? OH COME ON!\\"I have no interest in reading any other books of the author. Her writing style is just not interesting at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"overhyped!","review":"I found this book mildly engaging but contrived. The characters were stereotypical and one-dimensional; the situations were predictable. One scene, in particular, made me mutter \\"Oh, come on\\" outloud.At the risk of sounding like a snob, I have found that books this popular are seldom very good from a literary standpoint.This definitely fits in well with the Oprah type \\"woman's voyage of self discovery\\" tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of trees","review":"The book started strong. But, after dragging the story for years out and all the unnecessary stuff like the mother's \\"actions\\", the grandmother appearing from nowhere, it became a total bore. It just was a waste of trees. This book could have been written in maybe 150 pages (at the most)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT well written","review":"I really looked forward to reading this book, seeing as how it has been on the bestseller list for ages. What a HUGE disappointment! While I found the first half of the book rather engrossing, mid-way thru it literally just fell apart. It made me think that the writer simply ran out of ideas and was searching for a way to end the book. I almost didn't even finish it, because I totally lost interest. Don't waste your money or time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding!","review":"How can the reviewers be so wrong? As I read this book, I kept on saying \\"No!\\" There is nothing credible about it. And it is icky. Heaven is reading Glamour Magazine? An alcoholic grandmother is the embodiment of love? A dead girl enters another girl's body to complete her life's ambition to have sex--and she was 14 when her life ended?I wanted to retch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Finish","review":"The only reason why I read this book from cover to cover is because I hate not finishing things I start. It took me a total of about three whole agonizing months to finally get to the end, and I only succeeded because I was on a flight to Jamaica. One more month, and I probably would have forgotten about it. Bookstores need to take this book of their bestseller bookshelves and quit teasing readers into thinking that it is a good read--it was terrible.The only reason I gave this book two stars was because the beginning hooked me, but everything past that had nothing to do with what hooked me in the first place.If you like stories with shallow plots or don't mind it when the antagonist gets away, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, steer clear and don't waste your precious time like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so good about it?","review":"I have read about a third of this book and have decided to stop. I honestly don't know what the fuss is about. It started okay and is now downright boring. Save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading all the hype of this book, I was very excited to dive into something worthwhile. After getting through 1/2 of the book, I was extremely disappointed and bored. I just had to finish the book since I already made it that far plus I was curious to see how all the loose ends would be resolved. Needless to say I was not satisfied with how everything ended. The author ended everything on a positive note. Yet I didn't feel justice was served and the murderer got away easy, compared to what Susie went through on Earth and goes through in Heaven. If you are looking for a exciting read and feel good read, this isn't the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment!","review":"An interesting idea and good beginning but it soon trails off into a rambling and unconvincing story. Yes, the recovery of the family is well done but the novel moves in fits and starts and eventually has a really contrived ending. Like another reviewer, I'm reading this for a bookclub or I would never have bought a copy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"I love mysteries and thrillers of all kinds, and dramatic fiction that is unique and challenging. This book didn't fit into any of these catagories for me. I can't deny its popularity, but I can say it wasn't my cup of tea.I was glad when I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Bones","review":"I thought this book was very good. It was very interesting and kept me interested through the whole story. The book had many details that made you know how Susie felt when something was occuring. Alice Sebold's way of writing was very descriptive and smart. There were alot of emotions in this book that made you understand where the author was comming from. I would recommend this book to anyone who can stand to hear harsh details about uncomfortable situations. I thought it was interesting that the story actually came from a first hand account by the other. She was writing about her life becuause she was also raped but wasn't killed so she really made you be able to relate to the character. I thought this book was very interesting and kept me wanting to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Hype, Not Enough Substance","review":"I was not impressed with this incredibly promoted, overly hyped novel. The subject matter is of course, controversial and I felt it could have been handled alot better. The narrative was awkward in places and was basically 8th grade reading level. Not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a disappointment...","review":"While this book was entertaining through the first half, I found that the author seemed to lose sight of where the book was going, how it was going to end, and why it was even written. I was pulled into the story immediately with the crime that the story revolves around. Then, about halfway through the novel I lost interest as nothing was really happening. The ending, which I struggled to get through, was silly and disappointing. I pushed through to the last pages hoping the ending would at least be a bang, but unfortunately it was a barely a whimper. With all the incredible fiction out there, I would not recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are Sebold's characters doing?","review":"I wanted to love this book. Sebold's characters do things that literally make no sense. The surviving sister is shaving her legs for the first time and her dad comes into the bathroom while she's doing it and stays to talk with her. Am I supposed to believe that took place? This scene as written is just one that needs a re-write. I could not believe the preposterous situations Sebold wrote her characters into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"The reason I bought this is because of a review I heard on NPR stating this was one of the year's best novels. It makes me rethink my annual donation to public radio. It is easy reading and is written from a unique perspective but has an absurd endinging and underdeveloped characters. You should feel sorry for the mother in the story bc she has lost her child instead I thought she should have stayed in her minimum wage job in Napa after deserting her family. The ending was ridiculous with the Susie's reinactment of Ghost where Demi Moore invades Whoopie Goldberg's body. Then the piece de resistance is when the murderer is killed by the icicle. Give me a break. I have never been so interested in selling something on eBay."},{"rating":"1","title":"She must have 1700+ friends that gave positive reviews.","review":"It started off strong, but that really only lasted the first 80 pages, before it before it trailed off into nothingness. Here is the issue, I know that I bought it, expecting it to be about the murder of a little girl, and ultimately, her \\"visiting\\" earth to avenge her death sort of thing. It's not about that at all. It's about her family. A rather uninteresting family at that. The writer repeats the SAME stories several times in the book, perhaps it was a stretch for her to fill the pages. By page 220-something, I thought, perhaps it was going to liven up a bit. No such luck. Just as quickly as it perked up, it died. I found this to be dull, and boring. It is by no means a page turner, it lacks a genuine plot, the characters are uninteresting and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Heaven\\" help this culture","review":"This and other \\"book group\\" books like The Secret Life of Bees, Bee Season, The Corrections, etc. typify the decline of American culture. Though I suppose that in the past, the \\"popular\\" books were not the ones that survived the test of time, much as, I'm certain, these won't, either.The Lovely Bones was a decent read, though given the subject matter, oddly devoid of emotion. There are some aspects that are disturbing, which is okay, but others that are downright silly. But when I got to the scene where Suzie enters her friend's body so she can have sex with Ray, I just lost it. This is SOOOO Hollywood and such a cheap trick. Well, at least I am forewarned, not to see the movie version, which I'm sure will play up this totally stupid scene. This ruined the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a \\"chick\\" book. It is not intended for guys who are linear thinkers and expect a story to unfold in an orderly and logical fashion. The beginning starts of well enough, but after that the author gives us snapshots or \\"postcards\\" of events unfolding on earth after Susie dies. It is not cohesive. What the author does is paint some excellent word pictures of single events occurring in the book, but the actual story is disjointed and dissatisfying. The killer appears to get away with the murder. What happens to her remains on earth is dissatisfying. There are just too many questions left open. If you care more about the emotional impact her Susie's death on her family and less about the solving and answering of her death, you may like it more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disappointing","review":"This is one of the worst books I've read in long time. The plot and the writing are dull. The main character is a teenager but she sounds like an adult so I never believed in the plot line. There are a lot of good books out there to read. Don't waste your precious time on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully silly","review":"Ugh, is all I can say. This book relies for impact on some mixture of prurience and sentimentality, without acknowledging that it's doing so. Its characters are flimsy at best. And the author is unable to disguise her own self-satisfaction and self-importance. Okay, the writing is competent in a very lowest common denominator way but so what? Competent writing is a dime a dozen. Above all, this book's fatal flaw is that it's boring. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid ending","review":"When I read the first part of this book, I was hooked. I even got a couple of friends to start reading it and was recommending it to everyone. But, halfway through the book, I felt the author losing focus and direction. The George Harvey character deserved more than 3 lines to describe what happens to him. I found the interaction between Ruth (as Susie) and Ray a little farfetched, even given the spiritual tones of the book. Disappointing and anticlimactic..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sketchbook rather than a painting","review":"Unsatisfying and manipulative. Learning this was a debut effort explains a lot.I didn't feel the narrative voice was convincingly close enough to a 14 year old's and I suppose the omniscient parts about what her mother/father/siblings/friends are feeling can be ascribed to the heaven vantage point.I found myself asking \\"what was the author intending?\\" more than I should, especially considering with a really compelling story, one forgets about the writer's existence entirely. The plot seemed to be advanced mainly through a desire for justice rather than interest in individual characters and the ending was just too Touched by Angel for my taste.There are so many better authors who can show rather than tell.I wonder if this book is so popular because of the subject matter, and to find fault with it is somehow and indictment of personal grief?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most over-hyped book of the summer.","review":"Alice Sebold writes beautifully. Also one saving grace in this book is the delightful grandmother who pops up from time to time. That character alone convinced me that Sebold really does have talent and may be capable of writing a decent novel, some day. Other than that--ugh. What an awful book. I can't believe I read an entire novel about a little raped/murdered girl who watches her family from \\"heaven.\\" And then when she briefly body-snatches her old friend and hangs out with her old boyfriend for a few hours. Good lord! Like another reviewer on this page, I groaned out loud several times, too. The full-page ad in the New York Times has Anna Quindlan urging, \\"If you read only one book this summer, read Lovely Bones.\\" So let me urge you--PLEASE. If you read only one book this summer, make it something decent--NOT THIS. Read Rohinton Mistry or Andrew Miller or Tessa Hadley or \\"Spies\\" by Michael Frayn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hokey","review":"This book goes from decent to bad to horrible. The ending is one of the most contrived I've ever read. The language is convoluted and lacks any grace, the characters are unbelievable and there are a number of story threads that fray throughout. Save yourself some time and money and read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Book","review":"What would you do if you were fifteen years old, and suddenly, violently ripped away from your mortal existence? Would you sit back in your heaven, not question anything, and never think of life again? Of course not! Neither does Susie Salmon. Alice Sebold, the author, captures her emotions perfectly.In this haunting, powerful story, you get the feeling that you could be in the story itself. You become completely enveloped in the emotions that run haywire, the spirits, the murder, and the thought of a true afterlife.This book is completely awesome! I didn't want to put it down the entire time I was reading it. I would reccomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely Bones","review":"It was a struggle to get through this book as it's very disturbing and dangerously depicts dying and heaven in a way that is very misleading. If one believes in heaven, then by default, onewould believe in God, and also the Bible. For people who are confused or seeking answers about their creation, dying and heaven, she has dangerously implied heaven and dying as something other than whatit is.I understand that this is a work of fiction, but nothing would lead a reader to believe that this is a work of science-fiction. Some readers may be okay with the rape and dismemberment of a young girl, as for me, it's an unfortunate reality for few and the rest of us should not deem it entertainment. I'm giving two stars because it does portray a good account of what effects a loss such as Susie's might have on her family and even people she hardly knew, such as Ruth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writing, But Little Happens","review":"There is no denying that Sebold is a terrific writer with great prose, but THE LOVELY BONES moves way too slow. The idea is interesting, and the way our villian is killed is fantastic. But for such a slow moving book to be such an amazing seller amazes me! Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"This novel is poignant...an excellent read. Very moving. I can't stress enough how great it was to read. If you've ever lost someone, or if you've ever wondered about heaven, this book will move you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't read it again...","review":"The author's writing in this book is very well done. She describes things very very well.BUT....the ending was a disappointment. It was missing something, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike Any Other Novel I've Read","review":"This was very unconventional for me and in the beginning, I was not exactly sure I'd like it. However, I loved it.It is amazing how quickly I became accepting of the concept of this girl's point of view. I am also glad that this didn't become a matter of religion. Generally, I thought the approach was soft but meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique, yet somehow average","review":"I completely agree that this is not a \\"feel good\\" book, and I disagree that this represents a typical teenager. My best friend died when I was thirteen and I did not relate to any of the situations that took place in the book. This book seems as a complete misrepresentation of youth and death. The supernatural part of the book was original, yet completely dark and depressing. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expect the unexpected","review":"No review that I have yet read truly encompasses the power of this novel. Reading the dust jacket actually made me put this aside for a while, but the first chapter pulled me firmly into the story. This is an amazingly well-written work, enjoyable to the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to my expectations","review":"I bought this book based on reviews from friends and from magazine reviews that all said it was great. I liked the general idea of the story, that Susie is murdered and looks on from heaven, but found the rest of the story to be forced. That Ray still lusts for Susie after one kiss when they are 13 is unrealistic. I would have liked for there to be more about what Susie's heaven was like and to have understood more about the emotions that the mom went through.Overall, this book ws a big disappointement. I'm afraid that everyone is reading it and making it more popular based off of hype rather than real quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feminist angle needed?","review":"\\"Lovely Bones\\" is a beautifully written take on the murder of a girl and its effect on her family. Sebold also manages to make a surprising literary device work: the narrator is the girl herself, now in heaven. Sebold provides some details about heaven, or kind of a pre-heaven, but is careful not to try too much (cf. to last chapter of Dara Horn's \\"TheWorld to Come\\" which I did not like at all).Sebold throws in a feminist angle (Susie's mother, also Ruana). While not done badly, I wonder if it may have been required only because Sebold's literary imagination needed another crutch; to my mind, it muddies the tragedy's after affects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great begining but I lost interest by mid way through","review":"The movie preview for this book looked like something I would enjoy. The begining was addictive, frightening, and beautiful but around the time her mother left home I lost interest. I guess I was just expecting something different...more like a mystery or something with suspense but it just dragged on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"After hearing rave reviews about this book I had very high expectations for it. It seems to be somewhat hard to believe that any book can be intresting when the most important event in the book, the entire climax is in the first chapter. When I was done the first chapter I wondered what the rest of the chapters would be about...well apparently nothing.I usually finish books in a week or less but I had to stop reading this book halfway through because it was so horrible. I was often afraid to read it because anything regarding murder and rape is a bit intense for me but the way this book presented such a serious event was horrible.No strong emotions were expressed through any of the characters, especially not the main character who tells this story. Not only did I think the book was poorly written I was also extremely disappointed by the end. This book left me indifferent and it was a big waste of my time. sorry alice. your characters were too flat and just plain dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNOOZE....BORING....BLAH","review":"This book was incredibly boring. Susie dies and looks down upon her incredibly boring life. Yawn. I could not care less about any of the characters. I absolutely could not believe my eyes reading all the praises stamped all over the book. Were they reading the same book as I was?"},{"rating":"1","title":"everybody owes somebody sometime","review":"This book has a gimmick (a spy in heaven) -- so does Dave Eggers's book, and so does Atonement. Those gimmicks work, but this gimmick becomes very very tiresome very very soon. Even so, I'd stick with it if the writing were good. It's precious, and not for mature readers. I keep on, thinking, surely, any moment... but no. What I'll remember from this is that even fabulous writers like Jonathan Franzen have publicists and editors who can coerce him into writing a blurb. That's how the system works. Read Three Junes by Julia Glass instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"good advice for girls, but not literature","review":"This is a very disappointing book. The disappointment, for me, came from the fact that the subject so important and touching, as the bestial murder of a child and grief of the family, should be presented in equally moving manner. Even if the narrator is the child victim, which, obviously, necessitates some simplifications of the prose. Instead, Sebold's novel is formally conventional, very boring and predictable. I can understand its being a recommended reading for schoolchildren, because it can be a warning and fulfills the educational purposes, maybe getting to the adolescent child better than pamphlets and science, but if you are not a teenager and/or are looking for something else that a warning in a book, this would be a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading, not worth a penny","review":"There is nothing inspiring, nothing learned from reading this book. The book does not make sense and it is very hard to read. It seems that Susie never actually died, she never left earth. In buying this book, I thougth there was a chance to learn something from the heaven perspective but the author was just to earthly, into the emotions and the sex ...I was very, very disappointed. I am surprised that other readers gave this book even two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure","review":"I have heard this is an excellant book... I wouldn't know due to the seller taking my money and not sending me my book. NOR have they bothered to contact me to return my money or let me know where the book I purchased is. I will no longer use the used book sellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Read","review":"The perspective of this book is original and the story is very compelling. This is a great book for young adults and up the story get under your skin and makes you believe in the characters. Dealing with such a serious topic the writing still finds room for wit and charm. I highly recommend Lovley Bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending kills a potentially great book...","review":"You would hope this book could fulfill some of the hype, but of course it does not. Actually very entertaining for most of the book, but the ending abolutely destroys it in my opinion. I began reading it knowing there was a film already being made. Not sure how they will pull some of it off with much of the narrative being told from the first-person, but it may give them the opportunity to change some things, hopefully the ending....I guess it's worth the read but don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just doesn't get better!","review":"I'm not the type of reader to shove my literary opinions on others - as I realize that art is very specific to each individual that interprets it. However, this novel is so moving, so tragic, so sweetly hilarious, that I simply had to mention it.In the first ten pages, I already felt as though Susie Salmon and I had been long lost friends and mourned her (not just because the brutal killing of a child is just too difficult to contemplate, but because she was indeed one of the most loveable characters I have ever had the pleasure to meet).Three cheers to Alice Sebold...for I hope we will always hear from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I saw an interview with author Alice Sebold on the Today show about a month ago, I felt compelled to read this book. I liked the author and found a familiarity in her personality, as if she could be one of my friends. Unfortunately, I thought the book was extremely depressing and did not look forward to my nightly sessions of reading after a long day at the office. It starts with the detailed description of the rape and murder of a sweet 14 year old girl. When the book started out this way I thought it would get better but it continued on a depressing path describing her family's dissolution, her friends' wierd adolescent life ramblings and later, the supernatural invasion of their bodies. The best part of the book was the ending, where the subject (the murdered girl) addresses what the afterlife is like. That part was very descriptive and strangely uplifting after an arduous read. It was disappointing overall and I probably won't pick up another Alice Sebold novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss this book already....","review":"I bought this book after seeing Anna Quindlen on the Today show and felt the book lived up to the publicity. I finished the book last night and am so sorry to have finished it, still wanting to know what is happening with Susie and her family. Ironically, my husband is out of town on an extended trip and I actually felt so lonely reading this book, echoing Susie's feelings about wanting to be with her family. I enjoyed the premise of the story, but I also think the strength of book is the quality of the writing. I look forward to future books from Alice Sebold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one?","review":"After all the hype, the strategic placement in book stores, and the lovely cover, my expectations were pretty high for this book. What a disappointment. Boring. Unbelievable. Characters (like the sister) whose motivations are unclear and whose actions are unexplained. An interesting premise (watching from self-created \\"heaven\\")that just doesn't gel. I never got the desired sympathy for the Mom, and never figured out why the Dad put up with her crud. Not a bad first novel... but am I the only one who doesn't get it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Trust Hype","review":"As a bookstore employee, I heard much hype about this book from customers purchasing it (who, ironically were talking up a book they had yet to read). I decided to give it a shot as it sounded as though it had an interesting premise.The beginning of this book was alright, good enough for me to be interested. The rest however, is mediocre at best. It did not seem to me to be very well-written, at times I thought it would be best as \\"Teen Fiction\\" rather than a book meant for adults. The characters were developed very little and at the end I was left feeling dissappointed. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a \\"Grown-Up\\" book. It is not worth all the hype it has received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, overlong nonsense","review":"The good news: this book has a clear, swift style, an affecting closing vignette, and a solid opening chapter. But after that first chapter, you hit the first one: our fourteen year old narrator describes someone's hair as \\"shiny like the promises in magazines.\\" These overwrought, cloying metaphors start popping up every few pages until soon, the whole book is overwrought and cloying. In 328 pages, Ms. Sebold attempts to capture ten years in the lives of at least ten people, one of them a narrator looking down from \\"heaven.\\" Of course, this task is impossible if one wishes to do it with any complexity or subtlety, so Ms. Sebold instead relies heavily upon predictable New Age gobbledygook. Fans of contemporary, realistic literary fiction (Russo, McDermott, Morrison, Cunningham), take note: this is not for us. It is a readable, shallow, \\"heartening\\" mainstream book. Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugly bones","review":"I will begin by saying that I had no interest in reading this novel, but a friend lent me a copy and suggested that I give it a chance. I was very disappointed that I did not follow my initial inclination. In general, I find that much contemporary fiction is rushed and lacking in genuine character development, and I found Ms. Sebold's novel to be no exception. The descriptions of heaven were annoying as hell (pun intended), and I particularly disliked the scene where she comes back to earth to have sex. In short, the book reads very much like a teen novel that wasn't allowed to be a teen novel because it was too graphic. Nonetheless, it would have been happier as a teen novel, and I would have been happier with it as a teen novel as well as I never would have been induced to give it a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell for the Hype","review":"Unfortunately, I bought this book in hardcover based on the buzz surrounding it. I found it disjointed (no pun intended) and in need of one more draft. While the plot is unique it is not well developed. Though I did enjoy the concept the author proposes of an individual heaven before being admited to the big show, I thought the development of the plot on earth was weak. Just my thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment...","review":"This is possibly the most over-rated book I have ever had the displeasure to read. Even if you can get past the deeply disturbing murder scene, you won't be rewarded. I kept hoping I would begin to care about ANY of these characters or their trite and one-dimensional lives, yet even as the book mercifully ended I found myself wondering why I had bothered to finish it. I kept hoping to figure out what all the rave reviewers had found so remarkable in this little piece of junk. Ultimately, I was just annoyed with myself for wasting so much time on a book so profoundly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money...","review":"I've never written a review before but I just had to jump in here with this one. I have never read a more boring book. Bestseller? Yes. Came highly recommended? Yes. But I can't imagine why.It starts out okay, but it never goes anywhere. You just keep wondering when SOMETHING is going to happen. I was at the end ofthe book before I realized that NOTHING more was going to happen.There was no great story here. No development of characters.Not even much of a plot. Everything you wanted to know about the book can be found out by reading the jacket and the inside cover.It goes nowhere...Save your money. But if you must read it, borrow a copy from someone. Or better yet...I'll give you mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"This is the most trivial nothing that I have read all the way to the end! And the last couple of chapters proved to be the most disappointing feature of the whole book. I do not think that characters were well developed and the whole story disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this supposed to be literature?","review":"I can't believe that there isn't one criticism of this book found in the editorial reviews. Maybe it is out of respect for the author and what she has survived that no one dared to write a negative review publicly. I (reluctantly) read this book for a book club, and I admit that the first 100 pages or so kept my attention. But there could have been so many themes here -life after death, faith, the mind of a serial killer, marriage issues, etc that were touched upon but ultimately left hanging. The book didn't seem to have any real message or coherence. Aside from the unusual perspective, I felt like I might as well have been reading a Judy Blume novel about adolescence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good page-turner","review":"Excellent read. I couldn't put it down. The first half has moments of brilliance. As Sebold tries to tie the ends together, she falls into some sentimentality and cliche, but it remains a haunting story with an excellent premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Kind of Tragedy","review":"This book hooked me instantly with its opening scene. And then what was different was that even after Susie was murdered, she is still our protagonist. The point of view in The Lovely Bones is unique; how often do we read from the dead's eyes?And then we see what happens to a family after the disappearance and murder of one of its members thru Susie. We follow them for years, watching their broken lives along with Susie. And we also watch two other people who touched her life, Ray and Ruth, two classmates.By the end, we know Susie has become to accept she is unable to infuse herself into her families physical lives as well as broaden herself in heaven. And her family moves on, however broken just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very engrossing","review":"I could not put this book down, it was beautifully written, and I was happy to see the writing quality stayed high throughout the book. However, I felt a bit lost at the end. I thought maybe Susie's remains would be found since there were some changes going on at the sinkhole. I just fell in love with Susie's character and greedily wanted something horribly cliche to happen at the end, like all of her family members finally join her. As a consolation, the family dog did, and I still will recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner!","review":"As a mother of three and a wife with a full time job, I somehow found time to read this book. My mother, who is not a big reader, bought it and read it in no time. She highly recommended it. So I started it yesterday and just finished it an hour ago. I was hooked on the first page! I thought it was an amazing idea for a novel, a murdered girl talking about her murder, her life before her murder and her family's life afterward as they tried to cope. I was not terribly thrilled with the ending, but in a way it was fitting. I am thinking about purchasing another book of Sebold's to see if it as well written. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot believe that ...","review":"SPOILERS BELOW............that no one appears disturbed by the fact that in the end of the book Suzi basically allows her best friend to be raped because she wants to have sex. How is what Suzi did any different than slipping someone a Roofie, rendering them unconscious and having sex with them? She RAPED this girl. However much you want to gloss over it. She raped a young woman and this is seen as a good ending?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting concept","review":"Lovely Bones is an interesting theory on life after death, and is told through the eyes of Susie Salmon. Brutally raped and murdered by a close neighbour at 14, Susie watches her family from her heaven, as they continue to live on earth. Lovely Bones is completely original, and in it's delivery speaks as an authentic, naive, inexperienced teenager. Through Susie's regular interactions with those closest to her, Susie learns that it is not only her family which must learn to move on after her death - but she must let go of her life on earth. Lovely Bones is a very honest, unbiased glimpse into the emotions caused by Susie's death. It confronts the changes in people, and the need to accept, move on - but never forget.A must read for anyone who has lost someone dear to them, or for anyone interested in an original concept and writing style. Lovely Bones was a pleasure to read - brought many a tear to my eye, both in sadness and in joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"After reading the reviews I expected too much!","review":"I did not enjoy this book. It was quite shocking, and very tedious to read. Please read \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" if you want a heartwarming book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense","review":"The book it good for those that like suspense. The beginning is a bit too descriptive and is disturbing. Would recommend for readers 18 years and old only."},{"rating":"2","title":"a disturbing read","review":"it is a great book but many times I need to close the kindle and walk away from it as it is very disturbing emotionally for the Salmon family however this being said, this author wrote this book really well, you are there as you read it, you are in the book, sometimes you can't breathe because of how well written it actually is,,,,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever","review":"I was intrigued by the first half of the book. The characters were likeable, but then it was like work to get through the rest. It hit a low plateau and just continued the same. I was so bored I never finished it. It lingered too long on unecessary stuff- kind of like the movie \\"In The Bedroom\\" with Sissy Spacek and Marissa Tomei where there were long periods of nothing happening to propel the story forward. I thought it was a big snore after the first 3/4ths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"Gentle Readers...this was not my type of book. I was expecting a gritty crime story and what I got was fluff. The basic idea of the book intrigued me; however, I found most of the characters boring and the author's writing style lacking. In defense of the book, I was the ONLY member of my book club who didn't like it -- the rest of them are still raving about it. It would probably make a good movie -- so I gave it 2 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like books that implode...","review":"What happened to this novel? It started off wonderfully and grabbed me from the first chapter (read it here at Amazon and see if you don't agree) - I can see why the publisher wanted it in print. But each chapter thereafter gets duller, more mundane, and - especially in the last 100 pages - downright inane.I don't doubt Ms. Sebold's talent as a writer, but it seems obvious she had no idea how to end the book - and still doesn't.One other note: you need to be able to handle metaphors that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Doesn't Little Brown have editors anymore? I can only hope whoever writes the screenplay (I assume this is going to film) will rewrite the second half of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and yet, when it first came out I didn't think it would be my kind of book. Told from a 14-year old's point of view after her murder, it is horrifying, funny, sad, and hopeful. It is how one family and the people in the town who interact with them react to the death of that family's daughter. I was pleased that the author did not try to make Susie into a ghost that keeps in touch with family and friends. It was more real in that she did not contact her family and friends on a human level from \\"her heaven\\" other than by concentration of thoughts. Well done, but keep tissue nearby."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum","review":"I was very disappointed - all the hype . . . best seller, good reviews . . . BORING. It worked better than a sleeping pill though, I'll give it that."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is pretty amazing...","review":"I have never read a book that does what this book does- it is incredibly sad and incredibly happy at the exact same time. I do agree with many readers though that the first chapters are better than the end, but the idea that this book puts out is compelling and intriguing that it is impossible not to get something out of this book. After I finished this book I felt ,basically, just content. Not that it wasn't amazing, but it leaves you with a feeling that life, though trying at times, is an amazing and thrilling experience, and that we should enjoy it and appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awful Disappointment","review":"After reading many reviews of this book -- and most of them were extremely favorable --, I bought it for myself, shortly after it was published. It was an \\"interesting\\" idea and good up until near the ending. Why, oh why, did the author feel the need for the \\"sex with those on earth\\" portion? It would have been better had the dead girl turn her back on earth and accept the \\"heaven\\" she had been dealt. I gave the book to 3 people and they all agreed that the ending was a dismal failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanting mystery","review":"Can't recommend this book highly enough. I loved it. The perspective of a victim following her friends and family through the aftermath of the crime was fresh; the writing crisp and witty and warm. And the ending was superbly worked -- not the neat all-ends-tied that you expected. You will love this work. I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"I culdn't put it down. I knew this after the third page so I made a pot of coffee and stayed up til 3am to finish it. It was direct, thoughtful, gentle. The good guys win, but that is not the point of the book. A whole new approach to death and life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intensely disliked this book","review":"The book was really fine for the first 2/3, compelling crime story was a really nice contrast with the ethereal description of heaven. However, there was one event toward the end of the book that threw everything else off, it was disjointed and felt like it belonged in a completely different book (one of much lower caliber). It completely ruined the story for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Time","review":"This was the biggest waste of my time!! Absolutely one of the worst, disjointed, unbelievable stories I have read in many years. Don't expect to be able to follow any train of thought. There simply isn't any. Ms. Sebold evidently cannot write about anything without going off in multiple directions that have nothing to do with the original thought.She seems to be mesmerized by everything and anything. None of which has anything to do with the story.If the movie is anything like the book, I'll be walking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Bones","review":"This novel is less about a murder of a young girl than it is about the effect such a brutal crime has on the members of the victim's family. Not sure we needed this novel to educate us on the fact that violent crimes scar more people than the immediate victims. And strangely, the book seems to suggest the victim is oh so lucky to have been murdered because she is so happy to be in her magical heaven. I give this book two stars instead of one because it is hard to shake and the author is very talented in telling her story. But, for me, her talents cannot overcome a story which has too many negative threads. For most, there's enough suffering taking place in the real world. But if you are the sort who likes downer books, you'll LOVE this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously? Someone thought this would make a good movie?","review":"This book starts out interestingly enough, but fizzles into a tedious account of the boring goings-on of every minor character, with no resolution to speak of. The story left me feeling like I'd had cotton balls for dinner: still hungry, and confused about why I wasted so much time on something so purposeless.I can't give you my reason for disliking this book without spoiling the ending, but let's just say that if I were going to write a parody of The Lovely Bones, I would leave the last 100 pages completely blank."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am stunned...","review":"I am stunned that a) this book found a publisher and b) that someone paid for the film rights. The overly long and tedious story line had me resolving to simply put it down several times but I kept thinking that the next chapter would make it all worthwhile. I was so very sadly mistaken. I can certainly understand how people who have suffered an unbearble loss of a loved one would be drawn to the concepts of heaven on which this plot seems to rely so heavily. However, the concept is not enough to support a storyline overburned with one-dimensional characters. Even when they showed promise, Ms. Sebold lacked the skill to develop them. The ending seemed to me to be a sophomoric attempt to simply tie up the loose ends. I suspect Ms. Sebold received confirmation that some fool was negotiating for film rights. It shouldn't be surprising that a reading publich lacking both teeth & spines should find pablum such as this so easy to swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtakingly Beautiful","review":"As I read through some of the reviews here today, I wondered if I read the same book as some others had. To each his own, but I found this book breathtakingly beautiful. Since so many stories of young girls being abducted have been in the news of late, the book is also very timely.The book begins with the death of Susie Salmon (like the fish, as she would say). So begins the story of a family torn apart by her disappearnce, and the ultimate acceptance of her death. Through Susie's eyes we learn of what her experience in heaven is like, and her close bonds with those she has left behind on earth. We watch the mystery of her death unfold, the changes in her friends and family and see it all through Suzie's forever 14 eyes. I stayed up all night unable to stop turning the pages.A unique and ultimately uplifting story, I recommend this book very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful surprise","review":"This book was a great surprise for many reasons; I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did. People should definitely read this book, especially if you've recently lost someone regardless of how they died. This book has helped give me a new view on what the \\"afterlife\\" might possibly be like and made my mother's death more bearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be","review":"I have to say I was VERY disappointed in this book. I think it had excellent potential but I found that none of the characters ever really developed into people that I felt drawn to or even interested in. Also, I am soooo completely disappointed as to how the main issue in the book is resolved. I don't want to give anything away but I felt it was a total cop-out and if it had happened sooner in the book, I simply would have stopped reading. Since it was a few pages from the end I finished.This book certainly wasn't a waste of my time but I can't say I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Doesn't live up to the hype at all. Sebold tries to tackle ideas that are substantial with weak writing. As a result, complicated themes are barely supported by immature writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"new age hooey","review":"This book came highly recommended from several sources and had a lot of buzz. It turned out to be a lot of meandering new age hooey. The writing was pedstrian, the plotting was not much either. Thumbs Down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put the book down..","review":"Me and my mother both read this novel and we both finished it in less that a week. We both loved it! This book is great! How can you not enjoy this book? It has such a unique perspective and it's very well written! This book is truley a page turner - if you havn't read it, read it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"in my opinion it was phenominal","review":"I really liked this book. I am only 15, and found this book to be glued to my hand. The only downside was that 3/4 into the book the years skip by fastly. However, i still give it 5 stars. I laughed, and lord knows i cried. This book is definetly 1 of a kind!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point.","review":"This book made no sense. It was not even a good murder mystery. If that is the writer's view of heaven, I feel sorry for her. She has nothing to look forward to except an eternity of what equates to real life television shows. Everyone suffers and the murderer is never brought to justice. Maybe that is what life is like for some, but who wants to read a fictional novel about it. I rate this right up there with Oprah's pick...House of Sand and Fog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read for a mother of young children.","review":"I found the descriptions of the rape and murder in this book really gruesome and disturbing. I wish I had never read it because the imagery haunts me. The thought of someone else reading it bothered me so much that it is the first book I have ever thrown in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and slow moving","review":"The beginning of the book is horrendous--a horrible attack on a 14 year old girl. The rest of the book plods on slowly as she watches the events of her family and friend's lives unfold. While there is a wonderful message--appreciate everything in life and appreciate the gift of living, the story just plods along slowly. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"too brutal for me","review":"I knew this was about a young girl who had been brutally murdered. What I didn't realize was that the brutality of the murder is repeated and explored and repeated. I can handle the psychology of the killer, the pain of the parents, I just don't need the graphic images repeated again and again in my mind. I read the whole book waiting for it to get better. The book kept my interest but focusing on that much violence was polluting for me. I don't need to add that to my life. I can just watch the news if I want gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"From One Writer to Another -- Bravo!","review":"Alice Sebold's talent shines through in \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" Susie's voice is powerful. Her version of heaven allows readers to visualize the journey of our souls in the after-life. The various characters in the story are people we can easily identify with. Each family member dealt with the tragedy differently, and the author did an excellent job detailing their emotions. My only gripe has to do with Susie's reunion with Ray. The technique seemed right out of the movie \\"Ghost,\\" with Susie in the role of Sam (Patrick Swayze).Bill Lee, author (\\"Chinese Playground\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold","review":"The whole concept of this book is original and purely delightful. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry. It will make you wonder about life and death in a way that can be very comforting. You will definitely feel for this young girl as she speaks to us from her heaven. I don't want to give any of the story away in this review, so if you are up for something interestingly original then read The Lovely Bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a sophomoric book!","review":"I was completely disappointed in this book that had received so much hype. I was reluctant to read it at first because in my job as a defense attorney, I deal with many child abuse cases and didn't relish reading a book that would deal so personally with the child's death. But, after reading so many rave reviews for the book, I gave in. Alice Sebold certainly had a clever idea for her story, and could have used it to explore real human emotions and the dynamics of the family, but instead she squandered her opportunity and ended up with a ridiculous, improbable and immature revere on retribution/fulfillment from the grave. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"i reccomend this book for how NOT to write","review":"i had high hopes for this book since i had heard rumors that peter jackson was taking it on for his next film project. as i started to read this book, i really felt for the main character. the descriptions of place and time were well written, however the additional characters in the novel began to blend into each other. one minute, we think we are really feeling what this teenage girl wanted and loved, then suddenly, it becomes some cheesy harloquin romance novel. i was extremely disappointed in the last half of the book. several people have asked to borrow this book since i finished it, i loaned it to them with prejudice. and all of them came to the same conclusion. it was a good story and good premise but poorly handled. if peter jackson really is going to make a movie based on this book, i hope he fixes it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising, but Disappointing","review":"The Lovely Bones is a very uneven work. At times touching and memorable, at times monotonous, at times pedestrian, the prose of Ms. Sebold needs more polishing before it can be called great. Some of the plot turns are silly and forced, and the effect on the reader is one of annoyance. This would have made a superb first draft. I hardly know how to account for this book's phenomenal success; perhaps, as in the title of her first book, Ms. Sebold got \\"lucky.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fascinating story","review":"What a fascinating story. This book is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. It is incredible to hear a story from what a dead girl is thinking of while she watches her family from above.The family goes through many struggles after their daughters death and this book beautifully and eloquently takes you through all the trials and tribulations that this family ends up facing.Another fascinating part of the book is that Susie follows her killer and watches over him as well. The girl is totally at peace with what has happened to her little body and what has become of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I know it might seem odd to say you loved a book about a girl who is sadistically murdered within the first few pages, and then tells her story from her heaven, but I really did love this story. I thought it was very well written and that Susie's story was incredibly sad and beautiful. Tragedy and grief often brings out the best and the worst in families and Sebold did a good job in showing what the unexpected death of a loved one can do to an otherwise normal family. I brought this book with me to the beach, to lend out and two other family members attempted to read it, but felt it was too \\"dark.\\" The subject matter is definitely dark, but I really enjoyed Susie's story and could not put it down, once I started reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you grieving a family loss? Then this book is for you.","review":"Kudos to Alice Sebold. I read this book after seeing it mentioned at a grief website and found myself deeply touched by the Sebold's keen insight into the emotions surrounding survivors of tragic deaths.It's been almost two years since my sister died in an auto accident, and while I've moved along in the grieving process, this book was very cathartic for me on many levels (and led to many tears as well as smiles). I could see so many parallels in what happened to Susie Salmon's family following her death to my own family's reaction to our loss, as well as the unexpected consequences on friends and even acquaintances of the deceased.So, if you're grieving an unexpected loss, you likely will find yourself glad you read Sebold's debut novel. A note for survivors of sibling loss, she gets it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Is She 14 or 40???","review":"After hearing/reading all the rave reviews of this novel, I decided to read the book. All I can say is \\"Am I the only one who felt that all the hype must have been paid for by the publisher\\"? I will admit that the book began strongly, however it rapidly plunged downhill like an out of control rollercoaster. A couple of chapters could have been taken directly from the shooting script of \\"Ghost\\" and were completely out of character for a naive 14 year old.As for heavenly experiences and the meaning of our lives here on earth, both subjects were covered with more warmth and wisdom in Mitch Albom's \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is just not for me","review":"The book was interesting in the beginning but then it kept switching back and forth from watching the criminal get away with the crime to the victim of the killer watching her family crumble down each day without a clue of who did this to her. This made me kind of bored because I would really get into the part of how the criminal was covering his tracks and getting away with it. And also how the police got close but lose the evidence. It made me start to lose interest and gradually I stopped reading book. I would recommend this book to whoever has the patience to rewrite and congrats those who made it through this book. Also if I had rewritten this book I would turn Susie's p.o.v. into a different book sort of like another side of the story but in a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE!!!","review":"I loathe this book! It was ridiculous! I hate that I wasted my time reading it and the sad part is the movie sucked too (Sorry Mark Walberg) but at least the movie was better than this garbage we refer to a \\"book\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it at all!","review":"This book is so sad, so sad, that I could barely finish it. It had so many stories inside one that made no sense sometimes. I didn't like it and don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing!","review":"Although truly a sad story, what I liked most about this book is the young girl watching everything happen from her very own version of heaven. That in itself is a comforting thought, that we can have our own heaven and we can watch our family from somewhere else...well, that was enough to take the sadness away. A truly good book, one you will have trouble putting down from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This was a fantastic read! I saw the movie first and loved it so much that I bought the book. (Although, of course, the book goes into a lot more detail and is somewhat different than the movie in certain aspects.) The movie had such wonderful special effects that really bring the book to life. The book really makes you wonder about what happens when we cross over and are caught in the \\"in-between\\". Once you start reading this book, you'll have a hard time putting it down. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Page Turner","review":"Lonely Bones was one of the most interesting page turners I have read in a while. After reading the first sentence it was hard to put it down. This is a great novel to see an opinion of what Heaven is truly like."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Sad *sniff*","review":"A very good novel but incrediably sad. I cried at least 4 or 5 times while I was reading it. Though sad its not really depressing. I found the end a bit of a dissapointment about how we don't find out why she fell from heaven or what became of Ruth. (Though I don't want to give away the whole plot)The only reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 4 was because it was so sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad tale well written","review":"I had trouble with this book because of the nature of the story, but I kept right on reading. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, strong writing, dull and lackluster story.","review":"I picked up this book because of all the hype and good things I had heard about it. I was drawn in very quickly due to the author's excellent prose (no arguing, Sebold is a beautiful and brilliant writer), but lost interest very quickly. There's really no plot, no central STORY. Things are just kinda happening and while she describes it poignantly (though at times it was very cheesy and corny), it's just not engaging.Far from un-put-down-able, but it is read-able. It's just dull and lackluster. Good premise, promising author, but skip this book. You're not missing much. Check out Jodi Picoult's Nineteen Minutes or My Sister's Keeper instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am struggling with this novel, which is surprising, because I was really looking forward to reading it. I don't even think the writing is very good. It is often confusing and awkward. I am having a hard time relating to any of the characters, as none of them seem real to me. I am only on page 150, so there is still hope, but at this point I think I am just being stubborn to continue with it. I forced myself to finish \\"On Green Dolphin Street\\" in November, and swore that was the last time I would do that for a book that is meant to be \\"pleasure reading\\". Some pleasure. For true pleasure reading, try Atonement. Sebold's novel seems to be an overhyped chore."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"6th Sense\\" Taken Up a Notch","review":"Dear readers:Did you like the movie \\"The 6th Sense\\"?Do you have trouble with the standard portrayal of heaven?If you answered yes to either of these questions, then you will probably enjoy this book very much.I did.I don't have much time to read, so I tend to seek out books that will give me hope, inspire me, or make me laugh. This promised to be a sad little book, but instead it gave me hope, inspired me, and sometimes, even made me laugh. I'm still not sure why I read a book like this, but I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I decided NOT to buy this book.","review":"After reading all the positive professional reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. But, after reading the \\"real\\" people reviews, I decided not to. Especially after reading one review that said this book was \\"as shallow as Bridges of Madison County\\". THAT book received rave professional reviews as well, while I thought it was the most inane piece of drivel that had ever wasted printing paper. Though I enjoy fiction, I still like substance in my reading. I'll pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonishingly Overhyped","review":"I guess you either love or hate this book. When I see the stacks and stacks ... - one sure sign of the new author's rite of passage - I marvel at the marketing power of the book industry. The book is deceiving, with its theme, concept, and moral/ethical stance. And what a marvelous premise. As a single mom of an 11-yr-old girl, I think about this sort of thing constantly. Unfortunately, what starts out so promising fizzles like a cheap firework snake. The heaven scenes were laughable (why all the forced \\"Heaven\\" geography?), the family dynamics played out like a worn out soap opera, and the ending was so contrived it almost made me hurl. (And that bathtub scene - shamelessly stolen from \\"Ghost.\\") Fortunately I only wasted an afternoon and a trip to the library (something told me not to spend any money on this one). Sebold: bag the fiction and stick to memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult","review":"This book was difficult to comprehend. The book got off to a good start, but dwindled off a third of the way through. I wonder how it got to the best sellers list? Probably b/c Good Morning America recommended it. Maybe Good Morning America should write me a check for [the money] I spent on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ice Ending","review":"I won't go into the whole book, just the ending.The villain (is it possible to be more of a villain than someone who rapes and murders children and gets away with it?) receives his just desserts in the end -- now pay attention here -- when a large icicle hanging from a roof eave falls on his head.Yup. I ain't kiddin' ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm clearly a minority here, but this book was a waste of time and money. After a good first chapter, the story becomes more and more boring. I ended up skipping bits and pieces in the end... The writing style is mediocre, the psychology of the characters and their interaction very predictable. Some of the events described, and some of the dialogs, were downright ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read with an Open Mind","review":"It isn't often that a book is written from a victim's point of view and I have to admit that I was skeptical about this at first. However, I put aside my reservations and picked it up. I didn't put it down until I had finished the entire book. The book is written in the language of a teenager and it read as though Susie Salmon herself was telling the story. This was one of the things I enjoyed most about the book.Alice Sebold offers wonderful, yet unconventional, view of heaven. I was moved to tears as Susie told the story of her tragic death at the tender age of 14, and as she watched the lives of her loved ones fall apart after her death. It was a touching and insightful look into grief and the healing process.I highly reccommend this book, but I would caution everyone to read it with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"It's hard for me to find time to read a book. I either just don't have the time or I don't try hard to find the time. With Lovely Bones I made the time. This book to me was haunting, sencere, sweet and just amazing all at the sametime. I am now passing it on to the rest of the lovely ladies in my family. I only wish to see more of Susie in her wonderful Heaven. I just may read it all over again when it comes back to me. No, I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Bones is More like It!","review":"The book grabs you in right away and then takes you down a spiral of nothingness. I got sucked in and fell all the way down to the bottom - help!! Somebody get me out. I did finish the book, much to my regret. I kept hoping it would come back and give me a reason for the interest I had in the beginning. Sorry to say it never gave me a hint. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fill your head with this","review":"Please don't read this book. It trivializes horror. Keep it as far away from young children and teenagers as possible. Teach them the evils that exist in this world and instill in them the precautions they must take to stay safe, but DO NOT let this book be their teacher. Murder, adultery, theft, betrayal, rape, teenage sex. Are these truly our bestselling themes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissatisfied!","review":"I was expecting a very good read, after hearing and reading so many positive reviews on \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" Sebold needs to take a different route in her writing. This is diffently a book you either love or hate. I will sell my copy to someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, Aimless, and Bland","review":"The aftermath of a murdered daughter's family as she watches from heaven. This could have been good. But with the sagging melodrama that never goes anywhere until some amateurish contrivance for an ending, this is one boring read. These great characters deserved more. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad to the bone","review":"This book is just a classic case of literati hype; it is poorly written, the ending is right out of bad cinema 101, and the people /circumstances in the book are just implausible. Frankly, I have no idea why any publisher would bankroll this rag. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I enjoyed the story until...","review":"A book's ending can make or break it. While the majority of this story was fairly decent, it fell apart at the ending. I liked the idea that the young girl was telling her story from heaven. Unfortunately, the author seemed to have been struck with a case of writer's block at the end and asked a stranger to write the ending. That could be the only explanation. Why else would the girl come down from heaven to have sex with some boy, but never come down and reveal her killer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Could Give this 0 stars","review":"Previously, I posted a review of this book. I think the book it is a wretched exercise in overrated drama. Somehow someone had Amazon pull my review. Here I am again; the lone negative wolf in a bevy or bravadoes (sic).Essentially a chick book; this misbegotten mess is unoriginal, implausible and downright corny at the end.I heard Peter Jackson is going to try to make a movie of this rag and I am wondering how how he is going to make something from this mess with an ending that should shame any writer.What continues to stymie me is; how could this book have gotten such good reviews from the professionals?"},{"rating":"2","title":"tragic story","review":"it is hard to say that you loved such a sad book, but that is how i felt about this story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, exactly what I expected","review":"My purchase got to me quickly and was exactly what I had expected, good shape. Would definitely buy from this person again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourites","review":"I really enjoyed this book although I thought the ending let it down a bit. This book was very memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story!","review":"This is one of the best books I have read lately. Keep the tissue box close by. I got through this book in just over 5 hours of non-stop reading, because I could not put it down.The style of writing for this book is very unique. The story is told from the victim, who is in heaven, to you the reader. It follows the death of a girl, and her family and how they adjust to her being gone. It also takes a new lood at what heaven might be like, according to the author, everyones heaven is different, depending on what you would like it to be. Almost any wish can be granted, except living again.It will grab you in the first paragraph and hold on to you till the last, making you ask when you are done, \\"What happens next??\\" I am very glad that I found this book and will treasure it for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Lovely, Sweet and Sad. This book is a good and fast book to read. It is frightening how the main character comes to be the voice in the story but a sad fact of life in these times. This book is well written and i enjoyed it a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate language","review":"I purchased this book for my granddaughter because it was on a list of recommended reading at my granddaughter's Veteran Memorial Middle school's Accelerated Reader program. She started reading this book and immediately commented that the language was foul and much to her credit indicated that she would prefer not reading this book. I would not recommend this book to young people middle school age or younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"book review","review":"The beginning of this book is so disturbing that I have not finished it to this day...4 years after purchase. I have returned to it on a number of occasions and feel obligated to finish. My book club gave it positive reviews and I hear nothing but good about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spectacularly failed to deliver","review":"Good start. The idea of a murdered 14-year-old telling her story as resident in heaven is an attractive idea.However, the story-telling goes down hill rapidly as the characters behave in manners so bizarre, so quickly, that as a reader I find it hard to keep interest. The most ridiculous point (amongst many) is the main character's desire to spend her only time back on earth having sex with a little boy (now grown up) who used to like her. If the girl is raped then brutally murdered at the age of 14, one would think sex is probably not the most important thing on the mind of such a soul.A good story must have a good beginning, a decent middle and an equally good end. The author has failed even at the second hurdle."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Over The Place","review":"I had heard great things about this book so decided to read it. I agree with a lot of the other reviews that say it started out really great and then fizzled out. I think the storyline was all over the place, and I couldn't understand what the point was, other than just to be a fly on the wall in the lives of Susie's family. I was also not happy with the bodily possession (a bit much in my opinion) or the weak ending. I think the concept was interesting, and I think I would have liked it better if it kept the same energy it had in the beginning. I did enjoy the fact that it was based in the Philadelphia suburbs, as I am familiar with that area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Distubingly Fascinating","review":"The Lovely Bones sucked me in from the very first page. It is not a particularly pleasant subject, but is disturbingly fascinating. The writing is compelling and I would highly recommend this book. I could not put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to read it before watching the movie","review":"I wanted to read this before watching the movie which is scheduled for worldwide release in theaters on 1/15/10. I really enjoyed the book. Some parts were very surprising as I had not read reviews prior to reading the book. I heard there was some controversy about the references to heaven. I don't think it was meant to have a true spiritual component to it. Susie often referred to heaven as \\"my heaven\\". It was different but not bad. Now that I have the characters and the storyline fresh in my head I am looking forward to seeing the movie this weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was a strange book","review":"I am impressed that this book is so popular. It must be a reflection of the state of being in this country. I gave it to my daughter first who thought it was wierd and skimmed through it. I continued reading hoping that things would tidy up in the end and they never did. It was a stretch for me to believe all the characters and some I just couldn't. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this was a top seller","review":"The idea of the story being told from the vantage point of a murder victim in heaven was very creative and the reason I bought the book. Unfortunately, that was the only positive about the it.As far as the \\"believability\\" of the book, I cannot agree more with the review from \\"Psychologist from Michigan\\". The characters and story in this book are pathetically unrealistic. I can't say this any stronger. As the book wore on, I kept shaking my head in frustration and looking to see how many pages I had left to endure and hoping for a good ending.Unfortunately, the frustration continued as the ending was another huge disappointment. To say the ending was anti-climatic and overly unbelievable is an understatement. I read 300 pages for that pile of trash ending?The author is someone who came up with a creative idea to write a book, but doesn't have the skill to write a good book. This was a big dissappointment and I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Won't Be Able To Put This Book Down!","review":"The Lovely Bones is an engaging and disturbing novel about death, life and after death. This book upset me and comforted me at the same time. I was so engrossed I could not put the book down and missed a great deal of sleep so that I could finish it. Susie Salmon is a fourteen year old girl murdered one night on the way home from school. The book is written from her point of view as she looks down upon earth and her family from heaven. Susie turns out to be smarter and more perceptive than she thinks she is and she tells a story of loss, love and redemption in a way that connected me to the book and the characters. I highly recommend this fast paced read for anyone looking for a good book they can't put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...simply amazing.","review":"This book was one of the most moving stories I have ever read and have recommended it to all of my friends. What a powerful, sad, inspiring story. This book will stay with me a very long time. I cannot wait to see what she writes next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, but an unsatisfying ending...","review":"I loved reading this novel and feel the author has a lot of talent. Alice Sebold's writing style and her little jewels of descriptions and metaphors grabbed me from the beginning of the book. I found myself wishing the story would continue (a sure sign of a good book, in my opinion). Then the ending came and ruined the reading experience and left a less than satisfying taste in my memory of great books. I hoped for a better resolution, some answers, or just some profound advice on living for the reader, and yet it felt incomplete--as if the writer had to meet a deadline. Maybe there was a profound answer that I didn't catch, but I felt the ending was too neatly wrapped and superficial compared to the rest of the novel (which offered an interesting vision of heaven).Would still recommend this book to any teen to adult reader. Quick and easy read too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking","review":"I read this book never having heard of it, so I had no preconceived expectations going in. In my opinion the book is very well-written and has been hard to get out of my mind since I finished it a week ago. It was very unsettling to experience Susie's death with her. To hear her describe the disposal of her own remains was quite chilling. I felt that the author's depiction of how such a tragedy can tear a family apart was very realistic. Statistics show that a broken marriage often follows the death of a child. However, the most disturbing thing of all to me was the fact that this book followed Susie for eight years in heaven and never once mentioned God. I also find it contrary to what one expects of heaven to feel the longings and sense of loss that she did. None of us know what to expect of heaven, which I believe to be the author's point, but I rather hope for more happiness and sense of peace. It's good to read a book that shakes you up a bit and makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Bones was GREAT!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I don't think I've ever read a book that taught me so much about grief and death. Alice Sebold does a fantastic job of showing emotions of the characters and leaving the reader in suspense. I could not put the book down when reading about Susie's family starting their quest for her killer. I thought this was a very well written book and would recommend it to anyone. I would also read it over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very depressing with dull writing style...","review":"I honestly don't know what all the hype is about over this book. I found it to be depressing, boring and lacking in any kind of style. I think it is highly overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boldness of the attack!","review":"As an often disappointed reader of modern fiction I can say this book was far from disappointing.The author launches into a tale that is both grim and tender with an amazing certainty. The prose is beautiful and the telling of the story is bold-- confident.There were some parts in the narrative that might be weaknesses, might be me. I never really understood Susie's heaven. It seemed melancholy and like a slow kind of torture. It was more like hell. You can see the ones you love, see their struggles more clearly than when you were alive but there is nothing you can do for them.The last hundred pages unraveled just a bit. I found myself wondering at all the far reaching threads that kept being pulled into the narrative. The ending had the feel that it was time to wrap things up. It didn't have the confidence or certainty of the first 200 pages. It's a subtle drop off, though.Overall, it's one heck of a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author Review","review":"I read this book and was immediatly taken in by the storyline. I found the book difficult to put down because I kept asking myself \\"What is going to happen next.\\"If you are looking for a \\"good read\\" I recommend this title.

It was well written and kept me guessing. this is on my top list of books. i invite you all to read this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh look at death and what it does to us...","review":"I had read the first chapter of this book here on Amazon.com and then went on to buy it later. I couldn't put it down, and read Susie's story with many tears and much laughter. See, I was a girl in the seventies, so much of the pop culture rang so true. This book is a great read and very moving. I must say, I will not give it to my own mother to read as it would be too much for her (I too easily could have been Susie). I would reccommend it to anyone who would like help dealing with death. As a footnote, I applaud both Susie and her Author for including dogs in our own heavens - for what would heaven be without them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book about a hard subject","review":"\\"The Lovely Bones\\" deals with the difficult subject of child rape and murder, but Sebold crafts wonderful characters and her description of typical 1970s suburbia is spot-on. The story's narrator is fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon, who is raped and murdered by neighbor George Harvey (whom Sebold gives a background as well, but it feels overdone and largely meaningless). Her death sends her family into a tailspin; her mother eventually leaves and her father suffers health problems. Her sister, Lindsey, takes it upon herself to help the police investigate her sister's death long after it's become a cold case. Susie's school friends are also altered by her death: Ray Singh, her first crush, becomes involved with artist Ruth, who also senses that the dead aren't so far away after they leave the earth. Sebold's description of personal heavens where Susie lives are beautiful and sad. This is a book that lives up to its hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty ordinary","review":"I think the one thing that makes this book worthwhile is the authors poignant and yet not overtly sentimental description of how the love and fondness within a family evolves over time. Other than that, I thought the book exploits our natural fascination with human tragedy (the voyeuristic tendency to want to glimpse into the life of people whose lives are more dramatic than ours) to pass off a rather poorly written story. The characters are prototypical and glossed over. The only relationship that I thought was explored or described to some depth was the one between Lindsey and her father.The book itself is reasonably interesting but I think the writing is merely passable. I think the book is overhyped and that one's time is better spent reading one of the classics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bones about Lovely Bones","review":"Lovely bones was an excellent book. It was a quick read because it gets the reader hooked on the main character. It is easy to relate to for girls in their young teens because it is about a 14 year old girl. When she is murdered, it inrtigues the reader to want to know what happens after her death. The reader then gets engaged by the younger sisters character as she grows up. It is a good story to teach people how to relate to a tradgedy in their home. It helps people to move on, and not stay stuck in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing.","review":"i was unsure of reading this book at first, only because of the thickness of it and all the pages. I then began to read then first pages & it captured me. I couldn't put the book down. I have read many, many, many books and this BY FAR is the greatest book I have ever read. I made all my friends & my mom read it & they all found it amazing. I recommend this to anyone who is passionate about reading & looking for an amazing story that will not only touch you, but really make you think about what you have. ITS AMAZING!!=)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"I read this book in a manner of a week. You must understand, however, that with work and many other commitments, this is a short time to spend on a book for me. I thought that this book was an excellently written rendition of a horrible tragedy. The storyline carries you through Susie's death to her first kiss, and to the resolution of the investigation into her death. Such a sensitive topic...and yet it was handled beautifully by Ms. Sebold. It neither minimized nor overblew the tragedy of death and loss, but told a moving story and kept me reading it, waiting expectantly for the next page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes You Think","review":"Alice Sebold provides a unique and at times haunting perspective on a child's death that will make you think. I wish that there were more redeeming lessons in the story, however. I just finished THE GRAVEL DRIVE by Kirk Martin and found that to be a more inspiring, redeeming book for parents. Either wya, you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Ending","review":"The first of the book held me. As it continued, I became frustrated trying to figure out who she was talking about at that moment. The ending was terrible and very unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner!","review":"This book was well written and very imaginative. I really enjoyed this page turner. It is a tragic story about a little girl that was brutally murdered by her neighbor. The story unfolds as Susie watches life continue without her, and her murder being investigated from heaven. Although sad, I really thought this book was worth reading and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"Reading the back of the book The Lovely Bones sounds like an enchanting story, but open in it and its brutal. The descriptions of Susie murder are much too graphic and highly disturbing.

However, this summer my teacher assigned this as summer reading. I was excited to see what all the buzz was about.But The Lovely Bones left me disappointed. I couldn't feel a strong enough connection with the story or the family. I didn't feel comfortable in Susie's \\"heaven\\", and the strange possession of Ruth's body weirded me out. The most exciting parts were the parts that got sort of murder-mystery on you.When I finished it, I felt like I should feel uplifted--but I wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reassuring","review":"Bought at an airpot and figured it would be a sleeper. To my surprise it was quite capturing from the first couple pages. Susie Salmon tragically & abruptly taken away from earth and transported into a plane in where we all have questioned at one time or another. A beautifully written novel about love, understanding, perseverance and finally justice. It was very hard to put it down. Although the ending was far from where i though it would lead, it made me understand that the authors message was one of reassurance to life's grief of loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was a tough love for me..","review":"a roller coaster of emotions for me. i came to tears a few times. it was a beautiful sad journey as well as frightening (following Mr. H he couldn't die soon enough). i'm a bit of wimp when it comes to tragic stories about kids. i enjoyed it nonetheless. as much as she detached herself, i loved abigail, i think she represents alot of mothers out there who \\"wonder if?\\" whether one has lost a child or not. it's worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Will Make You Stronger","review":"I read this novel and was really immersed in the emotional landscape of the Salmon family.

It's definitely great since it tells the book through the dead girl's view!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper","review":"THE LOVELY BONES certainly grabs one's attention in the first few pages. But the initial powerful surge of tension ultimately leads to a limp resolution, and in the final chapters the reader is mired in a morass of syrupy sentimentality. Sebold's \\"omniscient first person\\" viewpoint, morerover, though a novelty in the beginning, soon feels irritatingly manipulative; her narrator's ability not only to know the thoughts and feeling of all the other characters but, by the end of the book, actually to inhabit the body of one of those characters, is simply overkill. This was a promising but ultimately disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel was not lovely","review":"I am sorry, I really liked this book in the beginning. I found it unique and interesting. Then, about half way through, it was almost as though another author took over and began writing. I lost interest in all of it. Her focus stopped being on the murder and investigation, but on characters, I didn't understand. The ending was disappointing to say the least. This could have been a very good novel, if the author had not lost her writing style and direction, in the middle of it. I wish someone could take the idea, and write a really good novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book started out with an interesting premise. I had high hopes, but the story was shallow, incomplete and hard to believe . Comments on the book's jacket described it in part as \\"funny\\". I didn't see anything even remotely funny here. I finished it only for the payoff at the end, but there was none. This book didn't deliver. I wouldn't suggest you waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"highly over rated","review":"This was one of this worst books I have ever read. The facts and details that captivate you to further read a novel, are reveiled in the first several pages.

Unfortunatly it slowly declines into mediocraty . The premis of a murder victim as first person voice is great but it should have remained a novella or short story instead of the book it became."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Chore to Read","review":"Simply stated, this book is a chore to read. I am 3/4 of the way through, however every page is a struggle. After a pretty strong opening chapter, the book takes a nose dive into the depths of boredom and drudgery. The narrator, 15-year-old Susie Salmon, speaks in a voice well beyond her years with not much personality. The other characters are not very well developed or likeable. Her grandmother is the only interesting character in the book. I look forward to finishing this and moving on to something a little more worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Thought I Would Never Finish This Book!!","review":"I really wanted to like this book, I had bought this book when it first came out and put it aside along with my other books that are waiting to be read.

Much of the writing is lovely, but there are serious problems with plotting and narration. Susie's heaven is too cute, her voice too precocious. Many of the chapters have no real reason for being there. Much, much too often it is very obvious it is Sebold narrating and not Susie. The beginning chapters are compelling, and Susie's degredation is undeniably powerful; but the story, as handled by Sebold, cannot sustain itself all those pages. I would disagree with a previous reviewer in only one respect. No creative writing teacher, none I know anyway, would have told Sebold to write that way. The novel is a very disappointing read, and I cannot understand why it was so well reviewed in the media."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the brilliant writer of Lucky?","review":"When I began The Lovely Bones, I'd just finished reading Lucky,which I think is one of the most gripping,insightful,and humorous memoirs I've ever read -- so, I couldn't wait to read Sebold's first novel.Then, to read what seemed like idle reveries of a suburban everygirl or everyboy or everydaughter or everyhousewife or everyhusband,depending on the character in Lovely Bones,well,to say I was disappointed is an everystatement.Lucky was so taut. Its prose, its plot, its magnificent dark humor, about a distinctly unhumorous crime against Sebold,kept the reader riveted. By contrast, The Lovely Bones, with its limp style and indifferent characterization made me struggle to maintain my concentration or to care about these characters.I do think that Sebold's gritty and brilliant writing in Lucky could be repeated in another book. Alas, I didn't find it in The Lovely Bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely bones?","review":"Having many friends who recommended this book to me I was sadly disappointed with it. Maybe I'm being stupid as so far I've read only heavy praise but I felt the book sadly lacking in reality and character. Maybe that wasn't the objective of the book but when Susie Salmon fell from heaven I felt that the plot was lost. Maybe I'm not deep enough to grasp the novel. It did however take me; I read it quickly and maybe that was the problem or I'm just not the kind of person who likes reading about a girl who has been raped and murdered and is watching her family have sex and stare her murderer in the face every day. Maybe I'm staring a future classic in the face, or a book which will eventually been forgotten. Who knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste ...","review":"This is the most unsatisfying book I've read in years. The only reason I bothered to finish was because it was the most recent choice of my book club. I kept waiting for something redeeming to occur, which didn't happen until I slammed it shut for the final time.The story is pedestrian and the writing banal. There isn't anything original about this novel, and many of the characters (i.e., the grandmother) though meant to be quirky and eccentric, are simply cliche and annoying. This book is best reserved for adolescents, but only if the goal is to inhibit their imaginations.If you feel compelled to read something unsophisticated, this is your book. But do yourself a favor ... buy a used paperback edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype!","review":"This week's (1/16/03) New York Review of Books has an excellent article as to why this book is so popular: some post-9/11 need for simplistic healing and soothing fantasy about life after death.Sebold is more of a poet than a fiction writer. That is, she's adept at spinning pretty images, rather than showing us the paces of a plot. The characters are cardboard cutouts, and by the time the \\"dead\\" narrator slips inside the body of her old schoolchum, I knew we'd entered rock-song teen fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made For TV","review":"What's all the hub-bub, bub? \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is just an extended, R-rated episode of \\"Touched By An Angel\\", only sappier. The prose is by turns flowery and convoluted; sometimes it is flowery and convoluted at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly Encounters","review":"Alice Sebold writes a mystery equipped with special effects. Susie Salmon, in her own special Heaven, takes us on exciting encounters with her family, friends and her killer. She makes you think about what life would be if we could manipulate the people who are still living on earth from faraway heavenly borders. I liked the quirky way that she describes her friends and her family. The strong characters come alive in her descriptions. My favorite person was her grandmother, who jumps to the family's rescue when Abigail runs away from her husband to immerse herself in the baptismal waters of the ocean. The ending was bizarre with Susie's best friends sharing with Susie another heavenly enounter. It didn't make much sense to me; it might have been the adolescent Susie fulfilling her dreams. Mr. Harvey's departure was a perfect success and the lovely bones of baby Abigail Suzanne brought the memories of Susie to rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that can provoke thought and hopefully discussion about grief and loss can only be a good one!","review":"I didn't find this book depressing at all, far from it actually. I thouht it was a moving and healthy description of how people cope when someone very close to them died. The thoughts we think, the way we make assumptions, the guilt we feel \\"...Out loud I said I had two children. Silently I said I had three.\\" as well as social pressures.There were times where I wanted to skim-read and move on to something else I could relate to or a faster moving scene so it's not gripped me as much as some other books have, but this novel does what it sets out to do; Make us think!... about life and death, relationships, our own ideas of heaven or what happens when we die...and overall a knowledge that grief effects us all in different ways and that although time and our lives move on, it's perfectly normal to still think about and talk about the one's we've lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good summer read","review":"The way this story is told is very intriguing. - Susie Sammons is dead and narrating from heaven.The characters are very intriguing. - A strong and silent dad, and mid-life-crisis mom, etc.And so though I'd recommend the book as a good summer read, I was also a bit disappointed by the ending.It was a little strange. And a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dead daughter witnesses the grief of her family","review":"If you're looking for a touching story about the grieving process, this is the book for you. \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is the story of Susie Salmon, a 14-year-old girl who is raped and killed by a neighbor. Susie tells the story herself, looking down from heaven, a clever perspective that touched me. Several years ago, my brother died (under different circumstances), and reading Susie's perspective on how her family moved on made me realize it was ok for me to do the same. Several parts of the book touched me so much I cried. At the end, Susie has an exchange with Ruth and Ray that is kind of weird, but I think the rest of the story is extremely believable. Yes, it is a little cheesy, and it is an easy read. Reading it won't raise your I.Q. However, it may heighten your understanding of the human heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"I sure hope heaven is like this!","review":"This book made me cry. Now, I'm not the type for weepy, sentimental novels. A book that tells the truth of humanity in a clear, uncluttered voice truly moves me. Alice Sebold has accomplished that here. The tale is told through the eyes of a murdered teen. As she watches her family--and her killer--from 'heaven' (a place where, happily, cats and dogs go, too, and your heaven overlaps with other heavens so everybody gets what they want AND they get to see the ones they love--and you even get a counselor to help you make the transition into 'deadness!!') we see the painful aftermath of a family living with an unsolved murder over their heads. I was angry throughout, thinking there would never be justice for this spunky girl's untimely death, but in the end, rest assured, there is. Folks, this book is worth it. It isn't drippy and sappy, but it will probably make you cry. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Possibly the Worse Book I've Ever Read.","review":"This is quite possibly the worse book I've ever read. If I could give it zero stars, I would.The writing is amatuerish, plot started out good...but then meandered, reaching an epic fail towards the end. The characters were very poorly developed, and overall it was sappy and melodramatic.The whole thing seemed like a monday night movie of the week starring Cheryl Ladd or some other former \\"charlie's angel\\" as the mother.And, I really could not warm up to the character \\"Susie\\" or her idea of \\"Heaven\\".~Kayla"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really don't know what all the hype is about. I was sorely, sorely disappointed after reading the book. This is nothing what I expected it to be. After seeing the previews for the upcoming movie, I saw the book in the store and figured I'd buy it (it cost me $2 more then the movie and more once you add in my time, gas, etc). Anyways, I thought the story was about the girls dad trying to find her killer, not her in the 'afterlife' watching how her family grew without her. There were incomplete storylines - like why did mom leave the family? This was probably the worst book I ever read and even, for the first time ever, threw it in the trash. I almost didn't finish reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Somehow I felt that if the subject matter was going to be so horrible, then we must expect to be uplifted and guided as we read this child's story from heaven. Not so. She never seems happy in heaven, nor do the other souls around her. She doesn't even seem content. Chapter after chapter one keeps expecting something....anything to give this childs life worth. To give the book some worth. Never happens. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring for my taste","review":"I think it is a well written novel technically... Well the first half that I managed to read. Maybe it's just my own personal taste, but the book is slow and pretty uneventful. A really great angle for the story by having a narative from a dead girl -- but that (for me) sems to be the only thing it has going for it. To this end I ended up reading it in pieces so it felt even slower. I think if you like a very good sensitive, well written but ultimately slow book - then it will appeal. If you want something with more bang then go check out Da Vinci code, Angels & Demons, Vanish, Secret Revelation, or State of Fear. I read all of these between reading Lovely Bones -- sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author seemed to lose interest in her story","review":"I was disappointed in The Lovely Bones.

I had no incentive to see read what's next."},{"rating":"1","title":"NARRATION IS TERRIBLE - Get the 2002 audio edition","review":"The book so far seems great, but the problem is, the narrator. The author should have never read her own book.

This was not so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let go of this book, and move on","review":"The problem with this story is that none of the characters are likable -- they're all passive and largely react when things happen to them. They don't have goals, and they don't have obstacles to overcome to meet those goals. The main character \\"watches\\" her family and friends the entire book, as if she was watching TV. She doesn't explore her heaven, she never really tries to help or connect with anyone living, etc. Perhaps I'm too picky -- I demand tension, excitement, and intelligence. Not here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This is an excellent book. The viewpoint is one that you don't normally find.

A definite read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was surprised to find this book on Time Magazine's list of 2002's best fiction. I began with great expectations, but alas, the book never really got off the ground.The characters seem too light and superficial. Many promising premises are introduced: Susie's heaven, Ruth's connection with the dead, the extra-marital affair, Mr. Harvey's past. Sadly, none of these beginnings ever culminates into a satisfactory ending. They are all dealt with in a surfacy, nealtly bow-tied manner. None of the characters ever really deal with the consequences of the situations the author places them in. Susie's closure with Ray Singh and Mr. Harvey's fate are particularly disappointing. The author seems to have gotten bored with her own book and tried to end it as easily as possible.There are a few interesting passages, but overall ... flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everythng great","review":"I received the book very fast, in great condition, like new.

I completely lost respect for this book when Susie came back to Earth in Ruth's body...WHAT?! Even aside from that ridiculous plot point, I couldn't stand her writing style.

I assumed this book would be excellent because of all of the attention surrounding it, the movie etc. I thought that the book was going to be the story of a murdered girl who haunts her family through dreams to help them find her killer...and it was sort of, but not really. The book mostly is just Susie watching her family from her \\"heaven\\" after she dies, which is actually really boring.

I had heard a lot of hype for it so I decided to head to the library and check it out. When I read it, I was horrified by the chapter about the murder and rape of this innocent young girl whose curiosity got her killed. The rest of the book was ok, but needed more substance. It should have gone more into her experience of heaven and left out the other characters. This book freaked me out and shouldn't have been hyped as much as it was. I do recommend it for adult readers, being that the main ideas were good, but not for younger children whose minds may not be able to handle the complex world of murder and rape."},{"rating":"2","title":"A generally good book","review":"I read this book in fairly short amount of time. I didn't want it to be over, I liked it that much. Some of the characters and ideas are a little predictable, but still a good book.

But about halfway through, I started to lose interest in the story. It seemed to turn into a disjoint collection of observations on grief and death.

I swallowed the beginning and thought it was extremely creative, but there were certain characters that I wanted to konw more about (Hal, Samuel, her father in his younger days) and some that were elaborated on too much (Ruth). I would've liked to have found out more about Mr. Harvey's back story. I was getting annoyed that it took so long for the police to gain evidence, but that was realistic. The problem I had with it is when important things like the bear, the necklace, and the hunter were mentioned, it was chapters before we found out the outcome. I guess I was looking for more Law n' Order, less La La Land."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This book takes place in a small town in the 1970's. It's about a young girl who is mysteriously killed and everything that comes after. The main charecter, Susie, is telling the story from heaven. She just sits back and watches everyone on earth. In heaven she gets everything and anything she wants. As Susie watches he murderer get away and her family fall apart, she realizes how much she misses her friends and family. After ten years it finally happens her family is all back together. Her mom left then came back later and now the family is coming together again. Now everyone can finally move on with their lives and get over Susie's death. Over all I thought that this book wasn't very good. It was exciting in the beginning then just trailed off into other topics and got very weird. Basiclly I would'nt recomend this book to anyone. It was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely not what I expected","review":"After much hype about this book and my friends telling me I just had to read it I picked this book up on a run to the store. It was a very slow read and it jumped around a lot. At some points I found myself confused because I wasn't sure where this passage/anecdote came from. I kept waiting for it to get better and it didn't. The last fourty pages seemed to have nothing to do with the rest of the book and yes, like some other reviewers I felt cheated. The end was not what I expected. I felt nothing was wrapped up and there was a lot of build up only to drop u in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"This book is a page turner from beginning to end. I have a child of my own and I thought I can't possibly get through this book at the beginning. But by the end of page 5 I was so captivated by this book that I couldn't stop! I highly recommend this book to everyone. The way she describes her heaven and others is a nice take on heaven. It's a different angle of it. Great writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book","review":"I loved this book, but found myself confused and not as interested in some parts of the story, especially the last quarter of the book. Overall though, it was a haunting and powerful story that saddened me, but kept me turning the pages. I liked the ending and the characters were believable. I loved the foreshadowing, and the poetic way Alice Sebold writes. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"I have to start by saying that this is not normally my cup of tea. I picked this up by chance at a Boarders store and it gripped me. I finally decided to buy it through Amazon and I am so glad I did. It is a very delicate and refined book. Odd to say that about something that starts off with a 14 year old girl being killed but that is how I felt about it.I liked the way how this book dealt with the death, with the family moving on, with life as it moved on whether you were ready for it to do so or not, how some people never stop amazing you (the grandmother stepping in to fill a much needed space) and how in the end the things that should matter the most don't turn out to be so important.I am glad I took a chance with this book. I know that this is a movie now and I will head out and see it. However, if I have learned anything is that adaptations rarely turn out to be the same as the book. Deal with them as potentially two separate entities and you will be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling read","review":"This book is a gem. Though I devoured each word as if it would somehow explain loss, death, the power of the mind and the connection between people, ultimately no higher meaning was given. The truth is discovered within the characters and whatever the reader comes away with is personal and precious. The writer expects, demands rather, that the reader work and come to conclusions on her own. I was disappointed and felt unfulfilled at the end, that all the ties were not tied neater, until I understood that that was the point. The writer provides the reader with the characters and the story so similar to life: nothing is easily explained, there are no pretty satin bows with which to tie things up. This tragic story finds a way to transcend it's horror by telling simple truths about life and relationships; a child's murder is juxtaposed with the telling of her first awkward kiss. Ultimately, the characters are real and unforgetable and that, to me, is the mark of a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After all the publicity and hype, this book is my most disappointing read in a long time. Sure, there are moments of powerful reflection, especially on the relationship between children and their parents. But the prose here is pedestrian at best and the characters are hardly developed in interesting ways at all. And there is no real ending to this book. Readers looking for interesting and compelling novels would do much better by reading recent novels authored by Geraldine Brooks, Julia Glass, and Kate Jennings, all of which deserve the acclaim, attention, and publicity that this book has received by the mainstream book publishing/advertising industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding read.","review":"Having read several reviews about the subject of this book, it was a bit difficult for me to decide to actually sit down and read it. But, it kept pulling at me, and, after hearing the author talk about writing the book, I knew I would have to read it. Once, I finally did open it, I gulped it down in one sitting. Like many other readers, I was sorry to see it end, but, unable to slow down. I hoped for peace for Suzie's family, and, justice to catch up with Mr. Harvey. Ms Sebold reminds me that, very often, life deals to us in ways we never would have expected or wanted, but, she reminds me so gently that I am left shaking my head saying, 'That's right, that's how things are here.'I highly recommend this book, and, look forward to anything else Ms Sebold offers in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking, Comforting, and Beautiful.","review":"Alice Sebold should get five stars for imagination alone. Her conception of the afterlife as seen through the eyes of a murdered fourteen year old is unique and original and will have you seeking out people who've read the book so you can talk about it.I found the book hard to put down once I started, and a little awed by the flood of emotions it managed to stir up. I've tried hard to stay away from reading many of the reviews until I was finished because I didn't want to know too much. Hard to classify: Ghost story? Suspenseful mystery? Painful and honest family portryal? It seems to capture so many different facets in an honest and affirming way I don't think you can help but be affected. This little girl, her life and death with stay with you. A book truly worthy of its accolades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!!","review":"I loved the book. I thought it is a great story.

It is what I needed. I do agree with others that the ending was indeed strange. And of course I would have preferred George Harvey to endure an awful, painful death. If you have lost a loved one and need to understand more, even though this was only the authors interpretation of \\"Heaven\\" and the ability to \\"look down on us\\" as we all imagine our loved ones being able to do then this is the book for you.

With more time and effort, perhaps the rest of the book would have worked out to something more satisfying. The characters became stick figures and the plot points ridiculous.

I can't believe I heard someone actually call this book a literary work of art?The appeal of this book is much like 'rubber-necking' a highway accident. The idea of death-rape-family breakdown is not a new theme, nor did I find Sebold's approach to it fresh and exciting. The ending is patchy, slapped together, and she could have done a much better job to bring the ending together to save the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost it's way","review":"This story was all over the place.

Well sad to say that moment never came. I just kept thinking that I was really glad that I hadn't just lost a loved one, because instead of finding the book theraputic I just found it awkward.This book does portray human struggles, but I wouldn't give it to someone who is struggling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"After I finished this book, I looked at the adulatory reviews on the back cover, and wondered what I was missing.

Also, the part where she comes down from heaven and makes love, well, it's kind of silly. Moreover, if the detective had any clue, he should of solved the murder immediately. I mean there is a single man who gives everyone the heebie-jeebies, lives near-by, and no one initally interviews him or visits the local dump site. It stains the crediblity of the plot.

I was disapointed at the ending and how rushed the last few chapters were, but still I love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book","review":"I must admit I did not like the begining of the book, Susie telling the story from heaven. However, this book is so powerful and enticing I could not put it down.Susie is murdered and she watches from heaven how her family and friends cope with her death. She watches them and her killer trying to make sense from her murder.

I was very wrong. As I read I kept thinking that something would happen soon that would make all the fuss pan out.I didn't enjoy reading this book, I didn't even hate it, I was bewildered and somewhat annoyed on every page. My most common editorial comment, out loud of course, was \\"Oh, please!!\\" while rolling my eyes and holding my stomach to prevent my nausea from overtaking me.There was no poetry of language, no spiritual connectivity; it was just depressing and irritating. Two hours I can never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...really wasn't that great","review":"I didn't relate to any of the characters, and despite the tragedy that happened, I couldn't feel any sympathy for them. They were distant and cold. The story itself was like a puzzle that didn't quite fit together. And the killer got off pretty easy in my opinion.

At the very beginning, the main character has some troubles, and the author describes it in gruesome detail. There are also some parts which are very risque. However, at the end of the book I was happy for the character and her family. Throughout most of the book, I was either sad for the situation or literally \\"grossed-out\\". This was quite a depressing read actually, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who couldn't handle it (if you know what I mean). This was not one of my favorites. I hope my review has been helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"This book was very interesting. It took the reader into two different aspects of the narrator (Susie Salmon)'s life. She told how her life was on earth, and described her after-life in heaven. I really liked how though Susie would never grow up, throughout the book, the reader watched her family and friends grow to become adults. The book was somewhat confusing in certain parts, but for the most part, I really enjoied it. I would definately recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Not For Everyone, Then...","review":"I just received both Fight Club and The Lovely Bones for Christmas. How's that for a paring?I only write that to give you some indication that I'm not some soppy sentimental sap who simply fell for a cheesey story. The Lovely Bones is truly one of the best books of 2002.I don't remember the last time I read such a gentle, honest story. The characters are among the most engaging I've ever read. The story carried along at a wonderfully measured pace. It was at turns sad, funny and enraging.Don't listen to the philistines here that give it 1 star. Pick it up, and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!!","review":"I think that \\"The Lovely Bones\\" has been the best novel I've read in quite a while. I don't think another author could have had Ms. Sebold's perspective. I thought it was beautifully written & I didn't want to put it down. I found the plot engrossing and the characters well developed to the point that it didn't feel like a book, it felt real. It was very sad, but really worth reading anyway. I gave it a 4 becuase it had some awkward moments & seem to twindle a little near the end, but overall, I really enjoyed \\"The Lovely Bones\\" & would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the end","review":"I don't know what all the fuss is about. It took me a long time to get past the first couple pages, not a very interesting subject matter, the killing of an innocent girl. Very cryptic. I found the description of heaven to be enchanting. The ending was VERY disappointing, nothing really happened to George Harvey, he was stabbed by a icicle????? I wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE with a young girl, too disturbing. This book will go to the garbage bin before I give it out to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not everyone's cup of tea","review":"Susie Salmon is ripped from her family by violence at the age of fourteen. The story is told from her point of view looking down on the world from heaven. After putting herself back together she watches as her family grieves, the man who killed her goes on with life and watches her sister and brother grow up. The first two thirds of this book kept my attention as we watch her family pick up the pieces and move on with life. Her father isconsumed with the need to find the man who killed his daughter and bring justice to Susie. Her mother is an unlikeable character as she compromises the investigation by becoming friendly with the lead detective and then leaving home. Her brother copes bestby just pretending Susie was never here and leads a good life. Her sister is where the focus shifts and became the downfall of this book. If Sebold would of not aged the characters so many years and had a more realistic ending this book would of been a 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Dissappointment","review":"I am sooooo glad I only borrowed this book, because if I had purchased this I would be really upset. I thought this book was terrible. A great idea but terrible execution. Who wouldn't want to read a book about a murdered girl looking down at the life she left behind? Sounds so mysterious and intriging... but this was awful. It went on and on and on and it was just weird.I have nothing else to say beacuse this book was just too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"wannabe classic","review":"This is just a mediocre crime novel masquerading as high literature. If you like this genre, go for established crime writers - at least they write well researched books with interesting plots. The prose is patronizing, the characters are shallow, the big bang of the beginning is an inaudible invisible whimper by page 20. The lack of research may not be obvious to an American reader, but as an Indian let me assure you that no Indian can have a name like Ray Singh (they are both last names) or Ruana Singh.

I think people are comforted about the fact that their was depiction of heaven.

I only read about 200 pages of this book and decided I would rather be reading a good Stephen King novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"I held off on reading this book when it first came out. Although it got good reviews, I wasn't sure how interesting it would really be. But I eventually decided to give it try. Turns out I was wrong about not liking the story.I enjoyed this book so much that I finished in one day. I was really intrigued by the author's concept of heaven - that it is unique for everyone. I thought the author did a great job in creating believable characters and storylines.My only complaint about the book is that it drags a little bit and the Ruth/Susie body switch was a little hokie.Although not a light subject matter, this book was a good read and I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique fiction","review":"Normally I am not interested in reading fiction. However, Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" had me hooked from the very first chapter. The author's perspective is unique and while the subject is death, the book is upbeat and enchanting.Sebold has an uncanny ability to jump from gender to gender, age to age, and paint a picture of incredible detail that makes the reader believe the herone, 14-year-old deceased Susie Salmon, is indeed looking down from her prison/heaven and experiencing the pain, joy, and emotions each of her loved ones have endured since her murder.The description of homicide detective Len Fenerman's feelings about \\"wounded women\\" on Page 272 is both compact and compassionate. \\"The wife in the bait-'n'-tackle shop had no bruises on her fact but cowered like a dog and spoke in apologetic whispers.\\"It is that kind of tightness of thought that could place Sebold in the same category as John Steinbeck and Pearl Buck as she continues to hone her craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I looked forward to reading this book, however, found it to be predictable and mediocre.A tragic beginning was a ploy to hold my interest, but it was lost like the victim. Then the nameless town, faceless people, proverbial parental and children problems , and lackluster language added up to the common comment of money lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written, But.....","review":"I'll make this short and sweet. It's a well written book, conceived in a poetic style that I have not seen in many books of late. The idea of a girl looking down upon her family after her untimely death is a very captivating and unexpected way to tell a story. So, why so few stars? Freudianism. The book starts as what is a fun, yet believable flight of fantasy, and lands just short of vulgar. It was a good story gone horribly wrong. By the end of the book, you'll have lost interest, being alienated by the blunt sexual references that are, in the end, more than just references. If you decide to read it, you'll be enchanted, then greatly disappointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is one of those books readers will find hard to put down once they begin reading it. The story is told from the perspective of a 14-year-old girl, named Susie, who is brutally murdered by her neighbor. After her death Susie must come to terms with what happened and is stuck \\"between heaven and earth\\" until she can accept her death. Susie watches her family, friends, and neighbors as they try to deal with this terrible crime. She also watches her murderer as he tries to cover-up the murder.Alongside Susie, the reader witnesses the overwhelming grief that almost kills her father, her sister's resolve to go on with life, her mother's efforts to face some truths she has tried to bury, and her murderer's past and secret life. This story is mesmerizing. The frailty and randomness of life are clearly felt. I enjoyed reading this book because the author does not provide easy answers, which makes the story line believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Perspective","review":"This novel is written from the point of view of the victim of a rape and murder. She looks down from heaven and watches how her family deals with her death. The novel is unique in its perspective. The story is very well written and amazingly touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Not Great","review":"I thought that I was the last person in America who still had not yet read this book. It has been on every bestseller list since its debut, appeared on Oprah (a huge endorsement in and of itself) and receives glowing reviews on Amazon. Even with those high expectations, I found Lovely Bones to be a good novel.A quick read, Alice Sebold captures her reader from the first page and keeps them until the last 40 pages. Everything you have heard about the book is true - the story is heartwarming, thought provoking, and bittersweet. However, I was extremely disappointed with the ending.Without giving anything away, the writing style in the last 40 pages changed dramatically and I was left feeling like Ms Sebold had abandoned her characters and me. All of which is unfortunate as it is apparent that until page 295 or so, she took much care in developing and stewarding their story."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Read this book. It's incredible, I've never read such a style of writing before. It really touched me. I can't even tell someone about Holiday meeting up with Susie without crying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I picked up this book becuase I had heard phenominal things about Alice Seabold and there seemed to be a lot of anticipation for the release of this book. First and formost, I must tell you its NOT a murder mystery as the synopsis lead me to think. Its not about finding the killer or anything. Its basicly about a family's healing process after a daughter was murdered. I proably would't be so bitter about the book had I known the focus wasn't on the murder, but on the family instead. Other than that, the writing was eloquent but a touch on the flowery side at times. Not a terrible read as long as you understand where its suposed to lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"The Lovely Bones is a great book. It is different than all the other books I have read in my live. I really can't say too much because I haven't read it all the way, but I am into the last three chapters. I have gotten to where I have to stay up till midnight or even later just to read it. When you get done reading it, I think you will just want to read it again and again because of how good it is. The thing i would really do is keep it and let others read it so that that they can have the same experice that I have. My friend and I both are reading it right now. She tries to take it, but i get it back. I would hope if you have heard of the book you should read it.

Yes, style should be an important element in literature--especially in work that elicited that much RAVING.The premise was compelling, but the writing was dull, which made me utter the premonition: \\"In the right hands, this could make a good film\\"When I found out that Peter Jackson and his equally talented wife would be doing just that, I breathed a sigh of relief. You see, I do hope that they can make a heavenly creature (;->) out of them bones."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lovely Bones","review":"The book, The Lovely Bones, by Alice Sebold was a very interesting suspense-filled mystery novel. It was really enjoyable to read this book because it was very different from other novels I have read. It was interesting to see the author's different view on heaven and what she might imagine it to be like. This book kept me reading with its very well described situation and its thought-provoking suspense. It raises many issues dealing with the outside world, such a child molestation and murder. It gives you a glimpse of the pain and grief that grows within a family who has had this type of terrible tragedy arise. Although the book was fiction, many issues in The Lovely Bones have happened frequently in real life and in ways could be considered a non-fiction novel. This book was a very good book, and very suspenseful, although, at certain points, it was kind of slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing.","review":"I am an avid reader and I have to say this book is by far one of the best I have ever read. This book really captures not only the reader attention but their heart.It is about a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon who was walking home from school and was lured by her neighbor, into a manhole and was raped in murderd. Susie goes to heaven and looks down as her family, friends, and neighbors are trying to cope with her dissaperance and finally her death. I like the way this story was written and it had nothing to do with \\"god\\" even though it mentions heaven, because not everyone believe in or worships \\"god\\", and it makes this story readable for everyone. The way this story is told is brilliant and captivating. I would recommend it to anyone in highschool and up. Its the kind of story i think everyone needs to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"EEhh.. not all that great..","review":"This book wasn't that great at all. It was very hard for me to keep on reading it. It was somewhat boring and a slow read. There is a story line, but it is just plain boring. A couple of times I wanted to stop reading it, but I kept going hoping it would get better but it never did. Not a book I enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revered","review":"As I sit here, fresh in the wake of The Lovely Bones, I wonder how to put into words what this book has done for me. This book filled me and then drained me, over and over again. I have genuine and lasting cares for every character in this novel. I find myself wondering \\"what became of the love that could have been and the love that was?\\" Sebold is perpetually honest and empathetic when describing her characters. It seems she loves them as much as I do. The Lovely Bones is, how the late Susie Salmon described her first kiss- \\"a beautiful gasoline rainbow\\". Bittersweet from beginning to neverend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read, but worth it","review":"This book was a bit over the top - and the ending feels rushed - but it really was a worthwhile read. The narrator is fun, witty and very likeable and the author tells the story with feeling, and good emotion. The writing is clean and crisp, with some flowery prose - but that's expected from a 14 year old narrator so the flowery prose is believable. I enjoyed the book and finished it in two days, reading several hours per day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado about Nothing","review":"This book is a perfect example of how marketing can take a mediocre novel and turn it into the Must-Read of the decade. Ahem. Nice book, interesting perspective, but alternately overwritten and underwritten. Not satisfying at all. The lovely bones could describe every character in here, no flesh on them, everyone's a ghost of a character and the treatment of grief is superficial at best. Sorry, this one's overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I remember . . .","review":"I finally broke down and read this book because of all the buzz it generated - after all, \\"Cold Mountain\\" generated a lot of buzz, and it was an excellent book. Unfortunately, this book reminded me of why I shy away from books on the best seller lists: They're usually pap. I think I'll go back to avoiding the best seller lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be duped by the hype","review":"I sure was duped. After hearing a glowing review on National Public Radio, I bought this book for my wife. My wife and I agree that this book comes no where close to the reviews. If anything, the book is an example of how the marketing machine can make pretty much anything into a \\"masterpiece\\" for a time. The book reads like Judy Blume. So if you like Judy Blume, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this book w/a passion","review":"Read this for a book club and absolutely hated it. The writing was awful, the characters unbelievable and I can't understand its popularity at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"I agree with \\"Where's Whoopi\\" and \\"What a let down\\" completely. Combined, they express my sentiments exactly. This book is going everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. It is extremely contrived and lacks any entertainment value. The ending was lame. It was as if the author just needed to hurry up and finish the book and couldn't quite figure out how to wrap things up. Overall, it was an utter disappointment, specifically considering all of the hype surrounding this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!!!","review":"Although the story starts in kind of a disturbing way, the book is just too good to put down!

I'm so glad I bought it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get through this book","review":"I loved the reviews of this book and the outline. I was very excited but unfortunately I couldn't get through the first pages. I kept reading and it was just boring. Maybe it wasn't my style but wasn't what I was expecting. I did not like this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Lovely Bones","review":"This book was probably a catharsis for the author to write but it wasn't a story that worked for me. I bought it because of the media hype and actually did find it to be very well written. The topic of death and what the victim was thinking and observing while in heaven sounded very interesting. However, as I was reading the story, the sadness was so overwhelming it was hard to shake. I simply hurt too much. It wasn't until literally the last handful of pages that any resolution was achieved. Sorry to be one of the rare nay-sayers for this book, but I won't be recommending it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read.","review":"This book moved me to tears before I even got past the third chapter. A wonderful, moving story. I look forward to reading more by Alice Sebold in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I found the writing in this book to be rather trite and cursory. The story was quite fluffy and the ending very Hollywood. I really don't get all the hype around it; it was the hype that led me to it, and I was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Wonderful, detailed writing puts you in the scene. I truly felt for this fictional girl. The story of her family's breakdown and eventual rebuilding over a terrible event was very real - not overly dramatic, not glossed over. While the story centers on a young girl, every member of her family had an engrossing story. I was rooting for them all, and the ending is satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Bones About It: Lovely Bones is an amazing read!","review":"I truly could not put this book down. The perspective of the narrator, the change in settings, and the vivid descriptions of what one imagines heaven to be are just so unique. This book encompasses such a spectrum of human emotions: loss, longing, love between lovers,families,and neighbors, anger, denial, and forgiveness. There was just one part towards the end of the book which seemed out of place, but I would give it away if I tried to describe it. Nevertheless, this book is both lovely and amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took a leap of faith to write this book...","review":"...and another leap of faith to read it. I'm not sure why it hit the big time, #1 on NYT, etc, especially with the insipid cover. But it slowly sucked me in, in spite of the premise of a child looking down on her family from heaven, after she has been raped and murdered.I suspect the author was as surprised as her readers when this book took off into the stratosphere. Frankly, I'm not sure it's going to stand the test of time, and I don't feel moved to reread it. But there was a quiet power in the story, and a rare kind of healing took place, in spite of the somewhat unfulfilling ending (which I don't mention for the sake of those who haven't read the book yet).Read it. Think about it. Then give it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"When I was going to start reading this book I had expectations as to what I thought it was going to be like. I read it with justice and revenge in mind. When I read it at first I was disappointed because that is not what it is about. But the more I thought of it and the story that was told.... the more I liked it. I wish I had read it with more of an open mind. The book did bring out a lot of emotion, I cried and laughed. The story was told very well and made me look at things in different way. I will and have recommended the book to friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put it down..","review":"I hesitated to read this book. I had heard it was about death. But a murder? And the story told by the murdered girl? This book was very upsetting, but I couldn't stop reading it. I think alot of people have some sort of idea what their heaven may be, so I was glad to read what heaven may be like from someone else's perspective. I think the book was nicely written. It's just the whole subject was very emotional and upsetting to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Heavenly\\" Experience of love, growing up, and life","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I could not put this book down. The different perspective really draws you in and Susie Salmon's descriptions make you feel like you are there. Susie really grows through out the book and it feels like there are a few stories in one. Susie's portrayal of heaven is really believable and I could really identify with how hard it would be to keep her family together from heaven. I would recommend this book to teenage girls, or people who want to read from a different perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not great","review":"I work at a library and was constantly seeing this checked out. I then saw that it made the New York Times best sellers list, now I don't put much stock into this since my tastes differ greatly from what they say is \\"good\\". But I decided to give it a shot and I was not disappointed. It was a captivating story of girl who was rapped and murdered. The beginning was wonderful and kept me turning the pages. The only flaw was that in my opinion there was not a lot of heart wrenching that goes along with such circumstances. Also I found things happened way too smoothly. Still it held my attention and I have to give it that, and it would have still gotten 5 stars from me if it hadn't been for the ending. The ending is what knocked it down; I just ended up scanning over the last few pages for the most part. It seems that it got a little far fetched. Though I do recommend it I would not go so far as to guarantee satisfaction in this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow","review":"You know, I didn't care for this book very much at all. The beginning of the book really got to me and stayed with me for awhile as the author painted a very vivid picture of the murder. However, after that it just seemed to drag on forever. I also felt a bit let down by the fate of the murderer. I know that not every villian needs to \\"get his\\" in order to satisfy me but it just seemed to be a very anti-climatic end. A well written book but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated!","review":"I finished this book just because I wanted to see how it ended, not because I was captivated by the story. When I read that blurb on the book I wanted to read it as it seemed to be a very unique plotline, and it was. But for me that is pretty much where the interest ended. I don't know what the book was trying to SAY to me. Although Susie was the central character, we really didnt learn much about her other than the murder and her young crush. Another reviewer on here had the problem with the fact that everything tied up nicely, I would have to agree. To me the story was very \\"Hollywood\\" - nice happy ending which was strange considering the premise of the book! Would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I found myself skipping paragraphs towards the end of the book just to get to the end. I heard so many great things about this book, but it didn't do it for me. Although, I did feel for Suzie, I didn't cry as some of my other friends had. I found myself more interested in the non-existent forensics of the crime, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment","review":"The whole premise of the book intrigued me, a girl looking down from heaven and telling her story. I just could not get into to book at all. It was trailing off and not very descriptive of this \\"heaven\\" that she resided in. It was \\"work\\" to finish this book. Not reccommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maudlin gimmickry.","review":"Like many others I was led to believe that this was an outstanding example of serious literature. What it was, after reading seventy pages, I discovered, was silly hokum and a brazen attempt at bathos to move everyone to tears. It's like a fairy tale that turns into a nightmare of boredom. It will be amusing to see the author's next ployto make a lot of money while having really nothing to say. Save your time. Read DINO instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally overrated","review":"I read the reviews on this book expecting something really great. I was sorely disappointed. The idea is clever but it just doesn't work. I'm sure that someone will try to make a movie ot of the novel. Good luck! This is one that I really cant' recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this book a bestseller?","review":"Kept reading, waiting to understand why this book is so popular.Completely disappointed. Far from a shining star, Sebold is simplistic and boring. Didn't care a whit for anyone. And the lead detective is going to seduce the victim's mother? Puhleeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing with no merit","review":"I hardly ever dislike books this strongly, but I absolutely hated this book. In fact, my entire book group disliked it as well. I have tried to figure out why this book is popular but cannot find a reason. It is depressing, parts of it are ridiculous, it is slow moving, and disturbing. The concept could be interesting in the hands of a more talented writer, but in the hands of this writer it ends up being completely unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"choppy sentences","review":"This book was hard to understand because of the sentence structure. Choppy sentences that went no-where-\\"worked together, the snow falling, almost wafting, down\\", and \\"He had his family walking through the streets, going to school, passing, on their way, Mr. Harvey's green-shingled house\\". To be fair, I just finished \\"Empire Falls, by Richard Russo. Mr. Russo writes in a smooth, elegant fashion. I will give a book 50 pages to convince me its worth my time. I stopped at page 43."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it at all","review":"I can't believe that so many people liked this book. The way the story is told is interesting, but it wears off quickly. This is a story of a little girl who is murdered. There is no way to make this comforting to the reader or have us believe that good things can come from this. Yes life goes on, but for Susie it is over, no lovemaking with Ray while Ruth is gone that's for sure. Come on, this is all just too manipulative.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chilling and disturbing read","review":"If I had not had to rad this book for one of my classes, I would not have finished it. After reading the first chapter, I felt dirty and violated. Abigail Salmon's behavior as a mother is shocking and less than admirable, and Mr. Harvey (the villain) eludes punishment from the law for the many rapes and murders he had commited in the past. I personally would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!!!","review":"I feel that I'm being generous in even giving it one star. I've never hated a book so much as I hate this one. And I recently saw that it's going to become a movie. Why would they want to torture those who were fortunate enough to not have read the book??? I honestly do NOT understand why so many people seem to really like this book. It's simply not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A somber look at a child's death and revenge.","review":"The book is written from the view of the murdered child which is so unlike any book written before. The entire pros make you stop and think of the feelings of the child and the way the child leads everyone in the direction she wants them to go, this time it is all done the child's way. I have never read a more upsetting, yet inticing book in my life. I read this book in one read on a flight from Columbia, SC to Rochester, MN. It is a page turner and then when it is over you wonder how anyone ever harms an innocent little girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best novel I have read in years","review":"I saw this book at the bookstore and recognized the name just from the coverage it has gotten in the media over the past few years. I figured I would give it a try, since the plot sounded interesting. There are books that I read as a child that I still remember loving now 25 years later. This book falls into that category for me -- the best book I have read in the past several years. It is incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is rating this book to highly","review":"This was absolutely the WORST book I have ever read. Hopefully no one will waste their time reading it. I can't understand how this book was even published, what an embarrassment to the publishing company to put their name on it. Honestly I can't describe how much i hated this book. Don't make the same mistake I did by buying or reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I saw Anna Quindlen on the Today show promoting this book as a \\"future classic\\" and the best book she had read in years. She either must be a friend of Alice Seibold's or is receiving some kind of kickback from the publisher. I could not wait for this book to come out and submitted to the hype. Having recently suffered an expected death in my family, I was prepared for a life changing book with some profound meaning and depth. What I got instead was over hyped, amateurish, cliche, overhyped drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it 0 Stars, I would!","review":"This book was a huge dissapointment! I was intrigued about reading the story of Susie Salmon, speaking of her death and her family from Heaven.I found, however, that the characters didn't seem real to me. The character development was so poor that by the time I finished the book I was like, \\"So what!\\". What a waste of my time and money.I am not sure what all the hype was about... this book just didn't do it for me. I was waiting for it to get good at any time, but it totally let me down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Disappointing Book I've Ever Read!","review":"This book starts out extremely interesting and leads you to believe she will be able to help her family through the tough times. The story was extremely disappointing and goes on and on without approaching the real subject. I found the ending aggrevating and not worth my time of the entire read. The publicity this book has had is ridiculous and people who actually read this book in it's entirety I believe would feel the same. This is one book I would recommend not believing in all the hype. I bought it before it became so recommended and am still in awe at the push to sell this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pain, Heartbreak, Hope, & Love","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites! It's heart breaking yet full time for healing. As your reading it your guided by Susie Salmon who helps you see how her family, friends, and even her killer go through life on after her death and how she explores her new place, that so called \\"Heaven\\". Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is written so wonderfully unique and very enjoying to read that it is now to be made into a motion picture movie and is to be directed by Lynne Ramsay (\\"Raincatcher\\" & \\"Morvern Cellar\\"). I read the memoir \\"Lucky\\" and it was as best as \\"The Lovely Bones\\". I can't wait for the movie to come out, so I suggest that you read the book cause it's really no waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What does Sebold know about heaven???","review":"It was a struggle to get through this bookas it's very disturbing and dangerously depictsdying and heaven in a way that is very misleading.If one believes in heaven, then by default, onewould believe in God, and also the Bible. For peoplewho are confused or seeking answers abouttheir creation, dying and heaven, she has dangerouslyimplied heaven and dying as something other than whatit is. I understand that this is a work of fiction, butnothing would lead a reader to believe that this is a work of science-fiction. Some readers may be okay with the rape and dismemberment of a young girl, as for me, it's an unfortunate reality for few and the rest of us should not deem it entertainment. I'm giving two stars because it does portray a good account of what effects a loss such as Susie's might have on her family and even people she hardly knew, such as Ruth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing story concept but deflates mid-way through","review":"I am listening to this book on cassette and I'm not going to finish it. It has been dragging on since cassette 4 (out of 8)and I couldn't believe that I had that much more of the story to plod through. Sebold's writing is very thick and beautiful in points but it felt like the purpose of the story was diluted after the mid-point in the book. I'm glad I'm not alone in my thoughts about the boredom brought about during the back end of this book. Reading the other reviews made me decided that I will put The Lovely Bones down and return it to the library and pick up another one of the titles I have in the wings. I don't want to waste any more time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bones...","review":"I liked this book, but felt disappointed at the end. It gave me a creepy feeling for some reason. They never really resolved the family's need to find her bones and I expected there to be more. It bugged me. Forgive my lack of great explanation, I'm not feeling particularly intellectual/smart today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to the hype","review":"I read this book after many recommendations (from friends who have the same taste in books that I do.) and found it almost unreadable. None of the characters held my interest at all. I kept waiting for the book to get better, but sadly it did not. I am still wondering what so many people see in it. I had to skim to end it was so boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment...","review":"I was so disappointed in this book, after all the publicity! I love crime stories, but this one falls into some other category entirely. There's nothing compelling about this story, and the unusual plot device of having the dead girl narrate it wears thin early on. I gave up and never finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally inappropriate for teens !!!","review":"This book starts with a sickly suggestive and accurate description of a rape and a murder. I can say that the rape was too close to home for me... as I was raped as a teen... and spent years dealing with my fear of men...Several weeks ago my lovely adopted daughter began to act out and have severe mood swings, lack of sleep, snuck out after midnight, totalled my car, tried to run away, and even told the police that found her that she had been attacked by me!Then I find my own adopted teenaged daugther, who had been raped as a toddler by her father, had been assigned this sick and totally inappropriate book by her English teacher. She has been haunted by only half understood memories... dredged up by this perverted book... and now she has to write a term paper on this disgusting book. Please don't buy it, or give it to teens to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"The idea of this book, a dead girl in heaven seeing her family and murderer, was such a good idea! I was enjoying the book in the first couple of chapters and looking forward to reading the book. But the more I read, the more I was disappointed. I continued reading the book hoping it would pick up my interest again; but it never did and I felt the ending was just so dull and the one instance in the book of Suzie entering Ruth's body just didn't fit with the rest of the book. I felt it was a waste of my time and money. Come on Alice, it was a good idea, you could have done better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The book started out with a promise to be an interesting book but about 1/3 of the way into the book I began to get bored.I stuck it out & managed to finish the book but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends or even to my enemies. It had such promise & then fizzled big time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and compelling","review":"This book grabbed me from page one, and I read it straight through. It's a remarkable look at how each of us affects the lives of others. The book had a couple of flaws but none serious. I most enjoyed how the book showed the different ways each person grieves while not passing judgement on the differences. Lovely Bones portrays the peace and heartache of knowing that while we matter in space and time, when we die, others go on without us, albeit with a piece of us in their hearts. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Fluff","review":"I was excited to read this book because everyone's been raving about it. But I was so disappointed. It is purley fluff. It is simply meant to pull at your heart strings - it is not well written at all. It's a quick read and very shallow. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Hyped.","review":"I picked up this book because of the enormous hype behind it and from the majority of the positive testimonials here. Unfortunately I couldn't see what the big deal was. I thought the writing was ameteurish, it was uneccessarily and excessively gruesome in parts, the plot didn't engage me whatesoever, and I felt it was emotionally manipulative. The up side is it's a quick read. If you want a good cry, then by all means, carry on, but if you're looking for more message and meat in your literary choices, stick with something like 'The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay', the pulitzer winner of 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I will give my unpopular opinion but this is how i really felt about this book. i HATED it if i could give it zero stars i would. I have read many books and this is one of the very few books i couldnt finish. It was poorly written and the characters were unrealistic and bland. The story really wasnt that great either dont belive all the hype you hear about this book its not all what it is cracked up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!!!","review":"This book had so much promise, and even started out well. But it quickly deteriorated into a long, drawn out ... often confusing ... ping-ponging view of the life lost to rape and murder. It was just not worth the read, and I only hung on to the bitter end with a hope that it would eventually pick up and live up to the terribly incredible start. But it was not to be.With so little time, and so many great books to read ... dont waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It could happen...","review":"I liked the narrative but thought the last 1/3 of the book was a tad unrealistic. But overall a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading about the plot of this book I was very excited to begin reading it. The story started off well, however, it went downhill quickly. After Susie dies she watches her parents, siblings, murderer, and a couple of classmates from heaven. She also describes her heaven which she shares with another child. While the idea of this book is wonderful, I felt there were too many characters and I was never able to learn enough about one to connect with him or her. I was very disappointed after reading this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogwash","review":"Didn't like it at all. Could hardly finished it....typically morbid as is most of Oprah's choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"Although the book was very well written, I was dissapointed with the book overall. I was hoping for more out of the main character and was let down by the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated book","review":"Why are so many people in love with this book? I will admit that the first half is so good you don't want to put it down. That second half is horrid!!! It is as though the author had to drag herself to finish it and did so with overused cliches. What was up with the \\"Ghost\\" like out of body sexual experience?-I realize reality had to be suspended since the narrator is dead-but it was just too silly and reminded too much of Patrick Swayze taking over Whoopi Goldberg's body so he could be with his beloved Demi Moore). I wanted to love this book to the end but it was just not possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I would have read reviews.","review":"Well I agree with the rest of you on this...I bought the book because I kept seeing it on the best-seller list. I kinda read what it was about, but wondered what all the hype was??? I wasn't real thrilled with it at all. A dog finding nothing but her elbow? Is that supposed to be funny? I didn't even pass it on to anybody in my family. They would probably find me \\"strange\\" for even attempting to get into a novel like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful","review":"The first chapter of this book really was chilling and interesting. Still, I found some things about it that had me rolling my eyes. I guess I should have stopped reading it right there because I should have known it was only going to get worse............... Don't buy this book. It's utterly worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrifying to Uplifting","review":"I listened to the CD version of this book on a long drive. It's the story of a family trying to cope with the death of 14-year-old daughter/sister Susie. Early on, the book is horrifying. But this isn't a depressing book. In fact, it is quite uplifting so see family members and friends deal with the tragedy and eventually pull together. If you're looking for a crime mystery that solves everything and provides complete closure, you probably won't like this book. That's because the crime solving part of the story is in the background for the most part. The major story line revolves around how the family and friends of the dead girl deal cope in the days, months and years after her murder. It's easy to quibble with some of the mangled metaphors and occasional shoddy writing. Still, I found the book a good listen, unlifting in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having heard wonderful reviews on this book from various sources, i was excited to be using it in psychology class. I began reading immediately...racing through over a 150 pages in the first sitting. In these first pages i was moved by the plot and intrigued by the perspective from which Alice Sebold was telling this tale.However, this was all that appealed to me, i found the writing style extremely immature and rather tedious. There were numerous times where i just wanted to put the book down amd give up on it...the only thing that propelled me forward was the prospect that perhaps the latter part of the book would live up to it's raving reviews...unfortunately i was let down as the book ploughed on with it's prosaic narrative. And so for it's monotony and it's frivolity, i give this novel 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it!","review":"I was sold by the back of the book comparing this to 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. Whoever wrote that review has obviously not read the Harper Lee book. This is the only book I remember reading half of and putting it down and never picking it up again. I just couldn't get into the story or relate to any of it's characters.Everyone is different and no doubt millions will love this book, but it certainly wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell for it too!","review":"Well, I fell for all the hype too! The first 20 pages of the book may have made me think that it might be a good read.....it was just a slow, sad story!! I can not understand why this book got so many good reviews!!! A big disappointment!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book. I am now, periodically, reading the reviews with great interest (as well as reading another book with an unusual presentation, Norman Thomas Remick's \\"West Point\\"). People seem to either love Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\", or hate it. I think it is due to the enormous amount of PR it has had, for some reason that I for one certainly cannot explain. The PR has created great expectations. Some people may have expected too much. Though far from perfect, I still rate it at least a 5(-) star book of fiction owing to a creative and interesting presentation that I enjoyed.Also recommended: Norman Thomas Remick's \\"West Point: ...Thomas Jefferson\\", another creative presentation I am reading that, unlike \\"The Lovely Bones\\", is non-fiction and quite a little education so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"This book drew me in from page one. I finished it in a day. It was so compelling for the first half, but I have to say that I think it dragged on a little longer than needed, and started to jump all over the place. I was a little disappointed at the ending, but overall a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Prepared to Lose Sleep","review":"This is one of the best fiction books I have read in years. Alice Sebold captures the reader's attention from the second sentence, \\"I was 14 when I died,\\" and never lets go. The story is intruiging, a new twist on an old plot. As you watch Suzie watching her loved one's lives from heaven, you feel all her emotions. The entire time, one thought races through your mind...what will happen next? When will the pain for everyone end? Only to find out maybe it never does, which is the essence of this novel. One of the most touching scenes in when Suzie's dog, Holliday, joins her in heaven, and even those with the shakiest of faiths will be moved. I started this book on Wednesday at 6:00 pm and was finished with it by 10 am Friday. A must read for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most interesting books I've read in quite a while","review":"I had a love/hate relationship with this book because I couldn't put it down, even when I had important things to do! This is not really an intellectual novel, but everyone needs to read some fluffy books sometimes. This is a very unique book told from the perspective of a murdered teenage girl who watches the aftermath of her disappearance unfold from beyond the grave. The story itself is riveting, but the way the book is written makes it even better. I came across portions of the book that were so beautifully written, I had to read them again. Sure, parts of the book are a little out there, but it definitely makes you think about what happens when we die. If you are looking for a \\"guilty pleasure\\" read that is out-of-the-ordinary, choose this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strange comfort for every parent's worse fear","review":"This was an amazing book. Frankly I was leary of the premise but the author's style made the story bearable, one you needed to hear to the end. I flew through it so quickly, I made myself stop and think about what was happening. The wonderful story telling was not bogged down by sentimentality. The straight forward narration made the horrible loss bearable. Alice Sebold talks with the simplicity of a young child who has learned a great truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book of the Year!","review":"This book is really great. My father died when I was 7 and this book, even after 14 years, has helped me to feel a great comfort as if he really is watching and seeing me. It's just a great book and tears are easy to come at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"good book","review":"The lovely Bones is a good book, but towards the end, it starts to get boring and unrealistic. I think it was extremely pointless to have the mother run away and then come back years later. Throughout the entire book, it could have also used more details. Overall, I would say it's a good book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un-put-downable","review":"The lovely bones was one of the best books I have read this year. From the first page i was riveted by the main charaters chilling story. The main character, Susie salmoln, was murdered and narrates the story form her heaven. Her own private world where she is on the cover of each fashion magazine, and dogs dance at sunset in a field of flowers. Susie watches over her family as they try to cope with her murder. Susie also watches her murderer in some of the most chilling parts of the book. Though the subject matter is very serious, Sebold writes in a easy to read manner that is thoroughly entertaining. I know this book is very popular and it is for a good reason. This is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Bones","review":"I thought the the book called the Lovley Bones was the most interesting book that i have ever read in a long time. Don't get me wrong there were some parts in the book that were a little boring but overall this book was filled with a warm hearted good topic to talk about. The best thing about this book is that it caught my attention when i first read the first page. I suggest everyone should read this wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You MUST buy this one!","review":"I can't stress enough how well-written this book is. Alice Sebold seems to leave out unnecessarily graphic or gory details while still describing the unthinkable nature of the murder. So few words, yet more than adequate. Instead, she thoroughly and beautifully describes how Susie perceives her heaven and how bittersweet her view of the living seems to be. From Susie's first love to her mother's eyes, Sebold paints quite a beautiful picture. And THE LOVELY BONES is truly a must-read. I now understand why so many before me have given the book rave reviews. A truly remarkable tale, this book is among the best novels I've read in a very long time.Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I was looking soooo forward to reading this book but I hated it! I found it boring in some parts. I found the ending to be completely anticlimatic. Big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I got my money back","review":"I hadn't seen the movie, so I thought this was worth reading. Sorry, I was wrong but glad Amazon refunded the price my aunt paid to gift it to me via Amazon. I read maybe 30% of the book before deleting it from my Kindle. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I've heard a lot of people speak of this book. Truthfully, I just couldn't get into it. The beginning grabbed me and then dragged me through the rest. It was painstaking to get through, very slow paced. Not recommended in my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try Not To Miss This","review":"Excellent! Moving. Sentimental. Heartwrenching. A view from heaven of a chilling experience. Heartbreaking yet soul-moving. Best of all, like he book \\"West Point...\\" by Remick (a similar presentation I also loved), Sebold beautifully uses a unique and fascinating method of presentation. Try not to miss this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I am an avid reader, and a librarian. Despite the rave reviews this book has received, I found it to be a huge disappointment. The opening paragraph is a grabber; and the concept is fascinating (murdered girl watching how her death has affected those around her). But the book just doesn't deliver. I too have lost a daughter, though not to murder, and found the family's reaction implausible. And Suzie's heaven does not seem to be such a beautiful or desirable place; why does she still have such longing to be back on Earth? Finally, Suzie's return to earth to make love to Ray; and the way in which Mr. Harvey gets his \\"just desserts\\" are beyond believable! NOT recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too depressing!","review":"I heard a lot about this book while reading USA Today and watching Good Morning America, who both said this book was uplifting and wonderful. I disagree completely. For one, the premise itself is awful (she is raped and killed in the first 2 chapters) and the reader is forced to watch her family fall apart and her friends slowly forget. The ending was very unsatisfying and the \\"miracle\\" described in the cover made me angry. I don't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little Substance","review":"While I appreciate the way Sebold uses literary elements in her writing (and uses them well), I simply did not like the story. The characters are dark and the plot is depressing. The book is advertised as a story of hope, yet I felt as if the story was hopeless. What kind of hope lies in going to a heaven where you are consumed with the past and with watching the world you left? Where is the hope in a family that is ripped apart by death and cannot seem to let go of the pain, even 10 years later? Do not read this book if you want to feel uplifted or inspired... It's darkness and pain carries from the first page to the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese-bones","review":"Don't waste your time! Never before have I had to stop in mid-sentance and cry out to heaven - \\"OH MY GOD - HOW CHEESEY CAN SHE POSSIBLY GET?\\" Only to realize that I had underestimated her in the next chapter. I mean, the whole town turning out (spontaneously) to mourn her - like a freaking Coke commercial? (I actually started to hum, \\"I'd like to buy the world a coke...\\") And the worst offense is the fall to earth for a booty call?!?! The girl is still 14 in heaven (BECAUSE SHE WAS RAPED AND MURDERED, MIND YOU) and she decides her final burst of glory is to get laid?!?! The character development was desparately thin - which, in one case, leaves you wondering why the mother comes back after 8 years (during which she did nothing, apparantly) and decides to STAY!?!? WHY??? And why introduce characters in heaven - scenes in heaven - if Sebold wasn't going to do ANYTHING with them? I'm stunned to see this book get so much good press. Do yourself a favor and watch tv instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"I feel that it started very strongly, deeply with frightening detail, ran a bit long through the middle and ended predictably with every outstanding storyline coming to a perfect close. However, that said I adore this book. I did not want Susie to die, and in fact, felt a sense of losing her at the closing of this book. No one can ever fully realize the emotions felt by parents and siblings and loved ones when losing someone in such a violent way, but I feel that Alice Sebold gave us a bit of insight into the many facets of grief and all the different ways in which it can (or cannot) be dealt with. I very much recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Read","review":"I found this novel to be very comforting. The author leaves a warm and thoughtful idea that heaven is in the eye of the beholder. Alice Sebold captured my complete attention throughout her novel because the characters are so endearing and so thoughtfully written and the setting is so complete and imaginitive. Your heart can't help but feel the weight of loss on Susie's family. I enjoyed this book so much, that I would forget for a moment that I was reading a work of fiction. The unique imagery reminded me of the SECRET LIFE OF BEES, while the suspense reminded me of CONQUEST OF PARADISE. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has lost a family member and wonders about the afterlife. Even though, the afterlife is a work of fiction, I found it a great comfort in hoping that my loved ones are really watching over me and family. I eagerly anticipate another masterpiece by Alice Sebold."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of trauma","review":"I guess I fall into the camp of people who really love this novel. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found it highly original and thoroughly gripping. I especially thought the technique of \\"looking down from heaven\\" was interesting and unique. The quality of writing is super high and I felt the story moved with good pace. Overall, a very interesting and involving read that I won't soon forget. Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Interesting Read","review":"I enjoyed this book alot. You hear the story from Susie, a 14 year old gir who has been raped and even though I expected this book to be morbid, it was entertaining. Yet, there were many irrelevant details in the book. Overall, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLY LOVELY","review":"I've owned this book for years but just got around to reading it. I don't believe in heaven, angels, spirits - none of it, but that didn't stop me from loving this book. Sebold creates an other worldly atmosphere that I did not resist because of the strength and beauty of her writing, which somehow avoids being overly sentimental and deals with very ugly subject matter with objective grace. Even the ending that many objected to was for me stunningly, not painfully over the top. Generally, I'm ready to move on when a book is over but I did not want The Lovely Bones to end. What to follow it with was the problem. A heartbreaking work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runt of the Craftsman Litter","review":"I needed some bookshelves and thought the drawer would be a nice touch, but I was disappointed after I finally finished the 2-hour assembly required for this piece made in China. Not all of the fittings fit, the item is noticeably smaller and out-of-proportion to the other, solid oak Craftsman pieces in my BR, and sticks out like a sore thumb. It almost looks like downsized, kids' furniture and reeked of chemicals after I unpacked it, which led me to let it air outdoors in the sun for a day. Soon, it'll be relegated to the guest room, where its annoyance, perhaps like some of its co-occupants', will be only temporary."},{"rating":"2","title":"just excellent","review":"Although I do not like spirituals too much, it is a must listening to this fantastic countertenor singing with Moses Hogan.

After a short time, it will stop, second hand is frozen and the time is always off.I'm disappointed with this one.

From the era when Bob Seagren and Steve Smith held sway atop the sport, Ganslen describes in intimate, if prosaic, detail the mental and physical minutae of the most elegant and difficult endeavor in sport.In some ways pole technology and sports science may have surpassed the content of Ganslen's book.

In this book, he does not defend evolution in politics and ethics, but instead claims that fundamentalism (religion!) should be authoritative in these areas. What a disaster and betrayal! I like better (and recommend) books that maintain the truth of evolution in these areas, by people who are faithful to Darwin: Why Race matters (by Michael Levin); Race, Evolution and Behavior : A Life History Perspective (by J. P. Rushton); Mein Kampf; The Real American Dilemma: Race, Immigration and the Future of America (by Jared Taylor.); and the books by Richard Dawkins, a better defender of evolution, and true to Darwin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man without God and God without Science.","review":"This is a truly dreadful book, scribbled in the new age of the intellectually bankrupt. Mr. Gould proposes a discourse on Man and Science, in which those who are ignorant of grace should discuss God, and the rest of us should discuss the facts more carefully. Egad! New blood is urgently required in science and religion, and this type of book pleads for our ignorance, as if we, in all our needs and contradictions, have achieved some new pinnacle of understanding in our scientific and moral world. Mr. Gould is a scientist, and we pray that he speaks no more of God, as per his book, but informs us only of any facts that he has discovered. For those who are interested in the Rocks of Ages, I would recommend the originals, or morally chaste and inspiring books such as \\"Fermat's Enigma\\" by Simon Singh, or \\"G?del, A life of Logic\\" by John Casti and Werner DePauli."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufactured Categorization","review":"I like most of Gould's work, though it's often hard to read. I loved 'Wonderful Life'. I think his 'punctuated equilibrium' was an attempt to put a catchy label on a minor sub-theory that doesn't affect Darwinism much at all, just to get PR. I think now that the 'magesteria' in Rock of Ages is similar. He's set up these categories and derives his argument from that structure. I don't think that the religious 'strict constructionists' would go for the 'magesteria' categories. I think that he's failed to establish a basis for peace between science and those who believe in biblical inerrancy. What's worse, he's failed over a lot of pages of difficult stuff to read. Gould needs to take writing lessons from Richard Dawkins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gould can't have it both ways","review":"I think that fundamentalists are wrong, but at least they are more consistent than Gould: if evolution is true (in science), then it is also true in ethics and politics. If evolution is wrong, then it is wrong as well in ethics as well as in science, as fundamentalists rightly say. Gould wants evolution to be true in science but not in ethics: he can't have it both ways, double truth is nonsense. Dawkins is right: evolution is true in science, which entails that materialism is true and thus religion has no say in ethics and politics, but instead evolutionary / racial ideas should then be applied in those fields. In this respect Duke's My Awakening is an important contribution, although unclear about wordviews (is it possible to find a politics/ethics that is acceptable to materialism and religion?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Science","review":"In this book Gould takes another step in mixing science with his wonky social views, in this case arguing for a convergence of religious fundamentalism and evolutionary theory, which has not taken place and cannot take place as argued by the much superior Richard Dawkins, Unweaving the Rainbow, etc. Apparently Dr. Gould is also something of an apologist for the industrial appropriation of the biosphere as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The trouble with this book is that it has the wrong author.","review":"Professor Dawkins, when may we expect the book that needs to be written on this subject?Gould seems to envision the conflict between science and religion as some sort of scholarly philosophical discussion between C.S. Lewis and Bertrand Russell. What world is he living in? In ours, we have the likes of Pat Robertson and the Kansas School Board. There are serious, damaging challenges to science from the religious side of the fence, while scientists hardly give religious claims a second glance. The book's not a bad read; and a noble conciliatory gesture, but I think Gould has badly misread the current state of affairs in this country on this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really love Gould's work, but this is probably his worst effort. He is trying much too hard, and to no good purpose. He attempts to show that religion and science can live comfortably side-by-side in different magisteria, and cites Darwin as his example in the latter's ability to keep the two separate. Only problem is that Darwin didn't, and Gould makes not a single quotation from \\"The Descent of Man\\", where Darwin argues that morals and conscience are generated through the evolution of sociability among higher mammals in natural selection (rather than from God or the Divine, etc.) He also does not seem to see that science is essentially a \\"religion of error\\", where it is taken on faith that humans progress by learning from their mistakes.

The book tells much about those days of trapping and exploring when the West was an unknown and unmapped area. In addition to telling the stories of several individual characters like John Colter, Jim Bridger, Hugh Glass, Jeidiah Smith and others, the author takes time to explain the fur trapping business. There are several sections in the book explaining weapons, traps, boats, clothing, tools, etc. The result is that the reader gets a good insight into what these men did and how they did it. The one drawback might be that some of the character studies are a bit short, often leaving the reader wanting more information. However, for a general overview of an important time in our early history, this is a wonderful book.

For those who want some glimpse into the writer behind the scariness, this is a great book.

There is nothing wrong with the music or the performances, as they are superb. But you better buy it on another disc, because this edition has pops all over the last track. I thought it was one defective CD, but I returned it and got another--and it had the exact same pops in the exact same places. This is not my CD player. It happens on all CD players, including my computer, which is usually impervious to such nonsense. So, get a different edition. The current printing of these CDs is flawed. And, to make matters better, Sony doesn't take their CDs back--they say that they are perfect. So unless the store you buy it from has a refund policy, you're screwed. I can exchange the CD, and I have, but the new one has pops, too, and since I can't get my money back I now have a recording of the Brahms violin concerto only. Don't get screwed, too, and buy these performances on a different disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't read it yet ...but...!","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend, who was a former colleague of Thomas Murphy in the CIA.

The beginning of the movie is proof enough that you are truly in for a treat. The battle between the Hei-Pai killers and the school uncle is one of the most exciting demonstrations of weapon fighting since Master Killer. True fans will fall in love with Carter Wong's Tai-Chi style Kung-Fu. The near invincibility of the Taichi style leaves our heroes Mark and Jack Long in a seriuous quandry: Find his weakness, or die. Fortunately, The Taichi master has one glaring flaw in his technique. Can the heroes live long enough to exploit it? You'll have to buy the movie to find out. But I guarantee that you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior materials for great idea","review":"I loved the look of this T-shirt. For about 3 weeks.

The original seat created no real comfort problems, but I just assumed that the gel had lost a little bit of its shock absorption ability. After a little research on the net I decided to give the Schwinn Adult Ergonomic Bike seat a try. Initially, it was a bit uncomfortable, but I attributed it to a break-in period.

The one my bike came with was not cutting it. ;) I ended up choosing this one, because of the 'give' in the narrow part of the seat. I thought it would create more comfort. I put it on that night and went riding. Not only was it more comfortable, but there was a bounce to it, so when you went over rocky trails, it didn't hurt to hit the seat on the way down!

I know a lot of people have liked this seat - that's why I tried it - but for me and my bike which lacks any rear or seat suspension, this is a very uncomfortable seat. I'm a pretty large guy, and it could just be that it is a bit too narrow, but it felt hard, and caused pain in the sensitive area after just a couple miles for me.A couple reviewers said that the adjustment made a difference, so I tried several different adjustments - but to no avail.

I've been using it for over a year, and can say that despite its low price it is a quality product. My commute is 16miles/day and I never feel any pain related to the saddle.

I thought we would also learn new traditions with old roots that we could incorporate into our holiday season.As a history lesson, this book is completely useless. Morrison makes reductive generalizations based on little to no actual knowledge about other religions. Her biased statements put into question everything she has to say. The recipes and craft projects are uninspired. If you are looking for authentic rituals the will bring magic and life into your holiday, choose another book.

Winter holidays are celebrated by many different faiths, as this book illustrates, however, the author takes every opportunity to let you know what a bunch of hipocritic morons the Christians are.I don't know about you, but I believe there are many paths to God and no one has the \\"Right\\" path. I'm not a Wiccan, but I respect their right to practice that faith. The author doesn't respect other faiths and it became clear after only the first chapter that this book was a vehicle for her to vent her scorn.I do not deny that many (if not all) Christian holidays piggy backed on older pagan celebrations -- this is a known fact. However, the way Ms. Morrison states these facts is very disrespectful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation Galore","review":"At first glance, I thought this book would be helpful when I spied it on the bookshelf at my local bookstore. However, when I opened it to the introductory chapter I learned that the culture which gave the name Yule (the Norse) where not even mentioned...at all.

It's got the best artwork, the best title, and the music is....damn good.I pretty much enjoy it front to back, but the title track is a killer opener, and Have Love Will Travel rocks as well. My personal highlight is Everywhere I Go. That's one of those songs worth the cost of the whole album. It just drones and grinds on for over 5 minutes. Very kick ass.I suggest grabbing thickfreakness, your smokes and leather jacket, and hitting the road in your old muscle car...or mini-van."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a re-invention of rock, but maybe a re-discovery","review":"To me, what makes this band so incredible is that these two 20ish white boys from Ohio manage to sound like wizened and grizzled old black men from Mississippi or NOLA, who could sit around and tell you about how they used to jam with Muddy Waters. But what makes this music consistently listenable is the unique me-fi record quality, the Cream/Hendrix nostalgia, and the down low lyrics that make you feel cool and sexy while you drive down the highway in your minivan on your way to your Corporate American cubeland breadbasket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where has this band been all my life???","review":"I'm a bit slow at discovering the Black Keys but I LOVE THEM since I did discover them!

It broke the first day I got it and with the silencer and all that crap it doesn't shoot. The BBs fall out the front. It jammed like 6 times before it broke. This gun is somewhat accurate but doesnt hurt at all. It sucks a lot. Don't buy any products from HotImport Toys, they are cheap, worthless, and extremely breakable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"HA. This is the most disgraceful weapon I have yet to encounter. Sure the mock suppressor and the sight and the laser are good features, but the gun is weak, and the magazine holds a meager 10 BBs. I have very high standards, and this gun met none of them. It broke within 3 weeks of purchase. But, it is a pretty good backyard gun, but it is nothing compared to the pro-level airsoft pistols. Should not be used as a side arm in pro-level airsoft battles... Good for backyard fights though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Pistol","review":"The add ons on this pistol are a complete waste.

I had this for about ten minutes before i thought that i got 13 dollars ript off. it fell apart after 1 hour. it couldnt shoot after 5 minutes.Dont get this gun cause it isnt just mine its the way its made. those othe reviews are people who probly dont ever use it and probly never have used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not come as described","review":"did not come with supressor or laser and the sight broke within 3 shots do not buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent choice","review":"This book was very easy to follow.

Digital security and a backup Key.However after owing and using this product for the last year It is clear this is a very flawed design and poorly made.#1 Any safe that is electronic, ie battery powered is FLAWED. When the batteries(inside the unit) run down, you can NO LONGER OPEN THE UNIT.Think about it, you have stored all your valuables in there and your batteries ran out, just like in your remote control, but here you can not get into the box.#2 They give you a Backup KEY and now its clear why they do that. However, the key slot is about as cheap as anything in China can be made and having used it perhaps three times, the key JAMMED and would not turn.So dead batteries and a $.10 Key mechanism create a useless device, period.Never buy a security device that is battery based, take it from me, I should know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrost box I every had , I had a key could not open it!!!","review":"The knob you turn had broken I could not open with my key.

Anyone who has a strong enough hand can force the dial to the \\"unlocked\\" position, which actually bends the metal inside the lid and allows entry into the box.

I am in no way a professional lockpicker, but I was able to pick the backup key slot once when I lost my key. It took me about 2 minutes and I was in. The keypad did nothing, and neither did that wimpy piece of plastic over the keyslot. This uses a typical wafer-lock, the type found on filing cabinets. Anyone with two paperclips (like the ones I used) and a half-hour of internet study can open this safe.

Finally figured out that the key lock opens with GM car keys. The lock still works with the regular key also.

He said that it was a great innovation which allowed thieves to break into your safe at their leisure from the comfort and security of their den. He should have used a picture of this product.This unit is sturdy enough to avoid cursory break-ins. But it is so small and light, anyone can just steal the box with your valuables in it. There is no cable lock to secure it to something larger or heavier (like a desk or bed). The handle is flimsy, so there is no way to add one without drilling holes. If you buy this, you are only buying the illusion of security."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT LOCK BOX","review":"The box came 1 day earlier than expected. I LOVE how easy it was to program it.

I also really enjoyed the electronic lock, until I lost my keys and the batteries died. However, I read another review that said it was extremely easy to break in to. So I gave it a shot. I had never attempted to pick a lock before this, but with a few minutes of searching the internet...and two paperclips...I picked the lock with very minimal effort.

Compared to the bose triport which is boasted with better sound these were better in every aspect except the bass, which was a little less punchy. This is due to the closed style where the triports are more open, not blocking out any sound. The headphones block mostly infrasonic sounds, extremely well making things like airplanes, air conditioners, and lawn mowers dissapear. The ultrasonc sound, not so well but the treble on these headphones was adjusted to help with that problem. These headphones were real quality, including real softened leather, and the cords rubber even felt nice.

These headphones will greatly minimize the drone of a jet plane and make listening to any audio (music or movie) much more pleasant. However don't think that noise cancelling headphones - these or any others - to completely silence \\"outside\\" noise. You will still hear people talking and it definitely will not exclude the screeches of a noisy subway. It will however make those noises much more tolerable and if you're listening to music, reduce the volume level at which you need to play the music to hear it over the whistling and screeching of a subway. The case the headphones come with is nice and as compact as it can be. If they were any more compact, the headphones would likely suffer in durability. For the price, I think these are the best ones to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice","review":"Before buying this item, I have bought a JBL active noise cancelling headphone from Costco.

Then, I did some research on the Internet and found that this item had pretty good reviews.My parents used this item right after I bought it. They liked it very much. After they returned home from a trip to Asia, I used it during a domestic trip. Its performance of noise cancelling was amazingly good. And it was quite comfortable to wear it.

Some short haul, some long haul international. I had several people ask, and let them compare for themselves. (I guess I looked odd holding two headset cases). Everyone thought the Audio-Technica were the better set. In addition, the Bose required you to have the noise cancelling on in order to listen. (If your battery dies...you get no music with the Bose). At 1/3 the price, these things are hands down the better choice for active noise-cancelling (over the ear) headphones. The headpiece on the Bose was \\"softer\\" to the touch, but when wearing them on your head (epecially for extended durations) you couldn't feel the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on long flights","review":"I got these in time for a couple of long flights over Christmas and was impressed by how much of the engine noise they cut out and therefore the low volume that I was able to set my iPod to (between 1/4 and 1/3 volume) and still be able to hear clearly.The headphones were comfortable though the foam didn't quite cover my ears and so I had to do some slight jiggling to have my ears covered properly.I also tried these on the BART system and found that they didn't really cut out the noise produced by the rails and so they are definitely optimised for aircraft engine noise.Useful that you can use these headphones just to reduce noise with the cord removed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound","review":"this is my first venture into noise canceling headphones, but i would buy these again if i had the chance. for the price its a great product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noise Cancelling earphones","review":"These headphones are as good as my Bose.

With my old headphones (a cheap pair, don't even remember where I got them) I was unable to use them in the car. Hooked up to my Nintendo DS, I could barely hear anything over the noise of the car even with the volume turned up as high as it would go.With these headphones and with the active canceling turned on, the roar from the car turns into a background hum and I can set the DS's volume to just a fraction above mute and still hear everything perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helpful in van","review":"I have been very pleased with this product. I take a van pool everyday to and from work, and was hoping to find something that would allow me to listen to my I-pod instead of what was on the car radio. When I put these on, I was immediately impressed by their comfort. In addition, merely putting them on cut down the ambient noise nicely. Then I turned on the anti-noise function! There is no getting around the fact that some noise still gets through. But now I very rarely notice it, even during the quiet passages of a sting quartet! These are well worth the money, and have made my commute much nicer.

Real shoddy quality control. The Panasonic headphones we bought at the same time kept going and going with no toruble whatsoever (and the cable for that one worked on the Audio-Technica - so the problem was in Audio Tecnica cablee and nowhere else.)

I just wanted to nap and not listen to music. It would cancel some background noise of the train (cancel 60%) but did nothing for people chatting (cancel 15%) or other random sounds. Maybe listening to music, etc would help dampen the sounds of others. But this is definitely not very useful if just using the active noise cancelling option without input.I would give it 1 star, but haven't used it with music input to see how that fares. Also it is comfortable and feels well designed/sturdy, just not that useful for my intended purposes. At the price, I'd rather just let the train's background noise shut everything else out."},{"rating":"2","title":"ATH-ANC7","review":"A very good product for the price.

There is however a major problem with that line of thinking. With the \\"noise-canceling\\" feature activated his music is audible for anyone within 100 ft of him. It's like he doesnt even have headphones on. The first time he used them on a plane he had a woman yell at him for disturbing her with his music.

It's kind of like something you'd buy at Dollar Tree...truly a joke. Whoever had good things to say about these ATs is either easily impressed (that can't be right -- those odds are too slim) or the Audio Technicas are put together in VERY inconsistent manners (much more like it).

Essential for noisy dorm or inner city living.edit: the wire is somewhat damaged on its own after 6 months. I have to arrange the coil a certain way for noise to transmit. The wire is cheaply made, much like a $10 set of earphones.

I put the switch into \\"on\\" position when I hear the jurors on smoke break, and in my experience, 85% is about right. The sound is definitely muted..and to the point where I can go back to working on computer and no longer be distracted (and annoyed).

It does a reasonable job, certainly doesn't eliminate the noise but cuts some of the high frequency whine. However, the audio quality isn't that great, overemphasis on the bass which sounds pretty muddy. It's pretty bad with the noise cancellation turned off, and becomes average with it on.

So, with those broken, I needed a new pair of noise-canceling headphones. After reading reviews of more affordable noise-canceling headphones, I decided to buy the Audio-Technica Quiet Point headphones.These headphones are a pretty good value, seem sturdy enough, and work with or without a battery (big plus). The only thing that is kind of sketchy is that the sound is boosted when the noise canceling is turned on, rather keeping the sound at the same level and just having the noise-canceling turned on.

Though the bass does not have the punch I would prefer (I listen to a lot of hip-hop and R&B;), it is very adequate and warm. The Noise-canceling function is top-notched. Drowns out most of the ambient noise very well. I can not wait to test these out on an airplane.The headphones are very comfortable and covers my ears very well. The only issue I have with this product is the noise leakage, but with a caveat. If you have your mp3 player at max volume, the sound will leak. But with the noise-canceling function on, there really is no need to have your player at max volume. With the sound turned down, the sound leak is minimal. Also, having higher quality mp3's (320 vice 196) will allow one to reduce the volume as well.Would highly recommend these headphones to anyone seeking Bose-quality headphones at a fraction of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones for the price","review":"I've never owned a pair of noise canceling headphones before but these are defintly them.

I don't think I have enormous ears or anything (am female and petite) but these don't fit over them comfortably and after 30 minutes of wearing the headphones it is really a relief to remove them. The other problem is the headband/yoke presses down very hard on the top of my head no matter how I adjust the height of the earphones. I have a set of Bose QuietTouch ones which unfortunately broke (yoke broke when I dropped them, definite weak point) and they are far more comfortable. That said, if you have tiny ears, the noise cancellation function on these seems very similar to the Bose. I'm going to save these for my kids to wear on the plane, but really not a great investment. Save your money for the Bose if you have an adult size head and ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent -- Use even when running lawnmower","review":"Ok -- simply put, love it -- I wanted something that could muffle the sound and let me listen to music while cutting the grass -- and if you have tried that before you know thats a tall order -- I went by folks reviews and have to say, the fit and finish, and quality of sound and noise cancelling are top notch. Look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reviews are CORRECT!","review":"I did an extensive search over a couple of months and concluded that Audio-Technica ATHANC7 Noise-canceling Headphones were the absolute best technology for the money. When I got them I was prepared to do a return if they weren't up to my demands but they were! I'm wearing them as I type this!They are not absolutely and emphatically perfect but they are as close as I could get. The guys at the Bose store throw spit ball at me as I pass by now.Amazon did a great job with the price and delivery.I note that the adverb for cancel can be either cancelling OR canceling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"These headphones are awsome.Cuts noise amazingly, and can be worn from Chicago to London without taking off, in complete comfort.These are my second pair. Very good, and well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These headphones are absolutely the best","review":"So far I had these headphones for a month and they are still good. Better than those Bose headphones, way cheaper, and the most sturdy looking headphones i've ever had had. Another feature I like the most is the detachable wire because every time I buy headphones they end up breaking because of a faulty wire so i know that these headphones will stay with me for life. The clarity of these headphones are the best. You can hear every detail of the song even when you put the volume down. Also they come with a year warranty which is better than any other headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute best quality for price","review":"Now, I bought this a little over half a year ago, when it cost a lot more, and even then, I was very, very happy with the cost/benefit ratio. Now, there is no way you can convince yourself not to get these.The only way I can sleep through college parties is with these on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cocoon of glorious music","review":"The noise canceling is startlingly effective and the overall sound is superb. These headphone have dramatically improved my daily bus/subway commute and, hence, my overall quality of life. I sit on the subway and close my eyes, and I'm in my own cocoon of glorious music. Maybe when I open them again there's a crack-head yelling in my face, but I was in that happy place for a time, and nobody can ever take that away from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as expected","review":"Bought this instead of the overpriced Bose Q2. I was very happy with this purchase. Loved the soft cushion of the headphone and the sleek design. Overall sound quality is good despite the relatively weak bass. It's kind of dangerous walking around with this headphone on since it really does block out the ambience noise quite well. You can run the risk of getting hit by a car if you don't pay attention. =) The weakeast point is the cheap looking cable. I will definately buy this over Bose again."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality product,","review":"High quality product, reasonable price. Highly recommended. I have sony mdr-nc6. and tryed bose but thay dont even come close to Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"I have been researching headphones for the last 2 months. I spoke with people I knew and read a ton of reviews online. I was willing to spend upto $300. Looked at the Bose QC 15, which is a great product and is actually more comfortable to use for long hours. The Audio Technia has great sound quality and very good sound cancellation. I like the fact that you can listen to music with the noise cancellation turned-off.I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than bose!","review":"Compared both the Audio-Technica and Bose, and hands-down the for the price the A.T wins. So happy with this purchase! Would even have paid more for the quality of these headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive but I prefer Bose","review":"The noise cancellation quality, comfort, design are all excellent and a substantial savings compared to the Bose NC headphones. I really enjoyed using Audio-Technica ATHANC7 Noise-canceling Headphones. With the introduction of a new version of Bose headphones I decided to order a pair (QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones)to run my own side by side test. My conclusion after repeated trials I found the Bose were somewhat superior in the noise cancellation ability and creating an even more quieter experience. However, the Bose are more expensive. The testing environment was an office cubicle with a large air condition unit approximately 4 feet away."},{"rating":"2","title":"very very good","review":"Some of the coments about the noise dropping when the active noise cancelling is on it true, as is the poor bass response when active is on... but the noise cancelling is amazing... Had a flight with a crying baby in te row right behind me.. Noise cancelling on - no noise but music. Noise cancelling off - music, plane and baby crying.. Even with the noise cancelling off the headphones reduce teh ambient noise. Kit comes with everything you need. And at a really good price.. you know you need these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise Leakage","review":"It's hard for me to believe that Audio-Technica thinks that the amount of noise leakage out of these headphones is acceptable. The leakage only happens when the noise reduction is turned on, but my wife could hear my music clearly from at least 6 feet away from me. I don't want to be that guy on the plane that's annoyingly listening to his music and forcing everyone to listen to it too. I had to return them even though they did sound good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best noise cancelling headphones out there.","review":"Comfortable, good at cancelling mid to low frequencies, and good overall frequency response. About the only down side is the bright blue LED when the noice cancelling is enabled, and it blinks when the battery is low. These are even comfortable enough to use for working out. Also works well for PSP or DS audio, and comes with a high quality case. What's not to like?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good service, good product with a little regret","review":"Amazon provides very quick delivery, every time I am very satisfied with their delivery.The ANC7 is a very good product, dramatic noise decrease, better sound quality than my expectation when noise canceling is active. But it sounds dull when I switch off the noise canceling. Also it's a little tight, and the space for ears is a little small.So I give it four star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones!!!","review":"My wife and I both work from home. My wife teaches violin lessons in the room next to my office. Needless to say there are times when I want all the sound protection I can get! These headphones do a great job of cutting out outside noise as well as providing nice clear sound, good bass response, and are very comfortable.I have been using these for 3-4 hours a day for the last week and couldn't be happier with them. The noise canceling doesn't cut out all outside sounds but it does a great job of taking the edge off of and making it a lot less distracting. The most noticeable thing is how well it cuts out low-frequency background noise like computer fans, heaters, and street noise. Higher pitched noises (violins, nearby voices) aren't cut out as well but are significantly deadened.Overall I'm very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is in the market for some great headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% happy","review":"I got these for my (extremely picky)husband for his birthday and was worried that they were not the Bose headphones he had asked for. I was pleased to find that he was 100% happy with the style, quality, and function of the Audio-Technicas. He travels alot for work and they help him relax on the plane. Thanks for the great reviews everyone, you were right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy!","review":"I found the headphones quite uncomfortable and heavy to wear. So I returned the headphones without even trying the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphones","review":"These worked pretty well. I bought them to use on the plane and I wore them the whole time to Hong Kong. It is surprisingly useful in blocking out at least 60% of the engine noise to my oberservation. Good enough where I can fall asleep. I don't know if they work better than the Bose or not since I havent had a chance to compare them on a plane. But these are definitely worth the money and buid quality is good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for price","review":"Based upon the NY Times review, I purchased this item through Amazon. I am pleased with the online purchasing process, delivery time, and the product itself. At half the price of the competing Bose product, this headphone set performs well and delivers excellent quality sound reproduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I bought these and tried them over several days. Not for me, I'm afraid. First, they are really uncomfortable. They simply cannot be adjusted to your ears or, dare I say it, to the shape of your head. The sound with the noise canceling off is simply terrible. With the noise canceling on, the sound is better, but nothing to shout about. Nonetheless, what bothers me most is the simple discomfort of these headphones. They do not adjust to your ears. Ultimately, they're simply uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them!","review":"I've now used the Audio-Technica Noise-Canceling Headphones for a few weeks in the office, on an airplane and at a loud indoor volleyball tournament. They work wonderfully and I have recommended them to several of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"great noise canceling headset for a good price","review":"I purchased these for their noise canceling feature and so far I have been very impressed. I have been using these on airplane trips and while using a riding lawn tracker and they do a great job of noise reduction and worked just as well as the much more expensive Bose quitecomfort 2 I have also used. The audio capability of these headsets are also exceptional; lots of musical detail can be heard even in a noisy environment. The headsets also pass music when the battery is dead - albiet at a lower volume - so you will never be left with a dead headset when you battery goes dead, unlike the Bose. These are well worth their price and are made of high quality material and come with a very sturdy case that travels well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to the NYT Review","review":"Bought this after reading a review in the New York Times about how this gives Bose QC3 competition at one-third the price. Been very happy with comfort of headphones and noise cancellation (have construction going on next door and barely here a thing with just the noise cancellation, don't notice anything with music playing on top of it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Noise Cancelling Headset for the $","review":"Maybe I should have left off...'for the $'. I've tried the QC2 and QC3, and in my opinion, the ATH-ANC7s beat them both!If you're looking for near-audiophile balanced sound (bass, mid and high-frequencies), I think you won't be disappointed. Great design, great noise cancelling, great battery life, detachable cord, very comfortable, and less than half the price of th QC2. They look better in real life than in the picures.High quality product, reasonable price. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good value, except that it's poor quality for the long haul","review":"I got one of these a few years ago for travel. Like many others, I appreciated the cost to performance. The performance is good and a good value, but unfortunately the sturdiness of the device is poor.Here's a photo, so you can see the wearing: [...]You can see that the device is failing on three points. I had to superglue the earpiece to the headset to keep it together. There are multiple stress cracks on the sliders that bring the earpieces up and down. These keep the device from forming a good seal with my ears, thus decreasing effectiveness and making it very uncomfortable.I have used this for air travel only for a couple years. I don't do anything crazy. I'm not wearing this under a helmet playing football or something. Just on my head on an airplane.So, while these appear to be a good value, there is a reason. They are made cheaply and their lifetime will be short. Consider that before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a dream at work","review":"When I moved cubicles recently I ended up next to two heavy sighers, a pounding typist, peripheral conference and personal calls, and similar audio distractions. I'm completely happy with these headphones as they dramatically reduce or eliminate office sounds, make listening to music real fun again, work with or without an attached audio source, are extremely comfortable and light, and are very portable for trips. The circuitry does not introduce static. These are just perfect and I may be getting another pair for the commute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying thrumming in right ear","review":"Alas, I ignored those reviews that mentioned loud thrumming and went ahead and ordered these headphones. On the plus side, they seemed comfortable, the adjustable strap allowing me to place the phones over my ears for optimal listening and comfort. It's important to note that the headphones promise noise-canceling UP TO 85% They did mute the loud sounds from the ventilation system in my office, the whole reason I wanted headphones, but the reduction wasn't 85% What was worse, as I wore the headphones, a sort of humming in the right ear got louder and louder until it interfered with my enjoyment of the music. I returned them. but then Amazon, according to its stated policy, charged me for shipping, which I'd gotten free. So I ended up paying $6.17 plus the cost of return shipping for defective merchandise. Good luck if you order these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound but noisy to neighbors","review":"Just a quick note and observation on the Audio Technica ATH-ANC7. I found the sound reproduction and noise cancelling excellent. BUT, as other reviewers noted, the headphones are very loud to the person next to you. I was surprised and disappointed as I spent much time researching all headphones and decided on these. However, as a frequent traveller, I've always found it rude when I could listen to what one of the nearby airline passengers was listening to. Therefore, I returned these and spent the extra money for the Bose QC3. I am very happy with the Bose and have made some transatlantic flights with peace. I will say that the sound reproduction of the ATH is superior to the Bose, but the rest belongs to Bose. Bose is far superior in comfort. Spend the extra money and treat yourself to the better product (in my humble opinion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for a 2 months, and then....","review":"and then the right ear producing static.

Definitely.I read a lot online, tested a lot of headphones, and this was the clear winner. For those who complain of the bass, believe me there is more than enough bass than anyone can even tolerate, the sound is crystal clear, the design i nice, a lot sturdier than the Bose models, and the noise cancellation is (empirically) superior to that of the two basic over the ear Bose models. It is also incomparably better than the Sony. I was between the Sennheiser and this, but liked the sound of the ATH-ANC7 more. The only downside compared to the Bose is their size, but at least there is a lovely case to store them in. I am absolutely delighted with my purchase, and especially so when I saw that the Amazon price undercut everywhere else by about 70 dollars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...I've rediscovered music AND quiet","review":"This is my third generation of noise cancelling headphones, and the best by far. I spend hours a day on the New York City subway, and the Long Island Railroad. Whether I'm listening to music or just using the active noise cancellation I find myself much more relaxed and agreeable when I arrive at the office after wearing these on the commute. The ergomonics are great. They're big, and a little heavy, but remain comfortable for hours. The headphones also sound great, far superior to the dozen or so sets I've managed to collect over the years. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio-Technica ATHANC7 and ATHANC7B","review":"Watch out!

And apparently ATHANC7b is not as good as ATHANC7.So I just returned it, and reordered Bose QuiteCompfort15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality per price ratio","review":"I did a quick test with these against the Bose QC2 and they work just as well. Plus, these are over-the ear headphones, which is what I prefer. I work in a pretty noisy office and the ATH-ANC7's completely cancel out the air conditioner hum. Voices are still audible, though greatly lowered. With music playing, you don't even hear those.Ear cups are very soft and comfortable for extended listening. The wire detaches in two places which is actually kinda nice for accidental cord pullage.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for the price","review":"Great product. Unfortunatelly I did not have a chance to compare it to many other products but I had a great experience so far. The quality of sound is very good. The noice cancelling works really good. I use them at work where I sit near air conditioner and I don't hear anything when I turn them on. The only minus that I had so far that when the noice cancelling is turned on the sound leaks to outside environment (what I mean that people around you can hear the music almost as well as you can with headphones all). Otherwise, it's a great product. I will recomment it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't torch without them!!","review":"I work in hot glass and have a ventilation system that sounds like a jet engine, plus the torch, a noisy concentrator for oxygen and my parrots are in the building also ( fumes ARE exhausted for all you pet lovers).The parrots love the noise and try to outdo it. My poor ears!!I tried working without the headphones and I just couldn't concentrate and my tension levels skyrocketed along with sore back and shoulders etc.I put these on with my little Sansa and listen to classical, soft pop/rock, gospel and radio shows and I LOVE LOVE LOVE them. I am relaxed when I am through torching. My ears do not hurt from wearing them for hours. If I ever take a transatlantic flight these will be my best friend on that journey. I recommend them highly.Lorraine ChandlerRed Bluff, Ca."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for air flights","review":"Was looking at the Bose quietcomfort, but after reading some readers reviews settled on the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7's. Price was also a consideration and these were much more reasonable. On the Boeing 737 flight, the 3 hours in the air a much more tolerable with these phones. These aren't magic so don't expect complete silence, but they do take a lot out of the engine drone. Watching movies on my ipod or listening to music was a real pleasure. On the smaller commuter jets which are louder inside, the ANC7's made a huge difference. The carrying case is perfect for storing a small ipod. The airline adapter vastly improves listening to the lame selections onboard. Minor quibble is that the over the ear design can be a bit warm - or maybe it 's just me. Also like simple AA battery power which goes a long way. Get another pair for your wife with the money you save."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literally fell apart after 12 uses in flight","review":"Great sound but they earphones became loose and almost detached from the band.

One year my roomate had a gnarly Nakamichi system, with that lovely amp based on the Nelson Pass Stasis design. It was great. We could blast it enough to disturb the people upstairs, and still never get distortion or clipping. The next year I lived with a ghetto blaster in my room. Bummer. After college, it was years of destitution in graduate school and retail sales. I got a real job eventually, and slowly, I crawled out of that fit of financial despair. I finally began building the great big sound that I had come to love. Finally, it's in my living room. Massive Thiel speakers and Bryston electronics. And now, with these headphones, I can have that lovely sound anywhere, including the airplane. They save my ears from the fierce whine of those turbine engines. Get yourself a pair.

The reviews I read said they were superior to the $300 Bose that everyone sees advertised. A sad statement, if true. THEY ABSOLUTELY SUCK as noise attentuators. I test drove them in front of a TV with moderate volume. Spend 25 cents on a box of cotton balls and you will be better rewarded. As a 30 year electrical engineer I am amazed someone had the audacity to sell these as noise canceling headphones- they aren't even adequate as static earmuffs.

They don't seal well around the ears if worn with the arch behind the head. Moreover, the black material covering the earpieces start to peel after about a year. Now when I travel I taken them off and little black plastic flakes dot my face and neck.They do get interference from GSM cell phones and even (at least one brand of) DECT 6.0 cordless phones, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy these, they are better made","review":"I have seen many people with the Bose noise canceling headphones, and I have to say, they are poorly made. Not so with these! They fit well, are made of quality materials and I fully expect they will last for years. The noise cancellation is excellent, and the price better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great for sound cancelling alone","review":"I bought these headphones for the sound cancelling aspect. I found the claim that the headphones reduce environmental noise, without audio, by up to 85% to be untrue.

They're less comfortable but work far better and they're a lot more affordable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Headphones / Sound Leak Makes Them Like Speakers","review":"Great headphone if you plan to listen to them while alone or in a very loud environment.Otherwise, the sound leakage is just too loud.

While at work and a cafe, I had people give me looks when I had them at a 50% volume.Really too bad, I love this set, but I just sent in my return/refund request."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little noise is canceled","review":"I purchased these headphones based on reviews that said they do a good job of noise canceling. I purchased them specifically for that, intending to use them primarily without playing music. Since the headphones specifically mention that you can unplug the cord for noise canceling alone, I trusted that this would be effective.The only way I can tell that noise is being canceled at all is by turning the switch off and on, so there is an immediate comparison. There is some noise canceling, but nowhere near as much as I was expecting. When I test it and actually play music through the headphones, I can still hear the 'outside' music as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I buy headphones or a boombox?","review":"I bought these after searching for about 1 month for noise cancelling headphones. When I first got them i was excited. The sound was great and they looked pretty sweet. However, the noise leakage was horrible.

If you wear these on an airplane, I think the pilot will be able to hear the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great noise cancelling, poor audio delivery","review":"I just received these headphones. I cannot live with the poor quality of the audio delivery: the noise canceling technology truly gets in the way, resulting in some very weird sounds coming out of the headphones during playback, which severely deteriorate the auditory experience.Granted that the noise canceling job is done superbly (you can successfully isolate yourself from most surrounding noises), at the price these headphones sell for, I was expecting better audio: I am returning them tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect","review":"i love theseonly problem is that they leak soundbut they are also only about 150$, so it's worth it to me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love em!","review":"Listening to these headphones makes one feel like they are in their own concert hall. It is wonderful. I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the noise leakage.

In fact, I prefer these to the Bose because the Bose, while effective, gave me a weird \\"stuffy head\\" sensation whereas the AudioTechnica do not.I have recently used them on a commercial flight and they allowed me to listen to soft music easily. I also listened to several podcasts that I heard clearly (no small feat given my partial hearing loss!). I also use them daily during a 45 minute commute to work in a van pool.These phones are as comfortable as any I have tried and seem very well constructed.Note: While these headphones function in the non-sound cancelling mode, the quality of sound is definitely superior with sound cancelling turned on. The cable is detachable if you just want quiet and they come with a nice case and accessories.Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in the office, less good on the plane","review":"These headphones work very well for my purposes, but they won't satisfy everyone. Audio quality is good, but not great: compared to the open, clean sound of a pair of Grados these sound a little muffled and muddy. For my needs, the noise cancellation is great: window air conditioners, dehumidifiers, dishwashers, office ventilation systems are all virtually inaudible with the noise cancellation switched on. I've only used the headphones on airplanes a couple of times, and found them less satisfactory there. The QuietPoints help a lot, and jazz and rock are clearly audible. But quiet passages in classical music are still hard to hear, even with much of the plane's background hum cancelled out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Returned for refund as defective, right hand speaker failed to work with NC enabled. Initially a battery reinstall did the trick but not for long. Worse than that was the sound leakage i.e. with the cups placed together the exterior sound was as loud as that internally and gets annoying to persons nearby if cranked anywhere past 5 player volume control wise (which is NOT that loud!). Contrary to what I've read online re the sound leaking at the ear cups to ears, I found it came from the cups external NC port grills.Audio quality wise I could not fault them (when they worked), but my monies are best spent on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half price, what?!?","review":"I bought these headphones last Christmas - agree 100% with all the great reviews given.

I wanted the Quiet Comfort quality without the price. In reviewing dozens of alternatives and reading scores of reviews I settled on the Audio-Technica. I am not disappointed.A concern that I had in purchasing the headphones was the prospect of sound leakage. This has not been a problem, and in fact, I am impressed with how it is contained.Further, I was concerned that since my ears are bigger than average that they would not cover my ears. However, this is not the case. They fit comfortably on my ears. And they are quite comfortable for long periods of time as well.The sound is great, as advertised.As someone who has headphones on for several hours a day and occasionally has to travel long distances, I am quite satisfied and thankful that I settled on this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but...","review":"1.

Try them on for several hours--then decide. I planned to use these to replace BOSE 1's (stolen from luggage cart) and 2's--left behind on the plane, and swiftly gone. After trying them on a trans-con flight last week, I actually had to remove the ATs and switch to the airline's cheepos to survive to the end of the movie.I wrote to Audio-Technica about the problem--mainly the stitching and rough inner fabric that irritate the ears, at least MY ears. They replied promptly and constructively, but had no fix for the problem and suggested I return them to the retailer.

Still works as headphones.A couple of nits - IMHO it sounds like it adds more white noise than would be expected as a normal processing artifact (to mask what it doesn't cancel?).

It substantially reduced engine noise and took the edge off the loud intrusive announcements. Neither this nor similar products eliminate noise altogether.

The fit on the head and ears is comfortable for long-term wear. The one thing I wish it had is a built-in volume control like my previous headset, but it hasn't been a problem because my laptop has touch volume slider controls.

When I turned them on I heard acomforting hiss from the headphones (no music playing) which drownedout background noise but I wouldn't call it canceling.

They cancel just the right amount of excess noise, so that you have a great gaming experience, while still being able to hear if people are talking to you. They are also very good for airplane travel, because playing music or videos at a normal volume eliminates much of the obnoxious airplane noise. Since they completely cover the ear they are very comfortable. Also, they're durable, I know since I've dropped mine quite a few times.

I did not even have my iPod at 1/2 volume and others sitting next to me could hear the songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but takes some getting used to","review":"Performs as advertised and the noise canceling is pretty effective. My only bone is that especially the first month of using it, I was really irritated by the tightness of the headphones around my ear and head.However after weeks of using it.. I figured little ways of improving this pressure. Each ear muff is adjustable in two different directions, so that has helped me a lot. It's still kinda tight but I guess in order to achieve optimal noise canceling you have to almost create this suction effect with tight muffs.Would I recommend buying? Yes and No.. The thing about headphones is that they're very difficult to try and compare. Whether in the real store or online, you don't have the opportunity to try different ones so I don't know if there's a similar performer that's more comfortable to wear. The Bose are WAY TOO expensive. $300 will buy you a nice iPod for cryin' out loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones","review":"I purchased these in anticipation of two long business trips and was very satisfied with the performance. These headphones work well; the sound quality is quite good and the noise reduction is very noticeable. During one of the flights, a colleague and I traded headphones (he has the Bose QC2) to compare them. He could not tell the difference between the two; I thought the Audio-Technica headphones were marginally better. I'd definitely recommend them!What would I want to know before purchase?I had no problem with sound leakage, whether I was wearing them at home while on the computer or on the airplane. The cups on the headphones are smaller than other headphones I've worn; they were not uncomfortable for me but if your ears are big, you might have a comfort problem.The reason for 4 stars rather than 5?I wish they were even quieter....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NOTE ON HEARING VOICES","review":"Plenty of reviews so I add a note only to the one response which spoke of the ability to hear people talk with the headphones on. Judged a negative. So far as I know, none of the noise canceling headphones are designed to eliminate or reduce human voice sounds. To the extent that they may do so,it is to no greater degree than ear enclosing non-noise-canceling phones. What they are mostly designed for is to reduce the sound of airplane engines and, I find, they effectively handle the customarily noisy refrigerators, air conditioners and the like within the home. Bose claims to reduce sounds of a higher range than the others but I cannot remember how well the two of theirs did at that since I was not sensitive to their performance in that respect"},{"rating":"2","title":"COMPARABLE TO THE BOSE HEADPHONES","review":"For less than one-half the money, these noise cancelling headphones performed in every respect on a par during a recent international flight with the Bose headphones that I had previously tested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Uncomfortable","review":"While I was very excited to receive these after reading all of the great reviews I must say I was terribly let down. The carry case that comes with this item is very nice and I appreciated the extra Aux cables. However, the fit was HORRIBLE. Now, this will certainly be subjective based on the shape of your head but its pretty common sense just looking at them in person that the fit is going to be strange. They slide open horizontally instead of vertically so they put some serious pressure on the top of your head which in my case led to a headache. I read on Cnet that the design angles were somewhat strange but I figured I would see for myself. Very disappointed.Note: I really can't say much about the sound quality because I didn't use them long enough to get past break-in. They were just wayyyy to uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for years but will eventually fall apart","review":"I've had these for about 5 years. For the past year, they have slowly fallen apart and I've added more and more electrical tape to hold them together. Around the pivots and adjustments, the plastic has cracked and they would fall apart if not held together with the tape. The cord has also separated at its end and has exposed wire.I agree with all the positive reviews. I keep adding more tape because I love these headphones no matter how they look. Just don't expect these to last more than 4-5 years with daily use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less expensive as a BOSE and does the same good job!","review":"Used it now several times in the plane and I even fall in sleep with it!

If you want something that is going to deliver excellent sound (rather, as excellent as it need be for being on a plane) and block out noise. These are the ones.I'm so used to taking my headphones off on a plane to be pleased by how quiet the engines are relative to my music volume. When I take these off, the jets are overpoweringly loud, even though I could hear perfectly. Personally, I only plan to use these on the plane, and for that purpose, they are ideal. For my day to day commute, I still use ear buds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but don't touch","review":"A very good pair of noise reducing headphones. Sound was very good. I had no problem with sound leakage, but the thing fell apart after very light usage. I was pulling the ear piece into place when the plastic holding it to the headband shattered. It's a total loss. I don't know if this is an isolated event, but I'll stay clear of Audio-Technia products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I was just given a pair of these for my birthday, and I have to say they are going right back.With Noise canceling turned off everything sounds muted and not even close to the quality that my $20 Sony's do.With Noise Canceling turned on, suddenly everything is bright and crisp and almost, but not exactly hiding the static.Now, if I want static, these are great, if I want to always run the noise canceling, they are outstanding. But, otherwise, I would never recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sounding Headphones","review":"Really do like these noise cancelling headphones. I've compared them to the Bose On Ear Triport non noise cancelling headphones. These phones have better high frequency response. Still think the Bose have slightly better bass response. In a side-by-side test...these sounded better to me. Have used them on the plane and they do cancel most of the outside noise. Would recommend purchasing these headphones, especially for the price. Caution, if using on the plane and you switch to a different audio source (from music to movie) they can get extremely loud and possibly damage your hearing and the headphone speakers. Would be nice if Audio Technica would upgrade with an overload protection circuit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uber Comfortable - Excellent Performance - Outstanding Value","review":"Bought this for my wife, who does not like in-the-ear phones. We compared at home against a 10-year old pair of Sony noise-cancelling phones and found these to be much more cushy and comfortable since they go over the ear rather than on the ear. They also provided slightly better noise cancellation than the Sony phones when used against a microwave oven. She used them on flights to and from Hawaii and raved about how well they worked so I'm happy. The only downside is that they do not fold up like the Sony phones but fold flat into a nice provided case which takes up more room. This is the same downside to much more expensive Bose phones. Otherwise, these are at least the equals of the Bose at half the price. They also run for many plane flights on just one AAA battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static noises, small, heavy... buy the Bose","review":"I bought these here on Amazon based on positive reviews, but I regret it.

I had to turn my cell phone on vibrate just to make sure I was still getting calls.I heard complaints about less Bass but I have not noticed. The highs are crisp and noticeable and the bass is great. It even has a nice thump to it that I did not expect from headphnes. I think these sound just as good as the Bose.These really are just as good if not better than the Bose. They are also comfortable as well. I have only had them a short time but I would buy them again and highly reccomend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed","review":"Having read all the positive reviews I thought I was getting a great product.

I can not justify the cost of the Bose so I was looking at alternatives. These had good reviews on teh AV Forums.There are two elements to any of these type of noise canceling headphones. 1) the NC function and 2) the sound.First of all these are bog headphones. Big old style closed cup phones. For long plane rides if you have a big head they are a little uncomfortable but thats just because I have a big head.The NC function is good. Nothing better than I have had before but nothing worse either. The design is great that you can detach the connecting wire and the single AAA battery it takes is hidden.Where these come into their own is with the sound. Its wonderful, even with the NC function off they are really great headphones and a great purchaser. Also Amazon offers great service on these. My wire shorted after about 6 months so they just sent me a new pair.

Only negative is that with her enthusiasm also comes enthusiastic page lifts to find the animals and this has led to ripped and bent pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book appeared cute in the store, but didn't realize how thin the flaps were once opened.

Small children see the shapes, feel them and see what animal they correspond to. Unfortunately, it is made of flimsy, thin paper. Not a good idea, especially for a book that encourages young hands to explore it. The pages quickly get bent and torn. I recommend Sandra Boynton's \\"Fuzzy fuzzy fuzzy\\" instead, which has a similar theme, but is constructed to be explored over and over without damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the quality of DOG or CAT","review":"I put this on my daughter's wish list as she LOVES the DOG and CAT books by the same author. I thought this book would be comparable, as the price certainly is. This book is flimsy and my daughter crumpled the pages immediately--it is certainly not the durable quality of the other books.

Her little brother (age 2) also LOVES the book, but she has refused to let him use it anymore, since he created yet another tear and she doesn't want it further damaged. So, I am buying him his own!

The casting was brilliant with Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis playing Nikita and Michael. Their personalities not only meshed, but fed each other on the show. The tension, the sex appeal, the intrigue with Operations and Madeline are palpable.Beyond that however, the story lines are amazing. Written 10 years ago they are contemporary for today. They are still the most compelling and intriguing stories out there. Not even 24 comes close to Nikita. The set design was state of the art and is fresh today, and who can forget the music for the show? Everything in this series meshed.

It was clearly one of the best series on TV in the 60s. It's ironic that we can get Ishtar, Xanadu, The Bad News Bears Go To Japan, Caligula, Heaven's Gate and It's Pat (The Movie) on DVD but not a known hit series like U.N.C.L.E.

It was Trek reruns in the 70's that cemented its legend, while U.N.C.L.E.'s luster dulled.It was a shame.The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was one of the finest television programs ever. It featured cool heroes, fantastic plots, witty dialogue, and a memorable theme song. U.N.C.L.E. was one the truest examples of escapist fun. The fact that lesser shows have been released on DVD, while U.N.C.L.E. languishes, is amazing.Release each season of this show on DVD. I wouldn't care if it was bare bones with no extras.

There were of course other shows of the era I loved, i.e., Lost in Space, Daniel Boone and, later, Secret Agent Man. But UNCLE was the king and the one I have the most affection for all these many years later. I'm so happy the series has finally found its proper home in this wonderful DVD set.

The reason is in the design. The toaster grates move in and out and obviously they are not precise enough to keep all the slices at the exact same distance from the heat grids.

I couldn't care about the Corsican cartel, the humiliated congresswoman, or the missing college student. I will try another of his novels since his writing flows. But this book was mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best spy-conspiracy thrillers out there","review":"This brilliant novel portrays 4 Phase Man - the best black ops agents in the world, of whom only two are left. Both have taken their lives in different directions. Canvas sells his services to the Chinese, which want to take over US by implementing their own servant in US government. Xenos must stop them and Canvas, while also save himself from his past. The action is amazing, the plot awesome, the characters brilliant. This is Steinberg's best book. Simply superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor description","review":"The description says \\"standard batteries\\" but does not define what is a standard battery. Also the box that wa shipped was black.

Purchasing this book was part of my effort to learn more, and the book was useful for that. The book is very readable, and a very interesting overview of the buffalo. Unfortunately, it dates from the 1970s, and knowledge has moved on since then. The most obvious example of this is coverage of \\"Blue Babe\\"--A frozen buffalo from several thousand years ago which was discovered after this book was published. I'm sure there are other places where our understanding of buffalo and their place in the scheme of the prairie has changed, but I'm not expert enough to identify them. I really like the book, but would like to see it updated to reflect new findings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to understand spiritual aspects of our body","review":"Our body is a temple of various functions and activities.

The female lead's, and Coetzee always astounds me with his writing from a female perspective (I wonder if actual females would agree), confusion in dealing with the later years of Apartheid allow us to view in sympathy those whites caught up in the system by circumstance while not ignoring the great tragedy that Apartheid was to the Black majority. It also sheds a light on the perception issues that we face in the United States across the racial divide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Rudolph: The Florida Houses","review":"As the Case Study program got under way in southern California, Rudolph launched his own from his office in Sarasota on Floridas Gulf coast. For two decades (with time off for U.S. Navy service) he created (first with Ralph Twitchell and then independently) a succession of airy pavilions that mitigated the steamy heat and filtered the brilliant light. In Ezra Stollers crisp period photographs these houses seem almost dreamlike?too graceful and pure to endure storms and the crass consumerism of waterfront development. And yet, despite the pressure of escalating land prices and the cult of gigantism, most of these houses have survived in their original form, and several have been lovingly restored. Every aficionado of mid-century modern should buy this elegant volume. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The modern Florida house","review":"I found myself becoming nostalgic looking through the pages of this book. Having grown up in Florida, I was stunned to see that the house I lived in had been a knock-off of one of Rudolph's houses. His early Florida houses were widely emulated for their clean lines and passive solar designs. It is an impressive collection, and illustrates the lighter side of Rudolph before he became caught up in the monumental forms that dominated the latter part of his career.You might call him the John Lautner of Florida, creating a lifestyle as much as an architecture. You could see Travis McGee laying back in one of these houses, drinking a beer as he waits for the elusive flash of green. Rudolph really captured the spirit of Florida in the 40's and 50's. Simple, well-thought out designs that are as relavent today as they were then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb...","review":"This is by far one of the most exquisite Modern Architecture books I have ever seen... Paul Rudolph left such an important legacy through his Florida House designs... The illustrations are crisp and very well drawn and the content id pure of insightful information regarding the architect and his work. This book has become one of my favorite architecture books."},{"rating":"2","title":"6th number one in a row.","review":"This is the latest single for the legendary duo Murk --Oscar Gaeton and Ralph Falcon.

Each page is printed with very large double-sized text, and rarely exceeds two small paragraphs. All photos are quality, color shots, some of which are very nice, however they can hardly be considered a comprehensive survey of the aircraft since there are so few of them. The photographs are generally all exterior, non-detail shots. Many of the photos are also non-F/A-18E specific, including crew and F/A-18 A/C shots.This book is thinner and smaller than the manual that came with my toaster oven.It would be a nice little book (not useful for research, or any serious information) if the price weren't almost $30. It's absolutely the worst value in a book I've ever come across. It should be $4.95 at the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Marra is one the real geniuses of idea generation!","review":"Jim Marra has a unique way of teaching idea generation.

I marvel at how skillfully these people manage to recycle their own compost material with nary a raised eyebrow from the literate and clearly somnambulist public. To add hilarity to this re-hashed litany of E-Government's fits and starts is the exchange of Therese Morin for Grady Means as co-author? of this 2003 version- of a merit less book... In this respect, E-Gov 2003 is where E-Gov 2002 should have been- at the infancy of IBM's capability in E-Government. Someday soon, IBM consulting will realize its mistake in buying the worst of PwC as readers can clearly surmise from reading their worthless products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on the book?","review":"Apparently quite a few loved this DVD. I can't agree.I grew up in love with the book by Gail Carson Levine. Her world of wonder and magic was beyond anything I had imagined. It was, and still is, sheerly a wonderful work of art.However, the movie simply took a few odds and ends from the book and twisted it into their own humorous (?) version, omitting everything interesting and fun that made the book so fantastic and successful.I was VERY disappointed.Though I disliked it, I still believe that some younger children/teens will still laugh and enjoy it. Possibly, adults. It was still a fun experience. Just very disappointing for someone who is so in love with the book.Happy watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Destroys the book!!!","review":"If you've read the book, you probably enjoyed it, like I did.

How can you poison yourself with a crown? The book was wonderful but the movie didn't follow the same lines at all and changed everything around. The elf who wanted to be a lawyer was probably the most annoying part, in the book they were wise and cool but a lawyer?!

She can only follow orders to the best of her ability!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sad princess story","review":"' \\"Ella Enchanted\\", a new movie based on the successful children's novel by Gail Carson Levine...' Nothing could be further from the truth. Plot alterations, character revision, the addition of a stereotyped Hollywood villain, and musical numbers...all dilute the original message of Levine to produce yet another sad princess story.The film struggles in its delivery of themes such as equality and girl-power without the enchantment of \\"Ever After\\" or the wit of \\"Shrek\\". It's only saving grace is the attempts to make the story more accessible to tweens/teenagers with shop-lifting, fanclubs, popified medieval gear and pin-up boy Hugh Dancy.One star for effort. Sad, sad, sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I had never read Ella Enchanted, and thought the movie was very cute, and suprisingly funny! In typical Cinderella fashion, Ella is forced to put up with her two, malicious step sisters, and stepmother, who make her life difficult. Ella was given a \\"gift\\" of obedience by her fairy godmother at birth, and has to do whatever she is told. The story revolves around Ella's struggle to overcome her curse, and in doing so, assists others(the elves and giants) in overcoming their social and political problems. This movie is both witty and entertaining; i took my younger cousin and she loved it!I read the book Ella Enchanted after seeing the movie, and did not enjoy the book half as much. I found this surprising, because i read the Harry Potter series after seeing the second movie, and enjoyed the books better than the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty fair family fare - if you don't mind a little disco","review":"Really a 3 and a half. The book and the movie- many differences, but still, the movie is entertaining. The big addition was the Bee Gees and the disco vibe that we got every do often. And even though there wasn't really room, I'd like to have seen even more prominent roles to the character actors like Eric Idle and others all the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deserve to be called \\"Ella Enchanted\\"","review":"I almost wanted to cry after seeing this movie, and not in a good way. I have grown up reading Ella Enchanted over and over. It was, and still is, my favorite book of all time. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in this attempt at a movie. Not only is it nothing like the book, it is filled with a cheesy script, cheesy characters, and an annoying Prince Char. I am saddened that this means there will probably never be a good movie version of Ella Enchanted, which I imagined as much more serious and beautiful, rather than humorous and corny. I love Anne Hathaway, but even her charm doesn't help this movie. Not to mention, I think Ella should be portrayed by someone a little younger.I'm sorry for Gail Carson Levine, whose beautifully original ideas and magical writing was turned into this joke of a movie. Find another movie to watch, or go read the book. This movie is not worth anyone's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun movie to watch/listen to.","review":"This movie was fun to watch, and has plenty of enjoyable music. The only real similarity to the book of the same name was the basic premise and the characters' names, but taken as a completely separate work, this was pretty well done.Anne Hathaway was a convincing, strong, willful heroine, and her singing voice is pleasant. The choreography on the dance numbers is both skillful and amusing.This comedy is well worth watching at least once, and great to listen to while working on projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very cute movie for all ages","review":"This movie is appropriate for young children and is also very entertaining for adults. The music in it is wonderful and there are 80's tunes thrown in with some scenes, which is just hilarious. My little girls love it and I enjoy watching it with them. Very cute and harmless, and at the same time entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks weird","review":"This movie looks sort of weird. The characters seemed to have been selected for each role based on \\"Who's available and cheap\\" rather than \\"Let's get the right person for each role\\". I don't recommend this movie to serious movie watchers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge fun","review":"This is a fairy-tale movie, with all the trimmings - fairy godmothers, evil stepsisters, elves and giants, and a charming prince. Somehow, it's a fairy-tale gone off the rails. The fairy godmother should have her license lifted. Ella's first encounter with the prince is her \\"equal rights for elves\\" protest at his appearance. Her second encounter knocks her off her feet - literally, to the ground.Start to finish, this is howling funny. The premise is a little contrived, that Ella is \\"blessed\\" with obedience - forced to comply with any order given to her. Swallow that one (in a G-rated sort of way) and the movie moves along quite nicely, right to the happy ending. In fact, it's worth waiting around for that ending. It's an insane song and dance to a drippy disco-era duet, with Ella in a white minidress and go-go boots.There is absolutely nothing to take seriously here - but that's what some moments call for. Goofy, family-safe fun.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Princess Bride\\" for kids","review":"I popped in this DVD for my six year old daughter and went into the kitchen to make dinner. The first few notes of the opening music sounded very familiar, and I thought \\"Hmmm, someone has been listening to a lot of old ELO music!\\" But when they actually launched into \\"Strange Magic\\" I had to go back and sit down and watch the movie. It was very cute, and my daughter adored it! Easy to follow for her, and enough slightly more sophisticated tidbits to keep an adult amused. The music is a lot of fun, I'm about to buy the soundtrack. We loved Ann Hathaway in Princess Diaries and she does a good job here as well. It's now one our family favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute","review":"Reading the other reviews here, most people are disappointed because the movie wasn't much like the book.

If you don't compare, you'll enjoy them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book","review":"The book Ella Enchanted creates a unique and interesting world. It has fairytale elements but twists them into its own style with it's own languages, lands, and creatures.The movie Ella Enchanted takes this wonderfully unique world and Disneyfies it into generic fairyland. They take everything unique and interesting about the book and ruin it. Even the storyline is changed. About the ONLY thing this movie has in common with the book, besides the name, is Ella's curse. It's like someone read the back of the book cover and made a movie from that. Horribly disappointing. I would not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have been a BIG fan of Ella Enchanted for a while, so I bought the movie for my daughter to share in my enthusiasm.

Great movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book","review":"This movie is complete and utter crap. Just as a movie it is lame, but as a film adaptation of the book it is tragic.

I watched it with my family and I was shocked at how poorly written this movie was. I loved the book and have read it over 100 times and can't get tired of it. In the movie, Ella is more of a puppet rather than the spunky, resilient girl in the book. Also, what is up with the modern day language?!! This is supposed to be set in a medieval time, not today. In the movie, you never get to know Char's personality unlike the book. In the movie, it's more like love at first sight whereas in the book Ella and Char get to know each other first. Also, what's with the 'evil snake' and weird uncle?! The way that Ella breaks her curse is completely lame. Don't waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun family movie","review":"Received product superfast and it was exactly as described. Very pleased.

Great family movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy Vey.","review":"Oh, dear...this movie was an abomination. Why must directors insist on picking up books and deciding not to read them and make a movie out of them instead? I can see why they would change a few plot and character points to make the book's storyline more marketable to the target moviegoers. But honestly...there are many elements in the book that would have translated well to film that they left out and replaced with something cliched and unoriginal.And the film design! Bleh! Maybe it would be appealing to 5-year-old girls...but to me it looked garish, cheap, and...really fake. The costuming was slightly better than our high school plays, and the sets looked frighteningly bright and animated.I felt so much dumber after watching this movie. I feel like I need an IQ test...or a good book. Speaking of good books, Ella Enchanted is one of my favorites. I don't know why I thought of that book just now. I guess this movie vaguely reminded me of it...but not much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The film was silly, the plot boring and the comedy childish.

This movie was severely disappointing. The characters are flat, predictable, and annoyingly cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Actors, terrible writing.","review":"One thing I noticed was not one scene was taken from the book. Not one! Sure, they got the basics down, Ella had a curse to be obedient, her mom died, she met Char and went on a quest to get rid of Obedience, but thats the only thing they got right. Anne Hathaway is a great actress and Hugh Dancy is a wonderful actor so you would think that together combined they would produce something worthwhile but no. I suggest not seeing this movie and reading the book, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree to the three below this one-I'm just adding on","review":"Ella Enchanted is a Very bad romance movie. OK, it's not just romance. The romance in it is completely mushy and gross; it makes sure that the viewer knows 100% that Ella and the prince are in love. Yes, Ella is charming- but in a completely disgusting way that made me want to punch her. When she was sad, I only thought, serve her right. Ella is completely stuck up, getting everything her own way, needing to be rescued by the prince: the average heroine. The movie is 99% different than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Watch This","review":"It is a very badly done movie. It doesn't follow the book at all.

It was funny, and I loved how Gail Carson Levine made it into something similar to Cinderella. When the movie came out, I really wanted to see it. So here's what I think. Of course the movie is different from the book, but I still think it's similar to the book because it is still funny, and still has the plot of Cinderella. This version just has a bigger plot than the book. But still, my opinion is that you will like the movie, even if it is a bit different.

Do you value integrity in young women? If you did, then do not by any means watch this movie. It completely trivialized the strength and the pluck of the heroine and her struggles, and made it seem like some random romantic comedy where the girl is just walking along, looks attractive to a guy, and they fall in love with the slight inconvenience that, oh, she has to obey commands. In the book, there was no step uncle with a snake around his neck nor was the Prince the male version of a 'dumb blonde,' so to speak. Gail Carson Levine, why would you ever consent to this? Why would you ever taint something that was so good?In summary, this is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. Too bad I cannot give zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy and, well cheesy.","review":"This has almost no redeeming aspects except for the fact that Anne Hathaway is a FABULOUS actress and she makes almost everything at least a teeny bit better. This does the book NO justice whatsoever, and the \\"Medieval Teen\\" really pushed it over the edge for me. Disney went too over the top trying to make this a cutesy fairy tale and so they \\"cutesy\\"ed it up way too much. And all the good songs they ruined by singing and dancing to them? Not worth it. Girls around 7 [before they read the book and/or are too cynical] might like this movie. But boys of any age, will not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of TIME!!!","review":"First of all, I must say that Ella Enchanted has been my favorite book since about the third grade. This movie has nothing in common with this charming and witty story except for some of the same character names. I don't understand why this movie gets any good reviews at all. There is no depth in the plot and Ella is a single-faceted character. The only thing this movie is successful at is turning people off of a wonderful book and kill brain cells.

I LOVED the book, and I couldn't believe Ms. Levine capable of translating her fantastic book into this atrocity. Ella was horribly acted by Anne Hathaway, Char's uncle & the stupid snake weren't even IN the book, and everything else was just too fantastical. Where was the menagerie? Where was the boarding school? In my opinion, to have left out these crucial bits of story & add the uncle trying to kill Ella was ridiculous. I wish I could say something, anything positive, but it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It was NOTHING I expected from my favorite book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure","review":"Ella Enchanted the book is one of the best that I have ever read. It was so mystical and engrossing. I just couldn't keep my nose out. I've read it around 30 times but i'm having my doubts about the movie. I really want to belive that it will be good but from what I've seen and heard, they have added new characters into the movie. I've also heard that the banister parts have been removed. And from what I've seen the fairy godmothers...are young. That isnt how it is in the book they can look ageless yes but no they arent around 17-21. In the book Ella's fairy godmother is probably around 60-70. I also dont like whom they choose to cast everyone. Now a days it seems hard for the director to stick to the book. And that upsets me very much. I really hope that this movie will not be a waste of money.Sarahage-13 not 12 >_<"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so magical","review":"I absolutely loved the book, and the preview has confirmed my fears about the movie: they destroyed it.

The book could have been made into a very good movie with only slight modifications, so why they decided to completely change the plot, the characters, and the essential charm of the book is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Sad to Watch","review":"This movie really was quite sad for me to watch, because I disliked it very much. There is hardly any \\"magic and charm\\" from the original book. It was just absolutely corny, and the book isn't that way. Although it didn't have to go by the book, the movie itself was pretty horrible. I was embarrassed the whole time while watching it, and then when it was about to end, where everyone starts singing Kareoke, I was gone. It just wasn't worth our money and time. Too bad it wasn't that great, because the book is definitely magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to NY Times review or trailer","review":"This was a cute, pleasant entertainment, but nothing special. Could just as easily been a TV movie. For the NY Times to compare it with Shrek in any way is very misleading - Ella doesn't come close to that level of excellence in storytelling. It's more of a rip-off (albeit poorly executed) than an homage. Wait for the DVD and rent - don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"An example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood","review":"I read the book and loved it; it said a great deal about finding out who you are and not letting yourself be defined by other people's expectations. The book was clever, funny and very kid friendly. Several of my 5th & 6th grade students went to see the movie and were very disappointed, complaining that it was not at all like the book. I bought the DVD (used) and discovered the kids were right. The movie was terrible. Cleverness and wit had been replaced by potty humor and age-inappropriate situations and dialog. I watched about 20 minutes and turned it off. Don't waste your money on this one- it is just another example of the bozos in Hollywood ruining good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you like the book don't see the film","review":"I have read the ella enchanted books hundreds of times and it is my fave. book, and when I heard that there was going to be a film I was really excited. But when I saw the trailer I was really let down. It looks like a terrible film aimed at 5year olds, while the book is aimed at teens. The plot is nothing like the book, and as another reviewer said Anne Hathaway looks to old to play the part. I will not be seeing the film and warn any one who likes the book to stay away from this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm...","review":"The book that this movie is based on is probably one of the best books I have ever read (and that's saying a lot, since I spend nearly all my free time reading). I was ecstatic when I heard that they were finally going to make a movie out of it. However, in watching the previews and talking to people who have seen it, it sounds nothing like the original book. So many major things have been changed that I can't possibly list them all here. I suppose it's still a good movie in its own right, although a bit... corny, but I can't understand why the plot of such a fantastic book would be entirely changed like that! If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"I was completely surprised by how good the movie was. I went in thinking it was going to be an average movie, but I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire thing. It was so addicting and well thought out that you get so wrapped up in it and forget that it is just a movie...Well, at least I did. In many ways, this movie reminded me of \\"Shrek\\". It seems to have the same humor and parody of fairytales. Anne Hathaway did a great job as usual and her singing is excellent. I definetely will see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from the book but good","review":"This is a good movie, however, you might be disappointed if you have read the book. The book is one of my favorite books ever, and I was a little disappointed that they took out lots of the good parts. They could have done a better job choosing a character for Mandy-she's supposed to be old like 50 or 60. Ella was great, so was Char, and Hattie was really funny. Dame Olga was not how I pictured her. This story takes place in mideval times and they tried to modernize it too much, I think. The music and some of the clothes are too modern. This is a great family movie- it mixes fairy tale with excitement and humor. If you want to go see it I would encourage you to read the book either before or after.The bottom line is this is a great movie but they took out a lot of good parts from the book and tried to put too many of their own things in it :^)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst book-to-movies I've ever seen","review":"Ouch. One of the worst book-to-movie translations ever.Unfortunately, Ella Enchanted probably should never have been made into a movie: in the book (which is amazing), most of the real conflict (as well as the intense climax) goes on inside her head: it's her will vs. the spell. To make this into a movie, they had to change the story so that the conflict was much more visible-- but it also became much more superficial.The book borders on being corny, but the movie took the extra steps to make it definitely ridiculous. The movie-makers also added a shrek-like modernity that really didn't help.I have to add that I was quite heartbroken to see our beloved Wesley in a stupid evil uncle role that wasn't even in the book...So basically, watch the movie if you want, but borrow it from a friend or the library-- don't waste your money on it.The book, on the other hand... is a whole different story. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is five star, not the movie","review":"I like my movies as good as my books and this one fell depressingly short. I had really high hopes for this movie but, I was wrong for it. It doesn't matter, though. After accepting that the movie would never be as good as the book, I shook the thoughts of the book from my mind and decided to see the movie again, without bias. Again, I was disappointed. The script just wasn't good. There was nothing that drew me in and made me feel as though I was experiencing it. I say you save yourself some money and buy a copy of the book. Reading will take about two times more time than watching but you'll get twice the enjoyment out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Hoot!","review":"This movie is not high art, but it is greatly entertaining. Told in the same style as \\"The Princess Bride\\", Ella Enchanted delivers solid family entertainment that has as much for the grown-ups as it does for the kids. The book is better, but when is that not true.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT watch this movie. Read the book instead.","review":"The book, Ella Enchanted, was a magnificent tale. A good solid plot with great, realistic characters. Ella Enchanted really touched me and it has its own place in my heart. If you are a beloved reader like I, I'm telling you, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! You will be SEVERELY disappointed. Just read the book.There was nothing the same in the movie, except for the name. Singing elves? Elves for lawyers? Talking snake?! I don't think\\"Ella Enchanted\\" would be a proper name. How bout, \\"Ever After\\" or \\"Shrek\\", which, by the way, are much better movies. This movie took away those little details that made the book magical and enchanted. I was enraged that a great classic had its name on that...that...THING!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deserve to be called, \\"Ella Enchanted\\" it is not at all like the book.!!!!","review":"I loved the book by Gail Gibbons. It had soul, it made sense and it was unique but this movie was horrible. It was not at all like the book. It seems like a blind man was the director. The movie would have been better if it was remotely cose to the book.1. Hattie wears a wig and Ella takes it2. Ella's father is a bad man. He does not kiss his daughter and call her pumpkin.3. Mandy is a fairy and show Ella her tricks.4. There are ogres. And she befriends one(in the book)!!!There are so many wrong things in the Movie.......Sigh. Just read the book. it is so much better. Bye5."},{"rating":"2","title":"the wizard of oz meets cinderella","review":"this is movie not every one will like. it is loosley based on the book by gail carson levine. the movie is about a girl named ella who at birth got the gift of obedenice. ella has to do everything she is told, when she gets fedup she runsaway home to find the fairy who gave her this gift. along the way she meets a elf and prince. this movie is like the wizard of oz meets cinderella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie from a book I've ever seen","review":"\\"Ella Enchanted\\" is a lovely book, and my daughter and I enjoyed reading it. My husband brought home the video, and UGH! Everything that made the book a joy - the beautiful language, the sly humor, and noble Ella herself are warped and mutated beyond recognition. All subtlety and charm are lost. Don't buy this; check out the book from your library. The book on tape was also excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamlet with a happy ending","review":"Ella Enchanted was a wonderful book which could be looked upon as a children's version of Jane Eyre. It was loosely based on Cinderella, but had some beautiful themes that were all its own. Now, if they had stuck to the original story, the movie would have been a wondeful contemporary fairy tale with a very capable herione and role model for girls everywhere. However, this movie got rid of the Jane Eyre-style themes from the book and instead combined it with elements of Hamlet by having an evil uncle who killed the king to become king. Let me tell you right now, Cinderella and Hamlet do NOT go together! Gail Carson Levine is one of my favorite authors and I always thought her writing style would translate well to the movie screen, but not like this!The narrator is annoying, the movie tries way too hard to be funny, and all the beauty and charm from the original novel is lost.Do yourself a favor and order the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ella not so Enchanted","review":"After reading the book, I was completely disappointed in this movie. The only thing that was the same was the fact that Ella was cursed with obedience. In this movie, the characters come off as mere caricatures. In the book Ella is able to save herself from the ogres, but in the movie she needs the prince to do it for her. I think this movie was trying to be part Ever After and as my husband said, part Shrek. I would recommend watching either of those movies instead of this one and of course reading the book, which is way smarter and more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh..........","review":"The book was fantastic. The movie was okay on its own, but, it was NOTHING like the book. Areida had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Ella's father was actually nice. And Mandy was a stupid ditzy moron. I suppose the writers of this movie thought it would be more interesting if there was another idiotic plot about saving the kingdom, blah, blah, blah. Well, it just took away from the real plot, Ella overcoming the curse. READ THE BOOK FIRST. THIS MOVIE RUINS THE REPUTATION OF THE BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie should be called something else, because if it wasn't called Ella Enchanted, it'd be a great story on it's own. But no- it's supposed to be made after the book Ella Enchanted (which was one of my favorite books ever), and all it has that follows the plot is the names, and the fact Ella has a curse. OTHER then that, there is nothing remotely *close* to the book.I was expecting a great movie- but I saw *this* instead. Waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ella Enchanted Movie","review":"I was so happy to find out that Ella Enchanted was going to be a movie. However, when I saw the movie I was enraged. I does NOT follow the book at all. It souldn't be called Ella Enchanted. Very Very Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay movie","review":"The costumes were great but some parts were not. I loved Benny the book. But the book was way better it had more to it. I loved Ella's cloak and her hair and prince Char I could see was cute but I won't not buy it on DvD. But the singing is good maby get the soundtrack not the movie its self but if you like it wait until another Ella movie is out or a year and the dvd will have more to it like 2 disk dvd with fun extras and music videos for some of the songs. But this is a movie you will want to check of of you seen movie list. But you sould go out and see it and rate it yourself to see if you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Ella Enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when I heard that they were going to make it into a movie, I was estatic. I marked the movie release date on my calander, got my tickets in advance, and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater.The movie was a huge dissapointment. While I wasn't expecting the movie to be just like the book, I certainly wasn't expecting that. While the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie, I hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book. The only common thread I found were the names of the characters and the fact that Ella was cursed from birth.I suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie, it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears, despite the fact that I've read it over 100 times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was disappointed that the movie was not an original!","review":"This movie can't be a new Blu Ray from the original Manufacturer! It has no FBI warning, no menu with selections, nor subtitles! It starts right at the beginning of the movie and ends with no credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Love The Book .......","review":"This is one of the worst adaptions of a book that I've ever seen. The director of this \\"acid trip\\" movie must have been under the influence of drugs or a mental case. The target audience apparently was 10 to 16 year old girls. The campy choreography and \\"Abba\\" styled awful pop music, the inane script, the crude humor, the casting (undewear model, Heidi Klum as a horny giant?!?), and a hip-hop fairy godmother, all add up to a disastrous movie experience. Even the art direction and special effects are awful and cheap! This movie totally destroyed the spirit of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the strangest movies I've ever seen...","review":"I haven't read the book, but I've heard a lot of good things about it. (I'd still like to read it, so the movie hasn't ruined the concept for me totally, but it's a close thing...)The movie, however, left me staring at the screen with my jaw hanging open through most of it. \\"What the heck is this, and why am I watching it?\\"I give Anne Hathaway points for playing her part well, but I can't imagine why she'd have accepted the role in the first place. The same goes for Prince Charmont. The dancing elves, the backup singer giants, and the Elton John/Kiki Dee number... What were they thinking? Who decided this would be a good movie to make?And oh, Westley, what have you done?!Pass on this one. There are a million better fairy tale movies. Try The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, Ever After (if you can ignore the French Prince having an English accent)... There's no excuse for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was gail thinking?","review":"I absolutely loved the book and the way the characters are developed. The romance was lively and the plot was inspiring but from what i've seen in the previews, it seems like gail may have made a big mistake letting this be rewritten for film. I hope she assisted in the screen play to keep the movie true to the book but i'm not so sure based on the caharacter choices. (anne hathaway seems a bit too old to be portraying a 14 year old Ella.)They portray her curse as making her freeze in midair and the path of the book seems to have gotten lost in hollywood's obsession with technology and 'family films'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Hathaway Goes High!","review":"Anne Hathaway, who plays our main character, Ella Of Frell learns an important lesson. She saves Prince Charmont, played by Hugh Dancy, and overcomes her spell. She learns that, inside, she is stronger than any spell.I think Ella Enchanted is a wonderful movie and I encourage everyone to watch it. I also believe that Ella Enchanted is the BEST movie of 2004 (so far)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, in a word.","review":"Awful, awful, awful. Anne Hathaway was alright I suppose in Princess Diaries, but she's no Ella- not by a long shot. I saw this movie becoming a mistake from it's beginnings, and was so disappointed watching(I simply had to, you understand) that I actually had to pause it and wring my hands in helplessness. It was just one of those great little books i would read til 4 in the morning and hope somebody never made the movie, because it would be impossible. This movie is sorry- even without the book (which it barely pretends to follow). It is poor film-making, acting, costumes, script. Message-wise, I didn't get anything of substance either. The whole family will not enjoy this, I know, because mine groaned, too. Don't waste your money or time on this one folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Y-U-C-K","review":"I thought this book would make a fantastic movie, but I was more disappointed than I can convey with words other than this: they completely blew the chance for a great movie, and all the money they spent making it was completely wasted. I mean, I know movie companies like to take a few creative liberties--I don't mind a few creative liberties if they make it better--but come on. It's like they took the title, the main idea of the story, and a few characters (drastically changed, of course), and made up a completely different plot.If I were Gail Carson Levine, I would probably be living as a hermit right now because my book has been so disgraced. It was an awful movie and I wish I never saw it; the inaccuracy made me sick and the actors didn't do well at all anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, the book is MUCH better","review":"I love the book, Ella Enchanted, but the movie did not tell the tale. if i did not read, or know the book, i would of enjoyed the movie more. the movie is a great movie, but Ella, or Hattie, or even Olive are not children, they are adults. although i don't go to the movies that much, some of my friends said it was good (they haven't read the book) so i went. it barely had anything in common with the book, so, the book, Ella Enchanted, is MUCH better than the movie, and read the book first, and see how bad the movie is, and how it barely relates to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous disgusting movie, lousy musical score...","review":"I read the book and loved it. I loved Anne Hathaway in PRINCESS DIARIES so I thought we'd like this movie. The entire family hated the totally inappropriate musical score, and where was the wonderful plot and story from the novel?!?!?I have to give this movie a very low score due to the screenplay and very distracting, ridiculous music. Horrible! The actors were quite good, except the girl who played stepsister Hattie was miscast as she appeared too old."},{"rating":"1","title":"book was great, doubt the movie will be","review":"I read the book Ella Enchanted more than five times, it is the best book i ever read. But what i heard about the movie isn't that good. They gave Char an evil uncle, there is no Mandy, (but a farie retirment home instead) and there are talking books! I'm not positive about Mandy, but the rest is true. I think the movie might be cheasy, (it has a narrator), but i hope it won't be as bad as i think it will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I am 15 years old and I loved this book the first time I read it and still love it when i read it again for the 100th time. It is a great book for teens, a great tale about fairys, love, and the triumps of a girl in her travels to become a women. I can't wait until this movie comes out, i hope that they can stay as true as possible to the book and make it as amazing as Gail Carson Levine made it to be in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"ok SO FIRST LETS GET ONE THING STRAIT THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER AND THATS ABOUT IT.ok so I really liked the book and i was excited when i heard they were making a movie of it but then i saw it and didn't even end up finishing it it was soooooo bad they ruin everything nothing is the same...and when they go to the giant village there like belly dancing and Ella is singing?????? alright that doesn't even sound good but theres a ton of other things as well but it would take to long to right it all down.

Save Me from this Very Very Very Very Very Bad","review":"I watched this movie and thought it was Very Very Very Very Bad and thought it was a load of crap. It had Bad Acting, Bad Story Line, Cheap Sets, Predictable Ending, and a Waste of 90 Minutes of Watching Time. Then when I was in school I found out that that the class was going to read the book. I protested but I knew that they wouldn't listen to me. Then came a boring 3 weeks of nothing but a very bad book. Then I finished the book. Then to make the torture worse the class had to watch the movie. To be honest both the movie and the book was a very very very big load of Crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"ELLA ENCHANTED","review":"STORY WAS NOT GOOD TOO SLOW DID NOT SEE THE WHOLE MOVIE.......ANN WAS GOOD IN STORY......CANNOT RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ella Enchanted movie review","review":"I don't like it because they removed a lot of parts. My favorite part of the book was how Ella and Prince Char both like sliding down stair rails, and they took that out. For another thing, in the book there was no evil king or impending deaths.
