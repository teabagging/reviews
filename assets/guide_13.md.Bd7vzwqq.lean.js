It's just fast enough to keep you moving but not too fast and hard that you can't just sit and chill out listening to it.

I am sad to say this CD was horrible. I bought his previous CDs and loved both. While I was listening to this CD I could not wait for it to end. I didn't mind the fact that it was mostly southern rock, but the lyrics made no sense. I am a big Lynyrd Skynyrd fan and if I were them I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this CD. The only salvageable song was Picture with Sheryl Crow. This was definitely a half-hearted effort. The only high point to this CD is Twisted Brown Trucker's instrument playing and the background vocals by Uncle Kracker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally !

I agree with the other rater, if I had wanted country music, I woulda bought country music. I fell asleep listening to the middle half of this track. From what I can tell, they all sound alike. There is one with Sheryl Crow, that sounded all nice and sappy, but certainly not what you expect from KR. Save your money. Forever was the only good song on this CD.But, if you want proof that KR can sing {personally I thought he'd been faking it, especially after one TV performance I saw(I think the grammy's)}.... he proves that he has some vocal talent on this CD. He isn't using high tech machines to cover up the fact that he can't sing in this one.

His self described mix of hip-hop and rock ($%^& southern rock stuff) is dead on.

Mark my words, Kid Rock will be the \\"new cool\\" for the coming year. I'm not from Detroit but having lived there for a couple of years, Detroit's musical soul is in the Kid, no question. I'm now a 38 year old man driving down the street beating my stearing wheel and screaming out lyrics again.

However, this album contains tracks that are much more somber than previous Rock classics such as \\"Early Mornin' Stoned ....\\" or \\".... You Blind\\". Yet tracks like \\"Forever\\" show that Rock can still be the cocky (no pun intended) rocker we have come to know and love. When buying this album, you must realize that you aren't going to get the same .... you kind of songs. I wouldn't say that Kid has turned mainstream with this album, just more reflective. Overall, a great album and no music library should be without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened to ROCK?","review":"Kid Rock lays back in the album Cocky and does some reflection on life, the world, and even religion. Only a couple of the songs on this album actually rock, as most are slower songs with a nibble of BITE (and a lot of adult language).If you are looking for anything like Devil Without A Cause, you won't find it here. The first few tracks are all essentially the same, stating \\"I'm Back\\" or \\"Kid Rock's Back\\" but I am wondering why because he never went anywhere, did he?I like the album as it reminds me of the earlier years of John Mellencamp when he was the \\"Cougar\\" and any Mellencamp fans who don't mind a few four lettered words will really enjoy Cocky.Rock does not Rock much on this album.

Now with COCKY. Kid Rock does not seem so edgy, or dare I say Hungry anymore? The tracks are a mishmash of different styles, and none of them seem to contain the raw stylings of DWAC. The die hards won't agree, but now Kid just sounds like one of the LOUD, and the tired.

If it weren't Sheryl Crow singing on this CD, I would have given it ZERO stars. Don't get me wrong, I loved Devil w/ a Cause but I think he used up all his talent on that CD, he's washed up and has no new material left in him.

If I wanted Willie Nelson, I'd have bought Willie Nelson.Usually Rock fuzes rap and metal. In this album he tries to bring country in too, in a big way and I think it fails. The song \\"Lonely Road of Faith\\" appears to be pandering to the Sept 11 tragedy as a new marketing opportunity. In fact it makes me suspect of the entire work. It makes me wonder if the new direction to fuse with country isn't driven by the marketing execs rather than a true desire on KR's part to go country.Overall the album was preachy and country. If KR keeps this direction, it'll be the last album for me.I'm sorry I wasted my money on this one, and I hope I can save others the disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID YOU HEAR KID ROCK WENT PLATINUM?","review":"I CAN SUM THIS ALBUM UP VERY EASILY. \\"I'M KID ROCK, I'VE GONE PLATINUM, DETRIOT IS WHERE I'M FROM, WHAT'S MY NAME?

Lonely road of faith, picture, you never met and what I learned out on the road are all great songs. Then for the older kid rock fans there is Forever, Cocky and I'm a dog.

This album was produced before the choir started doing albums with soloists, which also gives it a major advantage over later albums. The only soloist-collaboration they've done that's worth owning in its entirety is \\"Spirit of the Season,\\" which they did with Sissel.

My main complaint is with the noisy cooling fan. (Other reviews had mentioned this flaw as well). Because of the shelving available to me, I need a slim-line unit, and a fan may be the only option for these. I'm guessing the \\"fat\\" units use heat-sinks instead of fans. I don't really know, but at normal listening levels I found the fan noise distracting.Additionally, after playing around for about two hours, I still couldn't seem to get the decibel levels to adjust for surround. I don't know if it's the system or me, but either way it ends up unsatisfactory.I will spend a little more money for something I like better. The product seems to be made solidly, and the design is attractive, but the downsides makes it unacceptable, and I have returned the system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn nice...","review":"The sound of this system is superb and it's very easy to setup. However, after using it for several weeks now I've found a few downfalls which are really just annoyances, not problems. 1)The receiver has a tendancy to get relatively warm after a long period of time. 2)I hate the fact that if you switch to the radio, TV or VCR you can't open the DVD tray. 3)The tray takes forever to open... I hate waiting. That's really about it. The radio was an added bonus and the price was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't even get what you pay for","review":"I bought this in early 2003.

This adds a new texture and excitement to the arrangements, which in and of themselves are fantastic and well thought out. I would suggest either of Brad's two recordings. On top of being a brilliant writer and multi-instrumentalist, Brad is a great engineer and producer. If possible check out Jeff Howell (Florida) or Mark Hayes (Cali).

The further I got into the book the worse it got. His attack on Frank Norris is bad enough, but his misinterpretation of fundamentalism and the Bible just go too far.

Don't let that fool you into thinking they make the movie worth watching. The entire premise of the movie is absurd. The writing is beyond dreadful, and the acting and directing are even worse. I thought it couldn't get any worse, and then the adults came into the picture--where did they find these people? How does dreck like this get made in the first place?

This is a low budget film that could mimic real life. Don't get the edited version though.I am not a movie reviewer nor do I pretend to be as most on here do. Short, simple and to the point. Not endless goings on about the movie was this or that. Nor do I give the movie away (HINT to all of you who like to write reviews to the point I could throw up)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eating Out gave me a stomach ache","review":"Absolutely awful. One of the worst movies I've seen this year. Feeds into every negative stereotype I can think of about gay young men. It isn't all that flattering to women either. In fact it is very insulting.Some will say this a fluff movie that should be enjoyed for what it is. I like fluff. Movies like Trick, I Think I Do, and All Over the Guy are romantic comedies that entertain without being too serious. The problem with Eating Out is the terrible writing and predictable plot.The performances aren't all that inspiring either. To be fair Ryan Carnes is very handsome (he really does remind me of a young Brad Pitt) and delivers a decent performance. But the other actors reek. In particular, the Gwen character played by Emily Brooke Hands is so completely over the top that watching her creates a desire to turn on the oven to 350 and break out the honey glaze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illiterate Script","review":"This could have been a good film.

What's that scene with the parents,!!! awfully painful. The overacting of the girl friend may mean to be funny, but it fails. Not to mention her attitude as a friend. The only worthy scene would be the threesome thru the phone. The two guys have gorgeous pecs and toys, but please. Rent it if you want.

There are bad moments. There are far to many bad moments. Overall this movie is really bad, but I can't say that it's not acted well. I enjoyed the acting, but the writing was terrible. My partner and I decided to give it a try, and were both so sorry we had. I busied myself doing some housework while it played out.

The storyline made me yawn and the actors were lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie i have seen this year","review":"There's nothing more irritating than listening to dialogue that is supposed to sound hip and cool but which sounds anything but. This script seems to have been written by someone completley out of touch with how young people converse, as the lingo in this film was incredibly ridiculous. You almost feel embarrassed for the actors, as they must surely have realized how corny the lines were. Not to mention the entire plot was absurd, and the characters incredibly two dimensional. As another reviewer noted, the supposedly \\"hot\\" girl is the most irritating character in the film. At the film's climax, you find yourself waiting to see her get get slapped, but alas, it never happens. If you're still absolutely dying to see this, just get it on netflix. its not worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome labels...","review":"Iron has to be super hot and you have to make sure that the edges are especially ironed, pressed with the iron.

The lyrics sound like they're being made up as they go along, and then those lyrics are mumbled throughout. It makes for a very frustrating listening experience, hence the two months to finish. If you're a Grizzly Bear newbie, go with \\"Veckatimest.\\" It's most excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Successfully improving the production","review":"Yellow House is a natural and healthy progression from their first album, Horn of Plenty. This majestic, captivating release showcases the band taking a step up in sophistication and complexity. The structure of the tracks are most often sprawling and have a tendency to change direction in mid-song. It is very folk-influenced, but definitely shows patches of pop psychedelia. This will probably hit home for fans of Animal Collective."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to live in a yellow house...","review":"Have you ever been to a model home in a midwestern suburban housing development in the midst of being completed? These houses, constructed inside and out to look as though the most pleasant families in the world have been happily inhabiting them for years, create the kind of warmth and familiarity that one could be convinced can never exist elsewhere. Nowhere else except perhaps in the cascading strains of \\"Yellow House\\". Much comparison has been made between The Grizzlies and The Beach Boys and Animal Collective...but I hear bits of Eno at his most jilted, Vashti Bunyan at her most tender and even, yes, Aphex Twin at his most melodic. This is not experimental music for pop fans, nor is it pop for fans of experimental music. This is intriguing music at its most populist...tuneful, expansive, exposed and redemptive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased Review","review":"Grizzly Bear may sound like the name of a band that should have heavy parts and a mean sound, but maybe instead the name just matches the powerful vibes and feelings that they can only give. They are respected by the modern musicians of our time because they have created their own unique sound while still using influences that are so familiar. Each song on \\"Yellow House\\" is a beautiful little masterpiece....I couldn't say one bad or negative thing about any sound on this album. I think one of my favorite things on this album is the higher \\"Beach Boys\\" type harmonies that the drummer pulls off. I think this will be my favorite band for good remainder of my life.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it...","review":"Headband is a little too large and no way to compensate for that.

A blend of caving, philosophy, and caving philosophy, his work gives one pause for finding meaning in one's life. I for one am jealous of the karst regions he has been fortunate to explore. Telling about those exploits is handled with style that doesn't get in the way of the story itself. I'm sure others would enjoy this book. I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much needed jolt to cave literature","review":"Michael Ray Taylor sends a much needed jolt to the world of cave literature. The book is a celebration of caving for caving's sake, rather than for some loftier goal. Mike is your average guy who has an unusual hobby, one that, in another time or place would remain unfulfilled. But Mike has not only been able to enjoy his hobby immensely, he has been able to weave it somewhat into his career. In his role asa journalisthe has wormed his way onto some of the most interesting trips of the past decade and, on occasion, been present at the making of history. Michael Ray Taylor has given us that rarest of things, real life advenure, told in a down to earth, believable style.

What I loved was how the movie exposed the difficulties in honest communication from several angles, leading to a less-than-happy existence for all of the characters, though you pull for them to find their true path throughout the movie.

First, the main female character is borderline pathological. She straight up FREAKS me out. Furthermore, the main guy character is a push over with no cajones. Honestly, it was rather painful to watch, but since I paid 3.99 I figured I'd skip along till the end. Boy did waste 4 dollars. I would have asked Redbox for my 1 dollar back if I rented it there. Do yourself a favor, if you're a sane man, don't waste your time and money.

They sounded so bad I took them back to Best Buy for a second pair just be sure that the first pair weren't blown. Well, they weren't blown: they were simply pathetic. The bass was virtually non-existent and both the mid and high ranges sounded muddy. Maybe other JBL products are of higher quality than these, but certainly don't buy these.

This TV has caused me embarassment, frustration and hopelessness. Panasonic should have taken care of their customers when they bought this lemon. There was a class action lawsuit but unfortunately I missed the boat.

The picture is amazing, it is relatively user friendly and I love the Split Screen feature. However.....we bought the TV in Sept. 2003 and the first bulb blew in Aug. 2004. With considerable effort on our part, Panasonic finally replaced the bulb at no cost. Bulb blew again in Sept. 2005. We missed the one year warranty by about six weeks so we had to pay $300 for a new bulb. We did call the Customer Service department when the second bulb blew and they admitted the bulbs were \\"defective\\" and that that bulb life of 10,000 hours is misrepresented, though they obviously didn't feel inclined to replace our second bulb again at no cost. This will be the last Panasonic item we purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER again, Panasonic!","review":"We bought this TV in June of 2004 as an employee purchase. We are now on our THIRD repair for a blown bulb/lamp. We've also replaced the ballast. Panasonic refuses to accept this set is defective and will not accept it as a return. Because this started occurring during the orig 1 yr warranty, the bulbs are so far still covered. If not, we'd already be out $1000 in bulbs after today. I don't even know what the ballast cost to replace. The bulbs seem to last about 4 months, then almost like clockwork - DEAD. No pic, no nothing.

Within the first year, blew a bulb and required a new optical engine. (The optical engine is the heart if the TV-set and will cost about $2k+). After that it was a new bulb every 9 mo.+, at $300 a lamp. Thank God for the extended service contract!Finally, in 2007 the ballast went out. After two mo.+ no ballast repair/replacement available. Ultimately, and after some haggling, the extended service contract basically refunded the initial purchase price for the TV.I have moved on since.

Having had mine for almost 4 years now, I have replaced the lamp three times and am now having to replace the \\"ballast\\". If you pay full retail, that would be an additional $1400.00 in parts and service. Fortunately, some people are selling the lamps (without the housings) and ballast kits at way below repair shop prices. Even at that, this was a television which should have had a formal recall from Panasonic a long time ago.

We've owned this TV for ~3.5 years and have had to replace the lamp twice...at $285 each pop. WOW! I know what you're thinking...well, maybe they just watch a lot of TV. Not true. Even if we did watch for 6 hours per day, 365 days per year, a single lamp should still last about 4.5 years. We actually probably max out at about 2 hours per day roughly 4 days per week, which means we shouldn't have had to replace the first lamp until after ~24 years or so. Do yourself a favor...buy another product.Aside from the unacceptable lamp life, HD quality output was very good. Analog output was not nearly as good as other HDTVs that I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the hidden costs...replacing expensive bulbs frequently","review":"The TV is very nice but if you want one be prepared to replace the very expensive bulbs frequently. I believe the company has completely overstated the rated life of the bulbs. They claim an average of 10,000 hours, but from my own experience, and from what I've read on the net, the reality is more likely 1,000-2,000 hours. Do the math and you'll see that this set is a very poor choice overall.I normally don't review products, but I thought that in this case if I could prevent one poor, unsuspecting buyer from making a bad choice, it would be worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"3 strikes and you're out.

Waited two weeks for action from Panasonic. Waited one more from repair shop to schedule pick up. What can I say about this set? I can't say what I want to!!! 3 blown projection lamps in 1.5 years. Panasonic would not send me another lamp (nor would I allow then to) until the ballast board is replaced. Yes, I did take the extended warranty, but the down time for this set has been excessive and irritating. It will be in the repair shop for at least another week. All parts have to be authorized by Panasonic or Circuit City, and then shipped. Probably third class mail!! If a new ballast board does not fix the problem, I have a boat that needs an anchor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait to Buy this!!!!","review":"My tv was delivered 30 days ago and it has already broken!!! The bulb, which is suppossed to last 10,000 hours, has gone out. My husband did some research on-line and found lots of people complaining about this problem. The authorized repair facility is trying to find out from Panasonic if it's a problem with the bulb or a deeper problem with the tv. The picture is great and I would like to rate this a 5, but a $2700 tv that breaks after 30 days qualifies for a low score. In all fairness, I will update this once the problem is resolved. I just think we should have waited a year or two for them to resolve all issues before purchasing this item.We ended up exchanging the tv because Panasonic couldn't give us a time frame on the bulb.

The problem is, it breaks down as hobby. The lamps burn out well before their stated life, and in my case, so did the image engine -- twice. And the ballast. I was unable to get a replacement as a class action remedy because my warranty company, City Advantage, gave me no receipts for their many repairs. Run away from this television.

A recall would be a good start, and then reimbursing all of us who have had to shell out $300.00 for every bulb.Absolutely unacceptable!! Do not buy this tv. Other televisions will give just as good a picture without the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant bulb problems","review":"We've had this TV for less than two years and we just blew out the second bulb on it! At a cost of approx. $300 each, you would think they could figure out how to keep this from happening. Now I'm on hold to order the second one and the projected wait time is 60 minutes! Althought it does have some really cool features like being able to play video games on one side while still being to watch tv on the other, I still wish we would have never purchased this tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my TV but","review":"I really do love my Panasonic 50 inch projection LCD TV. I use all the connections except the DVI (3 video, 4 component, both RGB, and coax). But, I purchased it in September of 2003 with an extended four year warranty. The light bulb blew out after 3 months. The replacement bulb lasted 17 months before it blew out. The warranty program has covered the blub and replacement, but each time the TV is picked up and returned to the shop for repair. As I write this I am waiting for the TV to be returned to me.I hope the newer bulbs have a longer life as the current cost for the bulb is $300.00, and I want to keep this TV long after the extended warranty runs out."},{"rating":"1","title":"bulbs don't last","review":"The television set / monitor is great, but the bulb life is awful. I fortunatly purchased mine with a mastercard, and was able to double the warrenty on the television and the bulbs that I purchased (at $300 a pop). Even still, viewing TV can get really expensive in a hurry when you are blowing 2 per year. Eventually, after 7 bulbs, another componant died, and I realized that for the price of a couple bulbs I could get a big plasma and save all sorts of money.

But this bubbler was quite a bit different, and the cats didn't take to it. It's very large, more like you would expect for a dog water dispenser; we couldn't fit it on a kitchen counter like we had hoped, so it had to stay in the laundry room. Then I took it apart to run it through the dishwasher, and broke the hard plastic tube the air comes through. The break was right under the valve that dispenses water, so it wouldn't close properly and water overflowed. That's right, I managed to break the one part in just such a way to make the whole thing useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petmate Ultra Bubbler Watering System","review":"Bought 1, hole in bottom let water leak; bought 2 (returned 1st after trading the blue base) & the 'quick fix' was to burn the hole so plastic melts to create a seal.

WASTE OF MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relatively quiet, seems to work well","review":"It's not the most attractive pet fountain out there, but it works well enough. The first one that was delivered had a poorly molded plastic piece on the underside that leaked. However, I exchanged it and the new one works fine. It's not loud, just a soft bubbling in the background like any indoor fountain. I'm not sure if my cat will like it or not, but I felt like it was worth a shot. It seemed like a good price to try out a pet fountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the cats . . . and the humans!","review":"The Petmate Ultra Bubbler is well made. However, the bubbles scare our cats.

I use filtered water, so I didn't need the additional filter in the machine. Also, I used a Drinkwell in the past, and the water had tiny black flecks floating in it from the filter. I got this set up pretty easily, but saw right away that it bubbled too much. My cats would not go near it. There is soposed to be a knob at the back that turns the bubbles down, but mine would not turn. I finally tied a loose knot in the hose and it turned the bubbles down. However, whenever one of my cats tried to drink out of it, the bubbles popped in her face. So far none of my three cats have taken a drink from it. I'm returning it and using the Drinkwell without the filter, at least they were not afraid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too loud","review":"The pump was so loud, that I couldn't use it.

I do too since it is so much quieter than the previous one and cheaper too since it doesn't require filters. It is easier to clean since it doesn't have a lot of small spaces to try to get into.

My goal was to keep him out of the sink and tub... that hasn't worked completely, but I've seen an improvement. The knob that adjusts the level of the bubbling doesn't work too well so the bubbles are very small and too few. This is fine for my cat but others may want more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it; cat didn't like it.","review":"This is a great idea, but I think it might need more tweaking. The reservoir holds a lot of water, which is good, but there is no filter. So any cat hair, stray food, or whatever your 18-month-old might be trying to throw will end up in the bowl. Then it sits there, usually after sinking to the bottom, until you dig it out. Also, with mine at least, you had to fiddle with it and fiddle with it to get any real bubbles to appear. A shame, since the cat really did like the few bubbles I was able to coax out.If this somehow filtered the water AND made bubbles, I'd be all over it (like cat hair on a pastel couch)."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother - it won't bubble","review":"I bought and returned 3 of these in one week. The first one never bubbled, the second one bubbled for 10 mins and the third one bubbled for 3 minutes. The valve and hose attachment is poorly designed and cracks when the bubbler is assembled.

They would sit right in front of it and watch the water bubbling for minutes before playing with their paws, then they would drink from it. But the tubes crack very easily during cleaning and it's hard to clean the gunk that'll build up inside the glass tubes. In fact, the first unit came with already cracked tubes. I had to return it and was promptly sent another replacement. But as mentioned earlier, the tubes of my second unit cracked while I was disassembling the unit for cleaning. So I'm now running the unit with broken tubes. It still works fine, but the the gunk will still build up pretty quickly in the tubes, and the cats would refrain from drinking from it. I don't mind cleaning it weekly, but it is almost impossible to reach inside the tubes to thoroughly clean it. I'm considering buying a drinkwell fountain instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted to like this but cats got acne from it","review":"I was really excited about this cat fountain and it would have been perfect with it's huge reservoir and easy clean-up but unfortunately, 2 out of 3 of my cats developed cat acne on their chins from drinking from this fountain. I'm guessing it's the type of plastic as the Drinkwell fountains are definitely made from a different kind. It's real unfortunate as I love this fountain in every other way. I even tried wrapping the rim in aluminum foil to see if it would help but no luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected Better Quality :(","review":"I was hopeful that this product would serve its purpose but it gave out within two months of the day I purchased it.

It cost us $1300!We tried to contact the manufacturer to make them aware so that they could fix the problem and/or help pay our vet bill, but they just said it was my cats fault for swallowing the tube!This is a strong product liability case, but unfortunately pets are considered 'property' in the state of Georgia.PLEASE SAVE YOUR PET AND DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waterbowl leaked due to hole in base unit","review":"The base unit had a small hole in it and it leaks large puddles of water.

This book claims to be a practical step-by-step guide to teach you how to design web sites without tables using CSS, but it doesn't even come close. This book should be called \\"An overview of CSS with a special 200 pages of Reference Filler\\". I don't need another overview of CSS and I already have several good reference books.

Unfortunately the various chapters don't show how to actually use any of the knowledge its supposed to impart. For example, it'll show an example, and then display various extra code that it says should be \\"added\\" to the page. Added where? At the top? Bottom? Inserted inside a DIV tag? Which one?I can understand a book not having any concrete examples if its going to concentrate on the subject at a conceptual level, but it doesn't explain the concepts either. For example, in the section on positioning it doesn't say more than \\"absolute\\" means absolute, and \\"relative\\" means relative. That's nice, but doesn't leave me understanding any more how to actually design a page than I did before reading the chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and time","review":"Hate to be so critical, but this book is very irritating.

I am not and never have. But I thought John Case (with whom I share not only a given name, but a surname) was completely right here. But I agree with your review. John Case's novels are not only plot-driven (like all thrillers), but prose-driven: he (I think it is a man and wife team) really writes such crisp, engaging prose that it is hard to put the book down. Reminds one slightly of Stephen King--but King spoils it with his frequent bouts of pretty revolting descriptions. The plot of this book is formulaic; but what other author would treat you to the word \\"immured\\" and expect you to figure it out? Elizabeth George? Maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible","review":"Danny Cray (the hero of this piece) has to be the dumbest hero to stumble off the pages of fiction, and he manages to save the world in the last 30 pages of the book.Anyone with half a brain (Danny Cray obviously is not in this demographic) would have figured out he was being set up.

The ending is so contrived and ridiculous, I wondered if perhaps the authors had watched one too many Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis movies. It wasn't a total waste of time, though, as I found myself drawn deeper and deeper into it, despite the sloppy and amateurish writing. With better editing and some severe tightening up, \\"The Eighth Day\\" might've been a really good story. As it is, I would recommend reading their first novel instead, or something else altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unforgivable waste of my time and money","review":"I found this book to be unprofessional and boring. I could use other words to describe it but they wouldn't be fit for a public website like this. The main characters were unbelievable and pathetic. The plot was ridiculous.

While I'm sure even the author(s) wouldn't argue them as life-altering literature, they are fairly well written and original novels within a genre (thrillers) that by and large seems to have run out of steam. That being said, I can only hope that pressing bills and/or a pressing publication deadline was the cause for the massively bad \\"Eighth Day\\". While I could wax on about this or that particular problem, the overall fault in this book is what can only be termed a terribly weak premise and a plot that just fails to engage on every level. Plot points make no sense, the writing is stilted and formulaic and so on. Do yourself a favour...if you want a good little \\"escapist\\" read by John Case pick up \\"Genesis Code\\" or \\"The First Horseman\\".

I asked for this book for Christmas.However, I wish I had asked Santa (or Mr. Case) for something different.The nanotech \\"hook\\" is just that. The plot of this book has nothing to do with nano. If you want a nano-thriller, read \\"Prey\\" by Michael Crichton. Here, it was an afterthought. When it first crept into the story I eagerly anticipated the tie-in later on. It never happened. Forget the attempt to reel in nano-interested readers.I felt like I had gone on the \\"around the world\\" adventure with the protagonist, reluctantly. I hung on to the edge of this hopeful joyride, only to be shoved out of the plane after a somewhat abrupt landing, with not so much as a \\"thank you, come again\\" from the airstaff.All kidding aside, I will not recommend this book nor did I enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again","review":"Case (or whatever his real name is) once again is able to blend science and fiction and at he same time raise important issues about emerging technology.

The style is loose, fresh and spontaneous. The beautiful art works on each page take us from drawings to watercolors, from portraits to abstraction.

A word of good advice to those considering buying the video, if a video is too cheap to believe, always remember this, there is a reason why the video is inexpensive and that is usually it isn\`t worth even watching.

Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Road kill.","review":"The first person serial killer confessional has been done better. This attempt is not the best of the genre, nor is it the best Ellroy has to offer.Ellroy is at his best when he is weaving his fictional characters within and around real events and people with his intricate narrative noir styling. He briefly attempts this here, but to lesser and possible only token effect, it is the only recognizable Ellroy trait in the story.Ellroy is again at his best when he connects the dots of his narrative to reveal the true intricacies of the story at hand; unleashing the larger secret, revealing the final mystery.There is no secret here, no mystery; the picture is clear, the outcome known from the first. As a result the filler to get us from here to there becomes pedestrian, when it's not tedious and uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have a warning label","review":"This is one of the most unpleasant books I have ever read. Nowhere have I encountered a narrative depiction of the crimes and motivations of a serial killer more realisitc than KILLER ON THE ROAD. What worries me about this book is how realistic it is. I am sure that there are readers who are not revolted by the acts portrayed in this book, or worse, find them somehow amusing or exciting.

Beware before you read about fantasy-based serial killing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"Typically I enjoy James Ellroy. I have read several of his novels and two volumes of short stories (and essays). I was introduced to his work through The Blue Dahlia which I found so absorbing, I read it in one day. Therefore, I approached this volume with anticipation, knowing it would also be dark, thickly plotted, and possibly disturbing. While Ellroy isn't someone I'd care to read everyday, I do enjoy the time I have spent exploring the underbelly of 1950s LA. Until I read (or tried to read) Killer on the Road. This book is a disgusting exploration into the mind of a serial killer. I felt no empathy toward the protagonist and just kept asking myself why I was reading this and what was the point. I got through 90 pages and finally threw the book away--the first book I left unfinished since A Tale of Two Cities in high school nearly thirty years ago. (And I have probably averaged reading two books a week since that time.) My short, one word synopsis for this work: ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good - but possibly worth it for perspective on Ellroy","review":"Probably only worthwhile to offer readers perspective on one of America's greatest living writers, currently at the height of his powers (can he possibly get better?).Too long, repetitious, with unnecessary slaughter/clutter, silly at times and without surprise. If you're just getting into Ellroy, maybe - but only so you can later discern the massive heights this guy scales in AT and TC6000. But if you're looking around for the rest of the catalogue and found this re-badged re-issue, don't bother, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average book but poor by Ellroy standards","review":"Out of the 4 Ellroy books I have read, this one was by far the worst out of the group. It profiles a serial killer and is writeen as his autobiography. While it sounds like it could be an interesting story, it in fact is rather dull in many parts of the story. Supposedly the killer is very smart, but he doesn't come across as that way; instead he seems of average intelligence. Basically what seperates him from the common criminal is he isn't a complete idiot. Furthermore, he was a boring person. Sure, there was the occasional murder but other than that he just drives around the country. I strongly recommend saving your time and reading a different book by Ellroy; I'm pretty sure whichever one you choose instead will be more entertaining than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Already published a few years ago.","review":"Already published a few years ago during Ellroy \\"serial killer\\" period, this book make you follow a serial killer very closely, as if you were with him.

Even though the whole drama with Tobias and his heritage could go on forever and probably have its own series, this book goes into the inner workings of his mind as he's staring down the barrel of death. Obviously, Tobias is my favourite character and I'd love to see more books about him and his quest to find out who he is. K.A. did a wonderful job of utilizing characterization and letting us see what happened to Tobias in his past."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Tobias book","review":"This is the best Tobias book I have read so far. It shows what Tobias feels durring the book, unlike some Animorphs which are totally emotionless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best animorphs?","review":"This book is a definite must for any fans of Tobias and Animorphs. It reveals some bits of Tobias' pre-animorphs life, which was very intresting. I liked it because it wasn't a big battle book, it focused more on his feelings and thoughts and was very different from most Animorphs. The basic story is they are trying to make Visser 3 think his Anti-Morphing ray doesn't work so Tobias has to volunteer to be captured. When he is captured he is tortured, which is where the flashbacks part comes in, this part takes up most of the book. A lot of people were really pleased someone morphed Ax, but in my opinion this book didn't actually need that scene, it would have been great anyway. I can't choose between #3 and this one now as the best Animorphs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animorphs, 33 Review","review":"This book is about how the Animorphs try to destroy an evil device.Tobias has to acquire A's DNA.The bad thing is, the yeerks thought Tobias was an andelite.They try to make him demorph.There are many main characters, Ax, Rachel, Tobias, Jake, Cassie and Marco.They each have special things about each of the Animorphs. Cassie can morph the fastest.The conflict or problem for the main characters are the yeerks try to take control of the world.They have a device to try to make andelites and humans demorph.This would allow the Animorphs' secrets to be given up. How they resolved their conflict is that when Tobias got captured, his friends saved him.Then they completed the mission and left.

If the AMR worked, Tobias would morph back to hawk and the Yeerks would think that the ray was a failure. If the AMR didn't work, it wouldn't matter. What Tobias didn't plan for was that the Yeerk in charge (Taylor) would want to torture him to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"I loved the story, but it was not at all up to K.A. Applegate's usual standard. It was frankly dissapointing.First of all, Tobias is not really himself. He just dosen't seem like the usual Tobias. Maybe that's just because this is the first book I read from Tobias's point of view. Maybe not.Second, the ending of the story is really much different than the normal. In fact, I thought it was worse. It seems that no one but Tobias plays any key role in the story.I say: If you want to read a REALLY good book, look elsewhere. But if you have a few hours to waste, go for it. I suggest not buying it, but checking it out from a library to see if you really like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea/premise....Bad execution.","review":"When I read the back cover of this book I was so excited! I love the paranormal romance subgenre and was looking forward to adding a new series to my reading list.Alas, I was sadly disappointed in this book. It was trite and boring. The characters had no depth and there was no flow or development of things. The protagnonist goes from being captured and threatened-into-submission to embracing her new job as a means to make her life count...all this in like 2 paragraphs??? WTF?!Also there were strange inconsistencies. The author goes through this whole long spiel about how uncommonly intelligent and clever the protagnonist is...IQ off the chart and all that jazz, but then literally in the next breath she is hunted, caught, coerced, and controlled with nary a hair out of place by her pursuers. Odd.Even stranger...there's a sequel to this mess??? No thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bittersweet tale of love--reminds me of early LKH","review":"Much of this novel follows the usual vampire mythos that we all know, but there is a touch here of bittersweet sadness that gives this lead female character a little more depth than our usual all in control vamp-about-town. Our female lead actuallyfeels the downside of immortality and the loss of friends and lovers as they pass through the natural life cycle. When she has a chance to either \\"turn\\" or watch one more beloved friend pass away, she intervenes.

Like I could have turned to any late night cable network on tv and found the same dribble. I bought the book because it had promise. A team of vampires to take down terrorist has promise, but it ended up with sugar coated plastic dolls fluffing their way through what should have been serious problems. The really bad part was the fact that all the characters really cared about was getting laid. I mean really, the sillyness of rubbing her foot up and down the attractive man's calf is old, overdone, and overripe (i.e. it stinks)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential but no follow-through","review":"This book makes one of the classic mistakes - instead of showing the reader about the characters through their actions, the author tells the reader. That was one of the distracting things about this book - the dialogue didn't match the actions. So, we have a genius vampire heroine who spends more time thinking about what she's going to wear to a meeting than what's going on in the mission to which she's been assigned. She's an ex-ninja that never does a single martial arts move. Instead, she continually resorts to brute strength. I, like a previous reviewer, was frustrated with her interaction with her love interest. She keeps telling him she has to be equal in the relationship but she never acts like one - again telling instead of showing. She jeopardizes her own mission in order to help out his, not even knowing what his goal was.On the plus side, it is an interesting concept and does show promise...if the heroine ever starts using that genius IQ."},{"rating":"1","title":"I regret reading it","review":"As a knowledgeable reader of Anne Rice and Laurell K. Hamilton and others similar, I was so dissapointed in this book that I regret even finishing it, and that's not something I say often. The plot is very thin and predictable, the characters shallow, and it's so obvious that the author has more experience writing tear-jerking romance novels than action ones. She's using modern themes like terrorism to make it more interesting, but appears to know about it as much as a 12-year old who watched half a season of Alias. And as a beginner in the genre, she should know better than to dare use a prestigious character, Louis from Interview with a Vampire, then make a mockery of him, call him a \\"creep\\", and let him die with no honor.

The romance was pretty hokey. Lots of graphic sex -- these books are targetted to women right? Don't complain to me anymore about guys and porn...The author has her own unique vampire lore, with vampires having reflections, but still vulnerable to stakes and crosses. Vampires can have kids, and when they do, the kids are human. Vampires turn into giant bats, something more like a demon or gargoyle in my mind.

But, if you are, you'd probably have a powered subwoofer - or should get one. These speakers were an amazing price for a Northridge Series and great sound. I would recommend them to anyone. I have thought about replacing all of my surround speakers with these as I am using them as my main pair to save space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great outdoor speaker","review":"This was a staight replacement for an old pair that had lasted over 8 years outside in the Florida climate.

Given then they are bookshelf speakers I was not expecting concert hall quality, but they produced a tinny sound with weak top and bottom ranges.

I returned them the next day.I had always been pleased with JBL products, but these speakers do not meet the traditional standards of JBL products."},{"rating":"2","title":"JBL Northridge Bookshelf Speakers","review":"They sound good but not like REAL JBL's.They are good for the Money and look pretty good too as I am using them inside for a small home theater system.They are more of an off-white as compared to a bright white.Mounting brackets worked out well and seem pretty sturdy.The speakers themselves seem pretty well constructed too considering the cost.Recommended but dont expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"faerie music","review":"While I am a great fan of Robin Huw Bowen on the Welsh triple harp, this album disappoints. Crasdant appears to eschew any depth of feeling or drive that I associate with good Celtic music. The absence of bass tends to give the music a busy, spritely feel which I have dubbed \\"faerie music\\". Reminiscent of sessions, the pieces have a repetitive and unimaginative feel which leads one to wonder why noone bothered to make thoughtful arrangements. Mr. Bowen can do better than this and his associates, excellent musicians all, should rally to produce a more varied and unique sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Finally Out!","review":"It's official!

I enjoyed seeing old friends and seeing what they had been up too. I was a little disappointed because I expected the story to move forward more like the other books, to complete a larger step in the whole war rather then just such a small part. Having emailed Mr. baldwin before and conversing with him, i know his busy timeline does not lend much to more adventures for Wilf and Friends. I will hope that he completes the story and the adventure soon as it would be a shame to not know how Wilf and his friends make out. Lets hope we dont have to wait even another 5 years til then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SOUND","review":"These babies make up for the lack of low end with pure clarity. All you need to suppliment these units with is a 12 powered sub with a crossover at 100Hz. Using measuring equipment, I found the response to be VERY flat for sub $5,000 speakers. You can always get better, but you run into diminishing returns on the price. I still can't get over how good they sound when I'm playing \\"Eagles: hell Freezes Over\\" and \\"Dire Straits: Brothers in Arms\\"I picked mine up for a $100 each, and would have been willing to pay much more than that. I 4 star them as I find they don't have the sub 100Hz performance required for a 2.0 system. It plays it, but without authority."},{"rating":"1","title":"great technique bereft of musicianship","review":"If you know this music well, either from recordings or, better yet, playing it, the strengths and failures of Lang's performances are obvious. He possesses a wonderful digital dexterity; he can play complicated, dense scores with real technical mastery. And in Liszt, for example, this works reasonably well. Yet, in contrast to Liszt, as Arthur Schnabel remarked, in Viennese classical music -- say Schubert and Haydn -- playing the notes in time is only ten percent of what's required to realize the music's potential. The pianist needs to sing his way into the heart of the score. Lang's failure, at this early stage in his career, is a failure to grasp the inner voices of pieces like Scubert's Wanderer Fantasy, performing a showy razzle dazzle instead of the profound song Schubert wrote. He has the raw talent to do this. Does he have the heart and imagination? Time will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Wanderer Fantasy EVER?","review":"I can't believe the positive reviews this recording has gotten. Don't believe the hype folks; Lang Lang may have technique to burn, but most 1st-year conservatory students possess at least the same interpretive depth, if not more. When he isn't indulging himself in interpretive excess, then Lang Lang is playing as if he really doesn't care much at all.His Schubert is garbage. Let him stick to playing Chinese compositions unknown to Western audiences, because virtually none of us will have any way of drawing comparisons between his interpretation and that of others. I can only assume that his interpretation of Dun Tan is the definitive version --- but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what the picture says it is","review":"I bought these because the picture shows a box that is NOT those crappy Ecstasy condoms/Sensations condoms where they felt a need to balloon the tip so you feel like you're using a garbage bag.

Don't order these if you don't want garbage bag condoms."},{"rating":"2","title":"A four star album","review":"A lush and melodic dub album. A four star album. If you are interested in dub music, there are far worse places to start. Pablo throws around a lot of ideas and really succeeds in his ventures, into spare rhythmic numbers, and into fusions that sound like precursors to funk and even modern styles of rnb and hip hop. The volume and echo effects are fine studio touches, if you're into such details of dub music. They add a variation, i daresay, a dimension, to the rhythm of a song. And the recording sounds great (except one of the later tracks). Sample the mp3s somewhere and pick it up. This music should be heard by many more people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three good software titles for a small price","review":"This pack contains three software games for preschoolers: Bear's Imagine That (with characters from Bear in the Big Blue House), I Spy Junior (based on the I Spy books), and JumpStart Preschool.My daughter loves all three games.

However, it is not at all what I needed when I ordered it, and the title is misleading since it does not tell you that virtually all of the recipes are foreign.I needed a book that would help me with recipes for church dinners.

By the way Brian was signing, to you personally, his Sled Driver books for a paltry $35. My friend who is also a plane nut , got one too. My treat. I also got his second book by mail from him for the same price. He is a great guy who answers his own phone and takes your order himself. He is also very funny.

And when I first opened it I thought it was nice but then as I started to unpack it I changed my mind. First of all everything was plastered together by small hunks of white tape that didn't really come off so your left with a sticky blob on each item. The colander has plastic handles (can't imagine those would last long if actually used for pasta). The pasta was a small bag of standard shells. None of the glass bottles (olives, oil and pepper flakes) had any kind of seal on them. Just screw the top off and there ya go. When I opened the olives the inside of the cap had what looked like a little bit of mold (so did the oil). Of course I packed it back up and promptly returned it.

It was just plain boring. There is no stage energy to start with. And the songs are not catchy by any means. If it wasn't for the bass player and the outstanding drummer, you'd think they were mere robots. I will admit that after watching bands like Nickelback and Shinedown some standards get set in your head, but come on, even Keith Urban puts on 10x the show with unique and catchy songs to boot. Save your money and watch the videos on youtube. Even the mere $7 I spent on this as my \\"night out\\" left me feeling cheated of my time more than money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously evocative and creepy.","review":"Ironically, I obtained this book thinking it was a historical account of Captain Cook's progeny, based on a hastily-read (although positive) review of it in Outside magazine. However, despite not being a fan of contemporary fiction, I was immediately swept up in the deliciously woven prose: contemplative, evocative, personal, and mysterious. Its imagery entranced and lulled (but not bored!) me in its depiction of a Hawaii both exotic and yet accessible, while the seedy underbelly of its mystical and tragic plot slowly and deliberately unfolded. Although it seems incogruous for a gothic novel to be set in a tropical paradise, Daughters of Captain Cook is a compelling, nearly seamless read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash -- Burn this book","review":"This book tries to pass itself off as an examination of the culture and heritage of the Hawaiian people and instead uses gratuitous sex and abuse of power as the example of cultural relationships. And, the plot is NOT furthered through this method. It evokes no sympathy for ANY character. There is nothing to be gained by reading this book, and if I could have entered this review without choosing using the star system, that certainly would have been the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I always look for books on how to take care of curly hair because, well, I have it! This book was helpful within the first three pages but went downhill from there. They're were no pictures, models or hair-y stories from the author. Overall, I just didn't like it. I thoroughly recommend \\"No Lye\\" or \\"Curly Girl\\" instead of this...just horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is Really Bad!!","review":"If I could give this book a negative rating, I would! First, the title is deceiving. A more appropriate title should be \\"Very Basic Information About Black Hair\\". It gives no real useful information about hair care or recommendations on products, which is what we are all looking for. The hair chemistry chapter is very detailed (must have been the only chapter written by the author who has an MD) and should not have taken up an entire section. Chapters 3 and 4 are all about skin with no information about hair. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Title Very Deceiving!","review":"The title of this book is very deceiving. It should be titled \\"Very Basic Information About Black Hair\\" since the author spends more time discussing black hair chemistry. There's no information about products or what to really look for in a product for natural black hair care. Interestingly enough, chapters 3 and 4 are all about skin care even though hair is mention in the chapter title. Also, the author's solution to hair loss is the addition of artificial hair rather than recommendations on products to use. Again, the title is very deceiving. This is NOT the book to purchase if you are looking for information on caring and working with natural black hair. It is indeed a horrible book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad review","review":"Yes this another bad review for this book. I was lucky that I was able to look through the book in the store before purchasing it. So I didn't end up wasting money on a book that wasn't helpful. I was looking for a book to give me simple hairstyles for natural hair that a hair novice would be able to do. The majority of the styles were for people with weaves or extensions. There were a few styles for people with short hair. However if you are in between lengths and don't want to put in a weave you were out of luck.

The book does a whole lot of \\"telling\\" and very little \\"showing.\\" It is thin on scenes and action and instead offers a litany of summarizations. I only finished the thing because Ungar's life, no matter how it is rendered, captivates.There is very little artful story telling in this book. I am surprised Mcmanus endorsed it. He had do have done so with reservations as the man understands writing.A good editor would have pushed this work further. It's a lackluster telling of a riveting life.The research seems solid, and the book is better than nothing.

Where this book really shines is the section on neo-Confucianism, and how the two blended together.Good, insightful read. Perfectly fine for someone not too familiar with the topic (such as myself.) 4 stars for the plates not being all that well explained, as the book fails to explain the changes in the Buddhist art that it has pictures of."},{"rating":"1","title":"readable yet hardly interesting","review":"Sadly speaking, most books about Chinese literature written in English can hardly provide a thorough and in-depth understanding of Chinese literature, and this book is no exception. Most of its content is uninteresting, not illuminating, and its written style not attractive. In all, this is a pretty dull and prosaic work from the viewpoint of a native Chinese teacher in Chinese literature such as I am. However, among all works written in English about Chinese literature, this book is still in comparison less faulty and erroneous, less scanty in reading materials. So for any foreigner who only wants to get a preliminary understanding of Chinese literature, I would still recommend this book as a not too bad start, that is why I still use this book as the textbook to teach students from U.S."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book for background","review":"The world is interesting, but the character might be more interesting. Unfortunately he travels across the world and among several different elements of society somewhat passively. We start with him gambling, see a few of his observational insights, and we end with him leaving a gambling table (though not as interesting as the first scene), but the rest of the time our hero is more of a reluctant fighter and sexual opportunist than a gambler. His travels become the excuse to put the world on display. Tension between the classes of society are built up but unresolved. In what passes for adventure our hero keeps pulling off snap shots and escaping, traveling once again to another part of the world until some crisis moves him on. The conclusion of this book must be in the sequel because it was not in this one... but I don't care to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot recommend","review":"I have purchased several sets of these glasses.

It's unfortunate that so many people want a quick fix and think they will get it from a two-hour read. When you are led to believe that, it is even more harmful upon discovering that it doesn't work that way. Serious books like Speaking of Sadness by David Karp or Undoing Depression by Richard O'Connor or Darkness Visible by William Styron do not show up on shows with the authors performing acrobatics or knocking over blocks labeled with tough problems by using a baseball bat or bowling ball.

I'm going through some personal changes and thought that this book would lead to some inspiration for me to conquer those changes. Wrong!! This book is filled with mindless drivel (basically affirmations) that is less than inspring.

I felt that I was reading the same paragraph over and over, reworded a bit so it would pertain to the chapter title. When I got to the part about filling my love tanks, I wanted to throw the book in the trash but decided to tough it out. I skimmed the balance of the book trying to find something worthwhile, but to no avail. Perhaps Oprah should start reading the books she pushes. If you want to learn how to appreciate yourself, good and bad, try The Dark Side of the Light Chasers. Unless you like drivel about your love tanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"His earlier books on Mars-Venus are superior","review":"After enjoying Gray's Mars Venus titles, I expected more of that good interpersonal stuff. This was disappointing. Too much new age and Eastern meditation. Thought that went out in the '70's. Bring back vintage John Gray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I have read other John Gray books and have found them wonderful - I usually instantly connect with what he is saying. I was disappointed with this book and couldn't buy into it since his message was so different. The discussions on meditation and religion just seemed so out of place and even though I consider myself to be religious (a Christian), they didn't appeal to me at all. Maybe I got caught off-guard with this one, but I don't want to keep this book on my bookshelf, let alone recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed My Life!","review":"This book is powerful.

I saw him at an all-day seminar called Results 2000. I don't know why they chose him as a speaker. Most of the speakers said something helpful, something practical. John Gray had us all hold our hands in the air until our fingers tingled. He said it was \\"healing energy\\" we were feeling. Now that our hands were charged with healing energy, we could heal other people or ourselves by putting our hands on those people. He asked us to chant this strange incantation over and over. It was creepy. The guy is in outer space. If you want to read something helpful, don't waste your time here.The time I spent with Self-Help Stuff That Works by Adam Khan (Youme Works; ISBN: 0962465674) was far better than this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Useless","review":"I was shocked at how bad this CD was. I absolutely loved Mars & Venus so I tried this one. First off he is just talking in a monotone voice that is very boring. It's impossible not to think about other stuff. He doesn't give any useful information, just dances around stuff leaving you confused. The meditation stuff was so lame I about quit right in the middle of the program. Gray struck gold with Mars & Venus but I'm afraid with Get What You Want he struck rock bottom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless Dribble","review":"The title is very misleading. It tells you nothing about getting what you want or wanting what you have, and it is by no means a \\"practical\\" anything. The author speaks of some ridiculous \\"love vitamins\\" (e.g., Vitamin G is for God) and then babbles about some \\"love tanks\\" we all have that we have to keep filled. Then he goes on to chronicle how people act at certain ages and what they need at each age. This is as far as I got before deciding this book was a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for people that take reading seriously","review":"I own this book and picked it up because of the title.The book is not useful, had absolutely no impact in my life.

I've read a lot of self-help books on how to attain success through various steps, but this one truly addresses what it takes to get what you want. I learned that life's not about getting more and more -- it's about appreciating what you have and also making it okay to go for more. It tells how to break through emotional blocks, something that I saw John Gray do on his Oprah Personal Success series that aired in the Fall. If a person puts into practice what Dr. Gray suggests, good results will happen, I have no doubt. It's already happening in my life. This is no doubt the best investment in a book that I've ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have: A Practical and Spiritual Guide to Personal Success","review":"I purchased this book for a very specific piece of content.

This clock must have had a short or something, because it caused the battery to overheat and explode. I had the battery in (in the correct orientation) for less than 5 minutes -- when I went back to check and see if the clock had set itself yet, I heard crackling, smelled something funny, and turned it around to notice the cover to the battery was melted. I had to pry out the sizzling/bubbling battery with a plastic spoon and leave it outside because of the acid leaking out of it. Needless to say, it was immediately returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't keep correct time","review":"This was a replacement for the same model I've had for years, but this one seems to have a hard time locking in on the correct time - it was 15 minutes behind for the first several days. Happened when first setting it up, then it seemed to work for several months, but recently it went back to being 15 minutes behind, and today I noticed it was 7 minutes behind. So, even a mental correction I might apply to it is not reliable because it changes. I like the visibility - it's great for the back yard - but I don't think I'll buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not an outdoor clock","review":"This model is appanently the same as the cheaper WT-3181P.

With 5 of these, it gives a good basis for the problems involved.We followed the instructions and after the initial battery installation, they all held at 4:00 waiting for the signal. Once they received it, 3 ended up at the same time, while 2 were off by several minutes.The clocks initially set themselves to Pacific Time and then needed to be set to Eastern.For the 3 that ended up at the same time, let's say 7:35, when pressing the ET button on back, one ends up at 10:35 (properly) and the other 2 end up at 10:31 and 10:16. This has nothing to do with an improper signal, as these 3 had the same initial time. The control board inside is bad in multiple units.We ended up continuing to use our old manual clocks...we were better being a minute or two off over having random clock times.It is not a signal distance issue as we also purchased 3 digital ones and those all work fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than expectation","review":"it worked immediately, it picked up the atomic clock signal and quickly adjusted to the correct time. it is a great size, easy to read face"},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"Clock arrived within 2 days or order.

Every time the clock got to an even numbered hour it searched for the time signal and drastically changed time. The closest it got was about 40 minutes from the correct time. So, I tried to manually set the time. It held until it reached an even numbered hour, and then started the search mode again. Useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK","review":"It seemed this would be the perfect clock for my patio,a large face,the correct color,the radio control was a bonus. Actually the \\"atomic\\" feature is a curse. The clock is located outside. It never recieved a signal. The instructions for manually setting is wrong. I was ready to call help line,,,,(an 800 number to set a clock?????)I tried several more times to set it manually,finally success.I was pretty jazzed,the next day the clock was off an hour,I reset it,and the next day I found it off again. I'll reset it again and if it screws up again I may replace the innerds,(a word?)with a traditional movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Displayed incorrect time","review":"I bought this item as a gift. Before giving I wanted to set it up for the recipient. I followed the instructions and had it working briefly. Once wrapped, I heard the hands cycling quickly around the clock (as if searching for the correct time). I unwrapped it and called for tech support. They offered some options, mostly changing the battery. Once done with that it began running at the proper speed, but was off by 3 hours (for every time zone). I'm done with this hassle and returning to amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clock finally working","review":"I highly anticipated a clock that gave me great time and minimal fuss to get it going. Truth be told the clock is finally keeping perfect time but took exactly six days of manipulation and teasing to get it to work properly. No matter what I did( and I did everything recommended by the booklet) nothing worked. The clock had a mind of its own. Even though the clock was pointed west with no obstructions it would not set itself correctly. It started out by being an hour slow and after numerous days and re- settings finally adjusted itself by some miracle to the correct time. It would have been helpful if I could have made contact with the company but after leaving five messages with them I gave up. Eventually two weeks later they returned my calls saying that they had a computer malfunction and weren't able to service my call. Anyway, the clock is working perfectly but the aggravation definitely wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atomic clock","review":"Received clock and installed battery and within 30 minutes it picked up the signal and has been working perfectly.

Unfortunately, the clock did not work. It was unable to find a signal in any location, despite a new battery. When set manually according to the directions, it did not keep time, even after several attempts. Very frustrating - we are returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No manual time reset","review":"This radio controlled time set clock worked fine for the first nine months then began going nuts. Apparently for some reason it no longer was able to pick up the time signal from Colorado. We tried several locations without success. As per the training video the hands would start going around in circles, stopping after about 5 minutes, trying to reach the radio signal from Colorado but never able to locate it.Logically one would assume that as a default position, we at least could set the time manually. Hard to believe, but this is not possible!!Now its just an expensive piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"This clock is great looking, the perfect size for outdoors and well insulated but we could not get it to keep time. We tried the manual and automatic setting. We went to the makers website and tried everything they suggested without success. After 2 1/2 weeks of trying we finally gave up and sent it back. We didn't want to do that because we loved everything else about the clock. But, after all what good is a clock that doesn't keep time? Unless you live in the Pacific time zone, I wouldn't waste my money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if using outside","review":"I purchased this for use on my patio as it says it is an indoor/outdoor. However, when reading the instruction manual it says that it is NOT water resistant and should only be used outside where it will be dry. So unless you are living in the middle of the Mojave Desert, I would find another option. It was returned immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atomic Clock","review":"The clock itself is beautiful. Unfortunately it does not keep accurate time and that is why I am giving it two stars. It is 33+ minutes off. We tried fresh batteries, setting by the window, etc. and when it finds its WWVB signal, it is still 33+ minutes off. I would send back but unfortunately I do not have the original packaging to return it in. I've called the La Crosse Product Support Help number twice and an answering service takes a message stating someone technical will call back and to date, no one has returned our calls to try and help. The website did not provide any help either. So, it is a $49.99 manual set clock. It's a shame. I could have bought a cheaper/bigger manual set clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good clock but not packaged well","review":"The clock itself is great, looks modern and works like it should. The problem is that the manufacturer only covers one side of the clock with the box, leaves the glass and 1/2 of the other side open, so I had to return the first one because it arrived with the glass shattered. The second one was scratched on the one side that was not covered with packaging. I kept it because I needed a clock and didn't feel like dealing with a second return...it's not so bad when you look at it from far away in a yard, but if you are looking for perfection, just be forewarned. Overall, for the price, I guess you can't be too picky, it's a very good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"outdoor clock","review":"This is a great clock for a very good price.

Would recommend it to everyone!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm happy","review":"This clock is much better compared to anything I saw even at higher prices in several local retailers like Target and KMart. Note the case on this version is plastic, unlike the more expensive La Crosse that is metal. I decided to go with the plastic since I live in South Florida. The plastic case has a very well done silver painted finish and it could very well be mistaken for metal. I have the clock mounted on the wall of my outside covered patio. The clock face is bold and distinctive and very visible even from 30 feet away when standing in my yard.I had absolutely no problem with the clock picking up the atomic time signal. It did not set right away, even after a few hours. But this is normal based on my experience with another signal based time keeping device I have. (Atmospheric conditions, influenced by the time of day, affect reception of the time signal.) The next morning my clock was showing the correct time. I've had the clock for a month and its been keeping perfect time."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of La Crosse 18 inch outside clock","review":"Excellent product.

The Zen material Spider and Jeanne explored in the first novel is so rich and mesmerizing that they can be forgiven for returning to it again and again. Starmind offers new insights about many different kinds of freedom -- intellectual, spiritual, physical and artistic. Spider and Jeanne also make a very good case against the world-is-going-to-hell pessimism of our ficton, arguing that real enlightenment, or at least a lightening-up, may be just around the corner. Still, as in Starseed, I was disappointed at how many of the previous plotlines seemed recycled from the original story without further exploration.

General Doolittle was a great American, a patriot, a person that believed in taking care of family first. He wasn't perfect mind you but this poor kid from the streets of Los Angeles would grow to become one the foremost inspirational stories of the colossal beginning of the Second World War with the famed \\"30 Seconds over Tokyo\\" raid that would change the beaten morale of a nation at war.

The picture it paints of God the Father trying to find a bride for His Son and choosing a woman who had \\"potential\\" does not agree with God's Word. He chose me when I was utterly dead and lost in my sins. There was no potential there, but He chose me anyway.God the Father is also said to be waiting helplessly for His own bride, \\"Rachel\\", who is described as His Son's \\"mother\\" to return to Him. The God of the Bible does not sit around waiting, wringing His hands and wishing things would happen (and Israel is not Jesus' Mom). Arthur is no John Bunyan; her attempt at allegory is just plain awkward.If you want to read a really great metaphor of God's love for Israel, and Christ's love for the church, I would recommend you leave this one on the shelf and read the Book of Hosea instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"a parable","review":"Christianna, the heroine of this novel, is engaged to Joshua, who has left her for some indefinite period of time, with the fervent promise to return.

What happens then is the greatest surprise and miracle of all.I simply love this book. It is a most beautiful portrayal of God's faithful love for the most sinful human being, and it is also a metaphor for the believer's struggles in this world, where sometimes it seems the Lord's second coming is delaying beyond our endurance.Joshua's love brought me a clearer idea of Jesus' love for me (and also reminded me of my husband).This is a beautiful, christian, profound book.

Then, when they actually startedrecording semi properly, they were filled with snow, in some cases to where the picture was barely visible, andreally could not be watched and enjoyed. That will be the ONE and ONLY time, I ever purchase this brand. The quality isabsolutely terrible. Every other brand I have ever used, has worked much, MUCH better than these.

But it's the NightHawk readings that are the most fun. Imagine...what if Dorothy had sought the Tarot for advice on how to get off the farm? Or what if Dr. Jekyll sought advice on how to get rid of Mr. Hyde? It stirs your imagination, and, I'm learning, imagination is the key you need to unlock insight on your own Tarot deck.

However, with affordability comes compromise; there is no working headlight on this model, which if on here, probably would have added to the cost. Still, it has a good amount of power and will look great on your N Scale layout. The paint scheme on this model is slightly garish, though...maybe on a larger scale it wouldn't look so bad.

We had many complements on set-up and presentation of the buffet tables, some of our guests (275 in all) were surprised we didn't have it professionally catered.

In 1975?!","review":"The proposed menus and arrangements in this book look like something from the Brady Bunch wedding. The recipes are a throw-back to an earlier time of cocktail wieners on toothpicks.

If you are under the age of 50, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay - if you just want to feed your guests","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. The recipes lack imagination and creativity. I would put them in a \\"potluck\\" category. As mentioned by other reviewers, the authors assume you have a staff of volunteers who can assist before, during, and after the reception. Although they make suggestions on how to arrange a buffet, they don't offer much as far as presentation is concerned so that it doesn't LOOK like a do-it-yourself job. If you are having a casual or informal wedding reception and have LOTS of people to help, then this book may be useful to you. If your goal is to have a formal or elegant wedding, or if you want to have your friends and relatives to actually ENJOY your wedding, then you should pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre recipes using too much mayonnaise","review":"I got this book because I am doing some of the food for my wedding and wanted some large quantity recipes. There aren't that many recipes to choose from and they weren't particularly innovative or good looking. Doing baked beans out of the Van Camp's Pork n' Beans cans isn't my idea of good food. That said, if you are just completely lost but want to do your own food this book basically does all the planning for you- provided that you have enough people to pull it all off.

Unlike one of the previous reviewers, I'm not looking for complicated, spend-a-week-trying-to-understand-the-directions recipes (what the heck is fusion cooking anyway???). What I want to serve my guests is delicious food that's presented beautifully and elegantly and that won't send the people who have volunteered to help me with my reception into apoplectic fits.

I especially like the variety of reception styles and food choices - I plan to mix and match a few of the menu items.

If nothing else, I learn a new routine or two, or a useful tip.However, I learned nothing from this book; the author somehow latched onto his idea of a better way to lift, and offers it with no technical or third-party support for its usefulness. I tried the techniques and found them of no real value. There is a good reason for this: in my opinion, the ideas advanced in this book are useless.I am not one to go out of my way to cause problems for others, but my sincere advice is to purchase books by other authors, whose insights are the result of great experience, their own education in this field, and are improved by the input of their peers. This book does none of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Book, Old Method","review":"This book is essentially supersets...check out some of the Weider publications and you'll find they essentially contain almost 100% of what Staley claims as new information. Better, do some creative googling and you'll find all of the necessary information on a couple of websites.In addition, the book provides a substantial amount of misinformation. For example, he recommends explosive reps for building muscle (research has shown for hypertrophy vs. strength) you need controlled, heavy weights that range between 8 - 12 reps.Best, google on Mark Berry and discover the \\"Da Vinci\\" of weight training...the man who truly wrote \\"the book\\" on weights and bodybuilding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Effective","review":"... and intense. I just started training with this method and immediately became a huge fan. The workouts are only 15 minutes long the first few weeks, but they are very effective. Plus, they really tax the cardiovascular system, so they're great for the heart as well.In general, you alternate two exercises for opposing muscle groups, starting with sets of 5 reps and doing as many sets as possible in the time frame. Every workout is a competition to beat the number of reps you did last time. So, it's great for stoking the competitive fires during training.I'm only 3 weeks into this program and I can already feel and see the changes in my body. And this is after working out seriously for two years now on other methods.I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for fitness exercise, would like a few more references for serious weightlifters","review":"I would highly recommend this book for people simply interested in exercising for overall fitness, but I wouldn't recommmend it for the serious weightlifter. Overall, I thought the concepts in this book were pretty good, and from reading other reviews it seems that people are having good results using this new approach to weight lifting. My only complaint is that the author made some rather bold statements without citing references, and while I don't doubt his sincerity, I would have liked to have seen references cited for some of them. For me, the biggest example of this was when he stated that the number of reps a person does per set (ie- low reps for strength, higher reps for mass or muscle tone) is not as important as doing as many reps as possible with as much weight as possible in a 15 minute period. This may be true for people exercising solely for fitness, but a powerlifter or bodybuilder would disagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so satisfied","review":"I've not tried the system yet, but on the book there is not any scientific reference or any exhaustive explanation about what he is writing on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jargon Filled & Confusing","review":"I read the first three chapters of this book and could not follow it.

I have them mounted outdoors under an overhang pointed toward a patio area. They produce a full sound with good base throughout the area. Mounting was a little problematic. Unfortunately, the speakers did not come with any mounting hardware and buying the kit separately was a bit expensive. I couldn't find a good description or picture of the mounting hardware so I wasn't sure if it would have helped much. A little ingenuity should get the job done. There are some bolt holes and attachment points you can use. My only concern is with the weather resistant qualities. Appearance may be deceiving but visibly they don't seem to have any special weather proofing. Even though I have them mounted under the roof overhang they will get a good dose of wind blown moisture, so I'll have to wait and see. They have been up a month so far and continue to perform great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good speaker but. . .","review":"Bought these off of tech reviews.

Tacky CG aside, the acting is sub-par and the plot is full of holes and never seems totally cohesive. You'll find yourself asking, \\"Why are there malls or car dealerships in purgatory?\\" or \\"How long have they been driving down that bridge?\\" Character development isn't great, either, with an older, wise, black man doing what older, wise black men do in these films and a Japanese character who looks more Latino than anything else.It's the kind of film you and your buddies might rent for laughs (you get to see the main character fight one of those tiny, plastic, pink-haired trolls on more than one occasion), but I can virtually guarantee that it's not worth paying $25 or more for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Dictionary","review":"The book is in very good condition.

The customer service person I spoke to told me I should dry clean it - but it's cotton and should be washable, and I don't dry clean anything (chemicals, expensive, etc). The second person I spoke to told me I should be able to get it in and that it can take 3 people to stuff it in and zip it up. Eventually, I finally got the whole thing re-stuffed into the cover and zipped but it was really hard to do.

Dolores Cannon has the ability to make complex concepts understandable.In these Volumes on Nostradamus, the translations of the quatrains are from the Master himself. If you need to be convinced, just read the passages regarding the Bush-Gore elections.

In the books, he communicates through Cannon's hypnotically regressed subjects, and says he arranged these contacts to explain to us the true meaning of his quatrains, because many of them pertain to our time. The prophecies described in these books are in alignment with others (Mary Summer Rain, Cayce, etc) but they go further and offer profound insight into the spiritual realm and into the cataclysmic events about to take place in our world.

The author also provides new information on some facets of Buddhism that was touched on only briefly in his earlier book Insight Meditation, such as: reflections on impermanence; why our morality is the reason that no one need fear us; that the aim of meditation is to be aware of thoughts, not never having any thoughts; and the path to liberation is through nonclinging to delusion. The book is a good companion text to Insight Meditation, but is structured in traditional chapters, so it is not as easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!

It talks about flying saucers, anti-gravity projects and general pseudo-science. I enjoy reading these mindless books, but the author really needs to have an English speaking person proof read these before publishing. I also find it amazing how many mis-spelled words and odd paragraphs are in here. I know the author is not a native English speaker, so you would think someone that is would read this and edit it properly. Has some interesting pictures of the Nazi saucer mythos and all as well. Some drawings and photocopies of texts. Good if you are interested in this stuff and I have added to my collection, but all of these books would have more credibility if they had more polished editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"skinny puppy no more","review":"this cd does not appeal at all to old sp fans like myself. it is techno-oriented and too rappy. where is the dark mood and brutal, distorted lyrics? save your money and buy something else instead, like mentallo & the fixer"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Album Is Great","review":"All of these people compaining about the album are just mad because Skinny Puppy isn't making a bunch of crazy noise and have quit using analog equipment. Most of them like an old school sound found in Industrial music in the 80's. Hence all of the talk about raw and abrasive sounds. SP are constantly evolving. Bands like Velvet Acid Christ, Ministry, and Nine Inch Nails are trying to keep things in the past or are trying to go back to a signature sound. I love the new Skinny Puppy album because they're are continuing what they always do. They're doing something different. People are talking about his lyrics being annoying. I don't see that. It sounds like the vocals on his Ohgr releases which are very unique. I've never heard anything that sounds anything like what he's doing on his albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this again?","review":"I find this latest edition to the so called \\"Skinny Puppy\\" ablum collection rather lacking in every musical aspect that they are known for.

I tried to resist the urge to do so with this record but caved in the end.while there are some interesting techniques taking place in most of the songs, it is not the record it should have been. i know that times change and you must adapt musically.had i been producing this record i would have sent them home with the entire catalogs of warp, schematic, merck, and some stuff from the german imprint hymen told them to come back in a month and we'll get busy working on the record.industrial is dead. move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remission","review":"Skinny Puppy's existence is now truly bound in remission.

Even to this day I am enthralled by its brilliance. With the addition of Dwayne the puppy landscape expanded beyond comprehension. I cannot say brilliant enough. Nivek and Cevin now find themselves back at the beginning--without Dwayne. Possibly.. Bill Leeb [William Schroeder] possessed a certain something to make \\"Bites\\" so tasty, but all that is needed to dissolve that option is one listen to \\"Brap.\\" No where on this disc are the multiple layers, thrash, or synthetic treachery that would strike a continual smile on my face...To regain that smile I will stick to Puppy's back catalogue... untarnished.r.i.p. dwayne :*("},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"What a load of garbage.

I admit that I like the more experimental albums like Mind,Rabies,TDP and Vivisects, however, I am getting older and so are they. I have found that as I get older I get less \\"angry\\" and more accepting. It appears that Cevin and Ohgr are the same way. All I'm saying is don't compare it to older albums enjoy it for what it is. A new album from two guys who helped change the face of music and at the same time changed my ideas about music. I am going to see them tonight. I can't wait. Kevin and Cevin thank you for the great music throughout the years. We all owe you for making our lives better."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you expect...","review":"Your enjoyment of this album will depend entirely on your expectations of it. If you are expecting the next Too Dark Park or VIVIsectVI, don't even bother with this one. Go purchase more of SP's back catalog that you don't already own. For those not completely stuck in the past, GWotR is a very pleasant surprise. Think Ohgr + Download, and you're halfway there. Gone is much of the dischordant and abstract sound that is Puppy's trademark, but there is a nice tradeoff for the crisp, tight recordings that make up this album.Remember, these guys are near 40 years old and have probably come to terms with a lot of the demons that fueled the rage of their previous albums. Their new sound is much more mature and calculated, and comes across very well. I really enjoyed it, but those who are expecting Last Rights will be highly dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but missing something....","review":"This is a great effort by Key and Ogre but there is something definitely missing here. It seems since they sobered and cleaned themselves up the music too has been 'cleaned' up. Which is good and bad.

I just wish they would not have cleaned up the music so much...I liked the noise they used to cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the butt-licking","review":"Skinny Puppy fans tend to be a bit rabid (no pun intended) and most of these reviews reflect this. Now, if Bill Leeb had released this album (and given the \\"gay bar\\" type music on here, he could have), these same people would be bashing the album.I love Puppy. I love ohGr, and I own the disks for most of cEvin's solo stuff. Given all of that, you'd think I'd love this album, but no.If the Puppy's intent here was to go mainstream and sell more albums, more power to them. They've given us some incredible music and they deserve to live well.

This is a waste of time and money. \\"The Process\\" was bad too, but at least there were a couple of salvagable qualities to it like \\"Cult\\" and \\"Amnesia\\". This CD has nothing to offer but a really bad time.Let's face it: industrial music is long dead and there's no resurrecting it. Even Front Line Assembly's newest CD was horrible.To all you 16 year olds out there who think Skinny Puppy is really cool based on this or \\"The Process\\", you're mislead. \\"The Process\\" was Megadeth with keyboards. \\"Greater Wrong of the Right\\" is, quite simply, filth.

This album IS NOT Skinny Puppy! This could have easily been released under the Ohgr name and probably should have been as not to tarnish the name and reputation of a truely remarkable band. And I agree, we do miss Dwayne. This album goes to show just how crucial Dwayne Goettle was to Skinny Puppy.I had great expectations for this CD and I am fully aware of the fact that Skinny Puppy is a constantly evolvong band and that each new work is treading new water. However, this album doesn't tread new water. It drowns in re-hashed mediocrity.\\"Greater Wrong of the Right\\" is very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunny Poppy","review":"If you like pop music, this CD is excellent.

But I really tried to give the album a chance only daddyuwarbash whatever song that was decent but the rest sorry. They had almost 10 years to write stuff and it comes down to this. A Shame. But with this album I say this should be the final straw and hang up the synths and Vocador and call it the final nail in the coffin. The songs were too over here and over there it was not like the dark elements and the dark vocals and harsh lyrics just a sold out industrial band. Thank You SYNTHSPOP for making this all possible. I will stick to my New Wave Bands and CDS. Industrial is dead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Linkin Puppy","review":"Yeah, I bet that hurts to those who might be fans (as am I, sigh), those two words, but they adequately describe the sound of Greater Wrong. It has some nice points (the last song wins in my book for best use of a Hindi movie sample; every other application of such sound had always come off as annoying as hell, no offense to Bolloywood fans (that and industrial, hmm...)), but overall, it feels like a big flop. I'm not ragingly advocating SP to keep up their old school sound, but in wake of new technology available these days, you'd hope they'd expand upon it. No, we just get some, as one reviewer put it, politically laced nu-metal.

Think of Linkin Park, but not at MTV-friendly.The grittiness and in-your-face of SP is not present. They seemed to have toned down their sound to meet the standards of the mass majority which feeds upon garbage like Nu-Metal, Pop-Punk, and most of all RAP.\\"Pro-Test\\" and \\"Daddyuwarbash\\". Literally the only two songs I like off the whole 10-track album.Get anything else from their catalogue of albums. Try something more even, like Ogre's or cEvin Key's side project. Don't bother with this new effort from SP."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greater Wrong of Skinny Puppy","review":"Skinny Puppy used to stand for something and that something was loud, harsh, messy, brain damaging, and bloody. But that something got lost on \\"Greater Wrong of the Right\\". Perhaps our beloved Pups needed some money and that's why they released an album under the Skinny Puppy name. Sorry, but that's good enough. Ogre and Cevin worked together on the Ohgr project and on Cevin's solo album and that's where it should have stopped. To call this CD Skinny Puppy is a tragic falsehood. Ogre lost his edge and his voice and Key fell in love with himself all over again. Call me nostalgic, but I just don't dig this new, rehashed garbage that people now pass off as industrial music and I'm very sad that Skinny Puppy, the originators of murderous noise pollution, now do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"How could long time Skinny Puppy fans claim to love this album and then go and knock people who think that this is simply tripe? Skinny Puppy were always innovators. They were always treading new ground, never heedful of trends. Well... something happened somewhere and they decided to sell out. Yes, even Skinny Puppy has fallen into the filthy mire of POP music. That is all I hear in this album. Trendy pseudo industrial, nu metal, ebm, techno garbage. Stuff that MTV and radio friendly \\"artists\\" have been poluting our airwaves with for years. Nothing innovative or original. This is a pop album that will surely win them new fans among the mallrat poseur goth and nu-metal crowds. And hearing Ogre \\"rap\\" could have made me vomit. How anyone can see this as anything other than an attempt to make a buck and be \\"hip\\" is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful compilation of great artists","review":"Dancy Dancy Dancy Beat!Dancy Dancy with your feet!Much more beat heavy than their previous albums, but not so much as to drown out their intracite designs. Skinny Puppy is no longer a simple industrial band, they are now a superband of top industrial artists. Cevin Key has developed musical styles that rival anyone in the music industry. Top them off with Ogre's newer \\"singing\\" rather than growling style of Ritalin and Ohgr makes for a very enjoyable experiance. Last but not least is the return of \\"Hi-Watt\\" Marshall on a studio album. I love these guys!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ohGr, not Skinny P","review":"To agree with a previous review, this is more of a new ohGr album than Skinny Puppy.

This is poppy gothic garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immortal Puppy","review":"I had to write a review because most people that bought this album have been longtime fans. If you've never heard SP and are interested in a different type of music (along the lines of Nine Inch Nails, et al) give this one a shot. It is very well done and creative.To be brief, this album reminds me of a diverse movie soundtrack, such as 'The Matrix' and 'Hackers' due in part with the constant rhythmic dives up and down, vocal/instrument sampling and piecemeal of catchy songs that build into a really surreal and dark work. Neauwerld Order indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SP waterd down, but I like it","review":"I have no idea why this received such bad reviews. Yes, it is Skinny Puppy watered down. It's not nearly as hard and in-your-face as their older stuff, but I still like the album for what it is. It's great music, instrumentation, vocals (though he's not distorting them) and lyrics. In comparison to their other albums, its feel is much like that of \`The Process'. I don't expect SP to put out another album like \`Last Rights' because I think they're in a different place in their lives now. I guess I expected an album like this so I didn't set myself up for disappointment.On a side note, it was absolutely awesome to see them perform this album live."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comic without pictures","review":"I found Young Cruisers, banal, a travesty of the English language.

For dance fans, however, Warner Brothers has enlisted the remixing talent of VICTOR CALDERONE, Wamdue, and Ananda. The Calderone club mix is a very nice house reworking of this song that keeps it simple yet exciting and fresh at the same time. While it's not the best work he's ever done, it's far from a dissapointment. (Check out his new mix of Destiny Child's \\"Independent Women\\" It's one of his finest!!!) The Wamdue mix is more original and melodic than Calderone's but less hard. It is a beautiful mix and was a surprising treat considering Wamdue's limited reputation in the US as of now. The Ananda mix is also quite good, but less so than the other two. However, with a great original version, two fabulous mixes, and one good mix, how could you go wrong by purchasing this most worthwhile and underrated single?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a jewel","review":"I discovered both Stingray and Nick Mancuso with this purchase recently (Autumn 2011).

I have been waiting for well over ten years for SOMEONE to release this exceptional program on DVD. It is a shame it lasted just two years... apparently Nick Mancuso didn't like the direction the program was going, and quit... but I LOVED IT!I think of it as KNIGHT RIDER for people with brains! A man driving a top notch car traveling around helping people... but unlike Knight Rider, the lead actor is more than a plastic face.Ray had a tragic past, and he seems to be redeaming himself for past mistakes but helping others.

Sounds trivial, I know, but when Ray walks into the diner to find everybody dead, coffee still hot, jukebox playing Gale Garnett's We'll Sing In The Sunshine, it was eerie as heck! They've put some random (my guess is made-up) song on instead. I know I'm not remembering it incorrectly because I checked on the VIDEO I'd made from the television. It takes away from an important scene and seems like a lame thing to do. Does anyone have any idea why they'd do this? I'm curious.

Willie exudes this indignation and hatefulness every other scene.

My best personal photo's have come from a Holga and it was all when I was just flipping away and not worrying too much about the composition of the shot or the exposure. The color flash adds another spin to an already fun camera. I love to use the flash in the daytime up close to my subjects (The blue flash on the beach gives an awesome feel to a photo).My only complaint is the hassle of loading and unloading the film and the cheap feel to it, but then again it's a 'toy' camera so I guess that's part of the experince.I recomend this (more so with the 35mm version) to anyone just looking to bring fun back into their photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holga fan!!","review":"These camera's are great for enthusiasts!

It is powerful and pretty sturdy, but I agree that it is very noisy. I'm used to bullet models with separate remotes, so it was a bit weird holding, but definitely better put together than the ones with the cords that tend to pull out. The other problem I have is in cleaning- the plastic cover has little nubs on it that are a bit awkward and the actual vibrator has three silver parts on the top that almost need a brush to get clean.

The size is great; it's easy to throw in my bag, and yes - my pocket too! Also super powerful, especially with one AA battery.

After a use I placed him on the nightstand and he rolled off, fell to the floor and the plastic had cracked. Since then, when in use the top part would just completely come off. Talk about frustration. They no longer sold this little guy at the sex shop so I decided to Google the name brand and found that Amazon.com sold him individually! SO HAPPY!!!!I read other reviews where people said it's hard, hurts, and it's loud. Yes, it's hard but this item is meant for Clitoral stimulation not for inserting. It does NOT hurt. It's DEFINITELY not loud. I love that it's quiet, small and it always works it's magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dissapointment!!!","review":"This book started off great. I invested a lot of time and emotion in most of the book. I loved the characters and got really involved and read the book in two days.The last 5 chapters were slapped on the book. There was no thought put into these last chapters. There was no climax; no big secret. The end of the book was so abrupt, I couldn't believe it! It had such potential and then totally flopped.

This \\"Shorter\\" two volume set is an excellent and more compact version of the full dictionary. While it lacks many of the historical word usage references (try looking up \\"apprehend\\" in the 20 volume set and compare it to this one, and you'll see what I mean), it is more than adequate for almost anyone. The thumb index tabs are very useful, and the books are bound beautifully. Along with the Oxford Canadian Dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus, and Strunk and White's \\"Elements of Style\\", this dictionary is one of the core reference books I use on a daily basis.

I cannot believe Bastiat wrote \\"The Law\\" in the middle of the 19th century since it has so much applicability to the 20th (and soon to be 21st) century. If ever there was a concise and powerful argument for defending Liberty and the Law against every social engineer, this has to be it (only 75 pages!). Bastiat is a master of words and the analogy. Every lover of freedom who wishes to get a nutshell understanding of why Liberty and Law matters ought to read this book. Every enemy of freedom (e.g. liberals, socialists, communists, etc.) ought to fear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound beliefs with some humor","review":"This book helped me develop another perspective on the law, what it is , can be, and most importantly should be restrained to remaining.

Overall, Bastiat argues, a government that practices legal plunder under the auspices of equality and social necessity deserves not to be in power and people must have the courage to fumigate these corosive thoughts from public discourse.

There is no way that anyone beyond a 5th grade reading level could have edited this book and missed all of these errors.

This book is so short, so simple, and so devastatingly effective that it is truly an all-time classic. If you are not a socialist, you should master the simple arguments in this essay and keep them handy for discussions with your socialist friends. If you are a socialist, you should in all intellectual honesty read this book (it can be done in an hour or so) and see if you can answer Bastiat's objection to socialism: that anytime the law is used to organize anything other than justice, such as equality or prosperity, it necessarily and inescapably works against justice. His logic is ironclad and uncomplicated. It's a real shame this is no longer part of our cultural consciousness, since it means we are now embarked on a journey of massive, organized, government-supervised injustice.

A lot of the explanations and revelations seem VERY similar to Sylvia Browne's, who was the first to write about the subject of \\"the holding place\\", \\"dark entities\\", and our charts, or blueprints we make before coming into life.What Sylvia says works and makes sense, and I see a lot of psychic authors jumping on the Sylvia bandwagon. If all this is true, why wasn't it all revealed 10, 20, or 60 years ago? Why now all of the sudden?Anyway, this book is very comforting to read, and nice to believe in, although it just doesn't ring true to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?","review":"This cabinet was undeliverable the first time I ordered it because the mirror was already broken.

Not only does it give solid descriptions for the various technologies within OpenStep, it also manages to give practical insights. Almost all of it will apply to Mac OS X programming, given you use the Cocoa API. The only reason I did not deem it worthy of 5 stars is that it fails to cover WebObjects, which is a very important part of business programming in Mac OS X (I assume that most people who will buy the book at this point will be using the Cocoa API under Mac OS X and not OpenStep)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A literary feast","review":"It is always satisfying when virtue and righteousness triumph over ignorance and superstition, and especially when the triumph is accompanied by humor and an articulate expression of entertaining ideas.

The author provides a few, mainly the least important,photos upon which to apply her suggestions. The rest is a concoction of her lists of what she did when she assessed a particular photo. That is a very substandard way of teaching. It's virtually impossible to follow her thinking in a meaningful way. It is like a little of this, a little of that. Poor reasoning and poorer presentation. Accordingly, it's almost impossible to learn much from this book. Look elsewhere if you want to master the subject.

A child could very well have written it. I do not blame the author for this, since it only reflects our society. But characters such as Nick or Jay or Tom are superficial, empty, and provide no substance to the novel. The women in the novel, such as Daisy, Myrtle, and Jordan, are objects of mens' affections only, and demonstrate the sexism we all face. There should be some way to work around the disgusting limits of our society and once again write beautiful literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great Gatsby","review":"I found the Great Gatsby to be the most boring book I have ever read. Fitzgerald does a horrid job of making interesting characters. The whole story revolves around lust, which is positivly sickening since the character of Daisy makes me want to hit her. She fakes innosense and thinks that the best thing a female can be is a beautiful little fool, and personally I found it degrading as a female! If any teachers are reading this review, please give your students something that will actually intrest them. The Cat and the Hat was better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AMERICAN DREAM THE AMERICAN WAY","review":"The Great Gatsby is an extremely uninteresting, boring book. It has no suspense, the characters are dull, and the whole book in general lacks quality. The verbal and lexical extemporaneuity of certain paragraphs in the book makes it an even more confusing book to follow. If you're looking for a book to read, the Great Gatsby is not it. If you consider yourself an intellectual, I suggest reading Pedro Paramo (I forget the author) or Karl Marx's Das Kapital for some stimulation. Better yet, write your own damn book and amuse yourself with whatever it is you come up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"The epitome of american Dream","review":"The Great Gastby was the first Fitzergald book I read. Indeed, he proves to be one of the greatest writer of the century. I like the protrayal of Gastby.

That he can be so single mindedly obsessed with one thing. That leads him to complicate his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great Book","review":"Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest books ever written in the English language. Not only does it supply readers with detailed desciptions of social history (The Roaring '20s), but it serves as a brilliant satire on many facets of the \\"American Dream\\". The symbolism, character development, and amount of realism make Gatsby one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel was very interesting from cover to cover!!!!","review":"The Great Gatsby is an awesome novel due to the fact that it described how life was in the 1920s.

Composers like Valle' and Deodato were almost unheard of in the period this was released. I must admit that I bought the LP and consequently bought Valle'68 for that very reason..I knew the tune and loved the composer.

This book is full of Farmer's sexual ideas, and if you don't agree with those, you won't like the book. Also, the story itself isn't all that great. The idea of The Nine is intriguing, but instead of making a couple of heroes of another age more \\"real\\", the story made them a lot weirder.

I have also read many other books on the subject of Anne Boleyn and the era. I was really disappoint with the movie. The many of the charactors would have \\"Diary camera\\" talk to explain thoughts. I always felt like I was watching Real World. The film had a very small budget and the customs/sets seem to be missing the glamor of Tudor look. I felt the script was missing important parts from the book. Mary grew up in France and her husband was chosen by King Henry VIII. She did not have just one child with Henry but two. Don't get me talking about hollywood movie...such a bad movie!! It's better to read the book and imagine their world. Both movies are not worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I had read the book about 6 months ago, I thought it was one of the best books I had read in a long time...My mistake was reading the book first. If I would have known that they were making a movie I would never had read it. The movie was like a short intro to the book. They left out so, so much of the story. Whoever edited that movie should be shot. The rivalry between the sisters was so downplayed. The king being really hurt, getting fatter and uglyer. His real relation with the Queen, etc.I felt cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful video quality -- Looks bootlegged","review":"If I hadn't bought this directly from Amazon, I would say straight-out that this is clearly a bootleg DVD. All but the brightest, outdoor, filmed scenes are extremely grainy, like a 2nd- or 3rd-generation VHS copy from the 1970s.Which frankly I wouldn't mind, if I were buying a rare, hard-to-get video that is only available through those kinds of 3rd-hand sources. But this was sold as a \\"real,\\" commercial DVD, which makes me resent the awful and amateurish copying job. It looks so terrible that I was distracted from watching the story, which by the way is also done in a dated and amateurish way. For example, there are numerous odd scenes where the characters, alone, speak directly to the camera, making funny faces and delivering soliloquies to explain themselves -- not unprecedented, but hardly something you expect nowadays, so it is jarring.Buy it if you are interested enough to ignore all of the above, but don't get your hopes up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More choppy than Henry's marriages!","review":"This unfortunate adaptation struggles from the beginning, and never finds it's footing.

Fresh, clean, citrus and lemon. Perfect for anytime, anywhere.Most of the negative reviews on this page are referring to the aftershave, deodorant, or the powder, not the cologne spray itself (which, oddly enough is the ACTUAL item that they chose to review by writing their reviews on this page).

Yes, it smells good, but the scent is short-lived. To keep it going you would have to probably reapply 4 or more times a day. Besides, it doesn't even have an anti-perspirant ingredient.

I had to get it for my Krav Maga class and several of the women in my class were complaining that the ones they got were too wide or came up to high on their back side. I found this one and because of the way it sets on the model in the picture thought it didn't look too terrible. I was right.It's not completely unflattering, and the protection piece is slim enough to still allow for a lot of leg rotation, for kicking and such. It's elastic around the waist and there are two elastic bands that rest around your cheeks not up the crack as the picture doesn't display. (Think rock climbing harness) It's really rather comfortable considering, and it fastens in the front.

You get a quick introduction to a character or concept and then you're whisked away to the next thing. I purchased the 1st four in this series. The second book helps explain a bit more.

It was so boring. I was shocked at the idea of vampires eating real food. I was willing to ignore such ridiculous idea. I tried to, and it was difficult at first. It was also difficult, because of this, to tell who was vamp and who wasn't. I was hoping for the plot, if there was any, to pick up the pace. It never did. The ending was so lame.

But lately the vampires in L.A. are really twitchy, they feel that Selim has been slacking on the job. Enforcers are not normal vampires... Whats more scary to a baby vampire? A 1000 yr old vampire or a Enforcer? Hands down, the Enforcer.Enforcers are Judge, Jury and Executioner in their city.

This book provides no characters that you care about, no information on who they are and why they are the way they are. Everything important in this book is described as assumed knowledge. For some reason the author felt the need to not write any background for the story, instead pointing you to a redundant glossary.

In fact, I ordered the whole series right off the bat.I was shocked to see that the main character was already way involved with his love interest from the very beginning and was in the process of being very very nasty to her. It was confusing to figure out the nature of their relationship and its not till very late (almost the end) in the book that it is really explained.I speant the whole time disliking him and wanting her, who I actually liked, to break it off with him.I love Vampires as teh main characters of books.

The plot was bad, the charectors cartoonish, and the storyline was trite. I was severley dissappointed with the author, for writing such a lousy book, with Amazon for recomending it, with the editor for not doing their job, and with the people who recommended it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed with poor grammar","review":"Although some of the concepts in this book are new and intriguing, the grammatical errors were extremely distracting.

Other stuff features them screwing around at Ozzfest '01, touring, and interviews. DVD only features are Chester's tattoes, Mike & Joe's art, \\"My December\\" and \\"High Voltage\\" songs, and other stuff.

It has secret passages that you can go to, that include, Points of Authority, LIVE at DRAGONFEST, and lots more. You see plenty of every band member in this video, and learn a lot more about them. It's mostly clean, funny, and I DEFINITELY suggest this to ANYONE whose a Linkin Park fan. It shows the TRUE Linkin Park, and their 'not-so-glamorous' life on the road. If you're just into their music, and not THEM personally, I wouldn't recommend this for you. I've watched it plenty of times, and I STILL laugh at it. So if you love LP, and love laughing, you've GOT to get this, on video OR DVD. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD","review":"The Linkin Park DVD is worth the money just to get the Music Videos. If you like their music you'll definately like this DVD, because it also gives you a peek into their lives behind the stage, and in other places as well. There are a couple of unreleased songs on the DVD as well, the best is \\"My December,\\" (maybe a preview of what to expect on the next album?). There is also a kind of bluegrass version of \\"Crawling\\" that is rather hilarious too. The list of Music Videos are as followsPapercutOne Step CloserCrawlingIn The EndThere are also a couple of live performances that have great footage of the band in action.

'In The End' is a really good video. I liked watching the making of it and it's funny when Chester mimes along to the chours, when it's speeded up really fast and high pitch! Linkin Park like to muck around and you can see this in the secret video filmed in London. It's especially funny when Mike breaks the table and when you hear about Chester's spider bite!

They took the script to Cruel Intentions(a movie I did like) and just did some cutting and pasting. They were the exact same lines and the exact same scenes. The plot to Cruel Intentions did cross some reality boundaries, however in comparison to this movie, the first was the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I am so disappointed in myself for not turning it off during the first scene. Now, you may be thinking, hey a movie with naked people in it...fun...but the people in this movie are not even attractive. If it's ever on cable and you can find nothing better to do, then maybe you could watch it for some comedy relief, but don't waste the $4 that it costs to rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wot eva","review":"The first movie was a legend but this one is a joke! what the hell was the writer thinking??? duh these characters are not sexy at all they are merely pathetic. i DONT recomend this movie to anyone.

Well let's just put in new actors (which aren't as good as the origonal stars) and give them the same script. If you liked Cruel Intentions the origonal, don't waste the two hours on this. If you didn't like Cruel Intentions, don't waste the two hours on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated. Should have been a prequel.","review":"Okay, this movie isn't as bad as everyone makes it sound! It's very interesting to see how this movie plays out and it IS entertaining, and I was glad that the ending wasn't a copy from the first one, and it actually shocks you! Would have been 5 stars but I gave it four because the actors who portrayed Katherine and Sabastian didn't have the chemistry Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe did. I would buy it as one of those movies you watch on a very bored day.BUT IT'S STILL GOOD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what was that all about?","review":"Okay so Cruel Intentions 2. A big no-no. I own it on DVD only because I couldn't find Cruel Intentions by itself. I deeply regret it now though cuz it seems the first one is available everywhere now...The sequel is a total rip-off from the first movie with obvious changes. Instead of playing the doctor's daughter at the beginning, Sebastian played his old principal's wife. And then Sebastian falls for the Headmaster's daughter like in CI. The actors they took to re-enact the characters don't compare at all. It's a shame when you think of the excellent job Sarah Michelle and Ryan Phillippe did. There's no plot to this story, too many swear words and too much nudity and just bad dialogue and bad... everything.If you really wanna see this movie, don't buy it. Rent it so if you can't handle it anymore you can always return it right away. That's what I would have done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, didn't I just see this???","review":"Three words: What the f*ck?I watched this movie with my friends in order, and when this one was put on I asked them \\"Haven't we just seen this\\"?Riddle me this,why would anybody waste their time, money and limited acting skills on a crapulent sequel like this? Sebastian is pitiful, Kathryn needs prozac and pathetic who-the-f*ck who played the virgin were as rusty and staged as... actually, there's nothing to compare this cr*p to. rent the original. It rocks. The cast is famous. There's chemistery in it. Why anyone would remake it will remain a question on my mind for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Philippe were where?","review":"Cruel Intentions 2 (2000) Robin Dunne, Sarah Thompson, Amy Adams, Keri Lynn Pratt, Barry Flatman, Mimi Rogers, Teresa Hill, Barclay Hope, D: Roger Kumble. Deteriorating (and even more unsavory) direct-to-video preclude is basically meloporn and treachery to the story of DANGEROUS LIAISONS as it shows the preparatory events of the sexually-active stepbrother-sister couple, Sebastian (Dunne) and Katherine (Adams), where she steps in the way of his new assignment: the headmaster's daughter Thompson. Bad comparison of the original is more of a rehash, though with the same director, but with different faces and hypocritical performances. Running Time: 90 minutes and rated R for sexual content, nudity, and some language."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT HAS SOME GOOD MOMENTS BUT DISSAPOINTS OVERALL","review":"I have to admit that I enjoyed the first half of this movie, knowing it was an excuse to look at some attractive actors doing totally unrealistic things (I was a MELROSE PLACE fan), but after awhile it started to get too superficial even for m y \\"forgiving\\" tastes. It unfortunately is worse than the first CRUAL INTENETIONS which we all know was never supposed to be an intellectual film either. What truly dissapointed me about this movie is the way it ends, but I would give away the whole \\"story\\"to explain my point. As in the earlier film, there were evil characters (or at least \\"soulless\\" ones) but watching the basic theme of \\"good triumphing over evil\\" was satisfying; I got no such satisfaction from CRUEL INTENETIONS 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, plain and simple. Entertaining.","review":"You know something, some people just read too much into these types of movies. If you're looking for a piece of art, move on. If you're looking for a movie that fits the title, and follows the same cynical plot as the first one, this is a great movie. It also has something the other one didn't- a bit of nudity. I'm not gonna pretend I'm some snobbish movie critic, I'm an average joe who likes movies, and this was a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst","review":"This is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I love the first one but this one is just lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're all wrong","review":"How can a movie with lesbian kissing, booby, no male nudity, and sub-par acting be bad? The blatant disregard for morals and values was great. How you can not appreciate the directer's ability to handle so many taboo subjects in one movie is beyond us. Now while your watching the begining, you might just think it is a cheezy, low budget version of the first one; it is the ending however shows how genius the movie was. At the very end, keep an eye out for the driver who fondles the freshmen girl. THIS IS A MODERN DAY CLASSIC IF THERE EVER WAS."},{"rating":"1","title":"First movie is ALWAYS the best one than the second movie","review":"This movie is pretty odd and little mix-up parts but it's ALMOST the same as the first movie. I always like the first movie better than this one. I ordered this movie because of Keri Lynn Pratt and that I really loved the first one and I was hoping this movie would be great one but it's not. I still have this movie but I hardly watch this movie because my boyfriend really love this movie so I dont bother sell it. Our things is ours so. I am warning you guys dont order this movie unless you REALLY want to see it then go rent a movie BEFORE you order it!! Save your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"By a 13 year old Viewer","review":"I found this movie appaling! The original Cruel Intentions is one of my favorite movies so I thought that I would much enjoy the sequel. It's a miss of bad acting and other gross humor that not that many people would enjoy. In Cruel Intentions Witherspoon, Phillippe, Gellar did an great job of acting and playing out their roles. This movie featured bad acting the plot was a cheap imitation that didnt make sense and the shower scene and the scene with the horse was unnesesairy and innapropriate. I would greatly urge anyone that is thinking about seeing this movie not to buy it, but rent it if they still want to see. It is nothing like the original"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was plesantly surprised","review":"I have to say that I was plesantly surprised by this movie. I wasn't expecting much when I first saw this movie. But, I think that it actually rates really close to the original. Don't get me wrong, there are some holes in the plot. But, I have to say this movie actually kept my attention all the way through. The writing was clever. Although I thought there were way too many ripped off lines from the original. Overall I liked this movie. I would recommend it, just to see how you like. This movie you will either love or hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly insulting!","review":"As a fan of Cruel Intentions, knowing that it was a trashy teen flick, I was truly disappointed by Cruel Intentions 2. The first movie at least has a entertaining plot as it is based on Dangerous Liaisons, however \\"2\\" has a weak cast (excluding the hot lesbian twins) and steals far too many quotes from the original film - so much so that i was bored!! Bottom line; no plot, lame cast, un fulfilling 2 hours with no real ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder the original stars wanted no part of this!!!!!","review":"It was an attempt at a view of the characters before they became as corrupt, but there was a lack of character development. In addition, those portraying Katherine and Sebastian did not even look close to the original characters. The movie kept my interest, and was somewhat entertaining, but disappointing. I disagree with other reviewers about the \\"porn\\" content of this movie. There were many innuendos but little graphic nudity. If you saw the first movie, this film will interest you by somewhat explaining the character's motivations. However, unless it was given to me, I would not add it to my DVD library. This movie will make no sense if you have not seen the original Cruel Intentions. I recommend that viewers rent it, take it back, and call it a night."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful Movie","review":"Being a fan of the original movie, I was suckered into watching this film. It has to be on my top 5 list of horrible movies that I'm embarrassed and mad that I paid money to watch.

I, too, strongly advocate for a negative star rating for this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop the pain...","review":"This movie was forced upon me. It does not surprise me that this pilot never convinced any television executive to buy it.If I have to listen to one more crack about long island iced tea not tasting like tea...*sighs* I strongly desire a negative star rating, just for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad!","review":"I was a big fan of Cruel Intentions so when I heard of the T.V. series that was supposed to air last December I was excited, but then quicky dissapointed to learn that it had been cancelled. Well it recently aired on cable the other night and it was really not as bad as most people would think for a kind of straight to video movie. It is a prequel so you get to see how Kathryn and Sebastian really met and what ends up leading them to their little games they play with innocent guys and girls. Unfortunately none of the actors from the Cruel Intentions movie are in this sequel/prequel but it really was not that bad!! I can see how they would not air the series on T.V. cause it definately is not suited to be on regular T.V. but I found it to be funny and entertaining. It kept me interested the whole time. Watch it and see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent for a TV Show","review":"For being a scrapped TV show turned into a movie, it wasnt that bad, I know Ive seen worse!! My only problem with it was the lame jokes (plenty abound)and recycled plot lines and jokes (\\"this sure dosent taste like a iced tea\\", \\"Its from long island\\") Coming from the same team except for the actors, Who incedently arent that bad, its just the material they have to work with, I expected a little better. Some of it was interesting but overall not a very good prequel. And they show like 20 scenes in the preview that arent even in the movie, including those scenes might have made the movie more interesting and a little longer that 87 min."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even good","review":"Okay, it was an alright movie but compared to the first one it really was just not good. i mean they use so much stuff from the first one that its like wait i thought this was suppose to be a little different. i really dont recommand this movie unless your curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"ok a sequal was expected...not wanted, needed, called for, or even good...but we got one non the less...ok, a question?What do you get when you take pretty wanna be actors from New York and put them on a sound stage and a half written script and instructions to ad lib w/e they want as long as they get naked?Cruel Intentions 2!good i think you passed........wait...whats this....theres a 3rd one....haha...hollywood is really into spending millions on crap that wont make them hundreds...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth checking out","review":"Okay people I know this movie don't live up to the first one but for good reason. It was made to be a series meaning lower budget and not a big time cast. If this movie had become the series it was intended to be I would have definately watched it.

This is definetly not a movie for young people considering the constant inuendo and sex scenes. This movie only gets 1 star because that is the lowest option. If I could really choose it would get none. It is best to stick to the first which at least had wit and direction. Cruel Intentions 2 is the same storyline just trashier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly your normal teen flick!","review":"As prequels go, this one really sets up how Sebastian came to the Big Apple to live with hsi dad, stepmom, and seductive stepsister, Katherine. \\"Seduce and destroy\\" is Katherine's motto,a dn nothing gets in her way except Sebastian. Of course as we know if you've viewed the original, Sebastian and Katherine are both playmates, which is kinda of out of the ordinary. This prequel ends with Sebastian turning into a seduce and destroyer. Rent the original, avoid prequels that are direct-to-video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first.","review":"Or at least I felt it was. I've heard several people comment that they liked the first one better, but I feel the Cruel 2 was actually the better movie.The first one had too much bad language for me. I'm getting tired of seeing characters that have to utter a useless string of profanity simply to make their point. So Cruel Intentions 2 is much better in this respect. Although, I must admit I liked the actors in the first one better. But I felt the Cruel Intentions 2 was much better in terms of actually getting to know the characters, we can even start to see why Kathryn is as bad as she is. Plus I am sucker for endings where the 'bad guys' come out on top. And boy do they come out on top here! Unlike the first one where the 'bad guys' lost it all.So if you liked Cruel Intentions, but hated the ending. You need to see Cruel Intentions 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twister Set-Up","review":"I've seen the first, then was flipping through channels, came to Showtime, and saw that the sequel was a prequel and was gonna be on. So I watched it and it seemed fairly slowly building up, but the ending was just totally radical. A complete twist of events that would really push toward the original. Instead of being seniors in the original, they're sophmores. So If you like the first, you'll like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth seeing","review":"Bad actors + bad script + bad storyline + over the top profanity=?A bad movie!This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen.

It's certainly not a great movie by any standard (but the original movie wasn't exactly a classic either). But it has two things going for it: first, it doesn't take itself at all seriously; there are quite a few funny jokes that would have been considered too over-the-top for Cruel Intentions 1), and second, THE SHOWER SCENE! That scene alone is the main justification for the movie. (...) this scene will definitely appeal to you. I found it the most intellectually satisfying part of the movie. Aside from this, the plot (though dumb) was actually good enough to keep me watching right to the end. So grab a beer, turn off your brain, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel intentions 2, Just pure rubbish","review":"This film is very different from the original and is terrible in many ways. the first is better however the second and is something that would appeal to 13 year olds.

Don't rent it. If it comes on cable, change the channel. Never in all my years of movie watching have I ever felt compelled to write a review for a movie. This is more like a warning. It was unclear if this was an actual sequel or a very very sad attempt to re-create the first film. Some lines were taken directly out of the original.

Lots of money and time to burn, living in the beautiful hills of Palo Alto. I used to run my bicycle around there in the morning. Mr. Levy had probably fun writing the book, but I did not have fun reading it. Obviously the author read a lot, knows a lot, but does not get to the point. The story gets lost in a mythical view about paper and information. I have to commit, I made it only to one third of the book, then I gave up, but hey, I don't work in research.An excellent book about Information in the internet age: Die Bibliothek der Zukunft from Dieter E. Zimmer; unfortunately not in English;"},{"rating":"2","title":"Documentation for our times","review":"This meditation on the changing role of documents in our lives is simply marvelous--wide-ranging, literate and even profound. Levy is no Luddite--quite to the contrary--but his essays here will change the way you think about the digital revolution. I might add that the prose is a model of what writing of this kind should be: modest, inviting and free of academic jargon or posturing. Nicely done."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is 1945 edition, very out of date","review":"This is a facimile reproduction of the original 1945 edition of the book.

There were only two small problems. One, the top portion of the cage was bent a little, but not noticeable.

It was easy to put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Item","review":"Purchased this cage for my two cockatiels. They were in an older cage which was getting boring for them.

While others have commented that the pieces were broken or damaged, all the pieces that were supposed to be included were present and intact. The instructions are non-existent, but it is a pretty straight-forward assembly. When assembled, the cage is pretty sturdy and looks nice.

When we were disassembling the cage for return to Amazon, we also noticed that some of the welds had already come off.Maybe this cage would work for a larger parrot but it definitely does not work for cockatiels due to the safety issue I mentioned.And if I had a larger parrot, I would not want a cage with faulty welds that failed within 30 days of ownership.Either way, this is a poorly made product and I would recommend against buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very hard to clean","review":"the cage itself is ok...the cleaning is a hassle!

The authors also included a good amount of humor to emphasize the point (in cartoon, comic, Top 10 List, etc), in order to keep a reader interested.I think this text is also a good reference as well, as there are numerous court cases and explicit examples of gov't at work - that if you are ever at a loss for \\"what was it that happened?\\" or \\"what does that term mean?\\" Things are extremely easy to find and be referred to.Good works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice for the ages, musically superb.","review":"Daniel Lavoie has a voice fo he ages, musically superb.

Because I now own the season, I can download episodes to my Fire and with that I'm able to watch the episodes without an internet connection.I love the show Leverage. The Ion channel started playing the first three seasons, and I was hooked. I love how the characters grow over the seasons. I am now in love with everyone on the show.

This season I laughed, I cried, and I chewed my fingernails to the stubs more than once. From undercover stings to reveal corruption to a search for a lost Van Gogh, there is always excitement waiting. Each episode is stand alone, so you don't have to see the other seasons to follow, but to get the full effect of the chemistry between the characters, it is best to watch them in order. This is one series that just keeps improving over time. You just can't go wrong with this DVD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leverage 4th Season","review":"Leverage is back with an exciting forth season on DVD.

Yolen is one of the greatest forces in children's literature and folklore today. She explores the reasons why fantasy and folklore literature is important for children to read and hear. The power of story in individuals and in our cultures is emphasized in each essay.

It is a serious loss.\\"Traditional tales perform four crucial functions, Yolen argues. They provide ...1. a landscape of allusion. (Example: How can you appreciate Shrek if you've never read Mother Goose rhymes and fairy tales?)2. insight into ancestral cultures3. a safe path for processing experience4. a framework for an individual's beliefs and values\\"When we ... deprive [children] of the insights and poetic visions expressed in words that humans have produced throughout human history, we deny them - in the end - their own humanity,\\" she writes.

I can not wait for more seasons to be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Pepper","review":"This is a very good police show from the 1970s. Angie Dickinson is a very beautiful woman or as they say today \\"she is hot\\". However, Angie's beauty and talent aren't the only aspects of the show. The show is action packed and deals with some gritty topics. The team led by Earl Holliman gels as they solve the crime.I also appreciate the stars adding commentary to some episodes. It is a shame that the other seasons may not be released due to mediocre sales as this television series deserved better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Police Woman Returns!","review":"I have been waiting for this boxed set to be released for ages and I wasn't disappointed. Quite edgy stories for the time and maybe even more so in some respects than what would be featured now. If you like the 70s cop shows - the action, the cars, the clothes etc - then you will love this. The extras are a little light on but I bought it to watch the original show so who cares!

It is RUBBISH. The scripts are boring, disjointed, and there is only about 30 seconds of real action in each episode I saw.I looked at the episodes on the first two discs, they were boring, nothing but talk. Looked at disk 3 and this would not play at all. Finally got rid them in the bin where rubbish belongs, a total waste of money. Even the Pilot episode taken from the POLICE STORY Series was slow, no action. If I had been able to see the pilot episode before buying I would have saved my money. Regrettably now, I ordered the 1st series of POLICE STORY before I received POLICE WOMAN, I expect this (hopefully wrong) to be the same kind of boring materialwhen it arrives. Nothing in the police type series touches T.J.HOOKER, this is action and suspense all the way through.How in heavens name this Police Woman series got any 5 star reviews I do not know"},{"rating":"2","title":"Angie and Earl Are A Winning Team","review":"Angie Dickinson has as much charisma as any female in the history of television. And it's the kind of charisma that comes from a deep sense of personal character. Put that together with her wonderful beauty and you have one of the best and most important female characters in TV history. Put her together with Earl Holliman and you have a female/male team that never gets old, always seems fresh and real and human. Put that together with 70's style, the cars, the clothes, the lingo, and you get a cop show that is as much fun to watch as any cop show that has ever been on the air. If you watched this when it first aired you will love seeing it again.The DVD extras are marvelous. There are a ton of very insightful comments from both Angie and Earl in the commentaries, and the both of them make you feel as if you are an old friend sitting with them in a nice, cozy place and watching a show that they loved doing.I just hope that season 2 will be released and very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marianna Jameson has hit the mark.","review":"This is an excellent book with well developed characters and a story that captures you from the very first page.

The real problem is with the heroine -- Miranda is absolutely unbearable. She is one of the most unlikable heroines I've read in a long time. She is completely obnoxious in her behavior towards Chas (cold, condensending, and just downright cruel at times) and spends the majority of the book throwing one long pity-party for herself. Chas, on the other hand, borders on too-good-to-be-true, but at least he behaves like an adult thoughout (most of) the book. The characters make the whole story completely unbelievable: \\"perfect man relentlessly pursues mean, self-centered woman\\". No man in his right mind would take the abuse Miranda dumps on Chas and then keeping coming back for more.

However, she will have to do some research to get a role model on whom to pattern her hero. That's where Officer Chas Casey comes in. Observing him, and getting in his way, Miranda begins to change her mind about hating alphas. Chas is not half bad, once she gets to know him, but her avoidance of literary macho men stems from issues she has with real ones. Only by facing the pain she hides can she succeed in literature and love both.** A truly sensitive, weighty tale is hidden under the fluff. More focus on the real issue would have made this an excellent novel instead of merely light comedy. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, freelance reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put this book down.

I read Big Trouble by Marianne Jameson last year and was impressed enough to read this book, and I was not disappointed. Both books provide a wonderful escape from reality, and it just so happens that the character in My Hero is a romance writer. Randi Rhodes/Miranda Lane is having some trouble writing her latest romance when who should come upon the scene ... sexy cop Chas Casey.

Her history of the Sundering and the creation of the Romulan (Rihannsu) culture is better established in five previous books, and quite frankly makes better sense considering the way the Vulcan people turned out in the canon shows.Books are never completely canon when the shows and movies can change details at any moment, but the books could at least be a part of the time line. Based on [...] information Chekov would be 132 and Uhura 138 years old in this trilogy. And I've never seen a hint of Saavik being married to Spock in the shows- that is sort of incestuous considering their early history. It seems a little too pat to have some of these details in the book and feels more like fannish wish fulfillment than good story-telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than other brands!!","review":"I highly recommend these liners.

The reproductions are awful!The works don't look like originals in the museums, colors are muddy, their clarity and brilliance gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before the glamour photographers!","review":"Looking at the lovely society women Sargent painted made me realise how like he was to the glamour photographers Avedon and Beaton. I loved the clothes! He paints them so well you feel you can touch them. The faces of the women artfully show them to be lovely but natural beauties. The conventions of the day deterred virtuous women from wearing make-up.One picture of a sitter with a powdered face showed the white powder streaking over the skin giving a clownish effect. This tallies with what I've read about the make-up available in those days: white was white and pink was pink.I was pleased to see the other studies of Madame Gutreau. Up to now I had only seen the Madame X picture and studies for that. From what I read in an earlier biography Sargent improved her looks for his portrait. She had creates a stir in Paris by wearing mauve powder. Sargent painted her as pale with skin like a lily.I will probably buy the other volumes in this series from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"dislike","review":"Doesn't work well with Quick Books checks as the \\"pay to order\\" information shows through the window.

The easy seal design is fantastic because who wants to worry about taping or licking so many envelopes?! My only problem is that when you have have several invoices to put in one envelope it doesn't always fit right and the address gets partially covered. The shipping with Amazon is SUPER fast, don't pay for shipping - do the free 5-8 business days and you will still receive in 2 days (or less!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Determination","review":"High as a Hawk is a sensational story of a little girl's determination to live out her mother's dream. Anyone who has lost a loved one can relate to wanting that person to live on in some way. T.A. Baron captures the endurance and the hardships that come with accomplishing this. The challenges that face the little girl in this book don't stop her and the image of being as \\"high as a hawk\\" at the end makes the reader breathe that breath of accomplishment right along with her. Ted Lewin's illustrations add the touch of expression and scenery that make this story as sensational as it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"How high can you go?","review":"It all started with her mom's dream to climb Longs Peak in Colorado. After Harriet's mother died, Harriet, her Pa, and Mr. Mills started the grand adventure to conquerer Longs Peak. After her Pa could no longer go on with the journey, Harriet decided she would not give up; she wanted to live her mother's dream and see the hawk soar. Her and Mr. Mills continue until Harriet no longer has the will to go on. One more climb over the top is all she can manage. Finally, all of her pain and tiredness goes out of her arms when she spreads them open on the summit copying the great hawk she sees soaring through the sky. A great use of color, Ted Lewin, depicts the mountains with oranges and purples. The colors throughout this book are magnificient and give the reader a sense of dept and realness. This is a great book that proves that no matter what, no person shall give up on their dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGH AS A HAWK","review":"T.A.Barron in my opinion is a great writer. He use's surprise statements like. \`It was my mom's dream to climb Longs Peak with Mr. Mills. She didn't tell me she would die first. He use's great verbs like panted, clomping, and more interesting verbs. The author puts the reader in the story. It feels like you're as High as a Hawk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album","review":"I bought this album having not ever heard anything from ayreon and Im glad I did. It features some of the greatest vocalists on the proggressive scene today, and they all deliver an amazing performance on this concept double album. It has its soft and melodic moments, and it has its heavy and dark moments, both of which I enjoy. This is a must own for any proggressive metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I was introduced to Lucasson's musical proficiency from Star One and immediately knew I had to delve into Aryeon, in which Human Equation is my first foray. I love the music. It is so different from everything else I own, seeming to seamlessly cross several different genre's of music into an asthetic blend of ear pleasing sounds. I originally rated this at 4 stars, but it wasn't long before this became my favorite CD to listen to for quite some time. How can I not give it five stars? Unfortunately I cannopt change my original rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Tommy\\" for my generation","review":"This album is a monument to the inspired musicianship and songwriting talent of Arjen Lucassen. Every single second of every track grabs you by the throat and does not let go until the very end.You want light thoughtful tunes? You got 'em. Some folky elements? Check. A who's who of the prog/rock/metal scene? James La Brie,Heather Findlay, Mikael Akerfeldt? Yep they're here, among others. Some huge slabs of metal guitar? Present and correct.Each song is perfectly crafted, the story flows to the point where I challenge anyone to listen to this album and not see a movie in their mind.This is \\"Tommy\\" for the Prog/Metal generation. Timeless and getting better each time it is played.Do yourself a favour - buy this CD, then buy everything else with Arjen Lucassen's name on it and see what a rare and breathtaking talent this man has for writing and playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing... AbsoFlippin Amazing","review":"I've always found that going into Mediaplay can be dangerous. We went in to look at guitars and came out with the name of a band that played absolutely brill music. A few weeks and $30 later I had \\"the Human Equation\\" in my hot little hand. It. Is. AWESOME! Arjen combines all the best elements of so many different kinds of music into this brilliant Rock Opera masterpiece. I watched the DVD and was further astounded at how flippin' tall Arjen is. He makes me proud to share a Duth heritage with him.The track \\"Hope\\", for me, is a very moving and uplifting song. All at once it gives me (ironically) hope and makes me think about all the friends I have lost over the years.Arjen has created something that will unfortunately be overlooked by bloody mainstream America. It is sad that we concentrate so much on glitz and glamour and sex and ignore bands that actually have talent. BUY THIS CD! You won't regret it! in fact, I DEFY YOU to dislike this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Ayreon is alive again","review":"What a comeback to the Ayreon serie. This double CD is nothing but fantastic, recommended to every Ayreon fans. Others not familiar with the gigantic sound/universe of Ayreon can also start with this great album. Ayreon mostly created the science-fiction metal opera genre. This new CD doesn't follow directly the Ayreon story line (but wait until the end of the second CD...). Arjen Lucassen, the Ayreon creator and composer, multi-instrumentalist genius, tell us of another voyage, the voyage inside the human emotions. The divine, entwined human's emotions (to quote Arjen's classic Electric Castle) are casted as different singers. It is strong, powerfull, inspired, beautifull, just name it. If the actual rock/pop/hip-hop got you disappointed, give it a try. It is a real musical inner eye openner. Great work Arjen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious stab at the epic","review":"The kind of grandiose (bloated) concept double disc that gives neo-prog a bad name. Despite, or perhaps because of Lucassen's preoccupation with theatrical tendencies, most of his contrived and poorly (over) produced musical ambitions are flat-lined and even sidetracked with laughable vocals masking as \\"perspectives\\". There can be an audience for this, but it wouldn't be a large one. Metalheads who are closet theater fans or people who find their Evanesence lacking progressive bite perhaps. There is no doubt the songwriter holds talent in the pop-rock arena, but succeeds at alienating a vast majority of potential listeners with thematic self-seriousness and typical modern prog-rock compositional arrogance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled album","review":"I think I listened to a different album than all other reviewers. This sounds like an absolute recycled album. There's nothing new here in terms of Ayreon music. Electric Castle is still one of my favorite albums, and Universal Migrator Parts 1 and 2 is also a top album, but Arjen insists to repeat the same formula in The Human Equation. It's nice to listen to some new and fresh musical ideas every once in a while, but not here. I tried really hard to enjoy this album, and I give 2 stars for the production, because it is really impeccable, but the music lacks or originality from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elitist","review":"Elitist Rock Operatic Nonsense.Purchase this:1)If you believe you are an 'Elite' musicican [or simply have 'Elite' taste in music].2)If you believe you are an 'Elite' Human being overall.3)If you enjoy spending more money than average to buy this package so that you may then boast about how 'Elite' you are to your friends/co-workers/neighbours/people on messageboards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel of the highest order","review":"I purchased this CD a few months ago, after reading plenty of reviews on various sites........I am a massive fan of Rock / Prog Rock / Prog Metal, and in my honest opinion I have witnessed better composed productions at my children's primary school. This CD is complete and utter drivel of the highest order. How talent like James LaBrie can lower himself to this level is beyond belief. Forget this garbage.....stick to Dream Theater. This CD is even worse than \\"Be\\" by Pain of Salvation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly arranged","review":"The Human Equation is a definite must for all progressive record collecters. The man behind Ayreon, Arjen Lucassen is a true talent, plus the guest appearances of James LaBrie (Dream Theater) voicing the main character 'Me'. Other borrowed vocals include Mikael Akerfeldt of Opeth, Eric Clayton of Saviour Machine, Devin Townsend of Strapping Young Lad and more!The concept behind The Human Equation is, though at times cheesy, an epic masterpiece.The music is diverse, ranging from the power-metal style voices, to the screaming, and the death growling. Keyboards and synthesizers are well composed, as well as the guitar solos and the additional instruments such as the didgeridoo.This is a record to definitely check out if you're into epic sounding music. It has folk, thrash, progressive elements. But most of all, it is great METAL concept album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, silly story","review":"Arjen Lucassen has created another well-done rock opera. If your not a fan of this genre it could be a difficult listen as the vibrato male vocals (or numerous vocalists on one song) can be taxing at times, and some of the music is similar to what you would hear at the Renaissance festival. However, the majority of the disc has plenty of heavy rock, prog, great musicianship, and outstanding engineering. Arjen plays most instruments and sings on occasion, is accompanied by several guest musicians, eight male and three female vocalists, and Ed Warby pounds the skins with authority. The story is kind of silly (man in coma deals with various issues/emotions subconsciously) and there is a sort of unexpected conclusion. Over 102 minutes long, this 2 CD set loaded with great music speaks for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Tribute!","review":"Jani Lane and John Corabi fans non withstanding, the real star of the show here is Colie Brice (ex Phantom's Opera) who delivers a stunning, bombastic rocktronic version of \\"Runaway\\" and a trippy, whimsical version of \\"Always\\". Colie sounds like a dead ringer for Jon Bon Jovi and indeed pays tribute to his fellow graduate of Sayreville War Memorial High School... A must have for true Bon Jovi fans as Colie used to the singer for Phantom's Opera who at one time included Alec Jon Such, Tico Torres and Dean Fasano who was in Message with Richie Sambora."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-have!","review":"My son LOVES the Captain Bob books and I love reading them.

They are essentially the same book, but \\"Windy Willows\\" is the European publication and that's the publication I wanted and expected. As I said, the story is essentially the same in both books.

It feels like an academic toss-off, designed for the layperson with a fleeting interest, who will leaf through it like a magazine. To swim through the author's disjointed and often autobiographical slough to arrive at the occasional chunks of interesting stuff is simply not worthwhile. On page 9, the author describes his attitude toward his doctoral thesis (...I stayed up, slept late, frequented cafes in the long afternoons, wrote and unpublished novel and an unperformable play, watched far too many old movies, and diligently avoided my supervisor...) Replace 'supervisor' with 'lit agent', and we may have discovered Newton's approach to book writing as well.It's a wonder that a writer could take such a fascinating subject matter and make it so annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Literary Reflection","review":"The book is not about the children as much as it is about how different cultures and eras have perceived individual \\"wild children\\" and speculations on the notion of boundaries between the wild and civilized. In fact, most of the stories of feral children are \\"alleged\\", since there seem to be no confirmed instances of wild children actually raised by animals. The nearest \\"authentic\\" examples are a few miserable cases of children confined alone in rooms from infancy and a brief mention of a Russian street child who roamed with a dog pack for 2 years. Interesting tidbits, as others have noted, linking Freud, Tarzan, Jack London, and the Cub Scouts, for instance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery of Edwin Drood","review":"I have read several books by Charles Dickens and this by far was the worst. I was beginning to think Charles Dickens was in a laudanum fog when he wrote this because his choice of words throughout what he wrote of the work was confusing and made little sense.

Even though Charles Dickens died before he finished this book, his story has intrigued people since it was first published.

This book is good for hard core historians, lovers of illuminated pages, medieval history or art buffs and any one in love with line, color and decoration for the sake of decoration. Alexander and Pacht are clear knowledgeable writers who love to point out the details and side stories that make art and history so facinating to comb through.

Especially interesting are his descriptions of how he innocently became involved with top mobster Mickey Cohen and how Cohen drew him into his world, bit by bit.This book reads like a Sam Spade thriller and would make for a great film noir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - I was there!","review":"I was an associate of Mickey's.

Steve was respectful of my privacy and kept me out of his book. Thanks Steve, you were always a stand up guy. As far as the review where the mook said Steve was being self indulgent, I have something to say. You are all wet pal. Steve's book captures the mood of that time and how Mickey operated.

It is clearly a propaganda film that shows Mao as a happy man who cares for everybody, nearly the exact opposite of real life. It has some interesting scenes of Chinese daily life. Credits include a few italian film makers, so maybe the Chinese had some help putting this together. In some ways it was interesting to see a staged color film of Mao (an actor) rather than grainy black and white images. A lot of extras were used to show the fanaticism around Mao."},{"rating":"2","title":"great descriptions and detail","review":"Da Chen's sequel to his first memoir, Colors of the Mountain, picks up where is his first book left off.

What I find most useful is the discussion of what did not make it to the screen. Russo discusses scenes, such as that between Tony Curtis and Laurence Olivier in Spartacus, which were removed before release. These scenes may not have impacted society as much as final scenes, but they are important when conidering the internal politics that shaped Hollywood. Russo is careful to acknowledge both the negative and positive aspects of visability, and to distinguish between visability and comic stereotyping. Probably more useful as a reference book than an enjoyable read, this book is packed with useful information from which people can start their own research/opinion making"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic in its field","review":"Russo, now deceased, published the first edition of this book in 1981, in the dark ages before queer independent cinema, and before mainstream cinema began the tradition of giving every female lead a gay man for a best buddy -- back when gay men appeared only as swishy queens or psychotic killers, and lesbians appeared only as psychotic killers, period. He exhumed hundreds of long-forgotten films, from moody German expressionism through the fluffy bedroom farces of the 1950's, and created an invaluable survey of the way movies look at gay people, comparable in scope to Donald Bogle's survey of African-Americans in film, \\"Toms, Coons, Mulattos, Mammies, and Bucks.\\" We desperately need an update, but for everything from Laurel and Hardy shorts to \\"Personal Best,\\" this is the place to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something special","review":"You know you're reading a good book when you find yourself purposefully delaying the conclusion to savour the experience longer.

If your car was totaled in an accident, this will still hold your bikes, and the bike rack would still be attached to the car!!! Got this rack after a previous one had a strap failure dumping/dragging the bikes on the road.The only down side to this rack is the bolts/knobs that clamps the plate down to lock the bikes to the rack - the bolts are fine thread and there are a lot of threads, takes quite a few turns to get it off, but no big deal - in fact these fine thread bolts are added strength, not that it is needed, but it is there.After disengaging a 2 lock system which (takes only seconds) bikes swing easily out of the way of the trunk area- engaging the locks are even faster, the first lock just clicks in place...Overall a great design in its simplicity, strength and function.NOTHING is better, and I had a few other racks to compare!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What size are these?","review":"Amazon.com Product DescriptionUse these AA batteries...What's in the BoxEighteen twin packs of AA batteriesProduct DescriptionDuracell Coppertop AAA 2-Packand the picture shows AAA..

While this sounds like a great idea, be mindful of the costs involved and also the longevity of the product.[...]Total cost: [...]- assuming you make no mistakes; and that the cost of the 2x4's are in this range. The problem I have with this is two-fold:1. 2x4 studs are not weatherproof. In time they will warp and crack and turn color. I would not consider pressure treated for obvious reasons and anything beyond that (Cedar, redwood or even the composite-plastic boards are phenomenally expensive). At that point, the price of this project will rival your aluminum patio tables.2. Maintenance - you will have to stain/weatherproof each year. These are added costs in maintaining the item.SUMMARY:Nice idea in theory. I love building things, however, save your money and INVEST a bit extra in an all aluminum patio table that will last a long time and not need continual maintenance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril the Whole Picture - missing 8 years .","review":"This is advertised as covering Avril Lavigne 10 year career .

The top snap is on the back side of the unit which makes it less than convenient to access. When the phone is removed from the holster, the flap just hangs sloppily. The fit was especially tight too. I have the original LG Chocolate (VX8500) which is a little bigger than the later version, but it claims to be a fit for the original. The belt clip places the phone a bit farther from the hip than I care for too. It makes it hard to detect a call when on vibrate mode. The one good thing is that the screen is visible. That's important when I'm driving my motorcycle and I can't hear it or feel the vibration.

Also, you must unsnap the plastic cover to slide the phone open! That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case). With the jacket on, receiving calls is not a problem, but to access the menus and other functions that require the phone to be slid open, you must unsnap, then slide.

Like other reviewers have mentioned, the cylinders will end up rolling everywhere... under the couch, the t.v., etc., so it's kind of annoying to keep digging them out, but scattering the pieces and watching them roll is half the fun for the baby. If you plan on giving this to an infant, just be sure to watch them closely or take away the light green piece... it seemed a little dangerous when I saw my baby chewing on the end of it.

I also met the offspring of people involved in the story. They, along with many other residents of Oxford confirmed what I already suspected. Much of this story is COMPLETELY MADE UP! Some of the events did actually happen, but are blown WAAAAAY out of proportion, and the means by which Mr. Tyson acquired some of his information are very shady. So my verdict: as a piece of fiction I think it's a beautifully tragic piece of fictions.

I find it interested that the whites are depicted as \\"terrorists\\" and the blacks as \\"military operators\\".As I know that many so called \\"facts\\" are not so, (names, events, locations, etc.) I have to suspect the remainder of the book.

THere's almost nothing at all about his few compositions, how he choose the songs to recording, who were his musicians, what were his techniques in a studio recording,hia ability with thu guitar, his favourite guitars, his favourite musicians as time went by, nothing! THere's only plenty of girlfriends, plenty of pills, plenty of nasty histories. If you're buying this book because you're a music (rock'n roll) fan, forget it. If you wanna buy it because you wanna know ELvis just like you hear about any other movie star, for example, then this is the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johns got the Goods!","review":"Excellent solo outing from the chairman of Steppenwolf. John Kay has always been a rock and roll social conscious for the American ideal and he serves us up a great selection of thought provoking tunes on this effort. \\"Sleep with one eye open\\" will make you revist the past couple of years headlines and cause you consternation at the very least. It ranks up their with \\"Monster\\" in making us take a look at ourselves. Only this time, this song and the rest take a domestic and humanistic approach rather than the harsh look at US foreign policy. Overall this is an excellent CD that has a blues feel to it, and with the subject matter of John's lyrics it is a perfect match."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great John Kay","review":"This is a brilliant CD with John Kay's social commentary and a traditional blues style. He has always been one of my favorite artists but I think this is the best work he's done yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Favorite CD's","review":"I am a long time fan of John Kay - the first album I ever bought was \\"Steppenwolf Live\\".But, that's not why this CD rated 5 stars. Even though most of the songs are literally electric (there are a few \\"acoustic versions\\"), the overall feel is one of Steppenwolf Unplugged. These songs are sometimes politial, sometimes personal. The style is closer to the blues than folk, but it is definitely in the vein of the early folk movement (Pete Seger, Woody Guthrie, et al)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster","review":"One of my favorite blues rock renditions. Kays voice is still raspy & bluesy - which makes this CD so good. Make sure when you key in for this CD you type in the album name. Few people know this CD is available with 4 extra killer acoustic versions at a cheaper price. Dions Bronx blues is also on an equal level with this excellent CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary Law Guide For Authors","review":"This book is extremely informative and insightful.

The album touches on timeless themes such as love, loss, freedom, and the spirit of adventure.My favorite pieces are \\"Full Circle\\" because it brings me back to my own memories and \\"An American Romance\\" because the end of this piece puts me on a horse galloping across the plains toward a crimson sunsent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gorgeous, profound album.","review":"Bittersweet\\" explores all the complex emotions of life in hauntingly beautiful, contemplative compositions.

Some things were ok but I wouldn't ever recommend this book to anyone else who loves a good read such as myself. My sister also attempted to read this book and stopped before she reached page 20. Every one is entitled to their opinion so you decide? But I didn't like it. I found myself rolling my eyes and feeling pressured to finish it.

These two are pretty pure--maybe too poppy for those Gillian Welch fans--but Pete and Maura could easily do clean, clear water public service announcements in character. On a grey, rainy, cold New England morning this record will put spring in your heart. Warm and fun too (Galaxy Express).

Living in an apartment and saving every dollar for my wedding I don't have the room, nor the funds, for bulky gym equipment.After only 2 weeks of following Buff Bride's workout program I can already feel the results. The exercises require very liitle equipment and are less time consuming than picking out bridesmaid dresses. Planning for a June wedding has left me with little time to think of myself and how I will look in my strapless wedding dress. However, the exercises in Buff Brides are illustrated, to the point, and results driven. In June, I know I will have the confidence to wear my strapless gown and I'm incredibly thankful to Buff Brides for helping me look my best.I certainly recommend Buff Brides for every bride, whether you need the confidence to look great in your gown or you are just looking to tone up, you will find it in Buff Brides.Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buff Brides: an AWESOME workout that works!","review":"I have been using the Buff Brides 24-week workout program (there's a 12-week program, too) for 5 weeks now and I'm seeing a lot of results.

I used to go to the gym, but had gotten lazy the past year or so. This program is great for beginners to those who already work out a lot, just want to work out at home. It takes very little equipment and space. It does take time. With 30 minutes of cardio added, the workout takes me a little over an hour and a half, 3 days a week. It moves to 4 days a week of strength training as you get closer to the 12-week mark.

Easy to read, understand, and I enjoy how the workouts vary from day to day.

I always feel great afterwards and I appreciate that the author takes into consideration how a beginner should start out and then increase the challenge over time. It's also nice that it only requires basic equipment and minimal space. I'm not getting married anymore and I still love this book. My only complaint is the same as many of the other reviewers... the binding really should be spiral bound. It's not THAT much of a hassle as I use a bookmark to track what page I'm on as I workout, but it would make it considerably easier to be able to lay the book flat.

It was just a series of short adventures for two kids at the lake.It's not a bad book - it just isn't interesting. It's not very well written, has no suspense, doesn't teach any particular moral or lesson. In short - it's chloroform for kids.Get something from Mark Twain, or Jack London, or C.S. Lewis for your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone Away Lake has a Gone Away Theme","review":"At first the book looks like it will be interesting with numerous twists and turns. Alas, I found myself anticipating some type of conflict to arise between the characters, until the very last page. Nothing happens. The book can be quickly summed up in a few short sentences; Two children go on vacation. Stumble upon two old people who live in the past. The end. I was always taught that a good novel has certain components... and having some type of conflict happen to the characters was one of them.

Then I read the book and kept on thinking to abandon it. But then when I finished the book, I realized my mistake. The book Gone-Away Lake is too happy and there are no problems to it whatsoever. It also catches your eye by its title because it sounds so mysterious, but that book just didn't work that way.

Back in the Baroque period you were expected to improvise on people like Bach and Handel because they didn't think their music would last as long as it did.

The intros are slow-paced like real classical music, and the first really good song is on Track 5. But having listened to 'Shine' and now this album, I have to say I liked their original sound much better.There's so much processing applied to these tracks that the ladies have taken a backseat to a SYNTHESIZER BEATBOX. It's obscene, and totally incorrect to boot, for the real musicians to get tossed in the background while some skinny, pasty recording engineer gets to pile layer after layer of samples and synth and...whatever else they use, ultimately smothering both the ladies' skill and the classical songs they're playing.Don't buy this CD.

Father Joachim (Gerard Depardieu), the priest-surgeon assigned to the nun's case, is mystified by her ailment and fascinated when its cause cannot be determined. Perhaps he sees in the young woman's secretiveness a reflection of his own violent past? What is the connection between these cases and the mysterious words \\"screel deen\\" that the nun screams in her agonies?The filmmaker strings us along for the better part of an hour, as we tease out the mysterious connections. We are treated to mysterious voodoo rituals on the beach, a nosy journalist wannabe, an improbably love story and a mother with secrets of her own. There is so much deliberate confusion and unclear switched identities that by the end, I wasn't sure what happened and I cared even less.BTW: This film is rated R only for 1 shot of a nun binding her breasts during the opening credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twins, Priests,Nuns,Murder,Cover-Up,Lies and Truth","review":"THE PACT OF SILENCE is a much ado about nothing film.

The \\"blade\\" of the key has no hole for placement on a key ring; just the head does. The result is that keeping up with the keys will become a real issue.

I am replacing this thing before I lose the keys and can't remove the lock easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compilation of Great Advice for ALL Parents.","review":"Being an avid Parents magazine subscriber, I turn through their pages every month searching for advice from parents across the country. It's almost like sitting in a room, sharing your best ideas with hundreds of other parents. Although Parents magazine features this every month, it's amazing that they've created an entire BOOK about this useful information. At least one in five of these tips could work for you. Creativity from around the nation combines into these pages to provide you with unforgettable hints and tips to make parenting a LITTLE easier and more fun for the kids. I've learned a lot in the past two years from just other parents' advice and strategies. It also helps you stimulate alternative ways of disciplining your children. I recommend this book to all parents willing to learn a little more about themselves and their children. Instead of arguing and cleaning up, you'll spend more quality time with the little people you love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Krups instead","review":"This thing worked OK for a few months but then it started falling apart.The unit is not very solid.I wish I had bought Krups one instead which has excellent reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"too dry","review":"Have had this waffle maker for nearly a year and no matter what recipe or setting I use the waffles always come out dry and tasteless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get something else!!!","review":"I got this waffle maker as a gift so I can't say it's not worth the money.

I don't know why the developers did not include a draft but it is absolutely ridiculous. Second of all, the player's look totally unrealistic their bodies are unporportional and they run like robots. There is no depth chart so if you wanted to put a running back at a wide receiver position you couldn't. This game is ridiculously bad. Madden is much better so don't waste your money on this trash.

However, halfway through the first chapter I grew bored from the exhausting use of sci-fi imagery and tedious storyline. This is not a book for Cubs fans. It is a childish plot and has little or nothing to offer in the realm of enjoyment. I have to wonder, with all the possible stories that could have been told about this hopeful event, why was this one so lame? As an avid Cubs fan, I truly hope it happens in my lifetime and I certainly hope that, when it does, it won't put me to sleep like Harper Scott's version did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Wonderfully funny.

I'm a very slow reader and it takes me about a month to finish a book (if I even finish)... not this one! I couldn't put it down. I admit, the first 20 pages (or so) were hard to get through. However, once I got through the first couple chapters I couldn't put the book down until I finished. The book captivated me so much I finished reading it in a day! I think this is a good book for any Cubs fan with a sense of humor. I wish this was a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare talent","review":"I saw this man open up for Daniel Lanois in San Juan Capistrano and was blown away. This album has some songs (including the opening track) that are just plain beautiful. He is unique, and perhaps the closest comparison I can make is to Patty Griffin. His voice is that good, although more frail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential, but failed badly.","review":"I liked the basic premise the film was based on, the amateurish home movie rumor of the Manson family. I didn't even mind the fact that it is silent. The movie is awful because like other reviewers below said, the guy in this movie doesn't even resemble Manson, except he's got a beard. There is no acting, or even attempt at acting. When several of the characters that are supposed to be women are actually men in obvious drag, and they act ridiculous, the movie lost all hope for me. It fails in every category. Tongue in cheek or not. This movie is wasted money. It's sad when the best part of a DVD are the extras, and indeed with Manson Family Movies, you should skip watching the movie and go directly to the extras. Avoid wasting precious 88 minutes of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title, yawnfest","review":"Those who expect authentic home movies made by Charlie and company will be sad to learn that all of those films are either destroyed, or in vaults in the desert.Not actually related to Manson or his family at all, these cheap, D-grade productions are neither interesting nor relevant to the case in any way. Unfortunately, because of the title and the legend of sex-filled, violent tapings of various criminal activities in the canyons and dirt roads outside of Los Angeles, many people have come to the (incorrect) conclusion that these are rare, rediscovered actual tapes made by Manson or his friends at Spahn.Just a cheap fake snuff fest, this will only appeal to the grotesquely sick, semi-insane individuals who like Cannibal Holocaust or other fake-realistic gore-laden horror smut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the $4.99.00 Price","review":"Very good documentary - 12 hours of detailed information about Hitler. As a history teacher - it bothers me to see our American textbooks saying that America's refusal to join the league of Nations after WWI caused WWII - that is nothing but politically correct - revisionist history. This documentary points out how Germany, under Hitler, wanted to right the wrongs of 1918 - yes - it was the allies in Europe who cased WWII - because of their unjust treatment of Germany after WWI. An excellent buy for the true WWII enthusiast.Larry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spare the time","review":"Spirituality development and growth can be difficult in these modern times.

The reader is right beside her as she relates her holy experiences in the context of a more circumscribed religious community. Her search for the triumph of good over evil is lengthy yet in the end her rewards are inspirational. Her humility is apparent, while her sincerity is unquestionable.

I love all the songs on this cd. It came looking exactly as is shown above. Unlike a lot of Bob Marley CD's out there, this one has his most famous songs. Many other CD's claim to have his greatest hits, but only have a few. It also has a neat little booklet, explaining his life and his accomplishments. There are also lyrics in this booklet. I love this cd!! It is without a doubt the best of Bob!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Collection","review":"Bob Marley is an artist of such stature that it's easy to argue that no collection could do fair service to him, but that's really beside the point.This collection is a great starting point for anybody interested in the music of this great talent. Is it complete? Of course not. No one disk could be. That shouldn't detract from the fact that this album is an amazing selection of music, great song after great song.Yes, the emphasis is towards Marley's most accessible, popular songs ... but that's how it should be. Every fan will have their own favorites that they'd love to see on a disk like this, but for somebody just getting started with the music of this amazing man, it's hard to imagine a better starting place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD.","review":"This cd has every great song by the inmortal Bob Marley.

Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Doubt an Excellent Album, but....","review":"There is no doubt this is an Excellent album. However, I must take issue with the inclusion of FIVE songs from the album Exodus. I am sure that any attempt to limit a Bob Marley compilation to 16 songs is the stuff of nightmares, but it is an injustice to include no songs from Survival. Furthermore, Natty Dread and Burnin' are far and away better albums than Exodus. However, there are only three songs (total) from those two albums on Legend (at least the live version of No Woman No Cry was included). Having said that, Legend is an excellent album, giving us a sample of some quality Bob Marley. Certainly the best cuts from Exodus are here. As far as compilations go, however, the four-CD set Songs of Freedom is more thorough. Otherwise, Legend is a good introduction to Bob Marley. I highly recommend this album. In fact, I highly recommend all his albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly one of the greatest albums, meaningful, beautiful","review":"My parents were playing this album when I was ten.

This set is a nice casual introduction to the band that started the worldwide reggae movement. it was released in 1984 3 years after Bob Marley died, and includes many hits that you are probably familiar with. Songs from all the albums are not included here which is the only downfall of this disc. The booklet that comes with the cd is a good way to learn about this legendary man and his band the Wailers. The Wailers are one of the most talented groups of musicians ever, and the instrumentation and variety on this disc proves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"too cleaned up for the purist","review":"have a couple cassette tapes of cheap studio time-love the earthiness of his sound. you can hear the steel drums and the rushing of the dunns river falls in his music. this cd is too cleaned up. no rasta here, mon. guess i need to find his older stuff for the sound i crave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, a bit depressing","review":"Bottom line: Bob Marley is the king of Reggae.

This reissue has improved and great sound, all the lyics and a good essay on Bob, and 2 new \\"bonus\\" tracks that emphasize good time party Bob. But the single best reason to toss your old Legend and buy this one is that it has, at last, the full length version of Exodus. There was never an excuse for having the shorter version of this great song on CD and it always took away from the album for me. Now Legend is the perfect CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for any true fan","review":"Anyone with taste is going to love this album. Has classic Marley tunes that even the most cursery reggae fan will know. While I don't consider myself by any stretch a true reggae afficinado, this is the one album I own on vinyl, tape and now CD. One Love, which frankly I skip over becuase all I can think of are the commercials now when I hear it, is still a great didity. For Eric Clapton fans, here the orginal version of I Shot the Sheriff. Buffalo Soldier and others are just truly classic songs. From begining to end this CD is wonderful. The two bonus tracks are OK and don't take anything away, but also don't add much to this wonderful collection. VH1, for those who care, has this listed as one of the Ultimate Albums. If you've never listened to reggae before, there is no better place to start than with this artist and this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Great Collection.","review":"I love Bob Marley. His music is uplifting, pretty, and great to chill out to.

This was the first Bob Marley album I bought and I definately think its a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll be jamming with out the Marley, thank you.","review":"First off, I'm not a reggae guy. I think the music is really phony and it doesn't say anything. Supposedly it's angry music but to me it is a really superficial sound. Second, I think the music is about the most unnerving and grating music ever performed by human musicians. Also, I don't get the 'We Be Jamming' thing. I know it's only a 5 minute song but to me it feels like it just goes on and on. I'd say if you're a conformist, and person that doesn't enjoy standing out of the crowd then buy this album. However, if you cherish individuality and evolution in art then you won't need any of this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont like him","review":"I dont see anything in this guy.

Bob Marley's musical talent, from songwriting to composition to instrumental skill, are nicely showcased here. From this album I have branched out to other reggae greats: Peter Tosh, Yellowman, Burning Spear, Steel Pulse, etc. I love not only the music itself but the message. You have to listen to the lyrics to understand the power of the message behind the music. Reggae is so much more than just feel-good party music (though it has that in spades). And it's not just about smoking pot, either. Marley had a very serious political and social message to offer. The fact that it is carried in such an enjoyable format just makes it all the more appealing. If you like reggae, you gotta have this album.

The reggae sound makes his music unique and pioneering, the catchiness makes the songs appealing on a \\"pop\\" level, and the soul and spirit of Bob's voice makes the lyrics as meaningful and poignant today as they were in the 1970s. Every song on here is a gem, from the slow jamming of \\"I Want to Love You,\\" the upbeat and steady guitar of \\"Could you Be Loved,\\" and the soulful live version of \\"No Woman No Cry.\\" Bob Marley died young and tragically, and it's impossible to predict whether the rest of his life would have proven to be as creatively brilliant and prolific. Nonetheless, this album deserves all the praise it has been given over the years. It is a nice introduction to Bob's legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective track 7","review":"great cd if all the tracks worked.

Some of the songs have almost become a lifestyle. There is loads of variation and each song is absolutely unique and special. I love the mellowness and flow of the songs. The greatest thing about this album is that it was released soon after Bob's tragic death and, since it is by far his best and most famous album, it caused him to be unforgotten and always be remembered as one of the greatest musicians of all times. This album reflects that to the fullest extent and that deserves five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely IRIE !!!!","review":"Even though Bob has been gone for some time now, his music still inspires and stirs the soul.

This book does a great job of reminding us to try to do our best with what life offers. Even if we don't succeed, we can be secure in the knowledge we really tried. We perhaps gain more for the honest effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's saving lives!","review":"This is a book that is saving people's lives. I give high praise to Joyce Brown for being willing to share these private personal experiences so that others may find joy in living. I recommend this book to anyone struggling with finding meaning in life, and especially to those contemplating suicide. It can help. It can send you to your knees to give prayers of gratitude for being able to live in this beautiful world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gauze curtains","review":"These curtains were just what I was looking for except for the length.

I purchased this CD not knowing what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised. The music is upbeat and fast paced.

It is for anyone - spanish-speaking or english-speaking, adult or child!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock?

She has not let this cat out of her sight. She takes it everywhere and sleeps with it. It's nice and softly plush, and very child friendly. I think what my daughter likes best is that it's actually cat-sized, which makes it easy for her to carry and hug in her sleep. The cat makes a soft purring sound if you press the nose area, which the girls think it great. So far it's been easy to wipe clean. It also looks exactly like the movie version rather than just being similar. That's wonderful for a stuffed cat, to be recognizable as the cat in the movie, which all of my daughters watch regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"My granddaughter loves it!","review":"I gave this to my 2 year old granddaughter and she loves it.

My 2 year old son loves Huckle and Lowly the worm -- since we have a Mother Goose book, the songs are all familiar to him and that much more fun to see in action. The animation is not jerky and fast like some other videos and is a perfect 30 minutes in length.

The writer's attempt to weave John Wilkes Booth as an escaped assassin is not only historically inaccurate but a failed attempt at making the story that is told more interesting. The last half of the film portrays only one of several legends associated with Hell's Gate when three thieves are caught and killed by Indians in the hills of Possum Kingdom Lake, Texas. While the acting is strong, the film is ruined by the disjointed and questionably relevant introductory sequences and failure to develop its stated theme. Artist expression or failed attempt at storytelling? You decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Legend of Hell's Gate...","review":"Waste of time and money.

The roof of the Murano is curved and there are seams on each side that prevent proper adhesion of the deflector to the roof. I installed following the directions to the letter and the deflector worked great the first day. The second day I noticed that the corners had already started to come unstuck (2-4 inches on each side). This clearly posed a safety hazard as it was only a matter of time before the deflector came off at high speed in the rain or snow. I unfortunately had to return because it would not work with my car's roof design.All in all this is probably not a bad product for cars with a flat, seamless roof."},{"rating":"1","title":"NG Save your $$$","review":"Remember Jason and the Argonauts from the 60-70's.

For example, Warren Buffett previously described his method of discounting companies in other articles, and it does not match the author's description.I can see how this book would be highly rated to someone not familiar with the details of Buffett's own articles and letters. But in my opinion, the book appears to only about 80% in agreement Buffett's previous writings. This book can give the reader a good overview of Warren Buffett's methods if they do not pay strict attention to the author's details."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books ever written on investing","review":"1) The first quote on the back cover is from Mary Buffett. Mary's claim to fame is that she divorced Warren's son and then got into the investment book business. If you can't do that 'math' or you buy into the '*****' reviews for this book I've got a bridge I'd like to sell you. 2) Throw out the chapter on 'Warren on Arbitrage'. I've worked in equity arb. Most of this chapter is either outright false or highly misleading. 3) Entire sections of this book read as if they were excerpted from Hagstrom's or John Train's books. 4) The only reason I didn't give this book zero stars was it had some nice quips about value investing in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Buffet way...","review":"This is book says it about Buffet's way of picking stocks, but it is not. I'm sure Buffet would scream if he ever read this book. It not only isn't Buffet's strategy, it is bad advise too. Don't buy this book.

This book stinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Value, Value and nothing but Value","review":"What a great book to read when the market is rethinking its value. Vicks, along with Buffett preach value, and as the market is trying to adjust to very high valuations this book is a wake-up call to investors. Only buy quality, and only at the right price. Even good stocks can become over valued, then they become expensive good stocks that we shouldn't buy. Be patient and buy good stocks at the right price.

The constant harrassment from the authorities made his life unbearable as it would any of us. His life became split into two realities. The one which the media made him out to be and his own: deep, creative, exploring. Two Jims, two personalities, intertwined yet separate. One very happy and one very very sad. Reading this book made me understand that he had to disappear. But, is Jim dead or not? Well, we do know there is much mystery about it. This book put my spirit at ease with any of the many possibilities. Mind expanding so to speak!

I have it for the Xbox and I have played 3 hours and am enticed by its atmosphere. First off, the commentary is first rate, hearing gary thorne holler \\"SCOOOOREE\\" is a nice way to cap off a goal. Bill clement also adds in some astout comments. But wat i like most about this game is the fact that there is a skills mode. This is great for when my friends come over because we don't have to go through a whole hockey game and can get rite to the action.Also I like the fact that the gameplay is so realistic. Scoring is really rewarding because its a challenge. You rarely blow the comp out on Pro and games are usualy within the 2 goal deficits.

While there, we meet some very interesting characters including a not-so-helpful bartender, and a strangely attractive young man who seems way to desperate for Raven to tell him who she's looking for.I'll let you read what happens from there and decide on your own, but this book is truely more eventful than Vampire Kisses and kept me quite glued to my seat.

Josh has a vibrant voice, very rich and compelling to listen to. I played the CD, then played it again, and plan to play it in my car CD player on my way to work, as his music is cheering and perfect to start my day off with - and end it too. I was never convinced that his genre should be country alone, and I still think he could handle any genre with panache, but he is most comfortable with country pop, and this CD demonstrates that. He apparently made a good decision to \\"go country\\" and I predict a fine career for this talented guy and I wish him well.

I was pleasantly surprised. A lot of the songs, such as I Want to Live and Brass Bed, are pop-ish country- that is, they'd go in the category with Faith Hill and LeAnn Womack. But the CD is also diverse, with very county and enjoyable songs like \\"Nothing to Lose.\\" My personal favorite is The Other Little Soldier, a sweet ballad about a boy who lost his father in a war.

On the CD, that is. On American Idol is a different story. I have no idea what they did to his voice here, but this doesn't sound like him. All the way through the top twelve, he just continued to get worse and worse. The only reason why he got as far as he did was because he was in the military and we were at war at the time. If he weren't in the military or if we weren't at war, he wouldn't have made it as far as he did. Those who want to dispute me do not want to face facts: Josh Gracin has no real talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated.... way overrated","review":"It's not that Josh Gracin is painful to listen to, but the problem is he just isn't any good at all. He went farther than he should have on American Idol, and his CD will probably sell more than it should (compared to other deserving artists). His lack of writing ability and the fact that he can't play any instruments leave his voice as the only thing that he can be artistically judged by. Which would be fine if his voice was good, but it isn't. If it does sound good at times, its because the synthesizer was able to help alot... and other times, its just downright worse than a kareoke bar. No offense to Josh or any of his fans, but anyone who hadn't seen him on American Idol that wasn't a blind follower of anyone from that show will not like this CD as anything more than overproduced pop music that doesn't sound very good and isn't that catchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"I got this album when it first came out.

Any good artist can do much better in the studio. I am a Josh Gracin fan and I believe he will do well. I am listening to his album for the first time while I surf the web and write this review.

I had learned all his songs and knew them all by heart by the time new songs came out on the radio.

The songs on this album represent the worst kind of insincere tripe, full of false emotions and faked attempts at honesty. Gracin is clearly in this just for the money and is so full of himself as to believe those who support him, who are also riding on his coattails and hoping he becomes a bigger star than he is. His talent, what little there is off it, is undeveloped and unworthy of the time it would take to actually listen to this album. In another 5 to 10 years he might be worth a first album.

(I liked the bar fight & the fight in the church, but the shoolyard fight between Matt Murdock & Elektra was just plain ridiculous & corny!) Matt Murdock's character & background were fully developed (though illogically changed from the comic-book original. He doesn't save a blind man anymore. He just gets caught in a loading accident.)But everything else about this movie is RUSHED. Fast-pacing for an action film is necessary, but everything else, from the Kingpin's introduction, to Elektra's relationship with Daredevil (& no, she's NOT a ninja in this movie the way she is in the comic-book, because she doesn't live elong enough to become a paid mercenary!) is just way to quick.If they have a sequel, let's hope they'll get it right the second time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078","review":"Ben Affleck is a tool.

Not you money, your time, or your energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"This has to be the worst Marvel movie ever. The movie is not true to the comic at all. First of all, Daredevil's origin is completely changed (he became blind when he saved a man from crossing the street!). The movie also has terrible casting. Sure, Ben Affleck and Colin Farrell did great as their characters, but Jennifer Garner as Elektra?!? Pleaase...Elektra is supposed to be a deadly assassin with looks to die for. And oh yeah, Greek also. Casting for the Kingpin was terrible as well. Michael Clarke Duncan might be a very big person, but he is not Wilson Fisk. Way too many characters were introduced at once, completely ruining the movie. Directors need to stop trying to make movies based on comics for non-comic readers; they should be made for fans who read the comics and stay true to the original stories. Marvel and Avi Arad: Stop ruining good comics like Daredevil and the Hulk with movies with weak story lines!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo!","review":"Omg, this movie was TERRIBLE, ben affleck....need i say more i mean come one ben affleck is in it!!

The entire vigilante to hero angle is a new and major one and a gutsy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is Hollywood thinking","review":"Okay honestly, I liked this movie, but there are quite a few people out there that didn't care for the theatrical release of this movie. What makes Hollywood think they can rip people off by selling them a special edition less than 2 years after the original hit DVD. How greedy can Hollywood get.

The story left little to be desired, and by the end I was ready to run out of my friend's house, cursing Ben Affleck.

I really enjoyed this film and I recently found myself in the graphic novel section of the bookstore picking up Daredevil reprints. The comics and the bonus material on the DVD filled me in on Daredevil's history and it seems that he's been both a devil-may-care 60's comic character and a more dark hard-boiled character. This film tries to bring both versions to the screen and it works. It's a great intro to the world of Daredevil. Even if you've never heard of Daredevil you should still give this DVD a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"The darker side works","review":"I really enjoyed Spiderman and all but after seeing Daredevil I have to say I liked it better. I was a real fan of it in the comics and loved the dark side of the character.

Turns out it's neither. It seems more british than american, the way it's edited to barely let you in on what's going on. The establishment and development of characters fits somewhere between slow and non-existant, and as if the premise of a blind superhero wasn't dumb enough the fight scenes seem specifically designed to induce laughter. By the halfway point the movie hasn't created any excitement or set up any plot points for you to anticipate the resolution of, something any decent action movie should do in the first 15 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie watching maybe once, but not more","review":"I found this movie to be dark and violent. I don't know if it was the acting or the writing, but it just didn't click with me.

Daredevil is it.While remaining true to the spirit of the comic, the four lead characters thrill us with their exploits. The costumes were great, and while there is definitely story, the action is perfectly weaved within the plot.The hour long documentary with the comic writers was excellent. The hour long movie dialogue was OK, although some parts lagged. All in all, I could not be happier with the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Movie.

Have you been awake during the times of STUPIDITY? I mean man this has got to be the lamest movie. The action was good and the acting ok and the rest well let me see...[was bad]! The music was the best part of the movie and so were a couple of the fight scenes. When Elektra and \\"Daredevil\\" are fighting that was dumb when she didn't kill him I mean she had a clear shot at him and she takes the time to take off his mask when all that precious time she could have cut him up. So Elektra and \\"Bull's Eye\\" Fight and the Sai through her hand was awesome and then there she goes of course that's it and the movie get's pretty dull from there and that is all i have to say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great comedy.....","review":"My little sister rented this movie cos she watches Alias. She said it was an action movie but I laughed so hard at it, I was convinced by the end that it was comedy.Wooden acting, predictable story with all the cliches and the worst offence in my opinion failed attempts to emulate HongKong kung fu films. Affleck and Garner fumble through every fight scene relying on editing to mask their ineptness. Just look at there playground confrontation, they are both sluggish and Affleck seems completely lost in the choreography.Stick with HongKong films, they have being making superior action flicks for like the last three decades. If you can read comic books, then subtitles shouldn't be a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't Afflecks fault, but..","review":"Daredevil is the worst comic to screen adaption since Batman Forever. Lots of high dollar effects, disconnected characters that we can not connect with and a city that feels like a rehash Gotham from one of the Batman movies of the 90's. It's just that bad. Also the their's a upsetting mid-movie event (won't spoil it for those who must see this) that leaves little hope for the ending.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if your 8","review":"I found this movie to be a complete disappointment. Ben Affleck is good at chasing lesbians, but being the infamous Daredevil.... I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed some work","review":"The film Daredevil is the first in a string of comic book movies hoping to cash in on the success of Spider-man and X-men. While it could've been a very good film some major points hold it back.Ben Affleck stars as Matt Murdock, a lawyer blinded at the age of 12 from some acid. While he can't see, he has more power in his remaining four senses. He soon meets Elektra (Jennifer Garner) who he falls in love with. Soon after Daredevil runs into Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) who wants Elektra's father dead by an assassin named Bullseye (Colin Farrell)The film has some major flaws though. The fights aren't as polished as they should be, the characters (Everyone of them except Daredevil) needed some major character development done, and finally, the dialogue sounds corny.If the rest of the comic-book movies are like this I don't want to see them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"Nothing happened in this entire movie. Do you know who the Kingpin is and why he does what he does? I don't, and I've grown up reading about the character! Atrocious acting (Michael Clark Duncan is WAY overrated, Ben Affleck is emotionless) and a terrible non-existent script make me ashamed for Hollywood in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daredevil=One of the worst movies ever made!","review":"Omfg! I absolutely hated this movie! It made no sense at all! Actually the only reason I picked up the movie (thankfully it was rented!) was because Evanescence music was in the movie and I was just curious. Movies like these make me want to believe that movies with good soundtracks aren't worth watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful! Awfullllll!","review":"Oh my God, I haven't seen Gigli but I can't imagine it being any worse than this terrible, terrible film. The thing that kills me is that there are good writers in the world...why are they hiring the people that put together this awful, cliche-ridden, cheesy voice-over using, put-the-exposition-and-motivation-right-in-the-characters'-mouths junk! And i have to say, I really like Ben Affleck, and I LOVE Jennifer Garner, so I just don't know what the heck is going on here. As I might have mentioned before, the script is terrible. Ben and Jennifer's relationship is kinda creepy and misogynistic with violent undertones. Poor, poor Jon Favreau is stuck slaving away as the lone element of hope in this god-forsaken mess. And I can't comment about the supposed twists and turns, because I turned the DVD off after 15 minutes. As a writer, every cell in my body was screaming out in horror at this film. Terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noooooooooooooo!","review":"This is one movie you won't want to not miss! Honestly, whose idea was it to have daredevil play fight Electra? That scene makes me so sick to my stomach. I tried to vomit but I couldn't because my vomit was afraid of seeing this movie. The soundtrack is the worst! It is as if they found a bad compilation cd on the ground in a highschool parking lot and decided, hey, lets use this instead of some composer and his crummy orchestra. I bought this movie hoping they would have cut out the horrible electra love scenes and changed the music but they hadn't. They kept everything that sucked about the original release and that makes it even suckier. This is the only comicbook movie worse than Fantastic 4. Keep your 7 dollars. Do not buy this dvd unless you want to hurt yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Dare Devil fans, but...","review":"...this is the worst comic book movie I've ever seen. I don't know much about the comic book itself, but the movie was quite boring and lame actually. Batman, Spider Man, X-Men and Superman movies are far better. Well except for the exception of Batman and Robin which was terrible. Arnold SCHWARZENEGGER as Mr. Freeze?! WTF? Kind of like Ben Affleck as any comic book character. I enjoy him in Kevin Smith films and that's about it. Especially Chasing Amy (His best performance). His acting in Dare Devil was just kind of dull.The action is not very exciting. The scene where he flips around slowly was copied off of Spider Man. This movie just didn't excite me very much. I couldn't get into it at all. For a comic book movie it didn't really have that great of special effects. The main villian (Played by Michael Clark Duncan, who is a pretty cool actor) wasn't evolved very well.As a film it wasn't enjoyable at all. Maybe if I was a fan of the comics..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less then 1","review":"If I could less than 1 I would. I think this movie is the combination of Batman and Spiderman, sometimes Daredevil's point of view in the movie is annoying, with many images and colors moving, that's a headache. And Ben Affleck shows again he's not an actor. Why everybody seems they can fly when they jump? Jennifer Garner is not great either, that's a sin."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!","review":"This obviously the best marvel comic hero movie ever made. The special effects are outstanding. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner bring out the best in this movie with their intense stunts and acting. This is a must see to all fans and non fans of this comic hero. It's a movie with a true meaning. I'm going to watch it again for the 5th time."},{"rating":"2","title":"stop making sense","review":"There are those who gripe that Daredevil isn't realistic. So?There are those who complain that it's not suitable for pre-teens. The box says it's rated PG-13 folks.Some compare Daredevil to other super-hero movies and sound like little girls on the play-ground battling over how Power Puff Girls is better than Kim Possible. What's next a tirade about how Clash of the Titans bastardizes Greek mythology and rips off Star Wars? Duh.I think this is a very entertaining DVD set. Nothing more and nothing less."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word - ....","review":"3 things keep this from being a great movie. 1. Daredevil DOES NOT KILL! This is a violation of the very core of the character, who believes that the legal system must decide someone's fate. 2. Matt fights Electra in a park in front of a crowd of people, openly displaying his \\"powers.\\" 3. Speaking of powers, Daredevil only has heightened senses, not the ability to jump from a skyscraper and land feet-first without becoming the Human Accordion. Whilie it's necessary to use a little tweaking of the story here and there when bringing a comic that's been running 20+ years to the big screen (see SpiderMan for an example of how to do it properly), the liberties taken with this character were too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIRECTOR'S CUT IS DA BOMB!","review":"Daredevil struck me as an ejoyable movie that got chopped down so they could get in more showings over it's opening weekend and make it a PG-13. I didn't mind and found it to still be entertaining if not completely what I wanted. The Kingpin seemed far less impressive than I had hoped for and that was that...or so it seemed. While watching the theatrical cut on DVD I was struck by the director's comments which made it sound as if the director's cut would be more to my liking. I wished it was available and you have no idea how excited I was to see the director's cut released! The Kingpin is far better now and really rocks! Other reviews have covered the benefits of the director's cut. I'll just say I'm glad I have both cuts on DVD and that the director's cut is sweet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love the director's cut","review":"I was blown away by the director's cut of Daredevil!

PANT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Mark Steven Johnson","review":"Daredevil is a good comic book movie. Mark Steven Johnson is still finding his way as a film maker, but his dedication to Daredevil can be seen in every frame of the movie and that's very appealing to me. I'm sure there are a lot of things he wishes he could have done better, but there's still a lot to like about this movie. I wont fill up to much space trying to explain it to those who don't get the appeal. Frank Zappa once said \\"It's simply this. Either you get it or you don't.\\" Roger Ebert saw Daredevil and he gets it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly captivating","review":"The theatrical release got critically trashed, so I really didn't know what to expect from the DVD. But I found it very watchable. It spends too much time with the \\"back story,\\" but the mix of drama and action - dark as it is - is quite good. (and the CGI stuff isn't nearly as laughable as in Spider-Man)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype.","review":"I think you should get this movie only if you love marvel type movies such as Spiderman and whatnot. The superhero in this one is blind... its almost comical but I don't think thats they way they wanted it to be interpreted. The movie is getting hyped way more than it should... Rent it before you buy it and spend your money on a dvd you'll actually watch more than once or twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAREDEVIL! Pioneer of Wire-Fu and Stick Fighting!","review":"I subscribed to the early comic book. I liked Daredevil because he was different with his disabilities (blind and mortal) and strengths ('radar-sense' and martial arts style of moving and fighting). I thought the film was a great version of my favorite underdog hero. There's a dark feeling in the look and story of this 'early wire-swinging' hero. A earthy cross between Batman and Spiderman with a realistic approach that is almost noirish. The picture and sound are BluRay bests! Basically, Daredevil is a blind stick fighter, who is so hyper-sensitive, that he has to medicate himself and get into a isolation tank, to get any sleep. And he's got a girl. Give DAREDEVIL a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Young daredevil loses his eyesight, and his other senses pick up. He also loses his father, and vows revenge. He realizes he can use his power for good, and becomes Daredevil to correct the wrongs in the city he lives in. The movie is not super fantastic, I guess I did not really like Ben Affleck in the role, and the fighting scenes just seemed too stiff, and not fluid and natural. I did like the scene where a young daredevil fights three bullies blind was really nice. Colin Fareel as bullseye was excellent casting. He plays crazy really well. Him losing the power to use his hands renders him powerless. Nice touch. I also liked Micheal Clarke Duncas as Kingpen. With his imposing size he made a good villan. The movie ending left room for a potential sequel......which I hope they don't do!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"Daredevil really does it for me. It really hits the spot. I like that it's a double disc set with lots of good extras too. Affleck is different than I was used to seeing. He's vulnerable, but a fighter. He's a complex guy, but not too hard to relate too and that's interesting from a super guy. Jen Garner is beautiful as always and there are groovy villians. I really enjoyed the baddies here more than any villians since Nicholson's Joker. It's a great pairing of two different types of evil putting together the insane and wild Bullseye and the imposing yet cool Kingpin. I loved a ton of stuff in this movie. The old lady on the plane cracked me up and Ben's dental scene...!! The subway part knocked my socks off and the lead up to the rooftop meeting of Bullseye, Elektra, and Daredevil was tense and exciting. I could go on and on! I'm not sure what the people that hated this wanted, but this hits the spot when I've got a jones for an action movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as Gigli?!?","review":"Oh my god, was this movie bad! I forced myself to get to the end of it to see if it got any better. I was disappointed! What happened to Ben Affleck? He used to be able to act.

He says \\"But there were no eyewit-I mean- bigfoot has eyewitnesses.\\" I heard that and thought it was pretty funny.

Jennifer Garnner plays a very good Elektra. She portrays the comic book charactor very well. Overall there isn't that much bad acting in the film, which makes me wounder why it didn't do well in the Box Office. The 'Special Features' on the DVD are not as good as they sound.

It's remarkably better than its theatrical release and I remember that the theatrical version received two thumbs up from Ebert & Roeper. Imagine how much they would love this improved version? I'm glad they didn't include a copy of the initial release on Blu-Ray. That film should be ignored. Honestly, the DD DC is one of the best comic based films regarding any origin.

Almost completely bereft of sympathetic characters (maybe Jon Farveau's character was okay), poorly structured, not involving at all, and Good Lord, I just wanted to slap Ben Affleck's holier-than-thou lawyer across the courtroom for being so self-righteous (\\"I only represent the innocent\\", he says...but it's okay for him to murder in cold blood...puh-leeze!!!). Far and away the best thing about this movie was Colin Farell's character of Bullseye. If you want to watch a good superhero movie, try one of the X-Men films or Spiderman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Daredevil was a boring movie to watch. The dialogue was cheesy and there was no chemistry between any of the characters. This movie looked like it was just thrown together. It didn't flow very well. I am not a big Ben Affleck fan, but he is not what made this movie so bad, it was the writing. When I watched Spider-man I got really into his character and you can feel his every emotion, but in Daredevil I could care less. He didn't pull me into the movie at all. And when Elektra dies I didn't feel sad or sorry for Matt Murdock because their was no real chemistry between them. The writing could have been much better. And when Daredevil and Kingpin finally meet there was absolutely no intensity what so ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Faithful to The Comic","review":"I loved Daredevil. I loved the comic too, and even with some of the controversial decisions involved, such as hiring a black actor to play the Kingpin, I think this is the most faithful adaptation of a comic book to film so far. Daredevil has always been a darker more interesting character, and the filmmakers have really captured his spirit in this film. Ben Affleck actually does an admirable job and Jennifer Garner is spot on as elektra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheddar. Provolone. Mozarella. Swiss.","review":"In other words: PURE CHEESE!!This has to be the absolute cheesiest comic-book hero flick that Marvel has put out there yet.The dialouge is so melodramatic and cheesy it's almost funny, the plot is paper thin and full of holes, and the acting is bottom-of-the-barrel B-movie bad. Ben Affleck and Colin Farrell are both TERRIBLE actors. This film deserves them both and they both deserve to have it on their resumes.By the end of this flick my eyes were sore from rolling them so many times.The ending tries to leave things open for a sequel. Please, God, don't ever let there be a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is A Great Comic Book FIlck","review":"DAREDEVIL is a great movie. The Effects are good and the stunts are excellent. I thought it was better that Spiderman and X-men. I thought it ranked up there with the first Superman and Batman. It confused me how Daredevil fought and after I saw this movie now I have an idea. This is a great comic book flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not See This Movie","review":"I repeat, Do not see this movie. It will be two excruciating hours you will never get back. Why, you ask? Well, it could be the painfully staged fight scenes. Or the badly delivered lines. It could be the lack of interesting story line. Or the fact that by the time you got to the end of the movie it left you wondering- What exactly was the point? In conclusion, It isn't worth your money or time to see this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst action hero films","review":"This movie is one of the worst superhero films ever. Ben Afleck besides being a mediocre actor could not save this movie. It is a flick based on a fine story but was turned into rubish. Sorry to say but the whole film was so cheesy I could not wait to the end of it. BAD acting mixed with terible directing."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate this bad movie too","review":"I would like to mention this movie. The music is godawful. Brilliant New York attourney listens to teenie-booper pitty party music when he is feeling pissy. Every action scene is backed by horrible, cheesey teen-angst metal music or white-boy rap. Yuck. So, what you have here is an already terrible movie that is rendered almost completely unwatchable by its vomit-inducing soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Without Fear","review":"This movie was simply excellent. Powerhouse performances from the entire cast are in store for anybody seeing this film for the first time. I loved the \\"radar\\" special effects, which were beautifully done, and the dark plot of the movie made for an engaging watch. Does anybody remember Colin Farrell as the \\"bad boy\\" on the BBC series \\"Ballykissangel\\"? I couldn't believe it was the same person. He's gone from taking care of sheep and riding horses in the Irish countryside to being a psychotic killer. Is that Celine Dion's husband playing Elektra's father? Oh, and don't miss Joe Pantoliano's turn as Ben Urich."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite dialogue, wooden acting","review":"I really wanted this movie to be good. Really. However, it was quite possibly the worst I've ever seen in the comic booke genre. The dialogue continually tried to be serious in tone, but sometimes was so badly written and delivered that half of the theatre was laughing in places that the director probably didn't intend. The playground combat scene between Ben Affleck and Jennifer was a joke. Colin Farrell and the KingPin were the only redeeming elements of the movie -- they did a great job in their roles. Ben Affleck was terrible. Even his superhero costume of red leather made him look more like the Catwoman than Daredevil. It's worth seeing if you really really love the superhero genre, but prepare to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"daredevile","review":"this movies thad to weigh,thad cause great shock in cinemas it is a fantastic movie of marvel, the best actor is a king pinkg.that covers a great parst of errors the spider ma, finally is a great produchon of accion an ficcion it a great production"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can someone please help me understand...","review":"Can someone please explain to me why the heck think this is a good movie.It has absolutely no story. You can't tell what is going on in any of the fight scenes. It's so dark. Plus, how much can it possibly rain in this movie!!! Plus Affleck is the worst blind man ever. Why doesn't elektra question the fact that ben keeps stop her from crossing the street and having an elaborate kung fu battle on seesaws in plain view of everyone. The point of Daredevil's secret identity was to pretend he was blind so no one knew he was daredevil. Plus he was around with the same stick he fights crime with. Worst blind man ever! The only enjoyable part of the film was Colin Farell's over the top performance as Bullseye (point to bullseye on head then repeatedly say bullseye) I just fail to see what's so entertaining about this film.

He wasn't a very convincing blind person.It actually started of pretty good but went downhill quickly.When the Jennifer Gardner character was introduced it went from dumb to dumber. She is a lame actress. I guess she fit the suit.Don't let Hollywood fool you by putting a couple of big names in the movie and trying to pass it of as a legitimate effort.The movie is horrible.

What he was trying to say was this: \\"I'm pretty much a hack director, and I couldn't come up with anything 'new' on my own. So I figured the Crow was done so long ago that no one would remember.\\" Hack. Affleck? That cheesy fight scene in the playground?

Don't waste ur time folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Marvel Movie EVER!!!!","review":"Honestly, I don't think that there was a single person in the production or studio that was not completely drunk or high on cocaine. Compare this film with any other Marvel film (Except Punisher w/Tom Jane) That was crap too! Stan Lee is getting older and there seems to be a necessity to pump out as many of the comics with little or no disregard to the true and factual story-lines. This film was put together with names vs. characters. Ben, Jen, and Michael were all the hype to watch this film. Had this movie been released in the 80's or 90's I would have cried at the disgrace, but seeing as how anyone who owns anything worth any substance sells it like a Prostitute, I am not surprised. Watch this movie with ear plugs and a blind fold while tripping on acid, then, and only then will this movie not want you to hate everything Marvel stands for.

So I went in with high hopes and much anticipation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"We have seen it all before. I gave this movie a second star because some of the effects were cool, but the organization and character development get zero stars. I found it difficult to care about the main characters.

I feel there was a great story hidden somewhere in this mess, but it just didn't make it to the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Dare\\" Me To Watch This Again!!","review":"This movie sucks!! All I have to say is the playground scene w/Elektra Natchios was reallly lame. \\"Let's take off our jackets at the same time, and then balance and fight on a teter-totter\\" man what a joke.

It absolutely kicks butt! My order for character liking is as follows: Bullseye, the coolest and nastiest Daredevil villain ever with an amazing way of using anything as a weapon, Daredevil, the blind hero who is the protagonist of this movie, Kingpin, the big boss man of all crime who looks really fat but is actually solid muscle and very strong, and Elektra, who is one of the hottest babes I've ever seen, and for someone who wasn't treated right as a fighter left quite a mark on the movie. Oh, there's Ben Urich. He's pathetic and the worst of all characters in the whole movie. Whatever, other than him, this movie is solid gold. It got a lot of respect, but not as much as it deserves. All who are interested in any or all of these characters should see this movie. Oh, and remember \\"That's the C-Train!\\"? Classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Director Knows Best","review":"Director Mark Steven Johnson truly explores the shadowy aspects of justice and vigilantism in the additional 30 minutes added to the film, along with some other tweaks.The scene which didn't make the final cut from producer Gary Foster and 20th Century Fox studio is attorney Matt Murdock (Daredevil) - portrayed by Ben Affleck - defending a murder suspect, who is played by rapper Coolio. The violence is also amped up which earned the revised film an \\"R\\" rating, a path not taken to movie theaters by comic book super heroes and movie studios.Colin Farrell (Bullseye) and Michael Clarke Duncan (The Kingpin) are excellent in their roles as villains, with Jennifer Garner (Elektra Natchios) able to show a different side of the character in this grittier version. Director's have to be daredevils at times in the editing process and this Director's Cut aptly shows - again - who knows best when it comes to delivering a solid film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under-rated for sure","review":"I think watching this film at the theaters is worth your time and money. Now I will give you my opionion on the DVD wide-screen release. Considering all the extras included in the set, I think it makes for a good buy. Not GREAT but definitely worthy of your hard earnd $ if you factor in the behind-the-scenes footage of the film and the history behind the Daredevil saga.I think Jennifer Garner radiates as Electra not only in her beauty, but her brawn. She kicks butt in this flick and Collin Farrel is a convincing pysco. Weather you're a Ben Afflect fan or not, very few could've pulled off the title character as he did and being a comic book fan, I liked his portrayal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad choice for Affleck...and you","review":"Right there at the bottom of the Comic-book-turned-movie heap. Slow and unexciting, only two things make the movie worth watching...Colin Farrell as \\"Bullseye,\\" who adds energy everytime he's on camera, and Jennifer Garner who adds real sparks. But just as she starts to gain your interest - she's gone! Ben Affleck apparently thinks being blind means walking through scenes like a zombie (sort of like his performance in Pearl Harbor!) Even the action sequences are enervated by the jumpy, dark (and boring) effects trying to show Daredevil's auditory bat sense.There are also some tremendous \\"suspension-of-disbelief\\" howlers, and the climactic fight scene is truly weak and anticlimactic...designed only to set up a sequel. Now if the sequel could feature a resurrected Jennifer Garner it might be worthwhile.Buy it and watch it? Only if the only thing on television is another insipid \\"reality\\" show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"Awful movie!! Terrible plot! Corny fight scenes.

Ben AFLACT as Daredevil/Matt Murdock? Colin Ferril as Bullseye? Michael Clarke Duncan as Wilson Fisk the Kingpin? Jennifer Garner as Electra? What the f*** is this s***? Who wrote this s*** and what the hell were they smoking when they did? This movie was more boring than one of Triple H's speaches. WARNING: THIS MOVIE IS FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T GET TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. I had to check my pulse every five seconds to see if I was still alive. There is no plot. The action is boring. Overall I give this movie -2 stars for casting, content and plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"even though its Director's cut","review":"This movie may be better with the added footage, but that does not make Ben Afleck a better superhero. I'm not a Ben Afleck hater, but the choreographed fights are a pain to watch. There could have been many other actors to play the role of DD much better. I suppose they just wanted a big name to sell tickets, but that's where they flopped. Jennifer Garner does well along with the others for a movie that is only so-so anyway, but I just didn't enjoy watching Afleck pretend that he knows some kind of martial arts with his limited flexability. This is why there will not be a sequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"This new R rated version contains more violence and.....","review":"....some character development that was originally trimmed to get a PG-13 rating and speed things up a bit for the theatrical release. I have heard that the final Kingpin fight is longer and much more brutal than the theatrical version. This film is very true to the recent Kevin Smith penned Daredevil comic series and it seems people either love it or hate it. The funny thing is, although it only made around 130 million in US theaters, this was one of the top selling dvd's in 2003. I prefer the darker tones in this film as well as the Blade series. The two Spider-Man movies were decent, but had no real edge at all. Daredevil has that edge and I hope the upcoming Electra movie has it also."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give this movie....2 STARS!!!!","review":"When I first saw the trailers for Daredevil I thought (like I thought for the Hulk) that this movie was going to be awesome. After 3 weeks it came out I dragged my family to see it with me, boy do I wish I had never seen the movie. Not only that it lacked plot, it was utterly boring and unmoving. It was sad when the father died but i found myself wanting to fall a sleep. The only good part about this movie was that the main girl kicked butt! Colin Farrel was pretty good as a villan but I think they could of done more with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Although I really enjoyed the performances of Suge Knight as Kingpin and Rob Halford as Bullseye, this movie really stunk it up. Terrible script, hokey acting, hackneyed plot, the worst martial arts I've ever seen, insulting to the audience, fake-looking special effects, cliche supporting characters you don't care in the least about, storyline slapped together like a house a cards, this entire film is a mess. Stick with \\"Spider-Man\\" or \\"X-Men\\" instead. Heck, I'd even take \\"Batman And Robin\\" over this disaster of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This movie was terrible. The story was absolutely numbing. The interviews on the second disk with the writers/creators of the comic book was much more interesting to me. The DTS soundtrack does have some serious bass in it for you subwoofer fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the only Daredevil movie that should count","review":"I had seen the theatrical release and found it enjoyable but forgettable. I even rented the DVD of that version later just to be sure. Then I started reading the reviews of the Director's Cut so I took a chance and bought a copy. Now here is something juicy and memorable. I think the DC version really does justice to the Daredevil stories of Frank Miller from the early 80s - the whole Electra-Bullseye-Kingpin arc, as well as some of the elements added much later such as Matt's mother being a nun. It was really a joy to see those stories brought to life and done right. Also, while this version is darker it was also funnier as well due to the added scened with Foggy Nelson. This version really allowed you to see more of and therefore care more about the different characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Gigli","review":"Okay Ben Affleck, no more movies for you. This movie was horrendous. No, I'm not a fan of the comics, and wouldn't want to be after realizing this is such a dull super hero. Ben Affleck is terrible, as always. Jennifer Garner, who only looks like she does on the cover after she gets mad, fights a bunch of sand bags that miraculously fall from her ceiling and goes out and almost gets instantly killed by Bullseye. (so I heard she's not really dead, I just hope there's not a sequel so I can find out) The effects were so AWFUL. Does anyone realize that CG effects are almost never well done? (Except in LOTR and anything that Spielberg uses them in) And the character of Daredevil...so when you're blind you can jump real high? Yeah don't waste you money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daredevil","review":"I saw this movie in the theatre and was not happy with it. I bought the DVD for my husband and I gave it a second viewing thinking maybe I'd like it the second time around. It only convinced me of what a waste of about 2 hours it was. The scenes are rushed, the story weak. I hated the whole Murdock/Electra romance. It was WAY TOO RUSHED!!!!! Even the way he met her and their duel just so he could get her name was extremely stupid and pointless. Then, the second time he meets her, they end up in bed together! YIKES! There was NO character development and the whole movie was rushed. Even the Kingpin/Daredevil face-off left something to be desired. The only saving factor was Bullseye. Done the right way, this movie could have been great. I was bored to tears seeing this in the theatre and seeing it again on DVD only re-enforced my opinion. I absolutely hate this movie and would not recommend buying the DVD. rent it, but do not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Daredevil' takes a bigger chance than expected.","review":"What that means is that this movie was better than I expected it to be. The acting was good and the amount of action scenes was high (usually MARVEL comic book hero movies have little action).Scenes to look for:1.) The battle on the church organ.2.) Subway chase3.) Playground fight scene.Anyways, most people didn't like it, but it turned out to be a pretty good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dare to beSTUPID!!!!!!","review":"The worst Superhero movie EVER!

No, seriously. Tell me. Are you and I watching the same thing here?On top of having a ridiculous origin story, it is also a typically clichéd one (childhood trauma, parent/guardian dies) bad acting, and a soundtrack that sounds good over a car stereo but when used in a movie soundtrack, immediately demotes that fim to B-movie status. Extra star awarded to this movie for having a cool villain in Michael Clark Duncan and Colin Farrell, who for some reason both decided this movie was worthy of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Super Hero Movie","review":"I thourghly enjoyed Daredevil. I am not big into the comic super hero lore (besides the major characters), but I found this movie quite entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent movie","review":"I am familiar with the basic story of the Daredevil comic books, so I think the movie does a decent job of adapting from the book. Sure, some people don't like this, and I don't claim it's a GREAT movie, but I honestly didn't think it was bad at all, and feel confident giving it a 4-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"So... empty","review":"Wow was this.. empty. It seemed like a lot of the movie had been cut because the transitions from one plot aspect to the next seemed choppy- too abrupt. One minute Electra wouldn't give Matt her name, the next minute they were kissing, the next minute they were doing the sex. This movie was just so vapid- especially compared to Spiderman which took pains to develop the characters and bring out their humanity, building an action movie that was also emotional. Daredevil was just missing something essential and epitomized Hollywood blockbuster film at its worst. The only thing I can say is the bat-style sonar effects were well done. Oh, and of course the Stan Lee cameo always tickles me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie ROCKS!","review":"I really, really enjoyed this movie. It is about a guy named Matt Murdock, and he is a laywer. By day, of course. He is the super hero Dardevil, and he is played by Ben Affleck. I saw this movie for my birthday party, and I just loved it. My favorite character was Elektra (played by Jennifer Garner), because she was so cool! Her cool Sais did the trick, probably. This movie definitely deserves a sequel, because of the cool ending. I'm not going to spoil it though! Also, when I saw it, I just thought Bullseye was so cool, and so mean! Dardevil's costume wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't the worst either. Elektra had an awesome costume. I liked the action and the comedy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd think it would be good","review":"You'd think that with such an all-star lineup (Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell) they couldn't go wrong. You'd also think after the huge success of Spiderman that this movie would only end up in dead competition with it. Also, judging from the previews, the movie looks great. SO WRONG! I was laughing the entire time; the corniness was unbelieveable, the ending completely sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"lol....Ben Affleck","review":"A world where Ben Affleck is a superhero could only be Sesame Street.

Ben Affleck doesn't convince me as a hero for a moment, and Jennifer Garner -- a martial arts assassin? What, was Britney Spears unavailable? Please.

Fight scenes are OK, other than that though, this blows."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I hope justice is served today before justice finds you\\"","review":"The above words were spoken by Ben Affleck in this, one of his newest releases-Daredevil.Daredevil is yet another superhero film that is sure to win the approval of it's viewers. Unlike most superhero films, this movie is about a boy who learns how to deal with the world around him after tragicly losing his sight due to an explosion of dangerous chemicals.Why is it any different than other superhero films? Because he didn't feel sorry for himself, but decided to help those who were in need.As for this version(widescreen edition) I would reccomend it because as you know, widescreen allows you to see more of the movie than fullscreen does and this is a movie you definatly want to see all you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Please don't watch this movie!

I felt Ben Afleck was Not Good. And Jennifer Garner as ELEKTRA (one of the greatest characters in comic history). I Think one person who could compare to Elektra at all would be Catherine Zeta Jones. And Why Would FRANK MILLER The absolute best of them all evn want to have a small cameo. Frank Miller Took Daredevil to where it became greatness in the 80's and should have written the script.Whats with changing Kingpin to a black man.

I give one star because its the lowest i can go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassingly bad...","review":"First of all, this is not my type of movie at all, but Colin Farrell was in it and my Husband was interseted so I decided to give it a try. UGH. This movie was sooo bad. The acting(if you can call it that), the plot....(was there one?)....the whole thing was so cheesy I cringed with discomfort while watching...I eventually fell asleep towards the end ..I honestly feel that being passed out on my couch was better time spent than witnessing the conclusion to this mindless mess of a movie. All I can say is that this just further reinforces my belief that if you want a GOOD story, skip the movies and read a book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic!","review":"It is a crime that Ben Affleck has the ability to get good roles like this and Screw up what could have been a good movie if someone else had gotten the leading role. Ben Affleck tries to incorporate the magic of the Spider-man movie into this steaming pile of crap, but everything about it is awful. Jennifer Garner's character has no depth, Jon Favreau is annoying and does not make the film any better, and Affleck is not believable as a super-hero with great fighting skill. Cuba Gooding Jr. would have been GREAT as Daredevil and is a much better actor than Affleck ever was. Even Silent Bob would be a better Daredevil than Affleck. Don't bother wasting your time with this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money on this","review":"This is easily one of the worst films of 2003. The script is ludicrous and repulsive. There are plot holes the size of Texas in this thing. Aside from Colin Farrel, the cast proves itself to be very untalented. (Although Jennifer Garner is nice to look at.) The action sequences are tolerable, but the climactic fight between Daredevil and The Kingpin was a very big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Marvel's duds","review":"I love superhero movies, but Daredevil is pretty mediocre. The character is much more violent than in the comics too."},{"rating":"1","title":"BS","review":"I agree with J.Hall. That is just ridiculous.

But it is a reasonably good movie that stays very true to the spirit of the character.Fun for Marvel fans to play \\"spot the in-joke\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and silly saved only by the villains","review":"Affleck has never been less convincing. Garner has never looked better, and the story was never very interesting.This film is redeemed by three things. Great sets, and two great villains. I so wanted to see Ben Affleck get whooped by both of the central villains-who were both terrific. Colin Farrel and the other villain (sorry, I don't know his name but he does lots of tv commercials) have fun-and when they are on the screen it is fun to watch. Unfortunately the camera focuses on Affleck and his inability to emote. Yawn, couldn't they just make Farrel's villain the main character so we can watch him beat up Affleck?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't be serious!!!!","review":"Worst movie I've seen in years! I can't beleive people actually liked it. I went with my husband and friend on opening night and we all thought it stunk. I'm not really that familiar w/the commic and didn't really know the concept behind Daredevil so when I realized that the Daredevil was a blind man I just could not get into it. In fact, I just laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of it all. Ben Aflact was unconvincing as a super hero and the dialogue was pathetic. Even Jennifer Garner couldn't sell it and she sells it every Sunday night on Alias.Beter than Spiderman, I really don't think so...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wonderful comic book movie! Better than Captain America!","review":"Daredevil tells the story of a young boy who lost his genitals in a forklift accident and becomes blind. With much passion, he learns to overcome this and become a fighter just like his father and he prowls the streets at night searching for his mother. He dresses up in a dopey costume similar to the one featured in the movie Daddy Day Care. Jennifer Garner plays a character who is just a token love interest, Colin Farrell plays a guy who can throw things really fast, and Michael Clarke Duncan plays a big kingpin dude. The movie also features Bernie Mac portraying a midget and Jennifer Lopez as Ben Affleck's girlfriend. Oh, and Queen Latifah sings something about mambo somewhere in the movie. I give Daredevil a rating of 15.5 out of 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel tricked!!!","review":"The commercials were better than the movie because most save 1 thing that was good was in the commercials. Jennifer Garner got hustled. All the kicking butt in the commercials, was just in the commercials. She didn't really do ANYTHING and was a waste of a good charachter. and the bossman...1 word. Why? Okay he's strong, how'd he get so strong?DareDevil has developed other senses ok cool, but he's a regular guy so now he's suddenly a great gymnast with super-strength??? Now I know you're not supposed to look for much plot in these movies but you gotta have some better action than that to distract me. Last thing, Nobody's going to bother to explain why Bullseye has a Bullseye on his head huh?More effort people,... Batman pulled it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"helpp!!","review":"K....THIS IS NOT REALLY A REVIEW BUT ILL JUST SAY THAT THE MOVIE IS OK.....I WANTED TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE SONG WHEN THEY SHOW MATT MURDOCK AS A KID ON THE ROOFTOP WITH HIS DAD, HITTING THE PUNCHING BAG...RIGHT AFTER THE HOSPITAL SCENE..I LIKE THAT SONG VERY MUCH BUT I DONT KNOW THE NAME OF IT.SO WILL SOMEONE HELP ME PLEASE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I'm not sure whether or not this movie holds up with the comics but regardless, I really didn't care for it. Sure, alot of people probably didn't like ... but that was just one of the things wrong with this movie. ... I'm not a Ben Affleck fan either but he is not the reason Daredevil wasn't good in my opinion. The plot seemed completely thrown together as if the producers were in a hurry to get this movie done so that money could be made at the box office. Not much was put into the development of the characters and I found some of the dialogue to be a somewhat slow at times. However, I do agree that making a movie about a blind superhero along with a babe for a sidekick and a villan from another comic series was a great idea. Sadly though, I felt there was much that should have been done with Daredevil."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to I loathe thee...","review":"Daredevil is the most staggeringly awful movie I have seen in a very, very long time. And I saw Crossroads . (please don't ask why) I'll spare you the fan-boy rhetoric about how it did not live up to the comic and all that and get right to it. Every single aspect of this film is tragic. The direction was such that one might believe Mark Steven Johnson is himself blind. The acting was laughable, with the exception of Colin Farrel, and the see-gee-eye was par at best. But what really struck me was the writing. I once met a rabid squirrel with seven different brain disorders who could have put together a better story than this. And the dialogue had to have been written by a handicapable third grader. It had to. There is no excuse for this movie. If you haven't already made the mistake, please do not see it. Please. Just run, man. Run far and run fast. And, if, while you're running, you see Mark Steven Johnson, smack him for me. Trust me, he deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Hero Or Villain","review":"Firstly, I am not a marvel movie or comic book fan but this movie was better then all the other marvel movies exept x-men. While some of the action scenes look good they are in all honesty comletly mindless. The main up is that Dare Devil is not affraid to kill during this film. This could show the director of spider-man what to do in it's upcoming sequal.I gave this movie four stars because it has raised the bar for all other marvel comic to movie productions that will take place. In overall Bullseye steels the show in his goth kind clothing and Dare Devil spits out his teath. FILM CUTTING WAS THE MAIN DOWNFALL AND STOPPED IT FROM BIENG A CLASSIC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Fun!","review":"Bought this movie from amazon 2 years ago & have watched it all the way through 5 times. I keep re-watching certain scenes, like where Bullseye kills the guy in the Pub with a paperclip. Colin's menacing look is hilarious. It's such a cartoon, over the top crazy. Affleck & Garner are great together. Michael Clarke Duncan is strong. Whenever life is walking all over me, I just watch any scene with Bullseye & laugh my a** off, get back in the groove. I have no idea why this movie didn't sell more tickets. It is a super great presentation of the comic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"significant improvement.","review":"I have a greater appreciation for the difficulties in dealing with Hollywood. The director's cut is a significant improvement over the theatrical release which I found one of the worst superhero films ever made. Ben Afleck is a disaster as an actor and the plot was not even there. This release restores to audiences what was meant to be seen in the first place. It's a much better representation of the darkness of Daredevil. One of my favorite parts of DD was Matt Murdock and he becomes a real character in it. We see him live his life and feel the difficulties of being who he is. I highly recommend this release of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad I bought it","review":"Daredevil has some very memorable moments. I won't give too much away, but Matt Murdock's medicine cabinet will make it clear that Daredevil isn't the typical superhero. Scenes involving his deep soul searching are striking and memorable. There's plenty that made this movie a must have. The DVD extras are top notch too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Spiderman, not Batman, but a new Original.","review":"Daredevil took the bright vibrant New York City the we all saw in Spider-man, and turned into a Tim Burton style Gothic wonderland. Ben Affleck did a wonderful job (no matter what any critic may say) in cinematically portraying the comic book hero. The finest performance comes from the girl-next door kick but superwoman, Jennifer Garner. She played her role with passion and brute toughness. Colin Ferrel also played his role well, but the other villain in the film was too defeatable and he really disappointed me. The effects were great and so was the drama. See this if you are a fan of comics or popcorn movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth a look","review":"Daredevil isn't flawless, but it's not bad. There's a lot to like in this movie. The way Daredevil grows from taking the law into his own hands to being more heroic makes for an entertaining movie. The development from killer to hero is interesting stuff for a supehero movie and it's dealt with very well. That and the extras earn it a B+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not feeling it","review":"I admit to not being a comic book fan, but agree there have been some excellent movies based on them including Spiderman, Superman, and X-Men. I don't think Daredevil will fall into that category.The movie is dark and reminiscent of the original Batman movie. Affleck is believeable as Matt Murdoch, a lawyer who as a young boy is blinded by a toxic chemical spill. The character turns to a vegilanti after seeing his father killed by hired thugs. The movie is slow to start, has not predictable wire fight sequences, and lacks a concrete story line. Or more importantly tries to tie too many loose ends up in one story. Murdoch discovers the man that kills his father is the same man that is running the cities organized crime ring and hires the hit on his love Electra. Again reminiscent of Batman.I wouldn't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"Okay. I found this film (on DVD) disappointing. I was a DareDevil comic book fan back in \\"the day\\", but I've long since forgotten the story. This film starts out pretty good with the story of the development of DD and how he lost his dad and gained supersensory powers. The fight scenes were pretty good, but other than these two things, the film just doesn't make it. The villians do much more for this film than DD himself. Ben Affleck doesn't get the job done! His love interest helps, but dies (as does the film) Rent it if youl haven't seen it --DON'T buy it. SpiderMan was tremendously superior!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"Oy! That hurt! Stan Lee gave us Spider Man and it was great but then he threw this at us! JJJJJUUUUNNNNKKKKK! Very mildly entertaining but I gotta say: I nearly fell asleep! Don't waste your time. You might like it but best stick with spider Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under-rated...","review":"I think this movie got alot less credit then what it really deserved. I think people just didn't like it as much because DareDevil wasn't the kind of super hero with the fancy powers or gizmos. In my opinion it was better than I actually thought it would be. Before seeing X2 this was the best marvel super-hero movie yet. I think that the cast really pulled through with their characters, and the DareDevil costume was done really well. *Conclusion* This was a really good movie in my opinion and I don't care what other people say about it, it's still one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"director's cut is stronger and better","review":"when I first saw the theatrical version of daredevil there were a few scenes that seemed suspicous. one of the biggest clues that something wasn't quite right was the inclusion of coolio as \\"dante jackson\\" in the credits at the end of the film since there hadn't been any \\"dante jackson\\" or coolio anywhere in the film! i also wished there had been more kingpin. both of these things have been corrected thanks to director's cut and it's a much superior cut of the film. dante jackson plays a very vital role and there's also more kingpin and i love it! did you like daredevil the theatrical version? then check out this version. you can't go wrong with the director's cut of daredevil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better storyline than the Theatrical Release","review":"I liked Daredevil. But there were story points that were lagging IMHO. I read the graphic novel of the film and the Director's Cut, if it follows the novelization (and I assume it does) is a far superior story. The largest omission was that of the character of Dante Jackson (Coolio in the movie). He is a murder suspect who's case nobody will touch but Matt Murdock. Ironically, it's this \\"small fish\\" that leads to the fall of the Kingpin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's to like?","review":"Daredevil is empty, and silly. Of course, you'd expect that from a movie that has a laughably bad fight/dance sequence involving Ben Affleck. Yes, you heard right. I was tempted to yell out, \\"Hey! They're break dance fighting!\\" Of course, I didn't.Daredevil has plot that is mush--predictable when it ought to be surprising, dull when it ought to be exciting, and funny when it never really intends to be. Ain't that a recipe for disaster? I won't spend more time dissecting it because it just isn't worth it. It represents the inevitable: Bland corporate types seeing the Spiderman and X-Men money machines and wanting to cash in with uncreative drivel. \\"Find me a superhero! From Marvel if you can! And get the Sexiest Guys on Earth to star!! That's the ticket.\\"Don't make the same mistake I made.

Nothing to see hear, nothing worth raving about, not worth buying, but not a complete waste of time either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daredevil.. sigh.","review":"I really wanted to like this movie. Going into the theater, I felt slighly excited, I have been a long time fan of the Frank Miller version of Daredevil, and I had heard that director had brought Miller in to help with the film's visuals. So I settled in, and watched. The movie starts fast, and quickly moves through daredevil's origin, which I enjoyed - then they have a very good scene of the boy daredevil being woken by a booming drip and we see his radar \\"vision\\" working. Then it went downhill fast.Some of my major problems with the film was I just didnt belive daredevil did those crazy moves. He jumps at least 10 feet down, falls another ten feet, and then again.. I expected him to be at least a few inches shorter when he hit the ground. And there is one more thing at the end that bugs me... but I won't give that away.It does fullfill as an action movie, and you gotta see like 40 million dollars in action flyin across the screen. But don't think too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"OK, I was reading these reviews, and I just don't get them. Some people are acting as if this movie is the greatest thing in history (it's not), while others act as if it was just the worst thing ever (it's not). It's mediocre!!! I would give it 2 1/2 stars if I could. There really isn't much of a plot, but the special effects are tight, and I guess the messages of love, justice, etc. can be cool. Personally, I would not buy this (unfortunately I did) but I would rent it at least. Just don't expect it to be Spiderman or something.

As always, he skirts the shallow subjects plaguing modern Christian writings, and plunges into a deep, meaningful subject.He discusses appropriating the blood by faith, and why the blood of our Lord is so powerful. One of the subjects which most impressed me was that of the effect the blood has on the diposition of a believer when he takes communion. It is powerful because it works in him the same self-giving nature which was in our Lord Himself.A must read for believers hungry for the depths of Christ. Now however, I must forewarn you that this book will not entertain you. In fact, you may find the first three chapters to be slow, as I did. However, almost each chapter ends with tremendously powerful prayers and meditations of the subject just discussed.Truly a magnificent work which will undoubtedly have powerful repercussions in your life.

Reading Operation Shylock was proof of this. His use of language and the themes the book covered kept me reading late in the night on many occassions. This is not a book you can read easily or quickly. That, however, makes it worhtwile.

Lost heirs, young rakehells, Milord Grandpapa, a lady of quality somewhat past her first youth, a peninsular officer with more to him than meets the eye, an Earl's daughter who never forgets what is due her consequence, smugglers, Land Officers, dandies; nobody does it with more grace, style and genuine warmth than Georgette Heyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unknown Ajax","review":"Being a huge Georgette Heyer fan, I was a little disappointed with this book, but I hadn't realized it was more of a mystery than a historical romance. It didn't seem as lively and witty and fast-moving as are the many other Heyer novels I've read. However, had I accepted it as a mystery going in, I believe I would have enjoyed it more than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing Heyer Regency Novel","review":"Extremely amusing Regency novel with all Georgette Heyer's historical references in play. Drama, family intrigue, romance all play a part; it's a thoroughly satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Heyer","review":"Great fun - one of my fave Georgette Heyer books. Highly recommended. Heyer gets a bit repetitive after you have read a bunch of them - if this is your first read, you'll enjoy it a lot. This is one of the more humorous ones, so I found it a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Heyer's best","review":"It took me forever to slog through this book because I didn't find the plot or the characters that interesting. With the exception of the Major, and perhaps Vincet Darracott, most of the characters that populate this book are caricatures - the combative patriarch, the silly fob, the spineless coward, etc. I also wondered if people really talked like that back during the regency era- in long winded passages that take up almost entire pages. It is especially frustrating for me to read those long winded dialogues because they more often than not add nothing to the plot and are so heavily in cant as to be almost indecipherable.Also, unlike other Georgette Heyer books, the romance is almost entirely absent so I did not even have that to induce me to turn the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original hero","review":"Hugo Darracott, the despised offspring of a second son and a weaver's daughter, is elevated to the position of heir presumptive when his uncle and cousin die in an accident. Unfortunately, his high-handed grandfather fails to mention his existence to anyone until he's hauled to the family estate for remedial training. There poor Hugo finds himself in the midst of a truly dysfunctional family, with aforementioned tyrannical grandfather snapping his head off, Uncle Matthew (the third son) and Cousin Vincent resenting his disruption of their eventual succession, Cousin Anthea balking at her assignment to marry him, and her headstrong, hobbled brother ripe for mischief. It's a good thing Hugo is more than he appears. He handily demonstrates the domestic and romantic value of a good sense of humor. The finale, a charade in which the slightest misstep will bring dishonor down on the family, is a marvel of invention."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining tale of misconceptions and mystery.","review":"The blurb is about as accurate as the Darracot assumptions about the son of their black sheep, Hugo Darracot. The heir, a \\"weaver's brat,\\" and totally unknown to his noble (and debt-ridden) family, has newly sold out from the army and is ordered to present himself to his tartar of a grandfather for review.Received by his relations, this \\"unlettered rustic\\" decides to see how far he can take their preconceptions.The romance? Well, how romantic to be ordered by your grandfather to marry your cousin to get both of you off his hands before you can cause any embarrassment.This one is pure Heyer, funny, witty, great dialogue, and clever twists abound. Her mystery writing skills are prominently displayed as well. A terrific cast of characters rounds out a satisfyingly robust plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Heyers","review":"The story summary seemed a bit dour, so I had my doubts about this one. What a fantastic book. Hugo's character is absolutely great as are a host of others. I won't give it away by going into too much detail, but he will surprise! Heyer always has great plotting, but in this case, it is an especially good romp. Some may feel disappointed that the romantic resolution that we all look forward to, is not the absolute final step in the book. Again, surprisingly, she makes it work wonderfully. As I move through her stories, this one, Venetia, The Nonesuch, The Masqueraders, These Old Shades and Devil's Cub are my favorites. Ms. Heyer is an addicting read even for those who aren't primarily romance readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Story is fascinating. At the beginning of the book, I too had my doubts about the hero Hugh and whether he was just as he seemed, very un heroic! The beauty of this book is that I found myself discovering and wanting to know more about each of the characters as the plot wore on. It has many twists and turns which are completely unexpected. You will not want to put this down. There is never a dull moment. Georgette Heyer was a brilliant writer of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love her books, but WAY TOO EXPENSIVE HERE","review":"Save your money.

I buy a head a of lettuce, rinse each leaf well and tear into bite-sized pieces, shake off, and put in the bag. Much easier to keep salad easily and inexpensively available than the pre-washed bagged salads.Four stars instead of five because I really DO miss my salad spinner -- easy to glance in the fridge and see how much is left, as opposed to the opaque bag. Also it is a little less absorbent than I expected -- be sure to shake off the washed lettuce well!

That is extremely way off base. The reason that these establisments are there is because people patronize them. If you do not want these businesses in your neighborhood do not shop there period.

Of the Rineharts I could find, The Album is my favorite. The setting is upper crusty, the delicate manners of the characters blow up fairly regularly, the murder is preposterously bloody and the romance that blooms in the middle of it all is so sweet you can almost smell the lavender rising from the page. It's a set piece from another age, which is the whole point, I guess. People have servants! People have so much money that nobody works! The chauffeur lives over the garage and wears green livery! We should all live like that, but the narrator gives it to you matter-of-factly, only going into the vapors over the murder mystery, which is a good one.

It reads as if no one put any time and effort into making this an enjoyable read or putting the stories in an order so that the book would make any sense at all. The author jumbles around from one decade to the next and then back, sometimes repeating the same story over and over again.

The play runs very sluggish and freezes often in the middle of a game, it isn't my connection either because many people complain of the same problems.Secondly, 2003's version had better game play. The checking was better last year, this year's players move very fast and are difficult to get a good hit on. It is very easy to score on one timers but nearly impossible to score w/ slap shots.

In fact, the only reason I continued reading the book was to see if the author would break out of his (and my) depression by getting romantic with one of the two women he ran into on the trail. Unfortunately (for me and perhaps him, too) the sad tone continued to the end, and although the ending was poetic, it and the book, left me unimpressed and unfulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"fwoggy","review":"Well I didn't like the fact that it gave no real info about the tracks and things so i honestly wish that I hadn't waste my time on buying this book because the info that i needed wasn't even covered."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to His Journey","review":"I liked this book. I know other reviews talk about the author's whining or his negative view of New Zealand, but to me that was HIS experience. I appreciated that is was \\"no fluff\\" and that it was what it was. I did appreciated his quick stabs at humor and his antecdotes about him getting hurt, ill, misreading labels, etc. I thought the book was real. I liked the commraderee with some of his travel mates. The only thing I would have wanted was some romance.. but that is me the bleeding heart romantic. That was his choice when he was in NZ.

I suppose they are mainly designed for someone trying to figure out whether they like classical music or not.However, the performances on this disc are better than the run-of-the-mill potpourri disk. The 'Summer' from Vivaldi's Four Seasons is powerfully played and a good performance (Orchestra di Milano, Benito Rossi, violin). Even the sadly overplayed Canon of Pachelbel is forcefully played with a lively tempo (Sinfonie Orchester Graunke Munich). The piano work on Schmann's 'Riding Piece Op. 68' is good as well (not attributed).All in all, a nice piece to play when you have non-classical music loving friends over for dinner or a social gathering. It is also a nice CD to have playing when you are just relaxing with a glass of wine.Maybe it will prompt some to go out and purchase complete works by a particular composer.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"STEELERS JENGA","review":"I WILL NBVER KNOW!

It is NOT the traditional music of the the time of Jesus or Jerusalem's temple.

Jewish singers use a certain style of voice that gives the music that unique sound. You simply cannot sing it in operatic or choral style and have it sound at all good.It isn't Jewish music but if you want to listen to some amazing ethnic music try Savina Yannatou's Mediterranea for some traditional mediterranean music that is so good it will give you goosebumps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ancient Echoes - Music from the time of Jesus and Jerusalem's Second Temple","review":"I decided I don't enjoy this type of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mild Waste of Money","review":"I recieved my copy of The Driller Killer within only a few days of purchase.

The game play and camera angles are the worst I have ever seen and the player motions and animation are Horrid (except in the instant replay which gamers never use)! I tried to bring this game back but wasn't able to because I already opened it. Nothing will please me more than to burn it, which I am about toi do now. If you are all about simulations without playing a game than this is for you. However if you love actually playing games - DO NOT buy this game. Oh yeah, EBX changed its policy and it is now impossible to bring back a game, so once you have it, your stuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"ESPN Makes It New","review":"ESPN has done well with other games considering football and hockey this year basketball will be as good as them also. Nba live 2004 has the same graphics and dribbling style it's like a repeat of 2003. 2K4 will show improvments of every play like a new game mode called 24/7 You get to create you'r own baller and make his statics better as you play. If you'r thinking of getting a realistic basketball game make it this one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Put...the best so far.","review":"This is far and away the best basketball game made so far. The graphics have come a long way from just last year. The gameplay is terrific although the isomotion could still use some work.

The 24/7 mode is entertaining and original. This is a must purchase for fans of basketball and gamers alike. Well done Sega, keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"best game ever","review":"this is by far the best basketball game ever. even the back up players look exact. hedo turkuglu of the spurs looks way better on espn than on live. live has worst graphics and crappier gameplay. you can shoot lean over 3's with shaq on live, live sucks. espn is the basketball game to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best so far","review":"I think this is the best basketball game in 2004.

It is to be most warmly recommended to all true and sincere students of mysticism. It radiates the warmth of St. Francis de Sales, touches in a uniquely loving and gentle way on the sufferings on the soul immersed in the dark night of the spirit, offers guidance on ways of contemplation and the attainment of true humility, which, as the author asserts, is the prerequisite of self-knowledge preparing the way for the love of God which the purified soul must enter through the cloud of unknowing. This book is my steady companion along with Jean-Pierre de Caussade, Rumi and The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy hunky boyz in speedos!","review":"This is definitely a B-movie, so don't expect great acting or special effects, but boy, does it have hunky guys showing off their glistening bodies as much as possible. Imagine a movie starring a bunch of Abercrombie & Fitch models... and imagine acting along the caliber of said models. The only thing that really bothered me was the ridiculous and annoying \\"special effect\\" used whenever the leeches attacked someone. But, now that it is available at a really low price, it's even more worth it if you like campy, brainless fun. This is one of those flix that you would rate \\"1 star\\" if your reference point is a normal Hollywood blockbuster, but for the genre that it is, this is definitely a great addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack!! The Badness!!! The Aching Badness!!","review":"It didn't take long to figure out what this movie was really about. Having read from the description on the case that it was about swimmers and giant leeches, I figured it would be your basic Laughable-Horror-Flick-With-Bikini-Clad-Babes. Boy was I ever wrong!The film definitely delivers on bad, cheesy, horror, complete with hand-puppet monsters (yeah you heard that right), but there's barely a bikini in sight. Instead it is scene after scene of guys in showers, guys in speedos, guys in tight boxers... it's a heterosexual male's nightmare.No, this is basically an exploitation film designed to appeal to a female and bi/gay male audience. As such, it is probably overdue, and I am glad that such films are being produced--but I have no interest in watching them.If you like bad horror and nigh-naked strapping young men, then you may enjoy this film. Otherwise I'd recommend you avoid it. Real leeches suck blood, but \\"Leeches\\" just plain sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"I always enoy a stupid horror movie, especially David Decocteaus films Voodoo Acadmey and the Brotherhood trilogy. However, this one is just plain bad. The leeches is the thing that ruined this movie. They are so poorly made that all it is, is someones hand in a puppet wiggling up people's body. You can actually see the persons arm! The plot was lame, about a bunch of swim jocks caught up on steroids who are attacked by giant leeches. I will advise you all to stay away, and even David Decocteau fans will be very disappointed, like I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Not The Worst...","review":"Ok, the \\"leeches\\" are rubber leech-gloves on someone's hands, the swimteam is a collection of non-descript male models who cannot act or afford shirts, and the females are utterly useless. Yes, the plot is imbecilic and the dialogue is horrific. Still, I've seen worse. I have seen FRANKENSTEIN ISLAND, my choice for the movie most worthy of total annihilation! So, LEECHES is only painful, not deadly! However, that doesn't mean it's any good either!

I saw this at the video store and thought that this would be great, campy fun. It is fun in spots, but Leeches is way too gay to be ignored.Its not an all male cast, Leeches does have three good looking hoochie actresses in it, and there is enough gore on screen, but there are just too, too many scenes with guys in speedos taking showers...SHEESH! I guess if you are into that sort of thing then this film would get a 4 star rating but I am not, so I take away two.It reminds me alot of Jeepers Creepers 2, another fairly good horror film loaded with scenes of bare-chested young men. I guess that there is a market for this sort of horror film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker","review":"If you like young nubile male bodies in speedos, you may want to see this film, otherwise, boy is it a stinker, it's not funny bad, just bad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure, It's a Really Stupid Movie","review":"My take on this flick is that it's intended as a parody of some of the sexploitation movies of the 1970s, except that it's primarily focused more on young adult males instead of chicks. Since the director is said to be a gay male, this isn't much of a surprise.I doubt the director's intention was ever to consider it as a serious horror movie, but just to poke fun at some of the bad horror flicks from the 1970s, which used attractive young women as victims instead of males.I think many viewers will find this flick amusing, so long as they have a good sense of humor, instead of expecting to see a serious horror movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This movie needs a serious steroid boost on creativity, believability, and budget.

Keep trying Fancee Free, maybe some day you'll figure out that the same designs and fabrics just don't scale up the same when you get into bigger cup sizes.

It's not the best and not the worst that I have found. It is extremely itchy! I even tried trimming the lace off but it's not the lace. It is the fabric around the inside edge. I am not sure what type of fabric it is but it definitely is not cotton! When I took this bra off after wearing for a few hours my skin was red and very irritated around the edges of the bra. The cup fit ok and inside seams didn't bother me. It is one of the few that I have found in my size 38/40 H but there are others out there.

I ordered a couple different ones from online, to try out different ones. This is the one I like the best. It's comfortable, as well as making it convenient to nurse. I also don't feel like the bra is about to burst open at any moment, like I did with some of the others. The hooks that keep the flaps closed are quite secure, never had a problem with them.

This product is very comfortable not to mention they are very thin very comfortable. The problem is that they don't really do anything for my stomach in perticular I am not big at all I am a normal size girl. The thing is that they actually create tummy rolls for me which is odd.

They are very thin and cover all so i like that aspect about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I thought that these would be kind of like cut-off control top panty hose.

It doesn't. you're just really uncomfortable.I had a pair when i was a size 4 and needed to smooth out a few lines and suck in my tummy a bit and, yes, it did the trick then. but at size 12, now, forget about it - the teeny weeny bit it helps just doesn't make the pain worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!","review":"I ordered these according to the size chart.

I'm assuming I need a size smaller, but won't waste anymore money. In The Mood Intimates, the company these shipped from, refused any refund or exchange because the packaging was disturbed, well DUH, had to try them on. Was really unhappy with their services. The legs of these rolled up. They were tight and uncomfortable. They did tuck my tummy in SLIGHTLY, but because they are an extra layer of fabric, made my favorite jeans TIGHTER.

There are entire paragraphs that are literally incomprehensible because the publisher did not comb the text carefully for faults and messy construction.

Now, it appears that Rob used ADO v2.5 for the code used in the book, and there have been some improvements to ADO (it is now at v2.8) which make a few of the timing comparisons, within ado now a bit obsolete.

It comes covered in oil and looks really cheap.After using it this is what I found. The cup is ok; the lid doesn't screw on right but does stay on. It does a great job of spraying, but if you don't know anything about spraying it doesn't comes with any instructions so you have to play around a bit. The wrench that it comes with is crap just through it out. The tip that it comes installed with is really hard to get off, I had to clamp the gun to a work bench and use vice grips to get it off.

The basis of this novel, ridiculing a stereotypical Englishman as inept and out of place, and a stereotypical Irish character as dashing and witty gets old.. Farrell's characters lack inner depth, their words and actions read like a stage-play.Perhaps I should have stoically continued indefinitely, but to me a novel should grab you by page 50 at least..but in this case I got to page 105, and still there was nothing to draw me in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the syrup out of a marmalade bottle","review":"Pretty mediocre , not worth the money.Flavor is dull, and not sharp.Imagine marmalade with no orange preserves in it.Bland flavour..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish.","review":"I bought this book expecting to get a few tips and ideas for building an eco-friendly house.

Rushed to market!","review":"This game certainly has potential but there are just too many bugs for it to be consistently fun. After playing it for just a day it has frozen up multiple times. I got another copy of the game and it also froze up.The Legacy mode also has some irritating bugs. For instance, the computer will automatically sign four 69 PGs to your team every offseason after the second season. This means that if you have a 5 Star PF wanting to sign with you, there may not be room because of the 69 PGs.Another annoyance is that ESPN forces you to control player movement with the analog stick. I switched off of the NBA Live series because of this same issue. Why ESPN NBA lets you choose if you want to use the analog and College Hoops does not, is a mystery.It is obvious that the game was rushed to market before Christmas and it really suffers for it. A potentially great game that has some serious flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst game ever made","review":"This, by far, is the worst game I have ever played. The camera angles are so bad that you can't even tell what is going on, and the players look like they are made out of rubber.

Like the previous 2 seasons, this season is great and full of great, clean, clever comedy. There are 25 episodes on 3 discs in this set, they are all excellent.

Seasons One and Two included various comedy clips from the season, but this set only includes an \\"Interactive Game\\" in Tim's workshop. I'm not really sure what the point was in creating it...I don't see any value with it.

He took bits of several genres and fashioned something from them, truly different and unique.Sort of like Bill Monroe. Or William Shakespeare. Any Tony Joe White album is worth buying.

I rather watch this garbage and laugh, than watch \\"Crossroads\\" with skanky Britney Spears and be bored to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"fan of mariah carey=)","review":"i liked the movie, thought it was cute. If you like cute romance movies and are a fan of mariah carey then watch it, it wont hurt ya lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"CRITICS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING","review":"I thought Glitter was a really good movie. I enjoyed all 103 minutes of it. Even if I wasn't a huge Mariah fan I still would have enjoyed it. This DVD also comes with the videos to \\"Loverboy\\" and \\"Never Too Far\\". Don't listen to any of the critics because \\"Glitter\\" was an awsome movie and I love Mariah alot. You will not be wasting your money if you buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"All That Glitters Isn't Gold","review":"While I enjoy Mariah Carey's music, this move is a trainwreck, only not the kind you can't turn away from. This is easy to walk away from. The movie is uninspired, as is the acting. It boggles the mind what makes pop divas think that because they can sing well, that they can also act. This has only proven true with a few artists, and the others are simply not acting material. Mariah would fall into that category. Her acting lacks emotion and drive, it seems like she is shifting from scene to scene just being there, like scenery. The supporting cast is better, but not much either. The script is a mess too, after a few scenes in the beginning when we see Carey's character being taken away, we're supposed to feel compassion but it doesn't happen. Basically the movie is just to show off Mariah's vocal skills which we already knew she had. Plain and simple. Overall, the acting is horrible, and the movie is boring, stay away from GLITTER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy Movie!","review":"I'm sorry to all the other Mariah Carey fans out there, but this movie was torture. It only sold tickets because of her name on the posters. The photograpy is confusing and hard-to-follow, the acting is basic. Yeah, we all know she has a great voice, but did they have to do it up like poor kid with drug-addicted mother, but she'll make it because of stupid luck. I laughed with all the predictable scenes they threw in! It wasn't all campy enough to make it funny though, which was sad because they took themslves seriously.

First of all, the critics are totally wrong! GLITTER is an enjoyable, light movie to watch. Mariah does OK on her first try as an actress. I admit, some scenes are a bit cheesy but it's not THAT bad. GLITTER begins with flashbacks of Billie's (Mariah's Character) past as a child with her mom. Her mom is a struggling singer that performs at bars/clubs. Soon after Billie's mom puts her in a foster home. Then, GLITTER fast forwards to 1983 in the club scene. Billie is now a young woman working at the club as a dancer. Anyways, to make a long story short she gets discovered by this guy (Dice) and he becomes her boyfriend/mananger. Billie now tries to make it as a singer in the 80's. GLITTER also features appearances by Da Brat and Eric Benet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glitter","review":"i wasnt pleased with this item at all. the dvd doesnt even work so i would like to get my money back if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks mariah","review":"now everyone who sings wants to be an actress and everyone who acts wants to be a singer.

The acting was so one-dimensional, it was almost painful. The actors weren't engaging and i honestly wouldn't have been surprised if they had been holding the scripts and reading them off to each other-it would have had the same effect. Mariah Carey is without a doubt one of the most talented singers out there today and i think her vocal range is mindblowing- but you don't have to be a \\"redneck\\" to see that this movie totally blows.

It's set in the 80's club scene and the music in the movie is mad tight! (GET THE SOUNDTRACK!!) The vintage wardrobe was pulled off amazingly well. Everything looked authentically 80's. (scary huh?) The DVD comes with 2 bonus videos (Loverboy and Never Too Far) and a cool director's commentary. ANyway, the ending was surprising and emotional. This film is surprising and a little bit dark.

Even the film's restaurants don't jibe; Asian-French fusion cuisine (consumed on Billie and Dice's first \\"date\\") didn't exist even in New York nearly 20 years ago. This movie bombed for a reason: Mariah was playing herself and there was no separation between her and Billie. The other problem with the movie is our inability to identify with the character. Basically she was poor who got rich....how many people does that happen to these days?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really didn't deserve the horrible reviews...","review":"Sure, Mariah Carey isn't exactly Oscar-caliber, but it's only her second movie.

I watched this turkey on t.v. awhile back and the critics were right, Glitter is one of the worst films of all-time. Mariah has stated this movie is not autobiographical but it is!

It's a pretty emotional movie, at some parts. It's a great movie... you should really give it a chance! Some of the editing was kinda cheesy, I have to admit, but that doesn't matter.

Those first few times were the charm, but the formula quickly staled. Seems every singer that was offered a film role made one of these type movies[or featured/played a similar role as such in TV shows] or willingly cast themselves to play the the self imposed role. Too predictably calculating and we've seen this type movie come along too many times, depending on the decade and its current most popular singer. This type vehicle is not for \\"actors\\" nor discovering \\"acting ability\\" - its more a stand, pose in an outfit, smile and lipsync your way through the horrible script. The rise and fall of Mariah Carey. \\"Glitter\\"s failure marks Carey as a \\"has been\\" pop star of yesteryear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad cinema","review":"All of the rumors and terrible reviews that you have heard about \\"Glitter\\" are unfortunately true. The rise of young singer Billie Frank (closely resembling Carey's own life) is dull, lifeless and dreadfully boring. The only time the film garners any speed is when some fancy camera work shows dazzling displays of New York. As for Mariah Carey, I have seen worse actors, but her performance is, for the most part, vapid and colorless. And she should slap her hairdresser and makeup artists. She wears her hair in a ridiculous one-sided ponytail that looks hilarious and when she is made up, she looks like Kathi Lee Gifford. Equally bad is Max Beeseley as Carey's manager who tries to act hip and ethnic. Horrors! There are numerous scenes that are dumb beyond belief but the winner has to be when Carey and Beesely, seperated and obviously psychic, compose the same ballad for each other!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A different kind of review","review":"Yes, I haven't seen this movie. But rather than give you a lot of hyperboles relating to sewage or garbage, or subjective and personal reasons why this movie is good (and why Mariah Carey isn't useless as an actress), I will list some things I would rather do than watch Glitter:3.

There should have been other big name actors/actress' to help her out. Whitney at least had Kevin Costner (The Bodyguard), Will Smith had Stockard Channing (Six Degrees of Seperation), Diana Ross had various big name actors (The Wiz) and so forth. I Agree with other reviewers stating the scenes were to short. As soon as you get into a scene it jumps to another scene that has nothing to do with the pervious scene. As far as Mariah's acting... I felt that her expressions did not fit the scene (over acting). In the scenes where she is crying, you can tell the were forced trears. Actors should become the character, so that things come out naturally. Mariah also smiled entirely to much, especially when scenes do not need such smiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glitter Shines with beauty","review":"Mariah Carey is by far the BEST female solo artist in the industry...her 8 octave range cannot be compared with all the others...She is a legend and will always be one...Glitter is suprisingly entertaining considering i didn't expect much...Mariah proves that she can act, and look good while she is doing it...to all the mariah fans, GLITTER!!! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST movie of all time","review":"I actually wanted to see Glitter, then I saw it and instantly regretted it.

Overall everyone in this movie was great, but Mariah out shined them all. In her first starring role I think MC did one heck of a job.

Clearly she's playing it safe by taking a role doing something she's already famous for. That's not exactly a real stretch. I don't think people will be interested in paying nine bucks to see a 90-minute music video with a predictable storyline on the side. Perhaps it might have a somewhat respectable showing since she has a big fan base.

This is a mediocre film built on a hackneyed, hole-ridden plot, shallow characterizations, and editing that strives for and fails to achieve true stylishness.The acting is good enough to keep the viewer from being taken \`outside' the film, and suggests that, given better writers and directors, Carey could have ended up in a film that garnered more positive response. Much of animosity towards this film seems to be a reflection of viewers' animosity towards Carey herself. Her unhinged personal life and the headlines it's generated have translated into a great deal of personal contempt for her and her work.Those expecting a movie that's so bad that it's campy good fun will have to look to masterworks like \\"Showgirls.\\" This one's little more than a bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah amazes me....","review":"All I have to say is that this movie is HIGHLY underrated...There are much worse movies that have done very well and I don't understand why Glitter was so unsuccessful.

There were some teary scenes where she truly embraces emotions so well......*I* was in awe of her talent.If people would give this movie a chance...I know they would like it. It was actually a lot sadder than I expected but nevertheless great. Also, it REALLY makes the Glitter album a lot more meaningful in a good way.....Props to Mariah for doing such a great job...too bad it didn't do to well but she has other movies coming......And just because other people claim they dislike this one it can't stop anyone from enjoying it themself.

Mariah loves herself,this we know,judging from her videos and her appearances on certain tv shows,but she ought to learn that she's a better singer than an actress.Stick to what you're good at! If you're looking for a laugh,unintentional,that is,then,this is for you..If you're a big fan of Mariah's,then you'll get this anyway--probably.I hear she wants to make another movie,but my advice is this:DON'T!

The only downfall to the film is that it doesn't give much of an introduction to Billie Frank's (Mariah Carey) life, and therefore you have to guess what she did in between those years she lost in touch with her mother. Keep in mind this is Mariah's first movie. Ignore the bad reviews, and watch the movie yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big mistake!!","review":"I can't believe they had the nerve to release this on DVD & VHS after it failed so badly. I like Mariah Carey's music (except for the soundtrack to this movie) but let's face it, she can't act! My niece liked the movie and I bought it for her for only $ 5.88 (I can see why it was that low, it sucks). It was a huge mistake to even film this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"QUICK TRIVIA! DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE PLOT IS??","review":"This movie made no sense. Mariah Carey can not act. I guess I would have a nervous breakdown too. Not only did she have to watch this awful movie, she had to star in it. It's enough to make anyone go crazy. Where's the plot? And where are the real actors- meaning people with actual talent. What's up with the ending? I mean c'mon, this movie is a waste of time and money.*NOTE Glitter had no real significance in this movie. Of course what did?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glitter DVD - Mariah Carey","review":"I purchased this DVD for my daughter. It arrived in record time in tip-top shape. The price had even been reduced. Extremely pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah Was Wonderful","review":"Okay OKay She was wonderful is what your thinking?? Well Yes I happen to be Mariah's #1 fan I think that this movie deserves 5 not 2 stars!! This movie was really good even though Mariah says that the movie wsa \\"Watered Down\\" I agree but it was not the most terriblest things i've seen I loved this movie! Mariah did a wonderful performance! I recommend this movie for a couple to sit down and watch the movie together. The critics I disagree with the most they have their opinions and we do to! So If you have the money at this point go ahead buy it! The movie is very sexy, sassy,funny, sad, dramtic moments and all in one movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesefest 2001","review":"I was hoping that Mariah Carey would prove everyone wrong and make a film that actually does something for her acting career. But judging from the cheesefest that was this trailer, she's gonna stink up cinemas everywhere big-time! I mean am I really supposed to believe Mariah Carey as a poor backpacking singer! She would have been better off in a movie like The Bodyguard, somewhere she could play herself. A character film like this is far too taxing for someone who's had so little acting experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a hit, but it shows promising future...","review":"Though it's not Academy Award material, not bad for Mariah being it her first time. The movie wasn't a blockbuster success, at the height of September 11th, no one was really interested in going to the movies a few weeks after the incident. But anyone with an open-mind to see this film might either be pleased or not; the story line is ok, but it could've been better. Though there's no reason to slam Mariah and her personal breakdown which had nothing to do with her debut film. For all you hopeless-romantics out there, give this movie a try. This is just the beginning for Mariah's movie career and whether people like it or not, she's not backing down. For the past 10 years she's given us numerous strings of number one hits -- album after another every year...keep in mind, she's also human. An artist breaks down doesn't mean it's the end forever...so here's to Mariah! And a new chapter begins..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Action Sci-Fi - Recommended","review":"\\"Predator\\" is a guilty pleasure since there really isn't much in the way of great acting or deep hidden meaning, but there are a lot of things blowing up, a very cool alien, and some great hammy lines delivered by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, and Jessy Ventura!No Spoilers from me: The plot is fairly straight forward, a special ops team gets dropped in the jungle to rescue the crew of a downed chopper and things just do not go as planned... The special effects are fairly good and hold up well enough.Again, not very deep but a lot of fun when you are just looking for an action sci-fi to watch.Recommended!

The Predator is defenitly one of the better movie monsters of all time. There is a lot of corny dialogue in the begining which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars. The DVD has a good amount of extras and the picture and sound quaility is good. A little known fact though, the original predator was actually played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. You can tell the difference between the preadtor in the begining of the movie and the end. The director wanted there between a considerable difference between the predator and Arnold."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest movies of all time!!!!!","review":"Between this and Terminator 2, I cant decide which Arnold movie is better. Those 2 movies are my favorites of all time. THIS movie, is excellent. Dont call yourself a man if you dont own this movie, because all real men such as myself own and love this movie.

I can honestly say I thought it looked terrific. I own a Samsung 40\\" HDTV and a Samsung Blu-ray player.It is obvious there was some serious DNR done to this but it wasn't enough to distract me.In simplest terms it looks like it was shot with digital cameras instead of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator","review":"High marks for the movie which I really like, but the quality of this DVD was poor! The DTS sound was awesome but the print used on this DVD was of very poor quality with nicks, scratches and hairs, dirt marks...it looked like it had not been cleaned. This I would expect from a Good Time video but not from Fox. The DVD opened with a spiel on how wonderful Fox videos are with fancy menus, extra features, etc. All this DVD offered was a still photo menu and a trailer. Very disappointing for a Fox video. I hope they'll re-release it with a good quality print and again with DTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Transfer from Fox!","review":"I do not know what Fox Home Entertainment is doing here, but I recently replaced my previous DVD version of this film, hoping the DTS would enhance my viewing experience.

Stick with the Dolby Digital copy. -bad move Fox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your dvd and sve yourself some change.","review":"First of all its not even widescreen and the sound is terrible as well as picture quality for blue ray.It looks washed out and the sound muffled.you will find a similar complaint to the first terminator..Are they trying to lessen the old school action hero movies now?All I know is I stopped this and popped in the dvd and enjoyed it more.that bothers me because I blindly went out and began upgrading my collection.Its hit or miss with blue ray.My guess is later they will come out with another edition for you to buy thats enhanced with \\"features\\".also no special features on on this .My surround sound and big screen tv plays the dvd version with flying colors compared to this ?Hell I'd rather watch the vhs cbs fox video release of this its so insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much DNR it's unwatchable","review":"Simply put they applied so much noise reduction to this movie that it looks awful. There is none of the original film grain, and no detail at all! The only reason to buy this movie is if you want the best example of how incredibly bad an HD transfer can be. If you actually like the movie (like I do) run away, watching this movie will make you cry seeing how a perfectly good movie was destroyed with a horrible transfer. yes, in this case only, the DVD actually looks better then the Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the 2-Disc DVD instead.","review":"I picked this Blu-Ray up for $10 thinking I was getting a good deal. Turns out the old addage, \\"you get what you pay for\\" rears it's head again in this case. Predator on Blu-Ray actually looks WORSE than the 2-Disc DVD upscaled through my BD player. Oh, and they also cut most of the special features for the Blu-Ray. So just to recap, 2-Disc DVD looks better, has more special features, and costs the same (or less). Don't be a sucker like me and stick to the DVD for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"~ A must see... ~","review":"This was probabaly the greatest movie ever created, think about it... a nearly invisible alien that hunts people vs. the guy from terminator!But this movies not just about death and killing people, its a story about death and killing people that u cant get tired of, a great cast supports the plot, Jesse Ventura and Carl Weathers also star in this awesome movie, and its kinda cool to see a governer pull out a mini gun and start killing guerillas!Even though you know that he will probabally survive in the end, it doesnt hinder the plot... cuz its got an awesome ending! i recomend this for anyone whos never seen it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BLU-RAY","review":"SENCE I GOT A BLU-RAY PLAYER, IV'E BEEN GETTING BLU-RAYS FOR ALL THE MOVIES I LIKE.

Yet I do think why this editions for the Alien and Predator films are coming out so close to each other is for the summers next cross over. Alien vs Predator. But to the film, the first predator was by far the best. Sending in comandos into a rain forest and each one being killed off is truly a scary sight and yet the movie is full of action. Predator is by far one of my favorit films and I will go by this film when it comes out three days before the opeaning of AVP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED","review":"This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover.this is first version of the movie.

While the extras are awful I could live with them if something had been done to clean up the film itself.Sometimes the film gets grainy and the colours wash out and neither has been fixed for this release.Until they do some restoration I can't think that there is a reason to buy it.

Nothing else was on and so I decided to watch Schwarzenegger shoot some stuff up. I'd seen the movie before in the theater years ago and remembered it was entertaining but I had forgotten how good this movie really was! More than just a commando film, the plot to this film is admirable - a commando team (with the Gov. Ventura himself, no less) is dropped into the jungle to rescuse some hostages. Along the way, they realize they are being hunted by the ultimate Preditor. This alien advisary is phenominal and truly frightening. Even knowing the ending, I was on the edge of my seat to see how Arnold with win against such odds.In a day when action films are only ho-hum and the world is without a true action hero to root for (Vin Diesal is NOT Arnold in his prime), this movie is a refreshing reminder of what a great action movie should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this seller that goes by 2 different names!","review":"Received the DVD & all looked ok!

This new ultimate hunter edition is hands down the best version of a classis film to date. I bought the movie for 15.00 at Walmart and got a 10.00 movie cash to see Predators. I don't know what all the complaints are about with the DNR issues. Blu-ray is \\"High Def\\", if you want old dirty looking films with grain don't buy blu-ray movies!! In addition, if you are having problems with too much DNR, simply turn off the DNR feature on your television. I had the same problem with DVD's and that fixed the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"PQ not bad like I expected","review":"I have both Blu-ray releases now and just finished watching the Ultimate Hunter edition. I understand some of the criticisms, but overall I'm happy with the restoration done on this movie. Color correction makes a big difference in the consistency of the video presentation here, and the sound quality is excellent. Grain is all but gone, which for me isn't distracting unless you're intentionally comparing the two blu-ray releases instead of watching the movie for enjoyment.My (likely unpopular) opinion is this is a good restoration of an older film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action film, OK DVD package","review":"I have always liked this film.FAVORITE BIT. JESSE VENTURA & THAT GUN HIS CHARACTER USED!! Just loved that.Good action film.Script however. TO THIS DAY I STILL CAN NOT FIGURE OUT IF I HEARD CORRECTLY 1 LINE ARNOLD'S CHARACTER DUTCH SAYS. MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL. When, he, Carl Weathers & his men attack the camp the hostages are in. He yells at one of his men & MAKES NO SENSE.BEFORE we learn Carl's character sent them there for a different reason FOR NO REASON all of Arnold's men treated him like garbage, with an attitude. What did the character do BEFORE we learn about the REAL MISSION to deserve that?Kind of a tacky DVD package. Thin card board. Mine is hard to get closed up.Ok, regular, normal extras.A passable, OK DVD package."},{"rating":"2","title":"ultimate hunter edition far superior","review":"I just finished watching the ultimate hunter edition of predatorand it a far superior version than the previous blu-ray edition.

That assesment stands regardless of if you currently own the movie or not.With virtualy no extra features at all and picture quality that doesn't look one iota better then the standard definition release (clearly the film wasn't remastered), the two disc standard definition version continues to be the edition to buy.The movie is one of my favorites, but this edition represents a terrible dollar value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predator","review":"One of my favorite movies ever. Why this did not do as good as Terminator is a mystery to me. Easily the better of the two films by star power alone.

The charactors are memorable, especially the predator itself. The music is tense and suspensful, but not overblown 'hero' music, which would've been completely out of place here. The settings, from the military base to the helicopters to the beautiful, lush jungle, are absolutely fantastic. The special effects are very good, still perfectly good today in the age of CGI. The action is excellent, the humor slick, and the gore at just the right level.

That disc is filled with goodies such as a behind-the-scenes making-of documentary, old and new interviews with the cast and crew, outtakes, a deleted scene, special effects segments, camouflage tests and a text profile of the creature and its weaponry, plus a photo gallery!!!

The picture quality on this Blu-Ray is garbage and there are no extras other than a trailer. Don't waste your money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Movie - Terrible BluRay","review":"Being a die hard Predator (not Predator II of course) fan, I considered myself lucky to find the Blu Ray version on sale at target for $15.00, and I bought it to replace my SD version.

If you're considering upgrading to Blu Ray - DON'T!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"People are IDIOTS","review":"First off, I was skepticle of this purchase, just because of what I read here. I bought the older Blu Ray, not the Ultimate Hunter Edition. As far as the picture goes, there is not as much detail as say a new Blu Ray for a movie released this year. I honestly have no complaints about this. I love the film, it gets 5 stars. The Blu Ray is not what people are making it out to be. I read that the people now looked like were made of wax in the film, not at all true. DO NOT believe anything from the negative reviews. Head on over to BluRayreview.com and look up this Blu Ray, they do not complain about things like AMAZON reviewers do. They found the good. Take it from me, a previous skeptic, this is a very decent Blu Ray and I imagine this is the best Predator has looked to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray version","review":"I have both the SD and Blu-Ray version and can tell no difference.

Who the heck was in charge of this Blu-Ray transfer??? Does the 'Ray' stand for Ray Charles? because it looks as if a blind man choose to use this print!

If I'm gonna pay a higher price, then I should get a much better picture.

The movie is classic, just don't buy the Blu-Ray version unless you find it in a bargin bin somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ratings should be for the Blu-Ray-HORRIBLE Transfer","review":"There is NO WAY, that this film gets a cumulative 4/5. The ratings have been pulled over from the SD. Amazon, please consider adding a separate database field for PQ and AQ for the hi-def products.This movie itself for me is a 5. I love it! The transfer- a nightmare. Tons of noise, color flutuation and light changes/artifacting. The picture is soft, too.Fox/MGM were just (10/2008) given some of the worst ratings, for their Blu-Ray releases and I understand why. I am a huge fan of this franchise, and was incredibly excited to see this in hi-def. If 0 stars was an option, I'd give it a 0. This Blu-Ray transfer is among some of the worst that I have seen.For the premium price paid for Blu-Ray I expect a pristine picture and sound. Fox/MGM I hope you're listening. This truly is shameful!I am thoroughly disappointed and all of the future MGM/Fox titles will be considered \\"rentals\\" until I see an review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never out of date.","review":"The predator in the movie is amazing. It builds up so much terror in its hunting hobbies and its pursuit to kill. John McTiernan does a brilliant job of building suspense throughout the movie which makes you love this movie.Predator contains a great plot with great characters and is a legendary action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger acting in his peak. The special effects are also outstanding and they will never be out of date. This movie is a classic tense thriller and it deserves the credit which it receives. One of my best films so watch it and find out what you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Action Movie!","review":"This is without question one of my all time favorite Arnold movies. This movie has it all. Arnold leads a group of commandos into the jungle to locate some kidnapped Americans. He and his troops find everyone slaughtered. The monster then begins on Arnold and the commandos. This is one of the most sinister killing machines you will ever see in a movie. The action is nonstop.You will also have to brag on the scenery in this movie as well. It definitely is eyecatching. The stars are also top notch. The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. The big question is,will Arnold be able to handle the killing machine from outer space? Watch this video,you will be greatly entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any collection","review":"How do I give this movie more than 5 stars?

As well as that, the menus and packaging are also far superior.

First section of the movie has the plot reminding me of Stallone's FIRST BLOOD PART 2. After the initial mission has done well, another mysterious task looms to the special task force led by Dutch played by Swarzenegger. Highly intelligent alien monster is elusive and hardly gives the team the clue to what it is until the end(even after the movie ends nagging question \\"who is he?\\" remains unsolved).It is so so enjoyable movie with high tension satisfying both the action movie fans and monster sci-fi fans.Verdict: Enjoyable movie and a nice start for longlasting series.Rating: 85 out of 100Recommended for: Alien movie fans and action movie fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Film Grain.","review":"Still Predator, but in some scenes (especially when Dutch and Dillon first reunite), the film grain has been digitally removed and the actors look waxy.

However, my anticipaqtion is now total disappointment. The film is so over digitally restored that it does'nt that it look at all like the original film. Most scene's look unnatural and fake! Yes, I know movie's are fake, but if the special effects are done to make the experience realistic, as they were with this film, it now makes this version of the movie look extermely unrealistic.

This is definitely one of my all-time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD Of An Excellent Film","review":"Predator is a very good movie and is very unfairly underrated but this DVD bites big time. The picture and sound is bad (the picture is grainy and the sound constantly skips). Not only that, but there are NO extras other than the trailer (which is a Teaser if you can believe that!).

Arnold plays the good guy with brains and brawn and a foreign woman to boss around.

At the time that was a very true statement. I still remember the first time I saw this film. I was chilled to the bone unlike I had ever been before (granted I was only 13). The film follows a group of US Army Commandos led by non other than the manly man himself Arnold Schwarzenegger (of whom I am NOT a fan but he works here) as they are picked off one by one by a mysterious creature. This creature has come down to hunt men and that he does. The action is top notch, and the final showdown between man and beast is brilliant. Even now, almost 20 years after the film's release, it's still top-notch entertainment. From the moment we see the skinned bodies hanging from the trees to the moment we hear that horrid creature laughing as he knows his life is over we are glued to our seats and ingrossed in one of the best action films ever to be released.

The old and this new one. The old is grainy like the film itself. Unfortunately the compression is only MPEG2 and can't handle the grain properly. It looks like film with some compression artifacts on top. This new Blu Ray is the same transfer, just with large doses of digital grain filtering applied and then well compressed. It does not look like film anymore, it looks like a video game. A wax museum with CGI puppets and scenery. If that's your thing you will love it. I'll stick with the old BD and wait for FOX to come to their senses and give the unfiltered transfer an appropriate AVC encoding. Or better, redo the transfer so it's state of the art. Filtering older transfers to death so the anti grain crowd is appeased is just lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predator!","review":"Before Die Hard, John McTiernan helmed this action plus gore fest starring Ah-Nold Schwarzenegger as Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer, on a mission with a bunch of hulky army guys to kill an invisible alien. One of the big man's best films, with great action, a creepy musical score and Stan Winston's excellent alien. However it still succumbs to the formulaic \\"kill everyone but the main guy\\" ending. And plausibility as well as subtlety are nowhere to be seen. But who cares? The action ante is great, and McTiernan's talent for over-the top action can be seen very clearly here.

But this transfer...oh my god. It has more grain than a wheat field. The picture's fuzzy, and on my 50\\" tv it barely looked any better than the DVD version of the movie. There's also NO real special features, just a theatrical trailer, so there's really no point in buying the blu ray. Maybe someday they'll clean it up more, but this transfer sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good tweny years later.","review":"After twenty years this is still one of the quintessential action movies. Better than it's sequel and far, far superior to AVP. I place it right next to Aliens as one of the best sci-fi movies ever. With few exceptions the FX are on par with those seen in today's films. The casting is nearly flawless, I not talking about great actors here, what I mean is they are perfectly cast in these roles. Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, and Sonny Landham really make you believe in these guys. Sure they're over the top and comic book like with bulging muscles but the way they are portrayed makes you actually give a damn about what happens to them. Even thought Arnold wins in the end it costs him his entire team to achieve victory, if you can call it that.The DVD itself has a lot of great behind the scenes stuff. The transfer of the movie could have been better but it is twenty years old so I can't expect it to look perfect.

For all their dense, breathless wordplay and thick, stewy production, you'd be forgiven for thinking that there's a surfeit of content, threads to untangle, layers to peel through. The disappointing reality is that all these five-dollar words and murky sonic tapestries are impressionistic at best, a fact that wouldn't be in the least bit troubling were Anticon's more lucid moments not filled with blazing rhetoric in deference to some sort of hidden insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Sage verse found in Bible Code","review":"Absurd long-words perform surgical intrusions,Impeding the brain with cranial confusions,Convoluted metaphors create pompous delusions,Leaving cyberpseuds with paranoid illusions"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Poetry not Really Hip hop","review":"Sage Francis sounds like a confuse Alternative rocker.He lacks anessentail ingredient of Hip Hop \\"Street savvy\\".The beats are Kind of Stale.

The moment the first song \\"Crack Pipes\\" starts you will feel swept up into Sage's world of middle class torment. As Sage's words flow like honey from your speakers, you will think \\"Hey, that kid down the street with baggy pants would sound better over these beats than this guy!\\". As Sage takes you through tough issues such as relationships with handicapped people (climb trees), selling dime bags (eviction notice), and alzheimer's stricken parents (cup of tea), youll squirm all the way and wonder who the #1 stunna really is. An excellent companion to \\"The Marshall Mathers Show\\" for anyone who likes deep caucasian \\"rapping\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of hip hop's best lyrically","review":"the songs for the most part aren't especially creative but his lyrics are enjoyable and i appriciate the fact he talks about his life.the beats fit his lyrics well.his style grows on you and at times gets old but overall it decent enough.he does lots of stuff with word play to keep it interesting though.it's definitely one of the better releases in hip hop lyrically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Take it Out of the CD Player","review":"Personal Journals is pure Sage Francis. What is Sage Francis? He is \\"different\\". This is an album that you can't fully appreciate within even the first two listens. His raw emotion and wit is impressive at least. I would recommend this album to anyone interested in underground hip hop, and to anyone wishing to broaden their hip hop horizons. Sage Francis deserves more recognition and a lot more coverage.

Thought she would love this version since she loves the Shrek movies. She loves playing this game and it's fun for adults to play too. Don't think it's really an \\"educational\\" game, and most of it is cardboard so it could get beat up pretty quickly, but we are careful about putting it away in its box and keeping the pieces in little plastic bags so they don't get lost. All in all, it's just a fun game to play with your kids. There are few companies that make a Shrek Operation and you'll see some at outrageous prices. I think we paid around $15. I've never seen in a store for under $30."},{"rating":"2","title":"arthouse cafe 3","review":"I found this selection of European Film Music harmonically well put together...although I expected to have the themes played a little longer - some are only two to three minutes long - This takes away from the beauty of the melody.

This is another example of those who can, do and those who can't, teach. The author is a college professor with many designations after his name.

I am sure he never had to make a split second decision that had profound consequences on someone's life.For whatever reason, this book was on the reading list for the promotional exam...so I read it.

This book was required reading for my Sergeant promotional exam. As for content, the book actually said that officers should not arrest the drug dealers, but should work with them and help them find a job at McDonald's. More crap ideas follow. I realize that you're probably going to buy and read the book anyway because other agencies have been duped into using it for promotional exams. I just wanted to prepare you for the BS that you are about to be subjected to.Also, the publisher/editor of this book needs to do some serious proofreading. I found over 70 errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Most of these should have been caught by simple spell check."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"This book is terrible. It reads like The author copy/pasted works from other literature to force his hippy message of saving the country from police departments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful for Police Officers to Read","review":"This text was required reading on a recent promotional exam. I had to memorize the reasons police are ineffective at fighting crime, how the Broken Windows theory is wrong, and how COMSTAT and the NYPD had nothing to do with the drop in the murder rate in NYC. If you believe that the police can do nothing about crime and should concentrate on fighting poverty and improving social conditions, this is the book for you. If you would like to learn about how to build rapport between a community and it's police force, go somewhere else. It made me angry to read this book, knowing that it is being forced upon police supervisors who have to memorize this information in order to suspend common sense and test well. If you think Dirty Harry carried a .357 (even the pop culture references are wrong) this is the book to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soap","review":"This soap is wonderful.

This basis soap really helps minimize any blemishes I do get.

What I hadn't expected was something so small. When told it would have 32 different patterns in the kit it misleads you a little. You only get 7 or 8 sheets front and back with mostly basic fundimental designs on them that repeat only in a slightly different manner. It also doesn't give ANY instrustiion on how to do any of the \\"lessons\\" shown. you need to look at the picture and figure it out for yourself. If you are just starting out and don't know what you're doing this would be good for you. Otherwise you know everything that is shown here. Better yet save your money and take a decorating course."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Alternative Universe?","review":"Strange that Coonets chose to kill of Fidel Castro AGAIN in this novel after he was shot after a revolution in Cuba in his previous work Under Siege. Never figured that out, especially since his main characters continued along in their own timelines. Perhaps this is a Star Trek-like alternative universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's Best ...","review":"Stephen Coonts served in Vietnam as a carrier based fast-jet pilot. Tom Clancy, so legend has it, sold insurance.My point is this: If you want real-time warfare, read Coonts. Without a doubt America's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changes In Cuba","review":"This was the first Coonts novel that I have ever read and found it very enjoyable and plan on reading more. The story here is very good and follows some of Tom Clancy's style where characters are introduced through out the book and than braught together at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good use of old biological threat scenario","review":"Good little story about a sudden threat from Cuba. Enjoyed the narrative on life in Cuba and the people living there. Character development was a little light - especially if you are not familiar with Grafton/Tarkington from previous novels. Addition of the CIA agents was very good. As Grafton's rank increases it's becoming harder to keep him in the action. Some of the instances where the battle group command team inserts itself in the action are like those old Star Trek episodes where the least expendable people expose themselves to the most danger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one his better books","review":"I felt the book was a bit slow. I like his books when he writes about aviation (Flight of the Intruder, the intruders, etc.) Here, the aviation seemed secondary to the action on the land.What I'd like to read is a prequal to his \\"flight of the intruders\\" book, maybe having him a nugget on his first combat cruise, or having a book about jake even before that, describing his naval air training, the replacement squadron he was in, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reading thriller.","review":"I really enjoyed \\"Cuba\\". It is suspensful and well written. Just the kind of thriller I enjoy. I have read many of the \\"Jake Grafton Novels\\" and have enjoyed them all.

However with Cuba Coonts drifts from the military action genre to political-fiction and the result is very disappointing ! I did not even finish the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed & Dull","review":"Seems like Coonts just went through the motions on this one. I dove into this book expecting another fast-paced Jake Grafton military thriller. Soon discovered Jake had a minor role and thought: OK, maybe Coonts is passing the torch from Jake to Toad Tarkington. Much to my chagrin, Toad also had minor role. Call this one a DUD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real Thought-provoking Thriller!","review":"I could not put this book down! As a former USAF B-52 crewmember, I could visualize every facet of the master \\"game plan\\" and marveled at the technical accuracy of the author! Dynamite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"another bomb","review":"In the usual fashion of Stephen Coonts novels they take the best clip from the book to lure unsuspecting people to buy the book. Once you get the book though you trudge through page after page of slow and boring literature.. To put it into perspective, I am more likely to pick up my Economics text and read it for fun than i am to read Cuba. The book is horribly drawn out.. What could have been said in 100 pages has been drawn out to 390 pages. Guess I should have learned from the Under Seige. I recommend reading a book by a better author such as Dale Brown or Tom Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted but otherwise enjoyable","review":"Coonts gets the politics of present day Cuba all wrong (Castro, survivor of countless assassination attempts, allows an underling to accumulate enough power to threaten him and where is Raul?) He also misses the boat on some of the cultural aspects (Casinos in Havana while Castro still lives.) Nonetheless, if the reader can get past the unlikley setup, the story is interesting though not gripping. Still, like a film shot in Vancouver, B.C. while supposedly taking place in Seattle, this reader could not put the obvious errors regarding \\"location\\" out of my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ever happened to the storyline?","review":"I've been an avid reader of Mr. Coonts books up until now. I was really disapointed when I read that Fidel Castro was \\"alive\\" after being killed in the book \\"Under Seige\\". Even Jack Yocke wrote a series of stories on the subject on that book. I expected a lot from this book and I didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, unintresting, did not hold my attention.","review":"did not in no way come up to the standard of any of his other books, all of his other books were outstanding, cuba read like it was written by someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Clinton character assault ruined this mediocre book.","review":"I would have put 0 stars, but I guess you can't in Amazon's system. The book is good bedtime reading because its descriptions of Cuba are just interesting enough to get your mind off daily concerns, but not so good that you can't fall asleep. Even at the end I was just reading a chapter or two at a time. When Coonts describes an evil character as a \\"liar of Clintonian magnitude\\" I realized that I didn't like Coonts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on ideas?","review":"OK, Ill keep this simple. The big dissapointment for me was the \\"return\\" of Castro after his death in Under Siege. Are we running short on plot twists here? If you know what Im taking about, i was half expecting El Hakim to swoop from the sky and attack from his transport plane. Its a good read, but not on par what I have come to expect for this author. He must have written this book just to get something out on the shelves to please his publisher. So, its interesting, but I would really like to see this author get back to \\"basics\\" and further develop the Jake Grafton gang of characters and not try and bring back the dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Stephen's Standard.","review":"When Stephen Coonts wrote 'Flight of the Intruder' he wrote it like the ex-Navy Aviator he was. When he wrote Cuba he wrote like a lawyer and it's disappointing. Lots of words but not much action. And everything is politically correct with the ladies doing most of the flying. And, oh yes, a two star admiral flying an F-14 off the deck of a carrier! Really, Stephen! Give us a break.IF you can wade through the first two-hundred pages you might get interested in this story. But I did a lot of wiggling around in my chair and never really enjoyed any of this. Maybe add a star if you are a female."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly a page turner","review":"I have greatly enjoyed Mr. Coonts past books, most of which I found gripping and hard to put down. But with Cuba, I found it hard to pick up. I don't think I can explain exactly what is wrong with this book other than saying it is..well...kinda dull for this author. The plot is rather plodding and never really fully encompasses the reader in its excitement and, personally, I don't really care about Cuban political struggles. I'll say it again, I really can't define what is wrong other than the fact that the book is truely boring. Don't waste your money on the hard-cover edition, save it for the paperback or, better yet, check it out from the library for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shel Silverstein and Bobby Bare were made for each other","review":"The Shel Silverstein songs interpreted by Bobby Bare are as priceless today as when first released and I remember way back then..this album is worth the price just for these songs Bobby can sing a ballad and does on this cd ..his duo with Rosanne Cash is very moving ...BUY IT AND ENJOY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Bobby Bare is a great singer, one of the most underrated country singers ever.

Unfortunately this DVD version is copied from video and is not easy viewing on large and projection televisions. The sound quality is particularly poor in the first half of the film. At this price, buy the video or wait for a studio to release a proper transfer edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I love this movie, and not all of it is historical fiction! There was a woman named Desiree Clary she was the first love/fiance of Napoleon Bonaparte. She married one of his marshals, Jean-Baptise Bernadotte whom was elected to become King of Sweden in the early ninteenth century. Desiree's and Jean-Baptise's descandents are still on the throne of Sweden to this day.There is only one thing I have against this movie: (1) There are some scenes that are missing, but are found in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brando just smoldered in this film.","review":"He's absolutely **seductive** in this role. He just draws you in and you stay through the film, which is sometimes bogged down in tableus, just to see Brando own every scene he's in.But I do hope to find a better version. This one was dark and murky even on my bright computer screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Brutal As Music Gets","review":"...I'm still vomiting from sheer terror after hearing this album.

But its the music that makes the journey special."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite battery operated vibe","review":"The price here is a little higher than I've seen elsewhere. I love this vibrator. Next to the Wahl Coil for clitoral stimulation and the pocket rocket for fun on the go, this one is a favorite. I don't find it flimsy, but it does have too many settings. I love the constant vibe with full power, but there are four other pulses offered and it is tricky to get back to the preferred setting once the new one is engaged. My current iflex vibrator has served me well. The batteries must be inserted properly and the back shut tight for the vibes to continue, which may explain why the other authors have been frustrated and complained of short life. If my husband didn't provide some technical help in this area I might be as frustrated as the others. I would love to see an updated version with improved button controls and more secure battery compartment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I bought this for my wife because it looked cool and the price was right but I should have listened to the other reviewer.It stopped working after 2 days and the replacement sounds like it's about to die right out of the box.Save your money,even at this price this thing is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"I knew when i bought it that it was $20 under all the other sites and that should have thrown up warning signs but i still bought it because the other Doc product i bought (from a store not online) Has been working for 3 years if not more now.

But i am also a trained opera singer so when music is badly written it REALLY bothers me. Ok, the cd... The song \\"Fame\\" is very well done, unfortunatly, it all kind of goes down-hill from there. I am not going to knock any of the singers, they are all very talented young people and i dont dare insult my fellow x-generations. My objection to this musical is the MUSIC. It gets repeditive in parts, some notes are held too long, some songs arent long enough. My recomendation for this CD: wait until the show comes out on broadway, by that time they will have fixed most of its little \\"musical problems\\" and it will be very good (i hope). But as for this version, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much talent...so much good material.","review":"Fame the musical is fully superior to the movie version. Natasha Renalls hits every note with gusto, and if you don't remember her name, you'll definitely remember her voice. This show is full of different personalities. If you are a fan of high school musicals, fun shows, funny lyrics, or the theater in general, get this CD. The unknown talent is phenomenal. If you are a musical theater nut, this show has a ton of good material to get in touch with. I met a few members of the touring company after one of their shows, and every single person was so nice and down to earth. Fame may not go to Broadway and it may not become the next famous American musical. But for those people who get a chance to know it, it stays in your heart. It's profound as well as it is fun. Anyone who gets this CD will end up relating to it and singing along. The songs are catchy and mostly easy to learn. Another bonus is that it's easy to understand the story just by getting the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I think I figured out why none of the cast members aren't famous... they can't sing! Who casted this? They need to be fired. We need fresh voices WITH TALENT to portray Broadway's up and coming. Believe me, the characters in this show won't be 'makin it' anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge the production by this recording!","review":"I saw the American touring company in Boston last night (\\"press night\\") and was blown away. I have seen every musical that is currently up and running on Broadway and have yet to see a show that surpasses Fame in terms of energy, enthusiasm, or even sheer, all-around talent. (And you thought Rent had energy??). The only weakness of the show is that it doesn't follow through on or develop many of the story lines (but that would, of course, take a few more hours and considering the time they had, I think they did a pretty decent job). This recording, however, doesn't do justice to the the outstanding production. The energy and talent simply doesn't transfer well to CD. But please, I almost made the mistake of passing up an opportunity to see Fame because I was upset with the quality of the recording...don't make the same mistake! I'll admit, the music sounds pretty corny in your stereo, but when you see it live...wow. Go see Fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FABULOUS SOUNDTRACK FROM A FABULOUS MUSICAL!","review":"This is undoubtedly my favourite CD that I have got, and it will be my favourite CD for many years to come.

This CD should be part of everyone's collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for musical lovers!","review":"So, the CD is totally different from the video. That's okay. I think the CD captures excellence the life of teenagers plus a positive message of going out in the world and trying to change it for the better. The best part about the recording is that they did not enhance the voices. I saw the touring cast and they actually sound that great! I think if you order this recording you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the London FAME?","review":"I saw this show first on the West End and thought it was okay. They singing was decent. I just got this recording and was VERY disappointed. The recording was even technically bad. If you ever get a chance to hear the London Cast you will note the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Attempt At A Great Musical - Robert Edmunds","review":"After hearing the first two tracks of this recording , I immediately grabbed my copy of the London Cast Recording and played it 3 times in a row! I expected much more of this CD, considering the reviews that I have read previously, and that most Broadway and American recordings are sometimes a lot better than British ones. The singing is very weak and the orchestrations are really lousy. It is almost as if the musical director has a completely different score in front of him. There are, however two tracks that save the day - \\"These are my Children\\" and the Finale \\"Bring on Tomorrow\\". However, if you want to listen to a first class production, DON'T buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FAME MIGHT NEVER MAKE IT TO BROADWAY","review":"I dont know if they are planning to take this show to Broadway, If they are planning to, I certainly DO NOT suggest it! The show begins with the song Pray I Make P.A which has such upsurd lyrics as \\"Next Week I going to be gone/ Where's the John?\\" This is just one example. The worst 2 songs of the show are \\"Tyrone's Rap\\" and \\"Cant Keep it Down\\". One of the better numbers is between two teachers and is called \\"The Teachers Argument\\". The Best number in the show is \\"I Wanna Make Magic\\" about a boys dream to be a star in theater. I think the lowest part of the show is when they actually mention the movie Fame! Even some flops have better songs then this! This show has some likeable moments but I recommened buying something else first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your $$","review":"Terrible.

Boy, was I disappointed. There is not ONE song that remotely compares with the quality of the original Michael Gore score for the movie. Even the songs for the TV show were better! This CD about high school kids sounds like it was written BY high school kids. Very weak, very obvious rip-***s of concepts gone before. I'm sure that on stage the cast has energy, but on disk the lyrics (embarrassing rhymes) and melodies (nothing remotely intelligent) are just poor. Some of the voices are OK, but its hard to listen to Regina Le Vert's damaged voice for an entire track. I'm sorry, but FAME should be called LAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This will never be the movie","review":"I have listened to 3 versions of this musical and seen 1, I've read the script and played the music. and it all boils down to the point that the musical is too much of a bad spin off of the movie. It saws that the movie isn't real life and that the musical is. But in fact the movie is by far more realistic than the musical, so please unless don't by this cd expecting to hear the award winning music of Micheal Gore from the movie FAME because you'll be dissapointed when you hear at most 30 secs of the movies music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Price on a necessary item!","review":"NEPRO is very useful to diabetics with kidney problems.Prices vary GREATLY; Amazon prices are usually the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very funny but lacking in propriety","review":"Shelton is hilarious.

I don't mind a little garden-variety cussing here and there, but Shelton really lets loose at times and pulls out the big ones--the offensive ones, that is. She did not end up using the F word, but frankly I don't know what stopped her; everything else was there. She really doesn't need the shock factor to be funny either. She's a riot. She's definitely been in the trenches, but she could take a lesson from Erma the Great.

I'd guess that this studio? didn't spend $5. pesos on the work. Some clips remind of when I watched the movie and 50 people, sitting in front of me, were all smoking.

This collection starts off great, with a couple of wonderful stories, but the second half of the book (along with The Red Pony parts (another of John Steinbeck's drab writings)) is very bad and yawn-inducing.My favorite story was \\"The Flight\\", and that is the only reason I am rating this 2 stars instead of 1. \\"Johnny Bear\\" is also a good story in this collection, and a fairly humorous one as well.Check this out at the library for a couple of good stories, but do not purchase it as it would be a waste of money.

But then brutality raises its ugly head with \\"Flight\\" and others such as \\"The Vigilante,\\" \\"Johnny Bear,\\" and \\"The Murder.\\" One thing all of his stories have in common is a terrific depiction of character. These people ring true. Their plights and fears and joys are well expressed by Steinbeck and felt by me, the reader.

Then before we left the house for the day I decided to give it a test run with my baby in it before we left and I am so glad I did! As soon as I placed him in it- I hated it! It made him sit so low that it was very uncomfortable. Then I tried to put the straps around my waist line instead of my hips and the straps had to be so tight around to keep him up that it was very uncomfortable! The shoulder strap was also very little.

In the story, vampires (there's only two) can get a nice tan, they don't kill by biting their victim in the neck, the 'fake' vampire even ages . . . and they eat (drink is more like it) once every six days!! Don't you think these are boring characteristics for a vampire? It completely eliminates the scare-factor and by eliminating the scare-factor, the novel metamorphose from a horror story to a drama. It was this change in story-telling that frustrated me the most.

The books in the middle of the series are incredibly long-winded and delve into philosophical questions usually reserved for Hobbes, Locke, Nietzsche, and others. The series creates a messiah-like character but does it very slowly, one layer at a time. The author does a good job of reminding the reader that we celebrate what is exceptional about human nature and great deeds should be rewarded instead of encouraging mediocrity. No one celebrates the team that loses the Super Bowl after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, Book 1)","review":"This book is a great read and very original material. I love the creative different classes of characters. There is great drama between the characters and a very good story line. I highly recommend for anyone that loves fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"I'll admit it, I only read 250 pages of this book. That's all I could stand. How can this book be compared to good SF/Fantasy writing? The characters were simple-minded fools, and the dialogue between them was excruciating. After reading the final 20 pages, I realized that the hero was betrayed by his jealous brother, the good wizard was his grandfather, his enemy was his father, and he's in love. How sweet. Sound like a B movie? No, B movies are over in 2 hours, this book drags on for over 800 pages! Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"SERIOUSLY disappointing","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book. Kudos go to the narrator, who does a fabulous job of emoting and expressing a wide range of characters. His performance truly is impressive.That said, the writing is HORRENDOUS. The book lurches from one scene to the next, leaving threads hanging everywhere. The characterizations are flat and inconsistent. Richard (the protaganist) has more modd swings than a drunken manic-depressive. It's sad that this book did well enough to force a series on the world, when there are far, far better authors getting far less attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily the most overrated book of the fantasy genre","review":"Blah. Overrated, overdone, overkilled, and there are many better authors out there that write better stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge waste of time and money","review":"I tried to read this book after recommendation from several different sources. Within the first chapter I knew this is going to be a horrible book. I tired to give this book a chance in hopes that it will get better in the end, but it never did. I have been reading fantasy books for 10+ years and I have never found a book I did not want to finish at all.The storyline is very stereotypical, but if this author is going to be common at least give us some interesting characters! Instead of interesting characters the author puts his weak characters through a storyline of disconcerting things such as rape, murder, and torture. I don't know why his sold so well.I wished I could rate this lower than a 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-necessary cruelty","review":"When this book came out, I read it, and it stopped me cold. I couldn't continue on with the storyline due to the intensely graphic depictions of cruelty against children. I think it's possible to make a villian seem like a villian without the long, graphic and often tedious depictions of child torture. Not on a crusade here, but reading this book made me want to scrub my brain with soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Place on shelf and back away quickly","review":"Do not fear. You can pick up Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time seriesThe Wheel of Time (Boxed Set #1)and read what Terry Goodkind horribly tried to imitate. If you read them both you see what I mean. I did not believe the Wheel of Time was as great as everyone said but I enjoyed quite a bit and find myself waiting for each new book. The characters have more depth, the story line makes sense, and the action is realistic. Goodkind's characters just do whatever they need to to continue what almost passes as a story line. They do not follow descriptions or previous actions or dialogs. It reads like a child cheating at a role playing game. Great fantasy writing in English has one name, George R. R. Martin.A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I believe that not4prophet got the review right.

Save yourself before its too late!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing!","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend and *attempted* to read it. The story was fairly interesting, but from page one I could not get past the sophomoric writing: cliched phrases, laughable and predictable dialogue, and a dull, somewhat limited vocabulary. I wanted to like it and to continue reading, but after the first chapter I just couldn't subject myself to it any more. I have drafts of \\"first chapters\\" written in high school that are more sophisticated than this stuff. Sorry, Goodkind fans, but it was truly awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had read the reviews before buying","review":"It would have saved me the wasted time that I spent reading this drivel (no insult meant to drivel). The other reviewers' descriptions of the horrible aspects of this book are spot on. There is virtually no character development. And yet, there is also no real scene description either. To the extent there is a plot, it is also poorly developed. Looking back on it, I'm not sure what all of the words on the pages actually accomplish other than filling space. On top of all of that, the writing style and dialogue are infantile. An utter waste of time.Do not repeat my mistake and actually pay for this book. For that matter don't waste your time reading it if it's given to you for free - unless it is to learn how not to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a waste of time... Horrendous read","review":"The first volume of the Sword of Truth. Colleagues who do not know anything about fantasy advised me this one, so I picked it up....such a mistake. The writing style is kiddish at best, the characters have absolutely no depth, and the plot is laughable. I gave up after maybe 2/3 of the book, too much for me...Afterwards, I came across interviews of the author and gosh he is not a likeable person at all, and I do not find that insulting his fans is a very clever marketing method. Very very full of himself.Anwyway, this book is a waste of time, there are some great works of fantasy out there, such as The Prince of Nothing series by Bakker, the First Law Trilogy by Abercrombie, or A Song of Ice and Fire by Martin... Treat yourself with one of these books and avoid Goodkind's book at all cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I would like it.","review":"I saw the TV show and loved it I then heard that it was based off of a book. So I went out and got the book from the library. It is really an imaginative story but... All the character dialogue is the exact same! So its nearly impossible to tell who's speaking. I HATE putting books down especially fantasy books but I couldn't continue with this one it just became so difficult and annoying to read not knowing who's speaking! So I returned it. If you want to have anything to do with The Sword of Truth I I suggest you watch the TV show titled \\"Legend of the Seeker."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it","review":"I bought the book because I started watching the Legend of the Seeker TV show that is based on it and am enjoying it. The book, on the other hand, is awful. I gave up after it took 300 pages just to get through the boundary. The writing didn't bother me too much, it's just so slow moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a start . . .","review":"Wizard's First Rule is dull. It is overwritten, hackneyed and lengthy. The dialogue rages along like an angry housewife, and it doesn't know when to stop. It goes on and on, and the point is endlessly repeated - \\"Do you love me\\"?, \\"Really\\"? \\"Are you sure\\"?. Moreover, the main character's name is Richard. Of all names, Richard. The battles are few and far between, and they seem to all be the same - a violent mess. The debatable part of the book i.e. the torture scene by the busty dominatrix isn't too overdone. It only adds variety to the climax and a break from the dull dialogue. Chapter after chapter. Despite these glaring faults, it shows that there might be better things to come. Maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come what may you will enjoy this book","review":"I picked up this novel a little while after I got into Scifi/fantansy after I became bored with mysteries. It was recommended by an acquaintance and I still thank her everyday for turning me on to this book.I was shocked when I read the publisher's weekly review because I thought it was a bit unfair. A fantasy is envitably going to follow a formula - Hero saves day , duh! It's fantasy. People would be angry if it didn't. But the story is engaging and if you like to read you will love this book there's no doubt in my mind you will quickly forget it's size. My sister's still mad with be because I hooked her on the series and she doesn't have the time to read it incessantly.It is a tale of great love and strength of character. Goodkind's narrative makes you forget that these are characters - the world seems so real and characters lively. While the whole series is just for diehards, I think everyone ashould give the opening trilogy a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I can't believe the praises other reviewers have posted here. The book is way too long, underedited, in fact. The author wasted a good number of pages explaining things that are obvious to readers. This style may be beneficial to young fans but with themes like pedophilia and sado-masochism, it is clearly a mature book without the mature writing style. Yes, Mr. Goodkind is inventive in his plot twists and characterizations, the overall plot is a cliche. He also crammed the interesting parts near the end. As a result, the ending was rushed since too many important events are happening without much explanation. Probably because he devoted too much time on the little things (a crime the Wheel of Time series is also guilty of). I'd rather read Feist's books. Even if the plots are cliche, they are still good reading..."},{"rating":"1","title":"had possiblilties, but far too graphic and perverse","review":"The book started pretty good, an interesting (but at times illogical) tale of Seeker trying to stop an evil force. Unfortunately, the tale begins to get into graphic scenes of torturing children, and a lot of gratuitous torture of hero by an evil mistress. I gave up on the book at this point. This book is not fit for children, teenagers, or anyone else for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific writing. Downright drivel","review":"I picked this book up while travelling to Australia. I am sad to say, I was very dissapointed by it's writing.

I read fast, so I bought the first three to keep me busy for a few weeks.I may not read the second and third.The story is OK, the characters not the most one dimensional I have ever seen, but why does he keep referring to rape? Every woman seems to have been raped, or nearly raped. I understand that he wants to make you hate the villains, but do they all need to be rapists and child molesters? I find it to be cheap and exploitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I rarely read. So to say the least this book had me wanting more all the time.

It is a mockery of epic fantasy, with tired, overworked cliches and little to no originality. Characters in children's novels are more original and interesting: Curious George comes to mind. Even worse is his writing style. It's sophomoric and unrealistic. I sincerely hope that majority of readers that liked this book were below the age of 30. Any rational, sane adult who knows anything about fantasy and/or writing MUST know that this is not good fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah blah blah","review":"Nice little door stopper/paper weight/S&M novel form the writer who apperently thinks that if a book has enouth words in it it will somehow reach criticall mass and become good"},{"rating":"2","title":"really good","review":"This is a really good story.

I like long books and moderate length series. I'm just here to say this was a disappointing book. I was left with no desire to read another book by this author, ever. Goodkind clearly has some internal issues that would cause him to write such a disturbed novel. Pointless blood and guts, torture, and S&M nonsense, which lead nowhere in terms of a compelling story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say Jordan wannabe?","review":"Totally unimpressive. Absolutely no originality whatsoever and the worst map I have ever seen. Several ideas copied from The Wheel of Time. Same old evil mage wanting to take over the world. Same old wimpy hero with a sword not, sure if he can save the world, and going after the girl he can't have. Bah bah bah boring. Save yourself the money and buy Jordan.

But overall I love this story and am looking forward to the next book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining!","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. The characters were compelling and the setting and narrative were well well developed. The \\"bad guy\\" is truly disturbing, and the book pushes the reader to reconsider black & white notions of evil & good.

I do generally expect more writing skill and better dialogue than Mr. Goodking bothered to provide. The dialogue seemed forced on almost every occasion; the writing seemed to be that of a sophomore in high school. If it weren't for the low standards I hold the genre to, I would have rated this book as a 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Beginning","review":"This book is absoslutely great. I have always enjoyed Jordan's fanatsy novels, but the superflous plotlines and his dragging out the plot gave me headaches. The world and its magic in the Sword of Truth series is similar to that of Jordan's. Although Terry Goodkind does not have the mastery of plot that Jordan possesses, this book is nevertheless great for its own reasons. The characters are amusing, the plot intriguing, and the world is astounding as well. Every part of the story is important and connects well with the rest. Plot twists are also suprising and yet believable. The characters are also likable and real, although they tend to get a little too mushy at times. Overall, I think this book is wonderful and a must-read for any fantasy lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good..","review":"I made the mistake of reading this book after I had completed the first three books in George R R Martins a Song of Ice and Fire series. I was looking for somthing to read while I am waiting for book 4, A Feast for Crows, to come out. Martins supreme writing really shows through. I will suggest this book as a good beginning book to anybody who is new to the fantasy genre. But if you want the best in the business then look toward Martin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knocked My Socks Off","review":"I was very cynical about the world of fantasy writing. My roommate insisted that I read Terry Goodkind's Wizard's First Rule. \\"Just as good as Tolkien,\\" he said. I was skeptical and one day out of sheer boredom I picked up this book. I've been hooked ever since. A very real sense of world building. The characters are rich, vibrant, but not above worldly flaws that make them more believable and real. You find yourself completely engulfed in a very realistic and wonderful world. You feel what the main characters are feeling and when you're done reading you'll want to rush out and buy The Stone of Tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read","review":"Short and sweet: I loved this book. I've read the series once and am now re-reading it almost immediately after finishing book seven. I can't put it down. The characters are three-dimensional, the action is non-stop, the plot is rich, and the story is fresh. I want more, much more. Mr. Goodkind, get off your tukus (sp) and write 7 more books right now! And, by the way, thank you very, VERY much for giving us what you have so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining as long as you dont think too much","review":"This is actually my first fantasy and I found it... entertaining. Although the hero Richarch Cypher was very whinny and the dialogue is not that good (\\"friends\\"?), I was still engrossed till the very end. Goodkind did a good job in maintaining the pace, though as another reviewer said, It did reminded me of an anime :) I also agree with the other review about the book as a male fantasy (sadistic fantasy actually if you count the mordsith torture scenes). I'm giving it 4 stars because I enjoyed reading it. My advise to others: go ahead read it, just don't take it too seriously or you'll go carzy, afterall its just fanasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard's First Rule","review":"This book was my first experience with science fiction fantasy.

I read the first hundred pages, got up with a smile on my face, and walked to the register. I set the book down and the man at the counter began telling me how great this book was. So I gave him the 10 bucks and went home geting ready to read a great book. I picked up where I left off, and didn't stop until I finished the book.This book took me through an earthquake of emotions as I slowly read the book. I couldn't take my eyes off the pages and I inched my way through. This book griped me, I simply couldn't stop reading this book. The next day, I went back to the store and bought the rest of the series. I have grown to love this series and I would give it to a friend to read without a second thought. Read this book, and I bet you'll like it, without a doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome...purely awesome","review":"I have no idea why I bought this book....I had just finished another series and needed something new to read, I just picked this almost randomly off the bookshelf.It is probably the best book I have ever read. I read it in one sitting, because I couldn't stop. Then at 4:30 the next morning when I finished, I anxiously awaited 8am to come so I could go out and purchase the sequel, Stone of Tears. It is enthralling how Mr. Goodkind brings you in and keeps you there, he is especially talented at ending chapters so that you can't stop reading. Definitely go out and buy this book if you haven't read it, although make sure that the next day is a weekend...just in case you are anything like me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"detailed,interesting,beliveable charecters","review":"At 12, I read my first Goodkind book.

I CAN'T WAIT TO START THE NEXT BOOK IN THE SERIES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems boring.","review":"I haven't gone through it and don't know if I will but anyway, here it goes: For me when I read fantasy the characters have to be interesting, very important. I like Jordan's characters but these ones seemed a bit frail. Also the plot wasn't engaging wich it should have been since it lacked this extraordinary creativity which I think a good fantasy writer should have but maybe I'll like it if I read it through?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough story for its size","review":"The good things about this book are Goodkind's crafty use of words, the memorable characters and its readability. However, these strengths are outweighed by the fact that the story moves too slowly as you often find yourself waiting for something of importance to happen. If an author is going to write a book of this length, he or she must be sure to keep the plot moving--Goodkind fails in this respect. Also, Goodkind goes beyond an average level of violence to images and events that are graphic, vile and just plain disgusting. What is worse is that these scenes have little bearing on the plot and just seem to be included for shock value. I don't recommend this book because it just isn't worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was buying this book for my sister as a birthday present and she only wanted it with the original cover art. On the site, the image of the book was of the original cover art so i assumed that is what i would be getting when i purchased it. When i actually received the book in the mail, i was disappointed to find that it was the new cover art and not the original cover art on the book that my sister had requested, so i had to buy her a completely different present. I was really disappointed. The images shown should be of what you are purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"lack in prose, good plot","review":"it is more like a 3.5 stars, but the first law itself is so right and amuzing, that i had to round it up instead of down.becuse this is a very not good book, which is only saved by the concept of trying to trick your enemy instead of stubbing him with a random sharp piece of metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of even the low industry standard...","review":"Although this is not the worst pulp fantasy i have ever been subjected to, it is close. Goodkind's poorly realized, childish world-building is further accentuated by his one-dimensional, inane characters, terrible dialogue and half-baked plot line. Any redeeming qualities within the story were swept away in the flood of trite drivel that this waste of time consists of. Avoid at all costs, and try something imaginitive, like Tad Wiliams or George R.R. Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked this book...","review":"...at first. It is one of the better fantasy stories of the decade, but nowhere near Robert Jordon. That started me thinking about Jordon. About how much thiss book was like Jordon's. About how he copied characters whole from several WoT books. About how mad I was And then I saw Star Wars for the first time. I was probably one of three people in America who hadn't seen all three Star Wars movies, just numbers 2 and 3. It was amazing. He copied everything!!! Old grandfather/wizard? Evil wizard/father? Beautiful princess in trouble? Sword that glows and cuts through anything? It's all there!!! Personnally I think Robert Jordan, George Lucas, and just for good measure Terry Pratchett, should all go to his house and beat him to death with sacks of doorknobs, but maybe that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great - it's trash instead!","review":"I was thoroughly enjoying this book until I realized more and more I was reading scenes of torture, rape, child molestation, and general perverseness. When our hero was captured by the Mord-Sith, and the torture scene went on for pages and pages, and then for more pages, I began to resent what time I had spent reading it. I looked ahead and found a scene when a man is forced to eat a very sensitive part of his own body as punishment. I closed the book, and I won't read anything by Terry Goodkind again"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I read this book when it first came out, and have read it several more times since then. Maybe it's not a English teacher's dream novel, but it's a good story and I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypical Mishmash","review":"If you like sheer page count (ie pretence) in a book, this is for you. If you prefer substance to be included in your purchase of a massive reading experience, pass this book up, escape while you still can. Reading the book was a painful experience; each page, each situation, each new character was jam-packed with worn out cliches or juvenile ideas. The entire time I was reading it I felt I was experiencing bad deja vu. Nothing was sacred; Goodkind stole ideas even from the most blatant and obvious places (George Lucas leaps to mind). If it had been well-crafted, those stereotypes and thefts could have been forgiven--after all, there are no truly new stories, just old stories redone, hopefully well--but as it was, the experience was so painful and traumatic that I had to force myself to finish the book so that I would be qualified to review it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a hack.","review":"Don't waste your time on Terry Goodkind. He doesn't have an original story element in any of his books. I have read his first several books in the hope of finding something interesting. Unfortunately, he apparently can't come up with his own ideas. If you have read much fantasy, you will recognize ideas he has lifted from Tolkien, Jordan and a number of other authors with actual talent. In some cases it is so blatant that I wonder the other authors don't sue for copyright infringement. Don't waste your time or money on these books. Read the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"What can I say? This book is just simply bad. A twelve-year-old could have done the writing, but the violent and sexual themes are disturbingly adult. Who is this book written for? I got the idea Goodkind just pulled ideas out of a hat as he went along, the book has a very slapped together feel. How a piece of crap like this can sell so many copies is beyond me. If you want good fantasy try Fritz Leiber, Tad Williams, Guy Gavriel Kay, Barbara Hambly, even the Wheel of Time series (which is starting to fall apart itself). Throw this garbage in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evidently I did something in a past life to deserve this","review":"I was foolish enough to buy the first 8 books in this series before reading the first one. Then I read it, and I kept expecting there to be some twist, something clever, something interesting. Reading it for the first time feels like you're reading it for the 10th time, because you will know EXACTLY what is going to happen next (with the exception perhaps for gratuitously sadistic stuff...which a normal sane person likely would not be inclined to predict). Terry does for Fantasy writing what the Titanic did for passenger liners. The fact that so many people rate this book at anything other than 1 star make me tear my hair out in despair because the Mayans ended up being wrong. This book's high rating is a harbinger of the end of civilization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The story is at times interesting, but not nearly enough to overcome the atrocious writing and bad dialog. The worst flaw is that the characters are just not believable enough as humans with human feelings, even for a sword and sorcery fantasy. I don't expect to be reading the remainder of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy for the feeble-minded","review":"This is, simply put, the junk-food equivalent of the fantasy world. If you seek semi-intelligent reading, this is not a book for you. The ridiculously derivative plot allows an experienced fantasy reader to guess nearly if not all plot \\"twists\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get sucked in. It will damage your soul.","review":"I'll admit, I was drawn in by the rich fantasy setting and the initially likable characters. And man, I was willing to go through a lot just to stay with that setting. In retrospect, it seems like the only person Goodkind hates worse than his characters is me.If you'll allow me, please direct your attention to the following series SPOILERS:Rich fantasy world, touching relationships, brave champions, torture, rape, a LOT of torture, revenge, separation, RAPE DEMON, scattered torture with a chance of rape, Ayn Rand, reunion, separation, rape, reunion, separation, torture and rape, Ayn Rand.There, I just saved you thousands of pages of trauma. I vaguely remember brief interludes of swords and sorcery heroism thrown in there as well, but, you know... rape demon and all that. Oh, and I'm almost sure that one of the books contained the exact phrase \\"tyranny of altruism\\". My god."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly awful dialog","review":"Truly awful dialog and unbelievable character interaction. I've never met people who interact like this. I've seen amateur movies with dialog this awkward, but I've never read a novel with reviews this enthusiastic that turned out to have such amateurish writing. Seriously, the Captain Underpants books are better written than this thing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story ruined by lots of gratuitous and graphic torture","review":"This book has a great premise and started out as quite an engaging read, but about half way through it became inundated with graphic descriptions of the absolute depravity of the villains. This went on for pages and pages while the story went nowhere. I was unable to finish it.Another observation that is more weird than disturbing: apparently clothing hinders the working of magic in Terry Goodkind's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"This series is one of my all time favorites. The story is engaging and it has truly likable characters. The love story between Richard and Khalan is enchanting and it isn't the perfect fairy tale love story that most authors like to spoon feed us. The people in this series are multi faceted and they come complete with flaws. I highly recommend these books to any fantasy fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"This book was just awful. It reads like a bad video game: first you get the whistle, then WHOA, two chapters later you need the whistle ... Then you get the dragon eggs, then two scenes later you need the dragon eggs! Simply pathetic. It's too bad that drivel like this gets published. Not only are the characters uninteresting and one-dimensional, the plot is predictable and the prose is SIMPLY AWFUL. Which, I think, is a fairly good two-word description of this terrible novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Could Give This Book Minus Five Stars, I Would","review":"I \\"sampled\\" the first few pages of this book and it seemed to be a fairly enjoyable, though derivative, quest fantasy. I bought it without reading the reviews, and that's a mistake I will never make again. This fantasy turned darker and more brutal with each chapter and by the middle was into child torture and pedophilia - at which point I quit and removed this creepy mess from my Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, predictable, lousy characters, blah...","review":"I am a well-read fantasy enthusiast, and I try not to be too critical of my favorite genre, but this story is downright lousy, and even worse it is extraordinarily long. Having read the Rings (which is of course my all-time favorite set), Terry Brooks, David Eddings, C.J. Cherryh, Steven Donaldson, and Robert Jordan, I have a deep love for imaginative fantasy. But what I detest are flat characters that do not truly change from one end of the book to the other. The dudly do-right, mr. naive character that has no inter-esting quirks or faults is boring to say the least. I don't like his exlanations of magic or his realm of the dead. The only thing that caught me was the Mord Sith episode, which did not fit with the rest... Yuk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story!","review":"I loved this story. I purchased the unabridged audio cassettes for my long commute in the car. The only complaint I have is that my car didn't support the tapes (so I heard both sides at once), but I put up with the annoyance to hear the story. That should say something about the quality of Terry Goodkind's story. This book made my commute MUCH more bearable (hardly noticed the drive). :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Awful - Should be 1/2 a Star.","review":"This is easily the worst fantasy book I have ever read. The characters are unoriginal, boring and I feel little connection to them, nor do I feel for them, the same way I do for characters from Jordan or Tolkien's books. I usually fly through books, but this one has me dreading to read it, and wishing I could return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"This book totally dazzled me and got me hooked on the series! There's a good number of characters and builds up mysteries and unfolds in the end. The variety of characters are amazing!

Any other words, speeches or reviews are woefully inadequate to express the triumph of his work. His characters are my friends, his world is a living tapestry and his villians are true inspirations of evil. I'm eagerly awaiting the fifth book and have every intention of purchasing it in hardcover despite the argument it will cause with my wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's deffinatly worth it.NO I REALLY MEAN THAT....READ IT","review":"I am a university student, have read fantasy before, have not read alot of fantasie.Ok. now i read this book about 7 monthes before this time. I was bored in class one day and read the first 50 pages (it was my friends book not mine) or so... wow what a mistake. I can't pay attention to anything in the middle of a good book and this book here was my life until i finished it two days later. People say it starts out slow and it does its own way but there is one point in the book where it REALLY beguins (its after the shadows at the mud people) then its a mad dash for 500 pages. during those pages i laughed and got angry and yes there were tears. the charecters are implanted in my heart (even the ones who died or wern't talked about alot latter on in the series). I refused to read the second book for 2 monthes because of the prophecy at the end. i just cared that much about the charecters that i couldn't risk letting one of them die."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must have","review":"I received my copy used but in excellent condition. I recommend this book to any fantasy lover. I have this book in paperback also so as not to mess up my hard back copy. If you don't own this book, buy it. make your friends read it. make your family read it. They'll be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Terrible Reader","review":"My round trip commute is nearly two hours, so I spend a lot of time listening to audiobooks and music. This books is fantastic, very original, and well-written. However, the reader in the audiobook format is terrible. You read about his Broadway credentials, but he is a terrible reader. I had to change the volume of my stereo pretty much every 30 seconds or so, because his inflection and volume are never consistent. What a wonderful series of novels the Sword of Truth books become, but they picked the wrong voice talent for the first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best epic fantasy series ever!","review":"I think the things I like the most from the Wizard's First Rule, are that (1) the characters don't rely on magic to solve their problem, they rely on their minds, talents and resilience; (2) there are magical concepts that I haven't read in fantasy before; (3) there is a dark side to the story that really gets you deep into the psyche of the characters and you feel very emotionally involved; (4) and there are definite political/societal lessons that are metaphorically addressed very well into the story line.By the way, if you are an audio book fan, you'll love the Audible version of this book, the voice acting is great - similar in quality to the Harry Potter audio books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"missing pages","review":"Good book... at least the 800 pages that i was able to read were good. My copy was missing pages 376 though 392!"},{"rating":"2","title":"11 books later......","review":"Okay.... I have read all 11 books... and I must say.... the first few books are absolutly wonderful... They got me into this genre.... I love them and would recomend them to anyone.... but they start to loose the quality all th eway until the end which I must warn is horrible.... so to all of you who are looking to start reading this series... for warning.... You will fall in love with these characters... Lucky for you the series is over now..... Thank GOD.... and you can breze through them... I on the other hand have had the better part of the last decade waiting for the next book... It is a very dissappointing end... I have yet to decide if it was all worth it.... good luck...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Characters and PLot development.","review":"I found that the book has a great plot. While some of the outcomes of the plot is a bit predictable, the twists and turns Mr. Goodkind takes us on while unfolding his book is very satisfying. I particularly enjoyed the character developement of the main characters which becomes more appreciable when one continues on to the other books of the series. I have read all the SWORD OF TRUTH series save the fourth one which I am in the midst of reading. I hope that Mr. Goodkind shall continue to write this series!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's far better stuff out there","review":"Mildly engrossing at times, but the plot is pure soap opera. Not an uncommon problem in the fantsay genre, but each plot \\"twist\\" is apparent about 150 pages before hand. I struggled to reach the end and will not be finishing the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stayed up until 4--what a fool I was!","review":"The first several hundred pages of this novel areinteresting--the world-building works pretty well, mostcharacters are full, story keeps moving, etc.However, the underlying ideology leaves much to be desired--falls off into horrible sappiness, the magic is not thought-through, the wizard character is hollow and overlyderivative, the violence is largely gruesome and unmotivated,sexist roles for both women and men can wear on your nerves.Showed some promise, but left me so annoyed with myself forfinishing it that I wanted to throw it across the room (Ihoped until the end it would improve)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book for those not scared off by it's size!","review":"All I can say was that this was a GREAT book! Mr. Goodkind has written one of the finest books since TolkienA must for all fantasy fans. In this book, Richard Cypher, a simple woodsman, Is sent on an important quest.After his father's murder, he is determined to find the killer. He then meets Khalan, a women of mysterious origin.She has been sent to find the last great Wizard to help defeat the evil sorcerer Darken Rahl, who holds a power thatcould conquer the entire world. After Richard is made Seeker of Truth by the Wizard, he is the only one who can stopDarken Rahl. This makes for a GREAT adventure, with a twist at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good- but kinda a play-off","review":"This book was an excellent book, and held my attention for a long time. It and it's sequels are wonderful. However, I thought it sort of a play off of Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series. I noticed many similarities and other things in it and the others. I enjoyed it immensely, and hope others did as well. I would definately recommend this book if you are an avid fantasy reader, who reads a lot or quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the read!!","review":"A compelling storyline..Addictive at times to the point of not being able to put the book down because you'll want to continue to read further to see what happens next. Well developed characters. Wish Zedd had more play in the book. Goodkind spent to much time on the Denna(Mord-Sith) and Richard's inter-action. Michael's role should have been a bit more developed. Other than those few minute setbacks, this book was fantastic and very entertaining. I highly reccommend fantasy readers indulge in this book. You definitely wont be disappointed. I give it two thumbs up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one kept me interested from the first sentence!","review":"Eddings, Jordan... move over. There was never a dull moment. We were constantly urged to find out how, or who, or when. There was often something unexpected around the corner as Goodkind placed us IN Richards situation. I don't think I've ever been able to empathize with any fantasy characters as I did with these. I must find out what is next!! Bravo, Goodkind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nope","review":"The first 40 chapters were great, so I bought the whole 9 book set... too bad the writer has a morbid fascination/imagination in chapters 40 plus... I would not recommend this book to anyone.. sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"EPIC FAIL","review":"I have tried some of this author's work before and didn't like it, but your review was so glowing that I decided to try again. Basically, I hate his work. It's not well written, has no clear trajectory, and it's protagonists are boring. I would like my money back. I was forced to give it some sort of \\"star\\" designation, so gave it one star, but it doesn't deserve even that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"It's a shame that I bought the first box set with the 3 first books in the series. This first book is terrible, just terrible. Hard to finish. Very child-like (not for adults). It is not a believable story. And in case you are wondering, I love Game of Thrones, The Wheel of Time, The Name of the Wind series, and The Way of Kings. SO it is not that I do not like fantasy, only that I did not like these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, boring reading","review":"Why do so many readers like this book? I cannot figure it out. The writing is stilted and wooden. I am only through the first chapter and I cannot stand it. The author may have a great story to tell, but there is no enjoyment in the telling. I was a few days too late to get my $2.99 back and I'm peeved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top shelf reading","review":"This is an extraordinary fantasy novel. This is as good as fantasy gets - if you've read and enjoyed Tolkien, Jordan, Donaldson, Brooks - this is a must-read. The narrative pulls you through at break-neck pace, unexpected twist after unexpected twist. Goodkind creates characters that truly involve the reader at the most basic level and sets them on an epic struggle of good versus evil. It's action-packed, romantic, funny, smart, heart-wrenching and, well, just fabulous. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Goodkind is the fantasy master of this century","review":"Terry Goodkind is the greatest fantasy author i've read since Tolkien. He is taking the usual characters of magic(wizard,dragons,etc.) and making it original. He introduces a whole new system of magic that I find incredible. People who say that he isn't original probrably haven't read the book, people who have read the book, think about the new revolutionary way of view magic that Goodkind introduces."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting a lot more","review":"I really enjoy fantasy books, and since I learned to read I usually had one near at hand. For some reason I missed this series over the years. Perhaps it's worse now that I'm some what older, but I don't think this book would have held up when I was 12. The characters are flat, the world has very little texture. The narrative all but disappears as the author tries to cram some sort of moral into his story.I knew this was a famous series, and had high hopes of it being enjoyable when I bought it. I almost bought the second book just to see if it could be as bad as the first, but fortunately I refrained. I've probably read worse fantasy books, but not by much."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must read this, try borrowing it first...","review":"I borrowed this from a friend and had to put it down after struggling through about 300 pages. I believe this book is badly written, but I can see how it could appeal to the young adult male readers who like the Jordan'esk type epic stuff.I must say that I'm very glad I borrowed this rather than buying it. If you really feel that you *must* give this book a go, then borrow it from a friend or library to see if it's your cup of tea.If you want something that's a little more mature and well written, have a look at George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. It also has its share of violence and sex, but it's in context, and the story is wonderfully written."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is firewood, not a good book!","review":"The only reason that I even bother saying anything about this book (or shall I call it a piece of junk?), is because almost every reviewer of this book likes it! I can say countless bad things about this book (the names, the descriptions, the bad atmosphere, the wierd characters and lots of more), but I'll concentrate on the major problem of this book (or is it in fact Goodkind's problem?):There is so much graphic violence, sex, torture and other disgusting things that is in this book! I feel pity for all the young boys (or girls) that have read this book, mainly because of the perverted Demin Nass who favours young boys!!!!!!!!!! What the hell is this Goodkind? Is this the kind of thoughts that are created in your mind?There are countless other perverted parts and other things that I would not like to mention, I believe that you all know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I first read this book 4 years ago and thought it was pretty good despite the rather graphic and grotesque descriptions of sex, rape, murder etc. However, I recently read this book again and I've come to the conclusion that its a pretty disappointing book. Kahlan and Richard are predictable and annoying and they get even more two dimensional as the The Sword of Truth series progresses. The villains are overly sadistic and certain scenes are disgusting and unnecessary(Richard and Denna, Darken Rahl's method of journeying to the underworld, the rape scene). This book could have been good but somehow Terry Goodkind's fascination with the perverse hindered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A blatant Wheel of Time ripoff","review":"Im not a huge Robert Jordan fan. Im actually a huge George R R Martin fan waiting for his next book, and Im looking for something decent to read. I read the first four books in this series (out of boredom mainly) and every idea in these books is ripped straight from the Wheel of Time. In most cases Goodkind didn't even bother trying to hide the fact. I could write a 1000 page book myself discussing all the derivations, but I'll just leave a few examples instead: The Children of the Light in WoT = The Blood of the Fold in SoT. Angreal = agiel. Rand al'Thor = Richard Rahl. Aes Sedai = Confessors + Sisters of the Light. Black Ajah = Sisters of the Dark. Sul'dam = Mord-Sith. Seekers of Truth = Seeker of Truth. Naming the Dark One = Naming the Keeper. The Stone of Tear = the Stone of Tears.You get the idea. If you're thinking of reading this book, read Wheel of Time instead, or better yet, A Song of Ice and Fire by George R R Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blues clues of Fantasy fiction","review":"I once heard that small children have to hear something three times before they absorb it. It seems Goodkind takes this ideology to heart and treats the reader like a four year old addicted to sword and sorcery gore. The plot is tediously predictable, so much so it made the story drag for me. Juvenile logic puzzles and semantics plague the intrigue that the author seemed to be trying to built. I would recommend this book to children who just got done with the Harry Potter series except for two things. First, some of the scenarios tend to lean towards the uselessly graphic, Secondly, really Id be insulting Harry by letting kids devaluate. A teenager might like it but then again they make walk away as insulted as I was. But maybe the series gets better after this book Ill never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"A good stand alone book but to get the full meaning of this book you need to read the entire series. It is a good introduction into a great series. This book is definately not for children, there are many scenes within it that made my eyes widen in surprise. Goodkind is a masterful storyteller who gets his point across without so many flowery long-winded speeches. There are some things within the book that many consider to be cliche but once you read between the lines and follow the series along you will find that the storyline is very original."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This was a great book!!My husband has never liked fantasy/sword and sorcery etc. but after I encouraged him to read this book, he is now hooked on the series. We definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I had been looking for a decent fantasy series to read for a while, and someone told me that Goodkind's Sword of Truth series was a good read. I was very excited to beging reading Wizards First Rule. However, right from the beginning, I was dissapointed. The characters are weakly developed, we jump right into the adventure without much backstory, ect. Goodkind's writting style is weak, at best. He uses many cliche's and is very unoriginal. I rarely give up on books, but this book had so many bad aspects, i had to put it down. I couldn't even imagine trying to read the entire series. I do not recomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Possibly The Worst Book I Have Ever Read","review":"Though that's at least partly because it is oddly compelling in its sheer unremitting awfulness, like a train wreck set to music. From the utter idiocy of the opening scenes to the ghastly torture porn to the villainy of the putative heroes, there is nothing good to say about this book. Don't buy it. If you bought it, don't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The plot was a little interesting but the brutality was unnecessary. It makes me question the authors state of mind and if he should be around young boys or women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I've read fantasy books that make use of several fantasy cliches and still manage to be great. This is the mark of a great author; the ability to take something the reader may have seen several times before and make it interesting and exciting again.Goodkind takes just about every fantasy cliche, throws in his objectivist rants, and calls it a novel. Not a fantasy novel, that would be beneath him.Give me a break, Terry. The only thing original about this series is its complete lack of believable characters and dialogue.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same thing, different book title","review":"I found this book to be very predictable. It seemed to have borrowed almost directly from other fantasy books. Samual was a Smeagol clone etc. I did finish it, which says something for it. There was one twist I didn't see coming. The reader of this book on tape sometimes seemed to have come from the Captain Kirk school of acting. All in all, not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent epic","review":"This story is a long epic that tells the heroes journey. I found it intriguing, but at times it drug on. In previous reviews there were some complaints with grammar but I would have to disagree. It was well written. I just did not like how detailed some of the inhumane actions of the bad guys were and how the story drug on at times. I would recommend it to any lover of a good fantasy epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about the story!","review":"Wizards First Rule is an extremely easy read with an extremely in depth story line. If your looking to be thoroughly entertained without the headache of trying to keep up with tons of characters and plot points this is a great series to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much More Violent Details Than TV series","review":"I really liked the television series but the book was much more violent. Sure the bad guys are bad but there are detailed descriptions of horrible torture etc that didn't appear in the book. As far as the writing, it is well written and so detailed that you can picture everything. I mean everything!

Mr. Goodkind has writen an excelent book and i look forward to reading up on the fate of Richard and Khallen . just as a messure so all you other bookworms can know because of how intrigued by this book i was i read it in 5 days and failed 2 final exam's for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was mediocre at best","review":"I will not waste my time by delving into the inadequecies of this book compared to other current fantasy authors (ie. Fiest, Hawke, Weis). But, I simply must let it be known to the world of literature that, in my opinion, this book is mediocre at best. Stereotypical characters, constantly under or over developed details, little backstory, and pathetically written emotions were all common in this novel. About the only thing I believe Goodkind was sucessful with in this novel was the sense of fear instilled by the forces of evil into the reader's mind, but, this alone did not save the book from falling below par in the field of today's fantasy writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"breath-taking adventure","review":"If you enjoy reading about wizards, dragons, and good magic vs. dark magic, this book is for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"Terry Brooks is an amazing new author with a lot of talent. I picked up this book and could not put it down until I was finished. An engaging tale with action, suspense and yes even a little romance this book has anything you could want. I highly recommend anyone who loves fantasy read this book, and while your at it you may just want to pick up the whole series because if it is possible to improve on perfection the rest of the books in this series try to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite after all these years","review":"Wizard's First Rule was one of the first fantasy novels I ever read back in the mid 90's and is still the benchmark I use for comparisons.I was quickly drawn into the story with it's fast paced, page-turner of an epic adventure.There are similarities with the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, which some say is better written. But in my opinion, Terry Goodkind is a far better storyteller which is more important to me.I highly recommend Wizard's First Rule to any fan of the fantasy genre.. (and even to those who aren't) :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing and characters, but worth a look.","review":"Despite being praised as phenomenal on the cover by Piers Anthony, the writing is technically some of the worst I've ever seen published in fiction, certainly worse than Anthony's. The story is written more like a report of the actions of characters who have little or no deapth rather than a tale of the adventures of people with aspirations, desires, and challenges to face. A strange aspect of the book I've never encountered before is that the characters behave in illogical, two-dimensional, affected ways that reduce the story's reality and deapth. The majic and monsters are relatively creative. It's worth a look because there is an undefinable quality to the story-telling that induced me to read on despite the constantly annoying flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deffinately rates up with Tolkien.","review":"This has to have been the most spellbinding book I have read in a long time. The characters are unforgetable and the setting is marvelous. This brought back memories of some of my favorite stories because it seems to take on an aspect of every style out there. Terry Goodkind is now ranked as one of my 3 favorite authors with J. R. R. and Stephen Brust being the other two. I would highly recomend this book to anyone at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an audio cd","review":"When I purchased it, the description specifically said audio cd...

So much for listening to it on my vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, no way around it!","review":"Okay, okay, I understand where some of the previous editorials are comming from, BUT to say the book is stupid, bad, or a rip off from other books is just plain wrong! I will not bore you with a long winded explanation of the book, if you are reading this, you have ether already read the book, or are thinking about buying it ( dont want to spoil it for you). Anyway, the book is a very good read, the storie is entertaining, and I thougth very origonal (at least there were no dwarfs, elves, or trolls). I would recomend this book to anyone that is a lover of fantasy novels. I enjoyed the second book in the series just as well, and am eagerly looking forward to the third."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow start.... better ending","review":"I have been reading the Robert Jordan books lately and happen to pick this book up in the down time. Compared to the wheel of time series I found this to be rather elementary. It was a good read I enjoyed it, but it didn't have the complexities that the wheel of time does. I found the begining of this book to be ho hum... but as I got about halfway throught the book it started to liven up. I thought it was a good read and I will probably read the books that follow. I guess I am just used to the complexness of the wheel. Had I read this book before the wheel of time series... I might have thought differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Why do all the books reviewed here get four to five stars? I really don't understand it. Certainly, I don't think it's deserved here. I suffered through this book because my husband said that the second book was much better. I will probably never get to it. I think Mr. Goodkind has a few interesting ideas, but I found his characters to be too annoying to live. Ah, the self-sacrificing Kahlan. What a saint. And Richard, our pure-as-the-driven-snow hero. Ugh. I just didn't care at all about them (except to wish them a violent end...hopefully within two chapters). Secondly, the dialogue was the most boring, stilted dreck. To make it even worse, I had just finished reading George R.R. Martin's, Guy Gavriel Kay's, and Vernor Vinge's latest. Now there's characterization and dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype about?","review":"Someone gave this book to me like he was handing over the Holy Bible of fantasy novels. I had only good impressions from everything I've heard about this book and the author. Therefore, I was rather perplexed when the story was so awful, and the characters so straight out of the fantasy \\"cookie cutter\\" of heros that I read more, thinking that there must be something wrong with me. But I'm afraid it's true, this book is horribly mediocre. The characters are flat, the plot is non-existant and I couldn't even finish the book. Now I am an avid reader of fantasy and I can only wonder at 300 reviews praising a book as completely uninspiring as this one. Read it for yourself, but I really don't have a clue why so many people find this author, and particulary this book, so engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bletch.","review":"Does the word \\"Ishtar\\" ring any bells?

Bad characterization, bad plotting, bad writing technique, bad grammar -- and derivative/ plagaristic, too!

Or migrant farm labor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible!","review":"First off, the writing was so bad I could barely stumble through the prose. The plot was predictable, but worse than that, it was incredibly derivative. I couldn't find a single element in it that had not been used somewhere else, by a better writer, in a better fantasy series than this one. The violence was over-the-top, unnecessary, and gratuitous. The characters were both predictable and one-dimensional. I cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this book. Don't read it. PLEASE. For your own sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needed some balls","review":"This had to be the wimpiest book I've everread.

I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind","review":"I did give it a try: I read it cover to cover.

Why would anyone waste their time readingdrivel like this???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Grand Fantasy Epic","review":"This book is a great beginning to another massive fantasy epic. Though considerably more sexualized than many of the genre, it is nonetheless quite well-crafted. Unlike many of its cohorts, this book doesn't leave you wondering what has happened to major characters that seem to drift out of the author's attention. Most importantly, it leaves you wanting to read the next book, but has enough of a conclusion that you can stop reading after just one book, rather than go through the whole series if you are so inclined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel","review":"Wizard's First Rule is book one in an on going series. it was written over two years ago and i am still anxiously awaiting the next installment. I must say this is the only series i have ever done that for. While the format might have been done before, guy on quest, w/a wizard, a magic sword, powers he never knew he had, and a quick romantic interest, the characters and actual plot bring this story to life. It is never quite what you expect; you want everything to be okay but it's not set in stone that it will be. This book was wonderfully written and the cover was excellently drawn, and from the get go it gets your attention, and demands that you read it. You will find yourself unwilling, or unable, to put it down after you read for a few minutes. This is another book i suggest reading when you have the sequel's handy and you have three or four free days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Even though the book is 800+ pages, I enjoyed it all. His writing is very descriptive and it creates the whole world for you making you feel like you are right there with the characters. Everyone can find a character that they can relate to and look up to. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good read. I've read the whole series and I am re-reading them while I wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To read it, is to see the movie.","review":"From page one I was completly entwined with the character of Richard. The more I read, the more I identified with the inner strugles he faced, with the choices he had to make, and how he dealt with the consequences of those actions. The desciptive detail of the events and personalities of the characters of not only this book but the complete series is so intense, if you have one iota of an imagination you'll swear your watching a movie instead of reading a book. The words actually paint pictures for you to see"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"Someone mentioned this work in the same breath as Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time Series? For shame! This is a pithy novel, without a breath of originality in what is otherwise a stagnant and boring book. If one enjoys simplistic wording, and sporadically developed characters, be my guest. I found that rather than introducing personality traits and useful skills graduallly, they are sprung upon the unsuspecting reader. It is as if the author did not tkae the time to plan the book ahead of time and had to rush to include crucial detail. While it was not the worst book that I have read, it was no better than a below average and uninteresting read. Your time would be better spent elsewhere"},{"rating":"2","title":"A detailed fantasy.","review":"This was the first fantasy book I've ever read. However, I have read a variety of other books and can tell you that WFR is not as good or as bad as some of the other reviews make it out to be. The book was very gripping (although at times to detailed i.e. Khalan in the Con Dar, Darken Rahl underworld ritual, and the Mord-Sith). I did, however, like the simple prose form of writting Tery Goodkind used writting this book and I am going to buy any future installments of the Sword of Truth Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIND BLOWING!!","review":"I picked 'Wizards first rule' up from the local library, and I was hooked.

I must know face the agony of waiting for his new book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still the best after reading it 8 times","review":"This is like the third review I've done of the book but I've read it 8 times. I'm glad to see more reviews like mine. Those people who rated it below a 8 must have had something else on their mind so they should read it again and again until they get to an 8. This book was a wonderful story. I was suprised to see that everybody else couldn't put it down. I couldn't either, it only took me two days. I don't know about any of you but thats the best I've ever done for a book that size. If you haven't read it, do so. And please don't listen to me or anybody else, just read the book and make your own opinion. :O) And I'd just like to say to beekman(the artist who did the cover) I think it came out great, it is a little darker than the original but it still has the desired effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wizards First Rule = Fantasy flop!!!","review":"Wizards First Rule (Book 1 of Terry Goodkinds 'Sword of Truth' series) is a classic example of yet another redundant fantasy \\"epic\\". One-dimensional and uninspired characters populate an unimaginative and cliched fantasy setting, and on top of it all Goodkind writes with the stylistic flair of a 3rd grader. Seriously, the writing is ridiciously poor. I am a HUGE fantasy and sci-fi fan, and after hearing rave reviews I picked this novel up. Somehow I managed to slog my way through the entire book, which incidentally is about 500 pages too long, and as far as I can tell it has very little positive elements at all. Prepubescent teens looking for gratuitous violence, and cliched characters will be extremely pleased with this book. Other readers looking for something more imaginative, entertaining, and intellectual than this piece of literary [junk], would do well to check out George R.R Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\", or anything by Guy Gavriel Kay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Series","review":"Do not buy the kindle version of this book expecting the rest of the series to be available anytime soon. I have noticed in many of my purchases of series titles from amazon they are incomplete. They get you started and then you either have to buy the paperback editions at a higher price or you are just left out in the cold.As much as I like using the Kindle I am starting to feel scammed with the hit and miss approach to series offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"buffy, my dog, can write better","review":"when you write a conventional fantasy plot which bases itself upon the worn out concept of \\"THE ONE\\" who is destined to save the world from the dark and evil forces , you better have something else going on for you other than originality.for example: a sweeping love story for the more romantic reader, epic fights for the blood thirsty, humor, belivable and LOVABLE characters and so on .i fear this book has none of it. it's boring and it follows every convention the fantasy genre has to offer.Starting with the mystery woman appearing out of nowhere in desperate need of help, continuing with our hero who rescues her. what a surprise, we'll later find out he is destined to do just that.On their dark and perilous way to save the world from ( again, what a shocker ) an evil magician, they will encounter many idiotic characters, and overcome unmeasurably borring difficulties.To make a long story short, a really Bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't. Just don't","review":"I choked my way through the first ten books of this series years ago. Guess what? All the rest of these books are the same. I skimmed the ending of the 12th one day at a bookstore and confirmed what I'd already assumed: this series sucks and gets worse as the bricks were churned out. This is sci-fi written by an Ayn Rand disciple, with all the wooden chacters, stilted dialogue and sexual violence of the Objectivist high priestess Herself. If Ms. Rand is your Bible, then here is your sci-fi. If not, there is a lot of better efforts out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writers First Rule","review":"With approximately 80 pages left in the book I was able to predict the exact ending. I owe this ability to having watched extremely lamely written television. Thankfully, this was easily translated over to the analysis of Goodkind's writing. It is difficult to believe that this author was able to write 800 pages from the rather simple kill the evil wizard plot, any even more difficult to comprehend once you finish the book. Another suggestion, you should probably write some clever dialouge to convince us that your character is witty and intelligent instead of telling us this every three pages. If you feel you must read this book enjoy the story! (and the other 650 pages of filler)"},{"rating":"1","title":"These books are close to horrendous","review":"I read the first three books of this series about 2 years ago and seriously regret the wasted time. The writing is low quality for the most part but totally breaks down in some sections making you cringe as you read it. The plot is predictable ie. hero always miracously escapes all danger, you know from the first chapter how everything is going to end. Really, these books have some major flaws. Please do yourself a favor and read these instead: George R.R. Martin's a Song of Fire and Ice series, Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series, or Stephen King's the Dark Tower series (which is unbelievably incredible). Or take a break from fantasy and check out some Charles Bukowski, Hunter S. Thompson, or Brett Easton Ellis. I really hate to give something only one star but in this case it was well deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confessor","review":"I confess that I found that Wizard's First Rule was not only a boring read, but it also droned on a bit.The love story was predictable, and use of magic seemed to be conveniently placed. Even brief flashes of S&M; did not brighten the monotonous read.I don't think I'll continue reading the other 8 books, and instead will focus on books that are a bit more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why fantasy books have a poor reputation.","review":"This is a low class voyage to a silly and pedantic world. Believe the comments by other reviewers who have called this work misogynistic, poorly written, poorly conceived, and needlessly perverse. Im tempted to write more, but feel that it has already eaten too much of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Read, but...","review":"This book reads well enough. I must echo the sentiments of those who have said that this is an \\"action only\\" book. If you like Ian Flemming and the like, you're liable to enjoy this as a foray into fantasy literature. If you find Robert Jordan's painfully slow plot and delightfully descriptive narratives, then you'll probably want to give this book (and series) a miss.The biggest problem I have with this book (and the two subsequent books, which I did indeed read) is the deviant sexual aspect. I'm not a fan of erotic fantasy, and it seems as if Goodkind is trying to gross you out (especially in the sequals). There are tasteful ways of depicting deviant sexuality, we need not the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Epic Disappointment","review":"This book was riddled with grammatical errors as well as extremely obvious plot twist. Even worse was the dialogue. At times it was difficult to discern which character was speaking; much of the dialogue contained cliches. The characters, throughout most of the novel, remian two-dimensional then suddenly change or make unconvincing decisions. At times, Goodkind's characters seem \\"inhuman,\\" which makes the novel difficult to read. I had to force myself to finish the 800 plus page novel. I was not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perversity of the story, destroys any entertaining value","review":"My husband and I were on a trip and we listened with anticipation to the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the story until the part where Richard's torture comes in. What kind of entertainment comes from listening to the degradation and torture of a man by such women? Although pure fantasy, what is the author's message?...what are you left with after listening to this kind of brutality? Training?...no author....just plain garbage....my vote is for the fire....sorry fellow readers...I absolutely love the story.....but not the perversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever ATTEMPTED to read","review":"I have read many fantasy in my life, but never this bad. It was recommended to me by a friend of mine who said he loved it. I do not feel the same. I only read 1/4 of this book because it lacked so much that i can get in other authors. My only regret about not finishing the series is i bought the first 4 at once. A total waste of my time and money"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books I Have Ever Encountered","review":"This book was a worthless copy of other writer's fantasy. I put it down about mid-way through when Goodkind began plagiarizing J.R.R. Tolkien. Overall, the writing and plot is worthy of any elementary school child. I am sorry that I even felt the need to devote any more of my time to this worthless piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Of Done Better","review":"This book had one of the best settings and characters I have ever read about. But this guy completly blew it. Giving everyone powers and sometimes they had them and sometimes they did not. All of that mumbo jumbo about prophecies. Names like Darken Rahl gimme a break. Then you find out Richard is Darken Rahl's son, sounds like Star Wars with Luke and Vader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This is a very, very trite and boring book. Goodkindobviously thinks he knows something about life, and whenhe tries to teach his readers, he ends up sounding preachy and dull. \\"People are stupid\\"...well, duh! I learned that in 1st grade!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sword of Truth","review":"First became a fan of Mr Goodkind when I stumbled upon his \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" series. While liking the series I must say that the written word is completly awesome!! Many of the darker themes expressed in 'Wizard's First Rule' could never faithfully come across in the PG rated television. His characters come across as wholly believable and literally leap off the page with their 3-dimensional renderings.You can rest assured that every other title in this breathtaking series will be on my must-have-list!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"People Are Stupid!","review":"Terry Goodkind is a gifted author who has a unique and fascinating way of making his characters come to life. I've read this book 5 times now (out loud and to myself) and every time I do, I fall in love with the people, the place, the imagery... over and over again. The beginning of a breathtaking, life-changing series, Wizard's First Rule has a special place on my bookshelf. Even if sci-fi/fantasy isn't your favorite, I believe you will still enjoy this novel because it is most simply just a great story. Highly, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard's RULE!","review":"The first book in Terry Goodkind's amazing Sword of Truth series is the best! A simple woods guide finds himself caught up in an adventure he can't get out of. This is a powerful, moving book that sets up a world of magic and adventure! I recommend this book to anyone who loves magic, plot twists, and romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, wonderful book","review":"The reason people read novels such as Wizard's First Rule is to be entertained. When I read books like this I am always happy to be sucked into a fantasy world, and am proud to see a very talented author who can pull off this immersive experience. For the reader from Austin who says that he/she is too good for this book; GO READ SOMETHING YOU LIKE. I am a college graduate from Yale, yet I don't consider myself 'too good' for this book. I also recommend (for those who aren't easily offended by good writing) the Dragonlance Chronicles and other Dragonlance books. Amazing, better than all other in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing","review":"I read this after being recommended by a friend. What a mistake. The writing was stilted, filled with cliches and irritating. Characters show up, then disappear or die, like the man turned into a wolf. What did he add to the story? The names alone are bad enough, Darken Ruhl as the villain, D. Cipher as the main character. The fact that so many people like this badly written, overly long, anticlimatic book is very disappointing. I understand that the ideas in the book might seem a bit original, but the way the story is told, coupled with the terrible writing, made this book very difficult to enjoy in the least. I finished it out of a sheer need to get to the end. This is one of the worst books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally forgettable except for the gratuitous torture","review":"I picked this book up on the recomendation of a book seller and I was desperate for something new to read.The first time I tried to read it, I didn't get through the first chapter. I should have taken it back and demanded my money back. But I tried it again years later. I can read 2 or 3 books a day, but it took me 2 weeks to slog through this drivel.It's so forgettable that I remember now is that it had a hero... no worthwhile female characters and someone that liked to torture along with sex so that they would become intertwined. Gee thats really uplifting. I have seldom read a book I have despised more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beating a Dead Horse","review":"More tired fantasy for a literate audience of readers desperate for decent prose.The same old elements: youth with magical powers discovered during adolescence (calling Dr. Freud...) , a plucky girl who puts him in his place but needs saving CONSTANTLY, and a Gandalf wannabee.Deliver me from this tired old recipe. Puhleeese.The thing that makes this book catchy is that it combines a 6th grade writing style with sado-erotic scenes inappropriate for anyone with a brain. Just right for all those 8th graders lapping this up. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooden and not very imaginative","review":"The dialogue is weak and wooden. The characters are one dimensional. The plot seems hackneyed. In short, it is just not a very interesting piece of fantasy fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good....","review":"This could have been a good book, although comparisons to Tolkien made by some reviewers are just silly. This author isn't anywhere near that league. It started out fun but then the author started to include graphic, lengthy sequences of child abuse and mutilation. I guess this was to show how bad the bad guy was, but just came across as sick, and shows either the limits of the authors skill or his predilictions. So, unless your really comfortable with that sort of thing, I'd look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok, could have been great.........","review":"The world is detailed and has lots of original ideas. I liked the little twists, it makes the reading even better.This novel had awkward pacing though. Like, sometimes it can be a page turner, then the next moment, your reading about 80 pages about some dang tribals, no action, no plot development, just 80 pages on tribals, yee hah. One of the more boring scenes is a series of torture sequences that lasted for like 100 pages. I mean, it was really offensive at first, then it just got tedious. Can we just get on with the novel and kill the freakin mistriss.The characters are flat also, but i dont need to go in detail about that ... .But when the plot did move along or the action did start going, it was like readin a fantasy classic, untill, of course, we take a 50 page break campin in the woods lecturin about prophecies. ZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A senseless childish unenjoyable book","review":"I hope I like the other Goodkind books I've purchased. This one is a poor children's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Fantasy Novels written","review":"This was the first fantasy novel I read that was more than 200 pages long. I read it when I was 16 years old (now I'm 21) and have read it 4 times since then and countless other fantasy and non-fantasy books. The author, Terry Goodkind, entraps you in the story so well that sometimes you might not even notice or remember that you are even reading a fantasy novel. The character development is so great in this series that by the time you get to the 2nd and 3rd books in the series you can feel what the characters are feeling. And almost anticipate what they will do next, except for an old wizard who will never cease to shock, amaze, and confuse you. This story has swords, dragons, the lost art of magic, love, hate, vast lands, monsters, and most importantly a brilliant author behind it all whose writing abilities put you right next to the characters in the story. I highly recommend this book, and the whole series, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best series of books I have ever read","review":"The way he makes the world and the people come to life it is just like watching a movie. I like how he vividly explains every thing in the whole book it gives a better picture. When I read it, it seemed like it would never end, he put a lot into it and it makes it seem like you are seeing Richards life go by one hour at a time! It is full of everything you could want in any book... It took a while to read this one but I read stone of tears a 9** page book in 5 days. They keep getting better and better.if you like these you should read Terry Brooks shannarah series"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck happened?","review":"Starts out slow, picks up speed nicely...and then slams abruptly into Warp 10. Unfortunately,in a wholly different direction. I've read other reviews commenting on Mr Goodkind's digression into sado-masochism, and I have to say I believe the term \\"digression\\" to be an understatement. The author throws together chance meetings, a backtrack in the plot, ignores other plot elements entirely, and very implausibly brings the story to a climax...just so he can turn it around and put the hero in peril. The almost excruciating detail of the tortures that follow left me wondering. And then, when these scenes are over, Goodkind almost seems to get bored with the story, bringing it to conclusion.The characters are great, the basic story is ok, but the \\"flow\\" of the novel is absolutely atrocious. I will not be reading the rest of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is only the beginning","review":"i cant say enough about this book. i have read it multiple times and it never gets old. ilove the whole series but this book is surely my favorite. the characters and the storyline are fantastically drawn. not only do you grow to know them but you falll in love with their spirit. not to mention the characters hilarious tendecies and quirky humor. as i whole i rate this a five star read for having every great component a wonderful book should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Goodkind really starts this series off in a great way. I have read the whole series and recently decided to re-read and Wizard's First Rule is my favorite of them all. Even if you never read the whole series this is good as a stand alone book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily, inaapropriately graphic","review":"After the first 200 pages or so, I was thoroughly enjoying this book. The characters were excellent, the plot exciting, and the adventure underway.With Richards' first use of the sword of truth, the graphic description was a little more than I prefer, but not enough to keep me from continuing.The description of the \\"ceremony\\" with Darken Rahl and a young boy, however, was WAY too much. With pedophilic references, followed by the torture, execution and canabalization of the boy, the author went too far me. I understand the authors intent to make the villain as evil as possible, but come on.....Anyway the book wsa instantly cast from my Kindle, never to return.Despite downloading and reading the free sample (first 3 or 4 chapters) there was nothing to indicate this type of graphic and disturbing content would follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, predictable, on of the worst I've ever read","review":"I'll be brief as other people have said the same things. The book was very predictable. Not simply like much fantasy is, but worse. I had figured out far too much too soon. e.g. it was obvious that michael had been involved in George Cypher's murder, and that he was alligned with D'Hara. Diologue between characters lacked the fine tuning that I expect from an author. Much of the dialogue was juvenille. On the positive side, the next book does appear to be tighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid and childish","review":"This book got a lot of hype but I still cant figure out why.

Don't waste your time trying to get into this series, find something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"God is this awful","review":"This series of books is even worse than Wheel of Time. Jordan is only writing for the money, which all the Lemmings (= Readers) are giving him with a big \\"Thank you\\". Goodkind is even copying Jordan. And he's copying it very bad. Story? None. Characters? Take a Superman-Comic and you get a much better Characterization. Ideas? Yeah, right... Don't bother with this piece of garbage.

Actually stopped reading this about 60% thru. Couldn't take it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a very nice story","review":"This book still keeps up after all these years. The story is pretty starigt forward and rather predictible and the main charaters is somewhat single sided, but all in all well written. If you havent read it yet you should. Its a \\"must read\\" in fantasy literature. Enjoy. After the third book the story drops in quality, but its still entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book!","review":"Wizards First Rule was a horrible mess of a book. There was absolutely no charactur development, and I could really care less what hapened to them. Dont start this series because they are all aweful. Read books by J.R.R Tolkien, George R.R.Martin because those are much better written then The Sword of Truth series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible writing","review":"It has an interesting and inventive story but is executed poorly. The writing is so bad it makes me want to throw it into a fire. The only thing that keeps me going is the story. It is a shame that the editors didn't have enough guts to get the author to rewrite or bring someone else in to co-author. Case in point: When Richard is going to Zedd's house we are told that the \\"old mans house was to far to reach before dark and the trail too treacherous to travel at night.\\" But when they leave the house 100 pages later, \\"It was an easy trail, almost a road.\\" If this is not the same trail, then why not take it in the first place? This is a slight example of a regular occurrence. Don't start this book unless you want to know first hand what bad writing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Going","review":"\\"Wizards First Rule\\" came highly recommended by a dear friend. How do you tell a dear friend that his favorite book is tedious? There was so little development of the characters that I didn't feel I knew them any better at the end of the book. I don't think I'll try any of the other books in the series. Maybe they get better, but I'm not willing to waste any more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst dialogue EVER.","review":"It really was painful to read.The plot was fine, despite being incredibly typical. The dialogue, however, was childish to the point of being absurd. Read any of the exchanges between the two main characters out loud and you'll see what I mean. Many passages where characters conversed in this book were so unrealistic they were unintentionally funny...NOT recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book underwhelmed me","review":"I found reading this book. very tiresome. It was like their was 300 pages of story stretched out over 800 pages. The Characters were unconvincing and one dimensional. I predicted most of the plot twists, and i'm the kinda guy who never sees anything coming. The main antagonist was uninteresting and not really developed fully. Overall this book was a giant waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please!","review":"If this is the standard of medocrity to which fantasy authors aspire these days, then God help us all. I think the previous review says it all about the type of audience to which this book caters. In the mood for stellar fantasy writing? Read George R.R. Martin. Read Katharine Kerr. Read the Feist/Wurts Empire Trilogy. Read anything but this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable to read but....","review":"The book was a good read but it spends to much time on things that are not critical to the storyline. He spends to much time focusing on things that are not critical and then leaves you feeling cheated with a quick ending. It is an easy read for an 800 page book but could have been done in half that without losing much. The grafficly horrible characters like Demin Nass do not need such detail. I did overall enjoy the book but felt like it plagerized many other books previously written. I always new what was comming next like I had read it before and that is because I have in other books. Over all an ejoyable read but not for children or the weak hearted. Richard is a great champion and a well developed character as is Kalahn and Zedd is an ejoyable comic relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You're Intelligent, You'll Like This Book","review":"It seems to me that there are two types of people reviewing this book, intelligent people and intellectuals.Wizard's First Rule, while not a clssic, is very engaging and has a lot of very interesting things to say about some very contemporary issues. Goodkind is most often successfull in his effort to take us somewhere and make us think. I've read classic fiction and classic fantasy and would reccomend this book highly to anyone who likes to either.However, if you don't like to think and just like to look down on others and if you get off mainly by feeling yourself to be more intellectual than the next guy, this book is not for you.In a nutshell, if you're intelligent and imaginative, give this book a try. If you're an intellectual, just go back to your Kierkegaard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to stop reading it.","review":"The style of writing Goodkind employs allowed me to make quick progress through what I consider to be an interesting plot. However, I ended up throwing the book away because it is simply too gruesome, brutal and cruel. This book is very explicit, and what it doesn't spell out for you, your mind will, leaving you to shudder later as the images resurface. It's a shame, had it not embraced and dwelled on such terrible images I would have really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"puh-leeze","review":"Instead of repeating what everyone else is saying about how tedious and unoriginal this is, let me just add one thing. There's a hideous creature, servant to a witch/sorceress, whatever, that attacks Richard in an attempt to steal the (dah-Dummmmb!) Sword of Truth. Turns out the creature used to be a man who owned the Sword but the power of the Sword crippled him and now all he wants is to regain possession of it. (His precious?) When bested by Richard the creature/man becomes a sniveling coward but will just as likely slit Richard's throat at the earliest opportunity to get the Sword. Give me a big, fat, bloody break!!

Excellent fantasy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantasy Masterpiece","review":"\\"Wizard's First Rule\\", which was hailed as an epic by a lot of people when it first came out, is just that: A towering achievement in the Fantasy genre, a great story with epic bloodlines. The prose at times is curt. Goodkind doesn't spend any time dancing around descriptions, nor does he spend pages and pages talking about how a character is getting out of bed, or how a character feels..or..or...He didn't waste any time cutting into the meat of his story, which is at times graphic, bluntly violent, and cruel. And I loved every minute of it. The situations in WFR were real. The way the people treated each other was real. This isn't watered down, high-prose, \\"classic\\" fantasy, ala Robert Jordan. This story was dirty, and Goodkind was not afraid to put some startling descriptions and scenes in this book. I love \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" as a great book, and recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable bad !","review":"This is without a doubt the worst fantasy book I have ever read. Giving this book even one star is a joke - amazon.com should allow us to give ZERO stars to a book ! There is nothing even remotely original about this book and most of all it is absoultely boring. Goodkind never managed to make me care about any character. So go and read Williams, Jordan, Feist, Martin, Pratchett ... anyone (even Brooks is better than this), but do not waste any money on this trash !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Jordan's Evil Twin!!","review":"Imagine if your Gym Teacher decided to write a fantasty novel...this is the outcome. Terry Goodkind obviously read the Wheel of Time series and decided, \\"Hey if he can write a book so can I! Jordan just has a beard, I have a beard and a pony tail!!\\" Goodkind obviously takes ideas from Jordan and puts his own horrible spin on it. My guess is that he was dropped on his head as a child several times, there is no other explanation for writing of such poor quality. I would suggest that those of you who like these novels go and ask your parents if maybe you slipped from their grasp as a child...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry's First Rule - Readers are stupid.","review":"This book will appeal to readers who enjoy tediously-detailed expositions of sophomoric philosophy, weak and one-dimensional protagonists, and a novel written in the \\"tell - excessively - don't show\\" style. The action and outdoor scenes are unrealistic - I get the feeling that TG hasn't spent a night in the woods, is a virgin, and certainly hasn't been in any sort of scrum. It baffles me that this series has achieved such popularity, but also gives me hope - after all, if this drivel can sell, then all I need to do to make a fortune as a fantasy writer is catch a few monkeys and chain them to a keyboard for a month.Heck, this book is worse than \\"Against the Giants\\" by Ru Emerson, and that's saying something.I won't be reading the rest of the series, thank you very much...and I very much enjoyed both Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged...those books were well-written (don't agree with all of the philosophy, but they work as novels)."},{"rating":"1","title":"why???just...why???","review":"This is a horrible, god-awful book. I have no idea how it gets all these good reviews. I was only able to force myself through the first 1/3 of the book before tossing it aside in disgust. It was just bad. Everything about it was bad.

The blatant Commie-bashing was really shocking. If you don't believe me, glance through the early chapters of the book - there is a speech about how some people like to drag down those who are more successful than them, and how this sort of thing has to be stopped!Could someone please tell Mr. Goodkind that the Cold War is over?

This book is the epitome of Fantasy 'been done before, should work again.' It is your typical hero, evil villian, 'oh, gee, if I don't save the world we'll all die'. <yawn> Besides that fact that the story line is tired, has anyone here read The Sword of Shannara by Terry Brooks?

Gee....a wonder?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential but Poor","review":"While this novel has all the right elements for a great fantasy story, it fails to follow through. The characters are weak, dialogue is terrible, and the \\"deux ex machina\\" rules and ruins the novel. While readable, it is neither enthralling nor a masterpiece. The author either tried to do too much or simply didn't do enough, however certain ideas and situations were interesting; resulting in a book with incredible potential but which fails completely to build a sustaining, intigruing, and original fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"You either gonna love him or hate him.","review":"Well, for me its the former rather than the latter. Ive read almost every fantasy series I can get my hands on, including The Wheel of Time, the Mallorean, the Belgariad, the Elenium, the Tamuli, Most of Terry Brooks stuff, and of course, most of Tolkiens books as well. I have to say, Goodkind is my favorite fantasy artist. There are many paralells with Jordans work especially, but Goodkind does something that Jordan does not: Actually makes his characters DO something. They dont just sit in the same place for three books, the action is very fast-paced. I cared about the characters, and always wanted to see what happened next. I guess Ill put it this way. The Temple of the Winds (the fourth book in the series) is the only book Ive bought in Hardcover in the last two years. If a slightly higher level of violence and sex dont offend you, read this book. I think you'll enjoy yorself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing fantasy!","review":"Wizard's First Rule is the first in an ongoing series by Goodkind. This is a truly wonderful book on many different levels. Our hero Richard is a well developed character with a mysterious lineage. His grandfather Zed is also an enigma but an enjoyable character with his magical antics. Being a woodsman, Richard stumbles across a beautiful woman who is being attacked by 4 large men. That is where the story begins and takes the reader through some interesting adventures with Richard, Kahlan and Zed. It's definitely worth reading if your a fantasy fan.

Tolkien's works are pretty good (incredible for the time); Jordan's series is near perfect but a little verbose; Eddings's works are decent; Brooks is worthy of the title author. However, no single novel is as good.If I were to have my way, this masterpiece would be part of the freshman curriculum along with The Grapes of Wrath, Catcher in the Rye, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, etc. I am serious; Wizard's First Rule is on par with these outstanding pieces of literature.I do understand how one could not like it, but, to me, WFR is amazing. I recommend it with the strongest implorations.A must read for anyone who is literate."},{"rating":"1","title":"One extreme or the other","review":"I personally thought this book was awful. Even by skimming over large parts of it, I couldn't finish it. There seem to be two extremes in terms of the reviewers of this book. There are those that loved it and those that loathed it. It seems to depend on what type of reader you are. If you are new to fantasy, its entirely possible you'll enjoy this novel. If you're a regular reader, you'll find it extremely annoying.

Every page I kept telling myself, \\"It's got to get better! It's got to get better!\\" The characters were two dimensional, the situations were unimpressive, and the dialog was like something from a dime-store novel. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't suspend my disbelief, and I couldn't care about the characters.I finally gave up around chapter 10 or 11. Maybe someday I'll try again, but I wouldn't count on it.If you aren't looking for good literature, but just a wild ride, then perhaps this is a decent book.

Like Jordan, Goodkind has a very detailed context worked out for his plot, and a very elaborate and detailed plot worked out as well. But Goodkind magnifies Jordan's principal fault: bilgewater prose. In Jordan's case, the poor writing is at least ignorable. But Goodkind's prose is so awful that it calls constant attention to itself. One minor, but indicative, index of a fantasy author's skill is the ability to come up with good proper nouns: names of people and places. The sheer awkwardness and silliness of Goodkind's invented names is a clear mark of his tin ear for language."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The chicken that was not a chicken...\\"","review":"Terry Goodkind knows how to write a page-turner. I'll give him that. But not much more. If you're reading this review, you've heard it before: Goodkind is a horrible writer. I wouldn't say horrible; but certainly a bad writer. Even then, I don't mind bad writers. I read bad writing all the time. What I refuse to read, however, is work from writers who refuse to let a story tell itself, and instead force the story through a philosophical mold in their head to the detriment of the reader's enjoyment. But I won't go into the details about that. What I will say, though, is that life is too short to read thousand-page novels where the author, with an apparently perfectly straight face, writes about a \\"chicken that was not a chicken.\\" It's not the absurdity of it. I love absurdities. It's the colossal amount of cheek he must have to write this garbage. To sum it up, Goodkind is a freak. And this book is a freak's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not GOOD enough","review":"I saw the tv show first and was eager to read the book (The more Sword of Truth the better, right?). I found the book mostly interesting, but became disappointed when Mr. Goodkind started turning the story into erotic fantasy. There was also far too much emphasis on the bad guys and the terrible things they did to people. I find it insulting when people say that Terry Goodkind is as good as Tolkien. Tolkien didn't need to feed people's guilty pleasures to write a world famous and beloved epic; why did Mr. Goodkind? I'm very disappointed because there IS a lot of the \\"good stuff\\" in Mr. Goodkind's ideas. He could have made a masterpiece, but he didn't. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive..Most Impressive!","review":"This author Terry Goodkind is not only one of the most incredible visual writers I have ever read but also has a knack for weaving a web in an amazing world that you just can't walk away from.

I would not order from this retailer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, can't-put-it-down classic.","review":"This book, Wizard's First Rule is a well-written masterpiece of the modern age. The character development is well done and creates the atmosphere of the book. The relationships between the characters Kahlan and Richard drive you to come back and keep reading. Each persona in the book is totally realistic and independent. The book has an air of mystery that makes you come back for more. Without the mystery of the secrets between the characters, this book would name be the great book it is.This book is one of the best books I've ever read. My collection of modern writings extends well into the hundreds and I put Terry Goodkind, and all of his writings well to the head of the list. I put this book with all of my Dennis McKiernan, Piers Anthony, Terry Brooks, and J.R.R. Tokien books. This book is a definite must-have and must-read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This series is a story about the characters. Not about building an intricate origional, something you have never imagined before world. Its a tale about love and hardship and what must be done to endure. So the prose is not the greatest, the story itself more then makes up for it. Kahlan and the Seeker seem to reach out and grip you forcing you to read more of the book, and cheer for them as they overcome the many obstacles. So near the end its obvious that they will triumph, but when is it not obvious in a fantasy tale. The how of the triumph is not obvious imho. This book is definately a page turner as are his sequels, I urge you to read it and flow with it. If you can connect with any of the characters and see the story unfold through their eyes, you will not be unsatisfied. It is definately worth its price, and its one of the best tales i have read in quite some time"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait for the next books in the series to arrive","review":"I am new to fantasy novels.

I read about 2 hours a day while I sit on a commuter train. This book caused me to miss my stop more than once. I actually have found myself looking forward to the commute because I know that I have the book in my bag waiting for me to delve back into it. I have never read anything like it.

Furthermore, the novel is well-written and could stand in a non-fantasy world as well. The character are (with few exceptions) real life ones, with feelings and emotions, with doubts and fears and drawbacks, which you can easily attach to and care about. The plot twists and surprises as at every turn (with a big one at the end), and tragic events befall the heros, and makes you care even more for them. Even the evil characters are real, and have drawbacks and human feelings and characteristics. Goodkind is definitely a symbolistic, and he uses the evil characters to portrait the negative aspects of our real life world. Read this one, and you'll never want to read another one again. Superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great book.....","review":"I have read many of the negative reviews, and am beginning to wonder why people who don't like this book write a 100 lines on WHY its bad. Sure, Goodkind copied. But so what? Who doesn't copy. His characters are deep and believeable, and his world is worth coming back to. And this is what fantasy is about. He does have a lot of originality as well (confessors, mord-sith). And i seriously doubt that anyone could have seen the ending coming way back on page 100. Obviously everyone knows that good will win in the end, but i dont buy the book for the ending. I buy it for the journey. For the 800 pages between page one and the last page. So, if you are a fantasy fan and like long, deep books, this one is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven adolescent adventure","review":"Goodkind's engaging tale of moderately interesting characters is seriously marred by a lack of rules about the world he has created. Most often the struggles resemble an afterschool adolescent magical card battle in which the play of an enchanted sword card is countered with \\"Well I have a magic locket which changes your sword into...\\" but the original player responds \\"But I have a secret power that turns your locket into just its opposite.\\" Since anything is possible, the reader is eventually overwhelmed by the sense that Goodkind is just making up the rules as he goes along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defininately not George R.

It is so cool to see Richard go from a plain young woods guide to this awesome swordsman who won't take any wise crack from anyone.

I read the entire series because after book 3 I waited some years and then bought all the rest before rereading them, bad mistake. *Spoiler* Main character Richard finds out in one of the books that he is a war wizard, so I kept waiting for some awesome destructive powers to be unleashed, never happens.

Well I think no book has ever changed my outlook on certain things this much. It is indeed the birth of a legend and the conception and development of an unparalleled love that by the strength threatens to leave you awe-stricken. You miss it since the very first moment you close it. The creativity of the author is totally breathtaking,because despite the fact that it has distinct roots in reality, the novel presents you to a new world.

But if you read the next books you learn more about the magic and then understand it. Goodkind did a very good job on keeping you wanting to read more and more.

The first thing that struck me was how junvenile the writing style was. It read like it was written by an eleventh grader. Now, to be honest, I had just finished reading the fire and ice series by George R.R. Martin, and his writing style is awesome. As I continued reading, the storyline was so basic and predictable it was silly. About half way through I had to just put the book down, I couldn't waste any more time. If you are 15 and this is your first novel you may like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, derivative, puerile, and misogynistic","review":"I tried to like this as a student asked me to read it, but I kept feeling like I've read this story before. Characters in the book do stupid, unbelievable things, and I ceased to care if they were killed; in fact, I sort of looked forward to it with a few of them. Names of characters seemed derivative, and I could not stand Kahlan. Her name seems like an amalgam of floor wax product names, and she is not a very strong character. I'm not surprised that the book did well however; remember the rule: \\"People are stupid.\\" Maybe this refers to the people who bought this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You're a very special person, Mr. Cypher","review":"I've cleaned out shelves in many a library and bookstore, mostly science fiction, but my fair share of fantasy. Why does this book irritate me so? Because to read such escapism, you have to have some plausible shred of hope -- however slight -- that you could be the hero. This book lays it on so heavily that the protagonist is \\"a very special person\\" that it makes me feel like I'm drowning in high fructose corn syrup!It's the antithesis of Joseph Campbell's hero of a thousand faces. What is Cypher's primary virtue? Perserverence, tenacity, maybe love? Nope. Genetics. The moral of the story: don't go into the woods on an epic quest, unless you were born it. Give me Tolkien any day, where the hobbits asked themselves \\"why me?\\" because they were ordinary mortals playing a part is big things.I guess that's why I find this book so offensive. It devalues the heroic struggle of ordinary people in turbulent times. And that isn't fantasy; it's how history is written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, start to finish","review":"I am 16 and when I heard about, and got this book from my older brother, I was apprehensive about starting it because of the size of the book. From the first page of \\"The Sword of Truth\\" I was hooked. Great job on this book, it was the best I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uh...this is supposed to be good???","review":"Was this book supposed to be good? I don't think Goodking knows how to write a book because this was terrible. I read this book because it was a suggestion on the Jordan page. It insults Jordan to compare Goodkind to him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I got this one out of the library","review":"Well - sick as I am (physically), I just can't take anymore. When I was 12, and new to fantasy, I might have enjoyed this book and found the time to finish it. Alas, another scene with a boring character doing one more contrived thing to steer a rather dull plot has driven me to give up. Too bad - Goodkind certainly has a lot of enthusiasm - he needed it to churn out 700 odd pages of repetitive scenes of the hero and heroine meeting one creature after another and (surprise, surprise) surviving relatively unscratched. There were promising elements, but they were lost in the constant pounding of uninteresting action that just wasn't coming to life off the page. If you are looking for the Grisham's equivalent in fantasy - this is it. Dissapointment city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something about it . . .","review":"I can't decide if I continued reading this book because I had no others handy (read it at the in laws), or because I was caught up in something about it. The writing leaves something to be desired, and the characters really annoyed me for the most part--I didn't care one whit whether they lived or died. Yet the action and the pace were pretty good--engrossing on some level. The torture scenes with the S&M mistress were awfully exploitive, but upsetting nonetheless. However, my one underlying thought while I read this book was \\"Dear God I hope the story ends because there is no way on earth I could read 3 more books of drivel like this!\\" Luckily, it does end, so you could read the first book and never pick up Goodkind again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most fantasies,. but not for kids..","review":"I cannot beleive people are comparing George RR Martin to Goodkind's series.

Even more overrated than Jordan.","review":"This book made me angry. Fifty pages in, I thought it might be good; three hundred pages in, I realized he doesn't write all that well; five hundred pages in, I realized there was no nuance nor shading to any of the principle characters, and that they were boring; six hundred pages in, I realized I was reading a sequence of disjointed scenes and passages that had no bearing on anything; eight hundred and twenty pages in I relaized what a sucker I was for wasting all this time.I think if a lot of the people below read books other than of the fantasy genre (and not Tom Clancy or John Grisham), they'd see there's not much to this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story could have been told in 10 pages","review":"After finishing the last (dutch translated) Feist, a (former??) good friend of mine advised me to read this book. An outstanding book, he guarenteed me. How wrong he was indeed. The characters are flat, the story has been told dozens of times before. If this had been a short, conan like, story, it would heave been okay, not more, perhaps even less. I finish what I start and this is the sole reason why I finished the book. PLease terry pick up your former profession, whatever it was. I do have to admit that the Sid morth part was pretty kinky."},{"rating":"2","title":"HARD TO PUT DOWN","review":"I've just finished this book and had a hard time putting it down. excellent fantasy, It's hard to understand the extremes in reviews of Goodkinds work here, but thats what makes it an interesting world we live in.

Anyway good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not excellent.","review":"I liked this book a lot. It takes the reader through a rollercoaster of emotions, from hopelessness, to extreme excitement. It also developed the characters very well, but my only complaint would be both the amount of characters, and the predictability. Robert Jordan certainly introduced many more characters that played pivitol roles in his following books, but I don't see that as much here. It also got a bit predictable, especially towards the end. It was a good book however, the first in an apparently promising series. The creatures Goodkind creates are absolutely some of the best I have seen in a fantasy novel. It has many great elements of fantasy that are done to perfection, so I would certainly recommend this book to a maniacal fantasy reader like myself, because you will certainly enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Characters","review":"I love to live inside characters. But I found them so paper thin in this book, I had a hard time reading it. The overall story is good, but all the encounters by the travelers are the same: They are met with mutual distrust, but are hugging each other within a few pages. I didn't read the series any further, but perhaps Goodkind finds his stride later on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Along with blatant ripoffs from Jordan, this is one of the most cheesy and badly written fantasies I have ever read. The plot line is ridiculous, the dialogue corny and unrealistic, and the characters are completely unlikeable. This series is truly one of the most overrated that I have ever come into contact with, and I would suggest to everyone not to waste their time on this pointless drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this series","review":"I was given the book as a gift. The series title nearly made me laugh. 'Sword of Truth? Gimme a break.' Then I read it. I was swept up by its story in the first few chapters. the tale was told masterfully; I simply could not stop reading it. I was engulfed in its wake almost as much as I was with LOTR. Kudos to Terry Goodkind."},{"rating":"1","title":"I disliked the book in most ways, but it did have some good.","review":"When i first picked up this book, i was fairly excited - the plot line looked good, and the writing style exciting, but the more I read, the less i liked it. It took me more than 200 pages to get to the point where I didn't want to throw it down and walk away from it. The writing style was not smooth, there were sudden changes in the character that came out of nowhere with no character delvelopement, and, at times, the writing seemed amost childish. The plot did turn out quite well, and I am willing to give the author a break because it is one of his first books. The potential that the book had is the reason that I have gone on and read his other books. He has improved in his writing with them. I only wish that he had spent more time making this book worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor character development, unbelievable interactions","review":"I found Richard Cypher's character unbelievable. The fact that he was written to have lived his life (up until the story) as a level headed, easy-going and likeable man makes it difficult to swallow such a profound change in personality taking place in such a short time. Also the interaction between characters shows errors of pace. Realistic adult interactions show that friendship and love develop over time. It seemed Richard and Kahlan were melting each other's hearts within several hours of meeting. This is the type of development and interaction that I would expect to see in a young readers' book. The storyline is actually decent, although his style is a little distracting; it does not flow smoothly."},{"rating":"1","title":"WFR Book1","review":"Even still they want me to write a review of a book that I was never sent. Instead I was sent a later edition. The picture of the book I was to have received was not the same book I got.

Now I did get refunded with no problems but I would have rather spent my time getting the correct book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compareable to the lord of the rings?","review":"I am glad that I have finally stumbled upon a fantasy book worth reading to the end that is geared more towards adults. With characters that readers can identify with, its no wonder that this series, that runs 10 long, is such a hit. With a new twist to the fantasy realm, I would gladly like to see this made into a movie, and would highly recommend it to anybody willing to read a more mature fantasy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindnumbingly boring","review":"This book drags on forever. I kept hoping things would pick up, but they never did. Good for sitting on the beach if you need a nap...use it as a pillow. The storyline is juvenile. I would have enjoyed it in high-school, but don't today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Kind of Fantasy, Should be Horror Instead","review":"I read the first book Wizard's First Rule and was enjoying it until I got to the part where a child was put in a hole to his neck and uspeakable things done to the child by the final page of his story (the child's), approximately 32 pages later. This is not what I call fantasy it is and was at the time I read it too too much like the awful reality of what happens to missing children and truly believe that this author's work belongs in the Horror section not the Fantasy section of all booksellers. I attempted to advise officials in this industry who did not care and were more concerned over profits vs. children. He has the right to write this but it belongs Horror. - Sandra"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, trite, repetitive, simplistic","review":"Oh dear.

It was beautifully written, I won't argue that. However, the story became so (unnecessarily) sadistic and deviant half way through the book, that I actually considered tearing it up. Instead I just threw it in the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did! If you'd prefer reading a book series that is mature, lovely, exciting and perceptive, forget Terry Goodkind and pick up almost anything from Carol Berg or most of what David Eddings and Terry Pratchett have written. These authors understand people, they understand tight editing and they are trustworthy in the level of sex/violence. Goodkind's characters are very one-dimensional and the episodes of torture are gratuitous and sickening in parts. The magic does not make sense, either, and I prefer not having to suspend my disbelief quite that much. I finished this book, unfortunately, but put away the next in the series unfinished.I don't recommend Robert Jordan, although he is generally excellent, only because of his three very badly-written books, but I would read any of these three stinkers again before picking up any of Mr. Goodkind's disgusting works of fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"motivationan","review":"an interesting way to convey the basic nature of people in groups an individually what it is that elicits response an really good read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start to a series won't release the remaining books on kindle.","review":"I'll make mine short.

It's captivating and original - characters such as the Mord Sith and Gars really added to the story - and I would completely recommend this book.On a side note, be wary of the rest of the series, which at points is very good, but deteriorates in both story line and character development as it progresses. Up to book 5 is defnitely worth a read, but if you're the sort of person that HAS to finish a series when you start (as I am), then it's probably not a good idea to start it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 1 of a dazzling series","review":"Terry Goodkind is one of the GREAT fantasy authors.

You'll want to continue through all eight books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining book","review":"I read all the comments from people pointing out the negative aspects of Goodkind's work: his lack of refinement in his writing, predictable storyline, empty setting, similarity to Robert Jordan, and over use of violence. While these things all may be true to some degree, they skirt the heart of the issue: the book is entertaining to read. Why else read a fantasy novel, if not for the excitement of not being able to put the book down and stop reading it because you are so engrossed in a great story? About the explicitiveness of the book. Anyone read one of Chris Bunch's fantasy novels? Read one of them, and you will see how it is difficult to critisize Goodkind for his torture scene. Yes, Goodkind's book does have many parallels with Robert Jordan's series, but so what? Simply put, this book is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is way offensive...","review":"I'm a huge fan of fantasy and sci-fi novels, with some of my favorites like the Shannara series.

What makes Richard any different from FrodoBaggins, Rand Al'Thor, or Garion besises a few trappings Goodkind layed on him? What distinguishes Kahlan from any other mysterious heroine? What keeps Chase from blending into Aragorn or Lan? What is the difference between Zedd and Gandalf or Belgarth? Sure, Goodkind can tell the stories of OTHER charcters clothed in new names, but he can't throw in any of his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters and adventure, but the world needs work.","review":"I must admit, after reading some of the bad reviews on thispage I almost quit reading Wizard's First Rule (WFR). I amgald I didn't. I imagine the people who gave WFR bad critiquesare more interested in the world of the story than thecharacters. Nothing is wrong with that. In fact, I also feelthat the world this story uses too many cliches and shouldhave been more throughly detailed. Still, it is thecharacters that drive a story, and this one has superb ones.Very rarely in any type of fantasy are the characters asbelievable as in this novel. You will cheer for the heroesand will despise the villians, I promise. The love thatdevelops between Richard and Kahlan is as real and tearwrenching as in real life.

Twenty years ago when _everyone_ wasn't writing pure high fantasy, it might have fit in--but we've gone beyond that now, and Goodkind is lagging. He may make money, but I doubt anyone takes him as seriously as they would Stephen Donaldson or William Gibson.

Reading the first 100 pages of Wizard's 1st Rule was a pain. Goodkind's writing is unimaginative, bad written and single minded. He needs about 250 pages to shift from one plot to 'another'. His fantasy leads to good laughs ... do you know the difference between a 'long-tailed gar' and a 'short-tailed gar'? The short-tailed counts his blood-flies ... argh ... often you think he's joking - but Richard can always count on his 'sausage', 'spice soup' and 'rightfull anger filling him with wrath' :( Don't waste your time with this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think of it this way...","review":"Read the reviews of this book.

Intelligent books open the boundaries of whatevergenres they are in, but dumb books stay within the ready- made bounds. Dumb books entertain and stupify us, but intelligent books entertain while they make us think or see the world in a different way.

Better toget drunk...it kills less braincells. Really, these kinds of books are filled with stupidity and childish morality. If it's not original, why not just go and read all the other works the author copied from? 99% of the time the author who copies as much as Goodkind doesn't translate the copied device/character/etc. with as much power as the original had. When I learned Darth Vader was Luke's father, it was shocking ...when I found Darken Rahl was Richard's, I laughed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind = Brain Candy","review":"I didn't like this book very much, and I'm glad I didn'tbuy it in hardcover. From all the hype I'd heard aboutWizard's First Rule and Goodkind in general, I thought it was going to be something fresh and daring--but it fell back on the same tired cliches, and the ending was worse than than anything a drunken hollywood producer could cobble together. It's preachy, boring, and the world-building is abured, so it's no wonder that it sold so well. All that bulk and no spark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind is a terrible writer","review":"Goodkind can't write for squat. Yes, there are a lot of cliches and a few blatantly stolen ideas in his story. But that's not the main problem. The problem is that Goodkind cannot write dialogue. It is so bad and unnatural that it's cringe worthy.Another problem is Goodkind preaching his moral lessons. It gets really out of hand in the later books, but it's still noticeable in WFR. What makes his moral lessons so ridiculous is how obvious they. He makes his villains so blatantly evil that we couldn't possibly agree with or sympathize with them and he then still feels the need to explain to us why they're bad as if we're 3 year old children.The overall plot is actually fairly good, but it's just poorly executed.I would recommend skipping over the books entirely and just watching Legend of the Seeker instead. It's cheesy, but it's enjoyable and a lot more fun than the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated, derivative tripe","review":"A waste of paper and time. The book is a thinly cloaked S&M fantasy dressed up as an \\"epic.\\" Wooden characters, stilted and monotonous writing, a plot that develops no original ideas, and an excess of violence that often seems to have no clear relation to the plot (such as it is). The appeal of this book is frightening--and doesn't speak well of the market for fantasy. This is the only book I've gotten rid of in a long career of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The parts that weren't bad were derivative","review":"My first reaction to the book was to wonder what insane experience poisoned Goodkind enough that he wanted to spend so much time talking about the Mord-Sith and other icons of sadism. Once I got over that, I was struck by how many elements of the story were positively generic. I soldiered on for a while, but the entire series just doesn't get better.I think the idea of the Seeker could be an interesting one, and that if Goodkind were to seek some therapy and start over, he might yet do some interesting work."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK EVER","review":"Hi.

Furthermore the writer tried to impress us with the fact that his hero is human by making him cry at the end of almost each chapter and if he is not crying than the female hero is. Like I said, not a back book but the story is not as logical and sound as we would expect from a masterpiece and making the hero human by just making him cry is a shortcoming. Nevertheless I bought the sequel just to see if he is improving because the talent is there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard's First Rule","review":"I am not one who ever liked fantasy fiction books before but reading Terry Goodkinds wizards first rule got me hooked. I could not put the book down it had me captivated. I have enjoyed the characters as well the story line it was like being in another world. I read the book in two days the way that the book was written really got my imagination going. Wizards First Rule got me hooked and now I am almost done the series I really hopes that if Terry Goodkind is finished this series that he will start another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to this Genre","review":"Wizard's First Rule is a great book for those who want to experience a new area of reading enjoyment, particularly for women. Unlike most Fantasy novels who have a man as the main figure of the story, Terry Goodkind develops both the male and female into strong characters which tend to share the spotlight of the lead role. I have recommmended this book to a number of my female friends and I have had nothing back but thanks for the recommendation. The writing style is easy and fun to read. The characters are well developed and easy to empathize with. The scenery and plot development are not over-bearing and unnecessarily long which makes this book and excellent read. Personally I really enjoyed this book and I encourage everyone to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wizard's First Rule\\" one of the best Fantasy Novels ever!","review":"This book tells the story of an ordinary person called Richard whos life is changed drastically by a chance meeting. He was brought up in a world with nothing out of the ordiary such as magic for instance, and he now finds himself caught up in one of the most inportant evants of all time. The plot is filled with intrige and desite as Richard's view of the world, his friends and himself changes forever. Richard's only choise is to follow duty and destiny in his quest to save mankind.Richard croses the \\"Boundary\\" not only in his way of thinking and finds himself confronted with the impossible. Dragons, Wizards, and the ever ominous \\"Confessors\\" all have a part to play in this brilliant Novel.The series is continued in a furher 7 books and I would stongly recomend all of them. This series of books is unmissable to any Fantasy reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique themes - Great adult escapism","review":"You can alwasy tell a unique book when you get very strong and differing opinions. I've read quite a bit of fantasy books starting with my first novel, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" at age 9 and totalling well over 400 books in the genre. I have had to occasionally force myself to finish books or been unable to get through bad ones. I found that I could not put Terry Goodkind's down. I read the first 5 books in 2 weeks (at a heavy cost of sleep and spousal nagging). The unique modern themes including some adult topics and modern political parallels were fun and engaging. While I wouldn't give these to my 10 year old, but I would highly recommend them to an adult that enjoys a good bit of fantasy escapism."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not awful, but it's not worth it","review":"I am currently reading this book and would recommend to anyone considering its purchase to look for something more worthwhile. Although it is not an awful book, in that in can be read and you wouldn't throw it in the trash after the first few chapters, I will most certainly not buy any of the sequels. If you are looking for the same old conventional small party quest type fantasy with dialogue that makes you cringe in vicarious shame by all means read it. However, if you desire much better work for true intellectuals who love fantasy try George R. R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this ever become a best seller???????","review":"Thick, heavy epics of magic and politics are my guilty pleasure, and after seeing Goodkind's books on so many lists and promoted on so many bookstore endcaps, I picked up the first 2 volumes and was stunned by just how bad and uninteresting this story was. With the exception, perhaps, of the Confessor, these characters are are bad copies of archetypical characters found in pulp fantasies like those of David Eddings and Piers Anthony (You have to be pretty bad for your characters to have less depth than Piers Anthony!!). And if you can't deliver enaging characters, you need to be able to give the readers plot and creative settings. Goodkind delivers neither. I still have not figured out how a book that is filled with so little creativity, character and story got to be so hefty. As you probably guessed, I did not even pick up the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Compares","review":"Goodkind is a brilliant author who has finally given me a fantasy novel I've always desired. He's very vivid, but never gets into too much detail about insignificant details (*ahem* Tolkien). He keeps just enough of the fantasy aspect in this book without overdosing and making it all out silly. This has been the greatest fantasy novel that I have ever read (and I've read a lot of them), and I owe it all to Goodkind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, I loved it!","review":"I only discoverd how spellbinding books can be since last summer, and I have read a multitude of books since, my favorite being, Wizard's First Rule. I read it in two weeks, amazing since I read really slowly. I was so captivated by the story, and the drama of the plot that I couldn't even stop to do my school work. Terry Goodkind has a way of writing books that will not allow you to put them down. I sat reading for hours, enchanted and sometimes horrified. Even my brother, who claims he didn't like it that much, couldn't put it down. Richard and Kahlan are now a vivid part of my imagination, and nothing will stop me from entering their world through their books, or simply my own mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Book in the Entire World!!!!!","review":"I have read the entire series of the Sword of Truth. This book will stay with you forever. After Terry Goodkind finishes with the Series, I will read them, all over again. You are missing out if you do not read this. Adventure, magic, love, recover, mytics, giants, demons and the Great, Darken Rahl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as riveting as Terry Brooks.","review":"Anxious to see of Book #2 is as good as the first one. Hoping this series does not evolve into a soap opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total sissy book, terribly written","review":"The Sword of Truth has the word 'truth' written on it! That is how unimaginative Goodkind with his written. Totally flat, boring, uninspiring, overly sensitive rubbish. Very bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes to gain ground, you need to slow down...","review":"I read this book several years ago. I loved the bittersweet development of Richard and Kahlan. Zedd, at times seemed more as the crazy old uncle than a wise wizard. Though, if you get into this series you should not be the faint of heart. The following books delve into some pretty graphic violent scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLICHE AND CHILDISH","review":"I have read fantasy since I was seven years old (starting with C.S. Lewis and Tolkien), and this book was on the 2nd grade reading level. The authors writing style was simplistic and redundant, and 90 percent of the images in the book were hackneyed and trite. The Bone Woman and multiflavored Gars were the worst. The only original part of the book concerned the Mord-Sith and the still somewhat cheesy training by pain. If you want a serious good book do not look here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, bad names, no drama","review":"This novel is fascinating in that it manages to doeverything WRONG! It's characters are onesided (gee, Richard was nice now he's mean but doesn't like it), the names are god-aweful (Darken Rhal!?!?), and the desription of magic,how sometimes Zed is powerful and sometimeshe's not, just doesn't work. If you want good fantasy go and read Tolkien, or Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\", or Eddings, or ANYBODY!The only good thing about this book is that unlike a movie, you don't HAVE to finish it once you start"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful surprise!","review":"I just happened to stumble on this book and didn't really know what to expect. But now that I've read it... wow!This is the most action packed book I've read in ages. I can't believe it hasn't been made into the next Lord of the Rings-- it would make a GREAT movie trilogy!! There's so much going on, and the author does a really great job with his main characters and welcoming you into this new magical world. Interesting people, scary creatures, horrible \\"bad guys\\"-- it was a wonderful surprise to have stumbled across this. I just ordered the entire series! I had no idea its been out for so long. I can't wait to read the rest!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry Goodkind - Not Impressed","review":"1st: If you are from Canada, you can't buy all the books in the series. What? Amazon were very decent and refunded the books I did buy.2nd: I emailed Terry Goodkind's website. Not a peep back. Guess that indicates the value that organization and author attribute to readers.3rd: Story gets very predictable and drags on. The TV series was MUCH better than the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Binding was broken upon receiving package","review":"Very disappointed that the binding was broken. Went through the trouble and cost of finding a nice hard cover since the story is so good and then received a damaged book.

Mr. Goodkind exudes exceptional writing talent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid.","review":"People usually say that Goodkind has a lot in common with Jordan.The only thing I think he has in common with him is his ridiculously long books.Otherwise there are not as many pointless characters,the magic is as in depth as Terry Brooks,and the plot is fast moving and gripping.Richard Cypher,an unsuspecting person in the Westland,suddenly saves a mysterious woman called Kahlan Amnell,who tells him some disturbing news:Darken Rahl(the evil dude)has two of the boxes of Orden and is searching for the third one.She has come to the Westland searching for the only wizard powerful enough to destroy Darken Rahl.When the wizard turns out to be Richard's old friend Zedd,Zedd appoints him Seeker and gives him the mission to destroy Darken Rahl.This is a tale of romance,adventure,and wonderful magic .Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard's First Rule","review":"What can I say...I was given this book by a friend of mine and I began to read it. At first, I have to admit, I found it hideously boring, but I convinced myself to stick with it and by about chapter four I couldn't put it down! It is now my favourite book and I am onto the third book in the series. If you are thinking of buying this book, do! I can almost guarantee that it will be the best book you will ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"men are from mars women are from venus","review":"the story is quite straight forward and it is enjoyable for a while. i called it the hugging book (the female charator just want to sit down to cry over some masculinity's shoulder and then hug everybody!). the female charator is real pathetic. the book offended me and i am not a female. well enough said already. still this will be a best seller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, slow going, poor writing style","review":"There are a lot of self published books that are far better written than this thing. Very slow going, the hero is presented as some sort of imbecile, the characters aren't engaging. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype","review":"To say this book is bad is an understatement.

The reason It isn't the best book of all time is because the sequel is it's equal. This book will captivate you from the start, and never let go until the end. You will be amazed by the author's understanding of pain, suffering, love, and life.

Everything--his characters, his plot, his world, his magic, his writing style--is filled with cliche, and is, plainly, quite boring. It amazes me that anyone would pay $25 for something with this much hair on it. Read Tolkien, Jordan, Brooks, Eddings--that's who Goodkind takes everything from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind got one thing right.","review":"Why is this book championed as 'quality' fantasy?Why are there so many five-star reviews on this page?Why are most of those reviews incomprehensible?Why do worthy authors languish in obscurity while a derivitive, stunningly bad hack such as this sells as much as he does?Why do people feel the need to claim this wandering drivel is superior to Tolkien?Easy. Goodkind wrote it himself:PEOPLE ARE STUPID.'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storytelling Sucks","review":"Goodkind a better story-teller? Come on! His charactersare from a comic strip...Richard=Dick Tracy! The bookis boring and sappy...if you think falling all over one another and saying \\"oh, I love you!\\" is character development, then you better read something else--like Stephen Donaldson.

Geesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche to the utmost extreme","review":"I'm feeling lazy, and don't like to write a lengthy review, but I've read all the 1 star reviews here and I agree completely with all of them. This book is cliche to the utmost extreme. You can't enjoy it unless you haven't read or seen LOTR. It's so obvious what's going to happen, and there is what, 10 books in this series? Yikes, talk about a complete waste of time. I can already tell you, the hero in this story is going to succeed, he is going to defeat Darken Rahl... so, eh... why keep reading? The story is cliche, Darken Rahl is as good as dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok, could have been great.........","review":"The world is detailed and has lots of original ideas. I liked the little twists, it makes the reading even better.This novel had awkward pacing though. Like, sometimes it can be a page turner, then the next moment, your reading about 80 pages about some dang tribals, no action, no plot development, just 80 pages on tribals, yee hah. One of the more boring scenes is a series of torture sequences that lasted for like 100 pages. I mean, it was really offensive at first, then it just got tedious. Can we just get on with the novel and kill the freakin mistriss.The characters are flat also, but i dont need to go in detail about that, just read the other bad reviews, and then read the good ones and read what they have to say about the characters. Nothing.But when the plot did move along or the action did start going, it was like readin a fantasy classic, untill, of course, we take a 50 page break campin in the woods lecturin about prophecies. ZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Real fantasy lovers BEWARE","review":"Don't waste your money on Goodkind. A terrible writer who taints the fantasy genre with insipid, juvenile writing and even more insipid characters. How did this person get published? I've read fantasy novels for 20+ years and have never read a fantasy novel that I had trouble finishing, until Goodkind. I returned the books I bought and will never buy another one from this author ever again. I recommend George R.R. Martin or Robin Hobb, or just about anyone else besides Terry Goodkind."},{"rating":"1","title":"does it count if I couldn't finish it?","review":"Who can read this DRIVEL? Poorly written, with an almost juvenile writing style. Boring. Predictable. The interactions between the Kahlen and Richard, laughable. They have known each other for, um, one day, and already she has \\"a secret smile just for him!\\" Ugh. I kept reading parts of it out loud to my family and LAUGHING! I had to quit after about 100 pages. I am surprised I managed to get that far and shocked that this is a bestseller. Compares in my mind to the Eragon books by Christopher Paolini, except his are written by a teen, and for a pre-teen and teen audience. Still can't stand them, though. I would skip this book without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dookie","review":"The only reason I give it a 2 is that I am trapped on an oil rig in Mexico and there were no other books on board. I found that if you skip through about 40% of the book you can escape the monotony, repitition and weak plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Book Now Even More Accessible","review":"I'm so glad to see this series expanded into an even wider variety of distribution, especially with the advent of Raimi's Legend of the Seeker this fall. Anyone who wants to read the amazing story that started the Sword of Truth should now have the means to do so in any format. If e-books suit your style and you like reading about characters who embody the very best of humankind, then there's no better addition to your collection than Wizards First Rule. I hope Terry's work continues to see success on a large scale.I've been a long time fan of the series, but although I own all of the books in print, it's inconvenient to take them all to school with me. I've often wished I had electronic copies for quick reading access. The book itself gets my very best recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging beginning into a new world.","review":"This book is a great treasure for those seeking a This book is a great treasure for those seeking a Tolkien like story.

Far too many what I assume are OCR errors have got through the latter 3rd of the book, constantly pulling me out of the story to try and work out what was really meant. I'd live with the same issues that I assume exist in the latter books of the series for $2.99 each, but at the asking price between $7 and $9, it's just not worth it. Amazon please attempt to hold publishers accountable for their laziness with eBook releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile Babble","review":"Annoyingly archetypal characters. Even more annoying lectures on morality filling half the pages. Really, one lecture being repeated over-and-over. I got very good at skipping paragraphs to fast-forward to parts where something was happening. Especially in the later books. If you think the parts where something happened were worth forwarding to, you are mistaken. Could not wait to finish the series so the misery would end. Book 'TiVo' + the fact that I already had the whole series on loan from a friend is the only reason I finished the series. So I guess that deserves two stars. Could be worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodkind's First Book is the Best","review":"Personally, I loved this first book of his. Having read all 3 of his books now in publish, I would say this is the best one. If you are looking for action, romance in the quality of a epic fantasy this is the book for you. If you are looking for a ho-hum everyday fantasy don't pick to read this book. But if you want a whitty, humorous fantasy then this is definitely the book you want"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's alright, but there are better books on the market....","review":"It took me a long time to get into reading this book. Once I did I found I liked the story line, but Goodkind's writing style is the worst I've seen in years. I've known children who can write better than that. This book is VERY predictable and parts of it have been 'lifted' from other books. Can we say plagarizm?? Richard's time spent with the Mord-Sith was too drawn out and overly brutal...and hints of some BDSM fantasies Goodkind must have. If you have nothing else to read and feel like wading through all 800+ pages then take a crack at it, but there are MUCH better books out there"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"I really don't see how anyone could criticize Wizard's First Rule, much less Terry Goodkind.

The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is for the interesting creatures and magics that are revealed.

Sadly, that station has been defunct for some time now, as many of its target audience members are probably deceased by now. My favorites from this thoroughly enjoyable collection are probably the 2 perky 1957 hits by the throaty-voiced Jill Corey \\"Love Me To Pieces\\" and \\"I Love My Baby (My Baby Loves Me)\\".

It is one of the few pocket-size cameras on the market that can give you the option to shoot in RAW and offers extensive manual control. The Leica lens is superb and so is the picture quality. Manual control is available for most features I would like to have control over. The controls are easily accessible and intuitive despite the small size of the camera. The 16:9 picture format is great for landscape shots. I use this format most of the time. Image stabilization works very well. Noise is not really an issue if one shots in manual mode with a low ISO. The price is a bit heavy. However, I could not find a comparable camera (RAW format, manual controls, small size etc) at a more competitive price.I wholeheartedly recommend this camera to any photographer who is looking for a pocket-size camera with extensive manual control and the possibility to shoot in RAW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to upgrade","review":"Great little camera. By now though (2009) the LX3 is available and is very much better (if a bit bigger). If, however, you just want a 16:9 wide angle and don't shoot in low light much and can get a great price (you should by now) it's worth a shot. I gave it four stars subjectively based on what it meant to me. My real opinion, however, is to pool your money and get the LX3 (get a silver at great price. It's pictures are no different and you aren't Henri Bresson). But again, value for the money means getting an LX1 at a really good price and enjoying it versus saving up for the LX3 and waiting a bit longer, which is what I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality","review":"The samples I hear on this screen are pretty poor.

One other great thing is that there isn't just one or two techniques that you have to always rely on. There must be about twenty different ones that can be used in just about any situation.

A classic example is his comment on the last page that he is available \\"on a limited basis,\\" for workshops and group facilitation.

And once you have uncovered a lie, the author gives you no advice on what to do next. They've lied, and now you've lied to get them to be honest with you--now what? What people need is not a book that gives them only remotely helpful tips for telling if people are being dishonest (intuition seems to be good enough for most of us) but a book that tells you what to do with the people in your life who are dishonest with you. Catching them in a lie isn't enough--you need to know how to act to prevent the harm that lies can cause--and this book in no way teaches you that.

Unfortunately, this belief is simply false. (See, for example, David Lykken's Tremor in the Blood.) Moreover, in hands naive or reckless enough to put the author's principles into practice, the results are certain to be more harmful than helpful. The book inspires a cynical outlook on one's relations with others and cynical means for exposing them. Following its principles will lead to one's being avoided if not despised by one's associates.

On one hand, it does cover a lot of signs that you are being lied to, and if you know about them you will pay attention and will be more likely to figure out the truth. On the other hand, some methods for finding out the truth are really disturbing because the author advocates using lies and manipulations for discovering the truth. However, I would still recommend reading it. You don't have to use every suggestion in it - use what feels right for you. I especially found the first part of the book useful - this is where the author lists all the signs of lying (and there are a LOT of them, I think that he probably covered them all). The second part lists the aforementioned \\"strategies\\".

In one instance he recounts a story in which the boss is attempting to get a suspected embezzler to tell the truth. To do this the boss promises a great reward (the big office at the end of the hall) if the truth is told and bad circumstances if it isn't. The boss is telling the crook a lie to get the crook to come clean. The crook will be fired if he confesses. The author gives many examples of this type where the reader is encouraged to lie so the offender will tell the truth. But is this a morally correct position? I think not. This book encourages the very activity it condemns. And encourages it in a very big way. Most of the examples fall into the catagory of lying to catch the lier. Bad show overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"mixed truths","review":"I expected this to help me tell when people are lying (more than I already can currently), but all it's done is confuse me when I tried to put it into practice.I never really pay attention to my body language and the way I speak until I read this book.

Worse yet, when I do lie, I natually do all the things that the author thinks signifies someone telling the truth.There were a few good tips... shifting gazed, uncomfortable movements, etc... but those are fairly obvious... it's easy to spot bad liers.

For example, many of his techniques require the use of misleading questions. And manipulative? He teaches you how to HYPNOTIZE people so they'll do what you want! This irony ruins an otherwise effective presentation. This book cannot help you fight lying unless you yourself are a liar . . . in which case you have no reason to complain when people lie to you.

However, Trystan manages to get himself banished from Britain, and then sends for Gareth to come to Amorica. By this time, Gareth is a lord in his own right, and companion of King Arthur.The Arthurian legend is often mentioned in conjunction with this book. And although Arthur & Gwenevere play a role in the book, they aren't the main focus. Gwen & Lancelot are only mentioned once, and even then it is in passing. Arthur plays the larger role because he is commander of the troops of which Gareth & Trystan are members.I liked the people in the book, and I thought that Ms. Hawks did a good job bringing them to life.

I wasn't sure I would, after hearing the about the lack of depth, and, of course, Ray Charles. But I did. I really did. The music, saxphone in the beginning, giving it an 1940 feel, fit perfectly. And when \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\" played, well, the effect was strange, sure, but not at all bad.I ordered this from another site, and just finished watching it. (Delivered two days earlier then amazon, but no biggie, at least amazon is selling good anime) The DVD picture, and the bonuses...well, they deserve 5 stars. Great behind the scenes look at the CGI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Anime Fan","review":"Not the kind of anime I was expecting. It is from the creator of Astro Boy, so all the characters have the Astor Boyish look. Confusing, I fell asleep in the middle of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't get any better....","review":"From the moment this movie starts, the viewer can expect to be in for a whollop of bad entertainment. The colors are stodgy and the characters look like they are on growth hormones with their beady eyes and hyper-long arms. But that is not even the worst part of it...Honest to God, between stiff acting, a grating soundtrack, and a lack of plot, this picture should be credited to Al Gore instead of Tezuka. The team have done him a great disservice. Ultimately, this picture is about as exciting as a flat roller coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't tell which is worse: The animation or the story?","review":"I am going to make this review short. Three major reasons why I didn't like Metropolis:The Animation -- What is up with the fat heads, mustaches or other body features? Placed on a computer generated background, it either looks like an very very old Japanimation, or a really bad attempt to immitate American cartoons. I can't seem to tell which.The Story -- Lack of character developement, and with few action sequences in between a boring plot.The Music -- Where did they get the music they used for this movie? Are you sure I'm not watching an old American cartoon? I know that this anime was a remake of an old anime, but don't you think they could've at least updated the music a little? Awful!If this is the evolution of Anime, then I had better finish off my Dragonball Z collection while I still can and look for a new hobby."},{"rating":"1","title":"No offense but it really SUCKED","review":"Sorry to say it but the movie sucked. The storyline sucks the type of animation they used sucked.It could just be my taste since i like stuff like evangleion and princess mononoke. The end was very sad and depressing. The girl is way to much devoted to Kenichi. The inspector bot got blown up really bad. I was hoping for him to fight all of them and like some freaky chain guns and misle launchers would come out and bow everything up.Well thats my review.I ruined the part with the inspector but really there isnt really anything to ruin since it already sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"good lord!!!!!!!","review":"basically this is a remake of Fritz Lang's silent film \\"Metropolis\\" form 1927. and it is afully done!!! if you want to see a true masterpeice seen the original, live action, silent, \\"Metropolis\\". trust me, it is much better. any movie done by Fritz Lang is better!!

Sure, it did have some pretty cool action scenes(like in the last 4 minutes), but the characters [were terrible] and what's with the needlessly complicated plot and character background? I mean, it could have been great if the characters didn't look like they were from a freakin Rodger Rabbit cartoon and if I didn't feel like being beaten with a rusty pipe would have been better than watching this 'movie'. Very lame and so much wasted potential. It's sad really. I'd much rather recommend some REAL animes, such as: Vampire Hunter D; Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust; Wicked City; Ninja Scroll; Princess Mononoke; hell even Pokemon the movie would have been better than this... I'm sorry if I've angered anyone by this review, I just can't stand the thought of anyone viewing this (and I use this term loosely) anime without at least one warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very bad","review":"This is a perfect example of the worst in Japanese animation. I love good anime but this is not good anime.First of all the whole ad campaign was of this amazing \\"future metropolis\\" but what's amazing about it? It's not as amazing as the metropolis in several movies that came before it. For example The Fifth Element or Judge Dredd.Okay fine you say about how about as a movie? Well, it [stinks]. As almost all *bad* Japanese anime goes, it a series of images and issues the director thought would be *cool* without one thought about how they work together. The story is over moralizing, preachy and on top of that it's old stuff. This basic story has been seen tons of times before. The mix of styles does not work. The soundtrack, while maybe quality music, is horrid for the movie and hurts it tremendously. I would have walked out if I had not been treated to see it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this movie","review":"I am sorry that I have to give this movie 1 star but it is most certainly crap, even for the date of its production.

I do not know what was going on, but I remember for like 30 minutes of the movie it was this just stupid Japanese girl scribbling names on a wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a decent anime","review":"I'm a huge fan of the art style used in this film, so I really enjoyed the viewing experience. The story does move somewhat slow, and the ending may not be as over-the-top as other anime flicks, but it is visually a fun experience and has rightfully earned it's place on my collection shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Art, The Story...Horrible.","review":"When I first saw the character design (which is much like fifties American cartoons) I thought, \\"Uh...is this going to change in the second disc?\\".I was just fooling myself of course.The backround art, is exceptional however. It really annoyed me. I would love to see the characters with that art quality.Some say the way the characters look is 'refreshing.'. I don't see it.As for the story, it's way overdone and has nothing special about it.The best thing about this movie was some of the music and the backround art.I would explain the story, but there are so many other reviewers doing so, and frankly, it's so forgettable, I can't tell you much.If you like the sound of the other reviews though, you should rent it. I think you'll either love or hate this anime.If you're looking for an anime that's good for children, I suggest to you Panda! Go Panda! or Kiki's Delivery Service.I think, though, you're probably here because of all the hype surronding this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tima's last scene","review":"It'd been a long time since I hadn't seen a 'one scene' capable of rescuing a whole anime movie. (I wished for a scene like this one all along Akira for instance, and ... nope, it never happened, not one scene saved it, it sucked until the very end.) Other anime don't need such scenes because they are entertaining or decidedly good; not quite the case with Metropolis.The design of the characters is quite dull, which contrasts distastefully with the (for the most part) great scenery of the picture. I'd say though that the major achievement of the designers was to portray the robot girl so beautifully, which was essential for the movie itself.On the whole, the plot seems week, as does the script; but we'll always have that last scene between Kenichi and Tima ... which would have been the only reason for a third star, but it does not pay off for a rather mild film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeper","review":"Hi everybody, I've been watching anime for a long time now and there are many that I like a lot such as evangelion, Armitage, and Tank Police. I heard good things about this movie so I went out and rented it right away. I was at first thinking wow this is cool looking because of the CG backgrounds, but then was like wow, they get boring quickly. I first tried to watch this movie but grew tired of it after 20 minutes. I then tried again and fell asleep an hour into the movie. The movie could have been half decent but I didn't like the \\"story\\" of it and the imaging got very redundant after a while, it was like playing Final Fantasy and wathcing the cutscenes. I did give this a two star rating ony because it put me to sleep and I have mild insomnia so it was a good help!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It has NO redeeming qualities to speak of.","review":"The blend of digital effects blended with, what looked like, cheap 80's drawing was disturbingly bad. The story was heavy-handed and trite. What anime film doesn't have robots, sprawling cities of the future, a love/hate relationship with technology, and obscenely bad social commentary? \\"Metropolis\\" is literally the same canned storyline and social statements that made Japanese animation cutting edge in the late 80's. Guess what, the year is 2002. This plotline isn't just tired, it's an anachronism. This movie is a dinosaur that collapses under it's own girth. Good riddance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst anime I've seen","review":"I truly do not understand how so many reviewers liked this film. The animation while technically brilliant, is simply asthetically distasteful because the author decided on a character style that went out in the 30's.The characters are laughably shallow and the plot was tired back in the 80's when it was popular.But I guess if you're the creator of Akira, you can polish up a turd and the masses will call it art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze Plot","review":"Alright I was hopeful that this anime would turn out to be a superb materpiece! However i started the movie and fell asleeps fourty-five minutes into the picture.People raved how great the graphics were nbut i feel that CGI has no place in anime.This movie should recieve negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Akira wearing the mask of Astro Boy","review":"This movie is as bad as it can get. I've read some of the comics from Osamu Tezuka. The protagolists of his stories are mostly outcasts. For examples, an android, a werewolf, a vampire, and a surgeon. From my understanding of those comics, an android is neither a human or a machine, a werewolf or a vampire is neither a beast or a human, and a surgeon is neither a god or a man. This is the outcasts who tell the story about how bad the world they live in. I fail to find any of these applied to this movie. The story is focused mostly on the Rock character who seeks revenge from the android. The story itself is not even good. The story is like written by many people on their own, and then someone just cut and paste the pieces together. The ending of Metropolis is the worst part. It is like watching Akira (the comic is good. the movie is so-so.). The ending just doesn't fit anything in Metropolis. After all, this is the worst cartoon I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like no other Anime out there. Dragon Ball Z is in the dust.","review":"This movie had the most incredible animation. The music was a little odd, but the older Jazz music sounds almost like they're indicating it's like the depression of the 1930s. Movies like this make you realize Dragon Ball Z is mindless and I'm a kid. I also enjoyed some of the bullet scenes where you see it pass by Tima's hair and when they show the bullet come right out of the gun in slow motion. This movie is just incredible. And the part where they have ''I Can't Stop Loving You'' is great. And I just love the first ever pocket DVD. Metropolis is the highpoint of Anime!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Imagery, Poor Story","review":"Beautiful animation, this film is in a catagory all its own. The scenery and characters look great. There are some throw backs to Akira and Metropolis, but it is an amazing visual experience to watch this film. ...notice I said an amazing VISUAL experience. The plot is laughable at best. There are so many holes in the story you really have to ignore it and just enjoy the great animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"the next best thing to life","review":"This movie was fantastic! I am so happy that I spent [the money] on it. The CG is amazing, which about %90 of the movie was made with it. The endig is what really got me in the heart. That was probably the most climatic part in the whole movie. It is a superb work of art. It will carve itself into your mind forever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give credit where it is due","review":"Okay this is an okay movie, but only because of the story which was borrowed. The animation isn't that good. Lets not forget the German movie maker Fritz Lang orginally created this whole idea back in 1927. Lang's black and white silent movie (except for music) was far ahead of it's time. Considering he introduced a female robot that was humanistic in a industrialized society of workers that worked like robots his ideas were quite innovative. Just go look at the original 1927 Metropolis movie. I don't have any trouble recognizing the remake of a good thing, I just don't like the idea of reviewers acting like Osamu Tezuka's 1949 manga was the original storyline. He either obviously shamelessly borrowed the idea from Fritz Lang or people are just not giving credit as they should to the original Metropolis creator Fritz Lang."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth seeing and owning.","review":"I went to see this with my friends and one of their parents, and I didn't quite know what to expect.I've talked with my parents about what Astroboy was like, and I actually own the first volume of Blackjack, but this was the first time I would see somethings of Osamu Tezuka animated.The plot was slightly confusing, but I enjoyed it. I'm good at following that sort of plot.The art was quirky, but nothing more than the Osamu style. It's the same type of art as Blackjack and Astroboy. It had some familiar characters, and some new ones. The voices were good, but sometimes the subtitles were hard to read.The soundtrack was overall pretty good, but it was kinda odd at one point. You have this huge scene with a building falling down, people are dying, and everything's burning. It's full of emotion. Kenichi falls, and what plays?I CAN'T STOP LOOOOOVING YOU...........It was offsetting, but not enough to detract from the rest of the film.I plan to buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite different, quite good!","review":"I just saw this. I'd almost say \\"absolutely amazing\\", but it's not quite. It's not 100%, but I'd give it A+ for sure.I like the background music, very unique and different and gives it a good feel. This is definitely NOT a children's movie.I'm not going to say much about the plot, so as not to spoil it so much.Very nice story line and although it seemed kind of short, plenty of time to get attached to the characters. Well, maybe a bit longer would've been better.I dunno if I'd buy it for $25 (I'm cheap. Very few movies are worth $25 to me), but this is a \\"must see\\" at some point. For sure worth renting it out at the video store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just ignore the story...","review":"Metropolis..Wheee...I just have to say.. The art is AMAZING!! But the story is not. The plot is lacking some very important parts. I haven't decided which, yet, because the beautiful and breathtaking art distracted me. I fancy myself an artist, and even with the Astro Boy-ish art, I could find no flaws. I am normally incredibly critical, and i watched this only to try and find a slight screwup somewhere... But i could find none.So if you want to watch something purely for it's asthetics, i truly do recomend this. (It really is beautiful! really!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL MOVIE","review":"It all started 50 years ago... The shocking message Osamu Tezuka left for the future of the human race.

After seeing it, i just had to own it. Its a feast for the eyes, and thankfully, there's a story to go with it. It looks like Astroboy, so that may be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your tastes, plus, the soundtrack is very, very different, as it plays jazz music in very odd spots. But, this movie is truly worth a purchase, even if you're not into anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problem in the DVD","review":"Excuse my poor EnglishI watched Metropolis in a movie festival here in Brazil last year. After the credits they show a scene - a picture of the characters after the end of the anime. It explained what was left untold in the end.I bought the dvd and there is no such scene after the credits. Looks like when they cut the japanese credits and put the english ones, they didn't notice that the last image was gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metropolis the great","review":"Being a huge fan of Japanimation, Anime, whatever you wish to call it, an aunt of mine sent me this DVD as a birthday present. I am so glad she did.Metropolis has a complex, yet simple, storyline, BRILLIENT animation, especially with the computerized backgrounds, wonderful, wonderful characters that you remember for hours (Rock stood out in my mine, although Atlas left quite the impression), and a finale that is expected yet unexpected in the same way.In summary: Rent this movie! You will not forget it, and even the English dub is up to par with the Japanese version! The last two scenes made me have to rewind, and then re watch, them again and again (Call me sappy, but I still tear up a little when \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\" starts to play)... This is a truly spectacular movie, that deserves FAR more then then five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely film","review":"Upon first watching, Metropolis can be a little baffleing. Despite the somewhat confusing to the casual viewer plotline, you get sucked into the images that are created on the screen. And eventually, everything starts to fall into place, thus creating a rich, beautifully animated story. After a second watching, you find yourself drawn into tima's search for herself, and you catch yourself asking the same questions.A wonderful film that is fit for nearly all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! This Film Blew Me Away!!","review":"Once in a blue moon you will be lucky enough to see and hear a movie this good. Metropolis is one of those PERFECT works of anime, it is the Akira of the new millenium, and this DVD's sound and picture quality is awesome. If you have never seen an anime film, watch this one. Believe me, you'll become a fan of the genre after watching Metropolis.I cannot describe the quality of the visuals in this movie, it is truly an incredible achievement in animation and a great tribute to the original Fritz Lang silent film. The soundtrack is perfect, no matter what the critics say. BUY THIS FILM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animation ahead of its time!!!","review":"A lot of praise has been made for this ambitious anime. They are all correct! In the coming years, comparisons will be made to this film in regards to its innovative and largely successful use of 2d and 3d integration. This is a must for animators and fans of animation in general. Also for fans of DR.STRANGELOVE, Lang's METROPOLIS, AKIRA, BLADE RUNNER, ASTRO BOY, Fleischer's work....nuff said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I love animated films and I was looking forward to it when it was released, after some searching over here I got it, sat down and was never more bored.First off, the cityscapes are superb, but the \\"Popeye\\" type characters looked very out of place against the scenery. Not only were they very Pokemon colored they had very limited facial expressions and I could not get the feeling that the translation crew had left out loads !The ending would probably have been very moving if I had developed any feeling for any of the characters in the film. The personal character development is non existent and basically the film dragged out for me, and as I said , while the end of the film was pretty good I pretty much felt no sentiments for the characters, robotic or otherwise. Its a shame really as this had potential to be an excellent flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but empty","review":"Visually this is one impressive movie.

Madden is tried and true, if you liked 2003, don't expect anything different from the gameplay, but the extras are huge. Designing stadiums, setting ticket prices, etc. Overall, a good game.ESPN on the other hand is the same but different. I think gameplay wise the games are very similar, but ESPN allows you to do more running moves, by doing combos and charging up power. While this sounds like an arcade game, it's actually very realistic. They have a cribs feature for awards, and an awesome First Person mode. Where in my opinion, ESPN takes the cake is in the presentation. You get Chris Berman analyze your game before and at halftime, and at the end. The stat overlays are great and the game graphically looks better.In the end, you won't be dissappointed with either game, but in my opinion, ESPN Football/Sega 2K4 is the better of the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent compilation!","review":"This book far exceeds both The Renderman Companiona and Texturing and Modeling: A procedural approach(Two very good books) in the presentation of massive amounts of information, as well as simplicity of presentation. While this book does sort of deal more with BMRT and PRMan(look at the authors, sheesh...) than the Interface, per se, it does a very nice job of presenting information specifically geared towards them. The inclusion of a section on mathmatics and physics is especially appealing for me, because I'm not yet out of high school.

It eats D batteries too (it takes four), but you'd better hope the fan doesn't bite it like it did on ours. The manufacturer won't replace it after 90 days and if the fan doesn't work, the whole thing stinks to high heaven.Haven't used any other diaper disposal units, but this one sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"way too noisy","review":"You may be better off just buying a regular trash can that seals tightly.

Do not buy this machine - you'll end up putting the diapers in an envelope and sending them return receipt to First Years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I purchased this product without reading any reviews, and have become so frustrated with it, I am replacing after only a few months of use. My issues were similar to that of others here:1) Lid is often difficult to open, and sometimes very loud when it closes.2) Disposal access does not always open up (diaper sits in top area without going down into bag). I find myself opening and shutting the lid 5-6 times to try to get the diaper into the bag, and when it doesn't go, I have to hold the lid halfway open with one hand (to release the opening on the bag access) and shove the diaper down into the bag with the other hand. Gross.3) I thought the filter was working -- the light came on -- assumed it was quiet. Realized a few weeks later that the fan was dead, and there was no more power light despite battery replacement.4) Unit is top heavy when not full.I am sure there are better, easier to use products out there -- I would strongly suggest not purchasing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than any other diaper pail","review":"I've been using this for 4 months now. We are not very happy with it. Still very odorous! Not any less odor than other pails we've had. The pail is also small and we have to change it more often than others. The loud closing noise is also annoying - especially when you are trying to be quiet during the night. I like the Diaper Champ better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it Love it Love it!!!","review":"This is the best diaper pail I have ever purchased and boy let me tell you I have been through more then I can count. I love this diaper pail so much I bought more then one. There's no smell at all from it (however I do suggest using scented garbage bags, and yes that's the best part, you can use a garbage bag!), changing the filter, bag, batteries, is not hard at all, and I think over all it's an easier system then all the other brands out there. I'm very happy with mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good diaper pail","review":"My husband and I really like this diaper pail. I like that it is a simple color/design so it can discretely sit in our nursery. We've been using the pail for almost 2 months and so far it has done a fantastic job of keeping the room odor-free. We have not yet had to replace the batteries or the filter. My only (minor) complaint is that a tall kitchen bag really is a bit too big for this pail. You end up having to replace the bag before it's actually full because the pail isn't large enough to accomodate a full bag of diapers. So I feel as if the bag is being wasted somewhat. But that's a small tradeoff for not having to buy specific, expensive bag refills. Some people have mentioned that the pail is loud when closed. That's true- it does have a loud slamming noise when you close it all the way. It hasn't bothered us or our son, so I really wouldn't let that deter you from getting this pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price, although not ideal","review":"This is a good product, that does a good job at controlling smell, as long as you replace batteries and filter as frequently as needed.PROS:I very much appreciate the fact that I can use it with any garbage bag. Some other systems require their specific bags, which means that the price for the system is higher than it looks.CONS:The mechanism that closes the bag automatically is a good idea, but could use some improvement, namely:- It is made of cheap plastic; do not push hard on it if the diaper does not go through, or you will break it.- It would be a lot easier (and less dangerous for the mechanism) if the opening for the diaper were wider. As it is now, if your baby is not *very* young, you will probably often have to repeatedly open/close the lid, before the diaper disappears.Overall, considering the competitors, it is a good system for the price, just close it gently (and repeatedly, if necessary)."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKS","review":"I have had problems with this stinky pail since my grandson was born. It falls over, the lights don't come on, the fan has never run, the replacement filters are super expensive (to say nothing of the 4 D batteries I keep buying), its a pain to replace the bag and, worst of all......it smells to high heaven. I can now smell it when I enter the house. The final blow was when the plastic piece that pushed the diaper into the bag fell into the bag with all the diapers from the week and I had to fish it out. Gross!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away - total junk!","review":"Believe the other poor reviews - this thing is difficult to operate and it WILL break before your child is out of diapers. Even if you think you are getting a good deal, you will have to spend good money after bad to buy a better brand. The design is hopelessly flawed and the lid hinges are guaranteed to break. On ours, one broke off completely and we discovered that the others were also cracked. No way to fix the plastic. I would not take one of these for free because I know that it is destined for the landfill. Zero stars!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money -","review":"The diaper pail was great for the first 6-8 months...and then stopped working completely...It is also so completely engineered without the consideration of having an actual baby. It's very loud and easily tips over. Because it doesn't work it always smells, even after putting only the diapers with urine in the pail, and throwing the others in our garbage in our garage. Our garage doesn't seem to smell from the diapers either. Hmm...The only good part of the pail was that you could use regular tall trash bags instead of having to by expensive refills.I would not recommend this product to anyone. I replaced mine with Diaper Champ Deluxe and this works much better...quiet, easy to use with one hand...cheaper...uses regular trash bags...and I found out the pediatrician uses the same one at their office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, great service!","review":"We've used this diaper pail for 18 months now and it has been great the whole time. The batteries do run low pretty quickly, but even when the batteries run out, you can't smell it if you get it all the way closed (not that hard to do). Of course, as with any pail, when it's open, you get a whif of the contents, but it's gone once you get it closed. We LOVE that we can use regular trash bags with it too.Just last week, we accidentally lost the cone that shoves the diaper down into the bag and ended up throwing it away with the diapers. It just took an email to the manufacturer and in one day they had another part on the way free of charge, no questions asked...fantastic! We have another baby on the way and intend to continue using this diaper pail all the way through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible.

The filter doesn't hold in the smells. The plunger thing inside constantly detaches, leaving you to fish it out of a garbage bag filled with used diapers (yuck!). The lid hardly ever latches. The on/off switch is too close to the where you close the lid and therefore is turned off by accident alot. And don't even get me started on the process to put a new garbage bag in the unit. This was a huge waste of money.

I went to close it as usual today and found that the lid kept popping up. My husband checked it out and said that one of the hinges is broken. We previously had a diaper decor that broke after about a year and half of regular use. I found it frustrating that it broke after that time, but in my opinion it was a much better product than this one. We decided to try something new when we made this recent purchase because we liked the idea of not having to buy refills, but this has been more hassle than it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst diaper pail I have ever used","review":"This diaper pail is absolutely the worst baby product I have ever purchased. I have owned it for about a month, and the device that supposedly pushes the diapers into the pail has fallen off about five times. Many diapers, if not heavy enough, are trapped in the top part of the pail. The \\"jaws,\\" which are supposed to open to allow the diaper in and then close again, stay open most of the time, allowing the odors to escape into the room. The pail is very difficult to open with one hand, and other family members who have tried to use it have actually given up, thinking they were doing something wrong. I would not recommend this product to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, bad system","review":"We received this as a shower gift and we will not be using it.

Johnston tries to convince us he's a loving father, but the man is frankly a child abuser and no motivation justifies his treatment of his daughters. She also made some errors with Comanche culture, especially the Numu language. This series is entertaining if you simply want to read a romance, but fans who select historical fiction tend to be quite knowledgeable about their favorite time periods, and WILL catch glitches.

As for the elbow / kneepads, they had a hard plastic bubble type fixture that provided protection for those particular joints but they did not allow the pads to flex and bend because it was one piece and rigid. This item seemed to be made for and more appropriately used by her to play dress up with her doll babies that would never actually be riding. Definitely not designed for what it supposed to do.

The helmet is made very solidly, and the pads can be used for elbows or knees (we use them mostly for the latter and despite quite a few tumbles, they're holding up well). The only reason I can't give this a 5 star rating is the lack of a second set of pads.

Some (eg. \\"Bullet in the Gun\\") are perhaps getting a bit stale and overused nowadays, but other classics like \\"Resurrection\\" and the Tiesto mix of \\"Flesh\\" work well and keep the mix nice and fun.Disc 3 is a real gem!! It's a seamlessly blended, smooth package of mellow feelgood chills and warm after hours beats. Track selection on this disc is superb; with Jan Johnson's \\"Silent\\" Words and Liquid State's dreamy \\"Falling\\" sitting neatly alongside a gritty mix of \\"The Word\\" and the ubiquitous \\"Adagio for Strings\\".

Grafton books are among the very few \\"beach books\\" that I buy in hardcover because I simply cannot wait a year for the paperback edition. Unfortunately, \\"N is for Noose\\" is not up to Ms. Grafton's usual skills. The plot is convoluted. The characters, while generally interesting, sometimes are introduced in such a cursory fashion that I had to list them inside my back cover just to keep track of who was who. It was obvious from the very beginning \\"who done it\\" and the explanation of why it was done was not worth the wait. So why two stars rather than none? The book rates two stars because Ms Grafton's prose is easy-reading and natural. Even with a weak plot, the book is a pleasant read.

I listened to this book on a long driving trip. If I hadn't been a captive audience with no radio or tape alternatives, I never would have made it to page 100. BOORRRINNG!! No plot, no mystery, repetitious dull details. My feeling is that Grafton's publisher insists she write 300 page books so that they can make more money off her. They can't charge as much for 200 pagers that would have the snap and sizzle of her early works. Come on Grafton! Give your readers a break and speak up to those twerps in New York. Half of them don't know what a mystery is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, very boring","review":"I have read in order the alphabet series from A-N and have enjoyed ALL the books EXCEPT for \\"N is for Noose\\"!

Hopefully \\"O\\" will be more entertaining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"50 pages too long, but still a winner.","review":"This is the slowest of the Grafton/Kinsey Millhone books, although the final 40 pages rocket to a satisfying finish. There's definitely too much space devoted to superfluous descriptions, but it's Kinsey so all is forgiven. Good start, mediocre middle and a great ending. If this is your first Grafton, either start at the beginning (\\"A is for Alibi\\") or go directly to \\"F is for Fugitive\\" or \\"K is for Killer.\\" Those books will show you what the excitement is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinsey doesn't run much anymore!","review":"I usually eagerly await the next letter of the alphabet. But no more. A major disappointment throughout. Kinsey always made me feel good but she's lost her bounce.

It was the first book I had read by Kinsey, and probably the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comic book of a novel","review":"Grafton's writing is dull, formulaic, and unrealistic. Her characters are from the one-dimensional, connect-the-dot trash heap. N is for Noose is further undermined by scenes drawn from a simpleton's vision of reality. For example, Kinsey is trapped in her motel room while a thug breaks in... and what happens? The guy pins her on the ground and then dislocates two of her fingers. What a brute! We could only hope a similar experience might befall Ms. Grafton and keep her away from the keyboard where she threatens to belt out more of her \\"literature.\\" After all of the overblown discriptions are removed and a decent editor cuts a hundred pages, N is for Noose can be viewed as a short story that deserves a C- in high school composition.

There was essentially no plot and little character development. I agree with another reviewer, that perhaps this is what the trivial, day-to-day activities of a real-life PI might be like. I only finished it to see if at least there was an interesting twist in the solution of the case. I was disappointed to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"After reading other authors in the genre, I decided to give Grafton a try with N is for Noose. The first 50 pages were tiresome... but I kept going. The next 50 pages were boring... kept reading, waiting for something to happen. Around page 135 I gave up... the entire book is consumed with uninteresting details that seem to lead nowhere. Closed the book and watched a Columbo movie... which was actually enjoyable after this tedious book. I'm not even interested to see how it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy","review":"I actually really liked A - G... but the series went seriously downhill from there. This one was too much... I simply couldn't finish it. I got past all of my usual annoyances (again, she described the size 8 woman as being overweight... am I the only person that bothers?). The book was going nowhere slowly, but I still hoped for something. And then - Kinsey made a sandwich with Hellmann's mayonnaise and called it her favorite kind - minor, nitpicky detail, but *someone*, an editor, the writer, someone should have known that you can't buy Hellmann's in Nevada - or California for that matter. I instantly lost interest, and put it down, never to pick it back up.Details matter in detective stories. If they're going to overlook some details, what else will they overlook - the plot? the characterization? the mystery? just because its SUE GRAFTON?I expect more. With any luck, she'll take more time on the next book to write something worth the 3 hours of reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I picked up this book while I was traveling, hoping to find something nice and easy that would occupy me while the plane zoomed through the air towards home. Big bummer. I finished it only because I was stuck on the plane without anything else (I even read the in-flight magazine, yikes!).I can't beleive that this is a \\"best selling\\" mystery! Pallid, forgettable characters that even the author seems bored of. Cheesy scenes that felt like they were straight from a made for TV movie.And the ending! Please! Maybe Ms. Grafton should take a break for a while and get the juices flowing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot was uninteresting and the final scene absurd.","review":"I found myself very bored from before the middle of the book, but plugged along. Thus, the final scene was particularly infuriating as it made no sense, insult to injury. How did the mind-altering drug get in the brownies? If Brant put it there, how does one account for the plate he supposedly ate off? Would his mother have done this? Really the last chapter is a slap together, hodge-podge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many meaningless words and descriptions.","review":"Having read all of the alphabet mysteries, I can say that this one was weak. So little happened. Sue Grafton has done so much better in others. I wonder if publishers are asking for more words!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could have been","review":"No one in this book is very likable, not even the usually likable Kinsey. She wasn't very interested in the case, which made it hard for me to be interested. The small mountain town setting had all kinds of possibilities, none of which materialized. Rafer could had been explored more: for instance, how come a small town law enforcement official wears cashmere sweaters? I just didn't care about any of the characters, which spells disaster for a mystery (or any other kind of) story. It read like a book gone to press just to satisfy a deadline."},{"rating":"1","title":"N is for Needed More","review":"I have been a Kinsey Millhone fan from the beginning. However, N is for Noose left so much unexplained. My main question when I closed the book was \\"Who was Judy Gelson's lover and did that have anything to do with anything???\\" I have lots of other questions but hesitate to reveal too much of the plot here. It was very confusing in some spots, where peripheral characters all of a sudden became major players. Not one of Ms. Grafton's best. However, I'll look forward to \\"O is for Outlaw\\" with enthusiasm, hoping it will be a more satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"N is for Not-Very-Good","review":"I have been a big Kinsey fan since the first \\"A,\\" But there was very little here to recommend. The only reason I finished it was because I took it on a long plane flight and didn't bring an alternative. No plot, boring characters, a tired-out narrator. I hope Grafton is back up to speed on \\"O,\\" or it will be \\"O for Over and Out\\" for this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quirks of Investigating a Death in a Tiny Town","review":"This book was easy and fun to read. I finished it in 2 nights. It was interesting to see Kinsey operating in unfamiliar territory, the small town of Nota Lake. I found bits of dialogue to be some of Grafton's funniest ever - an exchange between Kinsey and a blowsy highly-sexed sexagenarian alcoholic for example. However, the finale was somewhat of a disappointment - overcontrived, without enough explanation. Otherwise, this book is one of Grafton's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Grafton's better efforts.","review":"Unlike the preceding 13 novels in this series, Millhone is having a week of rather bad hair days in this one and it shows. It spite of her usually optimistic approach to life, Millone is pessimistic throughout. I would hope this isn't what the rest of the series is going to be like.Not a particularly good novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was okay but the ending was great","review":"I've only read two of Grafton's books--N is for Noose and L is for Lawless. After reading the 'L' book, I still wasn't sure what I thought about Kinsey but I loved her dynamic, pushy nature in the 'L' book, something that seemed to be missing from Noose. The ending, however, was excellent. I don't remember the last time I laughed out loud when reading a book and that laughter made the book worth reading. Still, the ending was kind of hard to swallow and I hope Kinsey does more in the future other than getting chased around or beat up (I'm kinda wanting Kinsey to get a bit tougher, I guess). Still, it was a fun book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending was extremely disappointing .","review":"I have listened to both the abridged and the unabridged versions of N is for Noose and flipped through the hard cover version and was thoroughly disappointed in the ending...The rest of the book was very typical of a Kinsey mystery. I didn't mind the change in locale - it did make for variety which is good. The humor wasn't as present, and I did miss that. This was my least favorite book in the series which I adore. I still anxiously await \\"O\\".I also hope that in the future, she does release unabridged versions and that she has them narrated by Judy Kaye. I found that Mary Pfeiffer just didn't cut it - I've grown accustomed to Judy's voice since \\"A\\" and don't think anyone else could replace her."},{"rating":"1","title":"N is for noose","review":"the book is really slow, or should i say s-l-o-w. it really lack the intensity of a mystery book. i like books with a grip n is for the birds.it had a few moments, but very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is definitely not one of Grafton's best efforts.

Kinsey always gets her man/or woman. kept me on the edge for days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Grafton Winner","review":"Big Sue Grafton fan..read all her early ones when they first came out and trying to do a complete reread. Funny thing, Kinsey Milhone is not someone I'd like in real life, but Grafton is able to keep me interested, although she does overdue the scenery details a few times. Good writer, good plots, good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st book read by Sue Grafton, a real disappointment!","review":"I liked the sense of humor that the author projected in this story. I thought it was neat the way she mixed the mystery and the humor together. However I was very disappointed in the ending of this book. I have to agree with the reviewer from California May 27, 1999 that said \\"the plot was uninteresting and the final scene absurd\\". I couldn't believe that after investing so much time and effort in following all the clues set forth in this story, the author would end it so abruptly? Ms. Grafton owed the reader a better explaination of what happened. I feel that I ultimately understood the ending, but I resented having to go back and re-read it over and over to get it. The story moved very slowly and I felt there should have been a pay off at the end for exercising such patients, unfortunately there wasn't. I will try some of Ms. Grafton's earlier work, but this story was not up to the usual standards of what I like to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow, disappointing read with a contrived ending.","review":"I was very disappointed in this slow moving book. I am a big fan of Kinsey and was looking forward to reading of her latest adventure. It took FOREVER for the story to get moving. The characters were described in great and often tedious detail but somehow seemed one-dimensional. The premise was uninteresting, a woman's husband dies of a heart attack but was upset about something before he died...???!!! It took will power and curiosity to keep going. I kept thinking that it would get better, that I would be intrigued, that I was wrong about the person I suspected. Unfortunately when I got to the let's throw all the answers and action into one unbelievable chapter ending, I slammed the book closed in disgust.

The later books have not advanced the characters like Kinsey, Henry and Rose. All these charachters were enjoyable in the earlier books with their witty reparte, but have grown old and stagnant. Kinsey needs a partner (as maybe does Grafton) to make this series take on a new and exciting aspect. If O is as slow developing and boring as N was I may not want to buy the remainder of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort but ending was a cop out.","review":"I'll read it again, and I'll buy it in paperback but Grafton has got to quit copping out in either killing or maiming her killers. It almost works but I would have liked it better if Kinsey had actually killed him this time or if the good cop had saved the day so to speak. But honestly I am quibbling. It is a great read and typicaly Kinsey Milhone."},{"rating":"1","title":"N is for Noosr","review":"I have read all the Grafton novel through N and I think ahe broke the rule of one too many.

I will give O a try to see if Grafton can regain my favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Spark","review":"The premise of this story was a good one, but the telling of it was lackluster.

I think I'll forgo O Is For Outlaw unless the reviews are very, very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's hope O is for Original Plot next time","review":"This book was not only a disappointment, it was a waste of time. I was still at page 83 before anything of interest had happened. Yes, I knew what the characters wore and smoked, but let's face it, she's no Dickens, so that's not enough to keep our interest. I know she originally wrote in this genre to counteract criticism from producers that she couldn't write good plots...Sue, fight back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The least effective of Grafton's \\"alphabet\\" series","review":"I am a fan of Grafton and her fictional detective, but she has failed with \\"Noose\\". What makes Kinsey Milhone and her adventures so compelling is the great cast of characters that Grafton has developed. Let's face it -her plots have never been that complex. In this book,e.g., the culprit was telegraphed from almost the moment he entered to everyone apparently but Kinsey. The problem here is that the book largely takes place away from Kinsey's home base, and the regular characters are brought in only incidentally. The new characters in the remote town are one-dimensional. So Ms. Grafton, get Kinsey back home where she belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Kinsey ready for retirement?","review":"Just because there are 26 letters in the alphabet, doesn't mean this series has to run till the bitter end! Especially since at the halfway mark Kinsey seems to be running out of steam. The pace is lackadaisical at best, and the plot is far from original. Neither Grafton nor Kinsey show much interest, so how do they expect the readers to?And if there are future episodes (I know \\"O\\" is already in the bookstores), then PLEASE give Kinsey a computer, cellphone, etc. Bring this woman into the 21st century! It's ridiculous to still have her searching for phone booths."},{"rating":"1","title":"N is for Not So Fast","review":"This is the first Sue Grafton book I've read and I have to say that I enjoyed it--UNTIL the \\"quickie\\" ending, which was such a letdown after having read sooooo many pages to get there. It seemed like the author decided she was tired of writing, couldn't be bothered to explain or justify plot points, and just wanted to be done with it! Such a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This is the only really disappointing book in this series. Kinsey's so dumb she apparently never figures out who the two most likely suspects are, since she keeps blabbing to them, and the motive finally ascribed to one of them is vague in the extreme. In fact, very little of the plot is believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Editing would have produced a great mystery!","review":"Why didn't an editor cut most of the first 100+ pages? We mystery readers already grasp the efforts inherent in starting the search. Also, I agree with others' comments that the humor isn't as prevalent as in the earlier Kinsey Milhone mysteries. Too, I was disappointed by the ending, which required a few more pages to resolve the mystery. However, Sue Grafton can write, and I wouldn't miss reading any of her mysteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"N is For Not Much","review":"Kinsey while striving perhaps to be more \\"mature\\" fails in the lack of sassiness, I have come to love. N does not possess these qualities. It seems to drag and does not contain much suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"wha???","review":"(audio version)That about sums up my reaction to most of this book. It was slow, overly descriptive (I fastforwarded through large sections without missing plot details...), and schizophrenic in plot. Like many other reviewers, I also was disappointed in the ending...the killer is just suddenly identified and then nothing explained, just stated. The \\"plot\\" was much too random to follow and Kinsey was presented as a complete idiot. This is the only Sue Grafton book I have read and I hope her others are better because this one was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most disappointing and ineffective tale of the Series!","review":"If you're truly a Kinsey Milhone fan, you would think N is for Noose was written by someone other than Sue Grafton. The story never left the ground and the \\"pals\\" we've all become so familiar with in the series were nearly nonexistent. The plot was trite, lacked imagination and never was a mystery from the inception. One hates to feel so cheated after enjoying our heroine and the series from A to N. Better luck next time, Sue. A better editor would never have let this one off the press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wished for more","review":"This book was not very good at all! It was very slow. I found myself skipping many of the descriptions of weather and scenery, and I don't think I missed anything. I was quite disappointed and can't figure out why it made the bestseller list. I expected more from this author. I don't know if I will read the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is definitely not one of her better books!","review":"I kept waiting and waiting for some action to occur in this one! I felt fairly cold, most of the time, as I read this one, because Grafton's descriptions went on and on about the cold, sleet, snow, etc. I did not figure out the murderer, until it was obvious, so, she did do a good job, keeping me in suspense about that. Although, I would not read this one again, I will of course read the next, and hope that the plot is a little more exciting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and unfulfilled by my weakened heroine","review":"Just finishing \\"N\\", I am unhappy that I had solved the crime long before Kinsey and was railing at her sloppy fact-checking and detective work. Usually I can count on Ms. Millhone to give me a boost for female-kind, but this time she left me embarrassed and sad. Maybe she needs a major career change, she seems unable to deal with the stress of her job as she gets older. Even though I hate to lose Kinsey, it might be time for Ms. Grafton to take time off or try writing another character for awhile to get fresh perspective. I'd hate to see her go the way of Robert B. Parker (who I love, but his last few years don't match up to his first few)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading it was like trying to climb a greased pole!","review":"Sue Grafton has always delivered a good read, one that I can usually count on to keep me engrossed while traveling.

Get Kinsey out of her coma and back to her usual self - quick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KINSEY IS LOOSE WITH A NOOSE!!!!!","review":"Kinsey has turned loose on the town of Nota Lake. She is to find out that the town sticks together and does not like her being there. She is attacked and hurt, but she comes back strong and solves the mystery. I got confused with all the numbers toward the end of the book, also seems like the ending came and was, wham, over to quick. I did like the fact that she was not shacked up with Dietz in this one. Thanks, Sue Crafton. A pretty good read, some slow places and a lot of description of places. If you like female PI's I think you will like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get the ending","review":"I'm confused about the ending -- did the ex-con really attack Rafer's daughter? Was that the motive for Brandt's killings? Or, if the attack was made-up to get Kinsey to suspect Rafer, where's the motive? I've read most of the Millhone series, and I thought this one was a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy digressions distract from already weak plot line","review":"N is for Not Worth the Time it takes to Read. Starting with an implausible hiring premise, Sue Grafton fritters away the reader's patience with irrelevant set pieces like Rosie's birthday party, a Barbie doll collection, and endlessly repeated discussions of Kinsey's tastes in clothing and food. These efforts could better have been spent in making the plot more complex and more coherent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian!","review":"Grafton has never been my favorite, but most of her earlier books were at least good reads. This one is boring and padded with improbable incidents like a numeric cipher Kinsey is too dumb to solve, a murder technique that's never explained, and Kinsey's total breakdown because she thinks townspeople are talking about her! And what's the bit about the town's founders being branded convicts from England - in California!Grafton needs to take some time off. I don't think she's capable of sustaining the series through the rest of the alphabet. How about a new hero?"},{"rating":"1","title":"N is Not Grafton's Best","review":"I must agree with other reviewers that \\"N is for Noose\\" is well below par for Sue Grafton. I think Ms. Grafton is attempting to \\"round out\\" Kinsey - she attempted this in N by having Kinsey become frightened after an attack. Sure, show that Kinsey is human and gets scared like the rest of us but do not forsake the other elements of her character, especially her sarcastic wit, while doing so. As with the last few Grafton books, K is for Killer, L is for Lawless and now N is for Noose, I find that I neither care about the problems of the characters (M is for Malice was the exception to this) nor do I care about the resolution of the case. Perhaps Ms. Grafton should go back and read her earlier works to help herself devise more interesting plots for the remaining novels in the series. This reader strongly feels that unless the quality of plot strengthens significantly, I'll stop reading (and buying) Ms. Grafton's books long before she makes it to Z."},{"rating":"1","title":"N Is for NOPE!","review":"Sue Grafton and her editors should have read the book before it was printed! The first 100 pages drag; the characters are underdeveloped and weak; the most interesting character is already dead (Tom Newquist); the killer is obvious early on (well, early after the plot finally gets underway), and his motive is totally obscure and/or nonexistent! Kinsey is not just maturing if N is typical of the future books--she is AGING BADLY. Her humor and snap have faded; her analytical skills are seriously declining; she has lost her \\"edge\\" and babbles to the most probable villains everything they want and need to know about her investigation. The ending is improbable, and it is so rushed that the reader gets the feeling Grafton tired of the book or couldn't figure out how to give the killer a motive and/or how to have Kinsey figure out \\"who done it,\\" so she rushed to get out of the corner she painted Kinsey into.

I guess he's more in love with his style than we are. You'll find yourself skimming very soon into the book, wishing it wasn't written kind of in a novel style with too much information.

Several groups have seen the frontal range of the Rockies area as meant for them and called it home. At various times in history, changes in the 'environment, some man-made, caused Liebig's Law of the Minimum (i.e., an organizm's limits are set by the minimum availability of necessary things,) to enter into force. Those groups best able to adapt to those changes became the new powers in the area.

Richard Brautigan's suicide nearly two decades ago haunts American literature almost as darkly as Hemingway's does from four decades ago. In AN UNFORTUNATE WOMAN, the reader can see where its author is heading. I'm glad this book has finally found print, but I'm sad knowing full well how the life of one of my literary heroes will soon end. Brautigan's final work tells, in journal form, of a man's journey following the hanging death of a friend. In some ways, it's a typical, rambling, fun Brautigan book. At certain points the man shines like he did at his best. It's the Sixties and Seventies all over again. At other points, sadness takes over, as one can see a magnificent talent fading. AN UNFORTUNATE WOMAN is a book I'm glad I read, and I would freely recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brautigan fan","review":"This is one work by Richard Brautigan that I have never read, so I am just guessing on the number of stars.

This collection of thoughts is so personal that the reader feels like s/he is indulging the author just by reading it. There is nothing here that has not been said before and far, far better. But since the author died relatively shortly after writing this, and because he is something of a literary celebrity, we feel compelled to read this as if it were art.

Turns out, not much. Most of the songs are typical Beatles-inspired jangle and quite tuneful, but are bogged down by long-winded arrangements. These could be great pop songs, but Bennett and Burch seem to think that they should go on forever. It's also disappointing to hear such a poorly produced album, given Bennett's credentials as a \\"Noted\\" producer. Don't worry Wilco fans, Bennett's input and influence was overstated. Jeff Tweedy is the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't like this one","review":"In stark contrast to the other glowing reviews here, I have to say I just don't like this one. I purchased it because I'm a big Wilco fan and I really think Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett made a great team. Unfortunately, The Jay Bennett/Ed Burch collaboration does nothing for me. These songs are just not very good and are really uninteresting. The majority of them give you the feeling you've heard them before. In fact, Jay sings like a Elvis Costello clone (Track 3 sounds like an Elvis Costello cover band). I can't imagine recommending this over Yankee Hotel Foxtrot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ROLLING STONE REVIEW","review":"Former WILCO guitarist, Jay Bennett pairs his voice and octopus-like way with guitars and keyboards with those of Edward Burch on The Palace at 4am (Part 1).

But this record really falls flat for me. I have tried putting it aside for a week a couple of times in the hope that the light will turn on if I let it rest for a while but it hasn't grown on me. It's just too studied and precious. The melodies are a bit tired and do not deserve the self-reverent production and cloying vocals. Drinking on Your Dime particularly annoys. A kitchen-sink of shop-worn melodies cobbled together with an annoying retro-mellotron."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't Wilco...but that's good!","review":"I suppose it's natural for the breakup of a band (or one musician's removal as was the case with Jay Bennett being forced to leave Wilco) to cause fans to take sides and proclaim one side the victor. This happened when Uncle Tupelo broke up and people took sides either with Jay Farrar or Jeff Tweedy. Personally, I couldn't care. They are both stellar musicians and I've enjoyed their respective work over the past several years.This album by Jay Bennett is surprisingly good and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Son Volt/Jay Farrar, Wilco, Ryan Adams, or any other singer-songwriter who sings with passion. No, it's not Wilco, but for that I'm thankful. If he had left the band and tried only to repeat what Wilco was doing, he would be bashed left and right. Give the man some props for doing his own thing and enjoy it for what it is...Great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinking On Your Dime","review":"I purchased this disc mainly for the song \\"Drinking On Your Dime\\" which i heard in a movie which I do not recall the name of.

The song mentioned however is worth the price of the disc, great tune."},{"rating":"1","title":"emphasis on \\"party\\"","review":"24 Hour Party People is basically about one man (a news reporter) who walks around Manchester England and explains the significance of the punk movement from the 70's with such groundbreaking artists as the Sex Pistols, Joy Division, New Order and several others. The problem is that everything is a big party scene and nothing else.You have a man cheating on his wife, the wife cheating on him, back alley parties in vans, admiring and getting inside scoops on certain bands, getting a general idea what the people around Manchester are like, and that about covers it.Unfortunately nothing ever particularly compelling or memorable occurs so a film like this is probably only worthwhile to those who are *heavily* interested in the early days of the punk movement. If you're expecting a satisfying drama or comedy, you might wanna look elsewhere. Only the short concert footage snippets are worth your time. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"relive the glorious past","review":"This film is part comedy, part documentary, and is very entertaining. I've certainly been spinning the old Joy Division records in the week since I've seen it! 24HPP may be the first feature film to include a reference to its own future status as a dvd. In fact, it's the self-referential nature that makes the film so fun--Coogan's performance as Wilson is quite brilliant.Maybe not the greatest film ever made, but a better film about the very influential Manchester music scene that I'd have thought possible. More proof of the superiority of the Northern English punk bands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting.","review":"Im definiatly not the most qualified person to write this review partially because I am of a much later generation than this music. I know nothing about the band joy division. And I still beleive that they are not punk. Sounded like new wave to me in the movie. Anyways, the movie itself was filmed in such a way it appeared to be a documentary not an acted film to me. Tony Wilsons dialogue was very interesting and thought provoking. It was also interesting to watch these people go through their lives.

It is so boring, that one not only begins to hate British, because they are portrayed as chain smoking, cussing, prostitute visiting, sobs who do nothing but say the F word and sit on the cold sidewalk. The film was supposed to be about the Factory record label which signed up one of the best bands of all time, Joy Division but as the actors are so terrible, all we get is the Ian Curtis look alike who does nothing but prance around the stage all day pretending to look cool.

Maybe it's my own fault, but I was expecting something more like \\"Groove\\", or at least something interesting to watch. And it's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands, I often listen to Joy Division/New Order/Happy Mondays, and more from that scene. However, this seemed much more like the story of Tony Wilson and The Factory, than it did about the music, and almost came-off as a documentary. I almost stopped watching it out of boredom, but saw it through anyway.

This movie fits that description. Unfortunately, it was so boring and/or cheesy, that no one in my family wanted to see it. The story line was OK, but predictable; the villains were melodramatically over-villainous; the couple kissed or held hands every time they got together to remind us this was a fairy-tale romance; and some of the scenery was obviously low budget.

It could have been quite a bit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Vic","review":"Dissapointing, I loved the first with Julia Styles and Luke Mably but, none of the lead actors in this movie seem to be fitting into their characters. Zorin for one does not do, this actor has no idea where he fits in the picture, not even talking about Scott. If a series such as this is planned by the producers they should make sure that all the lead actors are available throughout to ensure proper continuity. Kam Heskin and Chris Geere does just not cut it. There seem to be a certain rythm in their playing the characters of Paige and Eddie that is absent. The acting of all the characters is very amateuristic and does not comply with the rythm and flow of the Prince and Me. If you have not seen the first Prince and Me maybe this one could go down as a good stand alone but, if you want it on your shelve for future viewing I would not recommend buying it.

The first was corny and improbable but had a certain escapist charm owing to the lead actors, Julia Stiles and Luke Mably. Number two was a hoot; so stupid it left one gasping for air. Number three has arrived and is giving its immediate predecessor a run for it's money. The main characters have now both been replaced, which is merciful for the reputations of the original cast members; the performances of the new 'royal couple' should give hope to amateur thespians everywhere but those two should seriously contemplate working at the local mall.

I actually wore out several copies of the album before it was available on cd. Anyway, this new cd has much better sound quality than the original Best of Blondie. The opening drumbeat on Dreaming is a prime example. On the original cd it sounds rather distant and anemic. On this Greatest Hits cd it sounds like the drums are in the same room with you. The selection of songs is diverse enough that there's bound to be something on the cd for everybody. Some of the songs such as The Hardest Part and Rapture sound dated but most of songs would still be hits if they were released today. My favorite song is Heart of Glass.

Right now, a few ladies and I are using this book in our study group because Mrs. Birds's book is very easy to understand and the projects are not difficult. I love your book! Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not root","review":"This book is not really root as practiced in the south. Dont get me wrong, there are some things presented here but this is really more of the authors perspective on rootwork. Its not the worst available on the market but it is deffinently new age and toned down from true root. There are many out there who will tell you that root is not uniform and that completely true, its hardly uniform anywhere, there are differences and sometimes complete opposites in how root is done. The differences are not really my issue with this book. The main reason Im not a fan of this book is the seemingly softening and watering down of hoodoo given here. Its almost as if the author is caught between wanting to write about root and writing about a new age version of root."},{"rating":"2","title":"The power of Hoodoo","review":"\\"Sticks, Stones, Roots, and Bones\\" is a fabulous insight into the workings of the magick of Hoodoo. This book guides you through the elements of War, Love, Fertility, and Prosperity as seen by the hoodooist, and offers practical information on making your own mojo's and washes.Hoodoo, not to be confused with Vodou (also spelled Voodoo and Vodoun) is a system of magick that was birthed out of folk magick practices, especially from those of the slaves brought from Africa, but became a collection of various folk magick practices and rootwork.I recommend this book for anyone who wishes to look into African American spirituality, Santeria, or Vodou. Just remember that she (the author) is only one opinion, and that there are various other books out there as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Positive Resource","review":"I enjoy this book immensley.

Great book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoodoo for Suburbanites","review":"Really now. Do we have to associate everything with the four elements? Do we have to constantly refer to deities and energies and chi and every other chunk of cheese from the word salad of new-age nonsense? This book is capitalizing on the increasing popularity of Hoodoo and packaging it up nice and neat for an audience of the most irritating global-spiritual-buffet-practice neo-pagans and neo-wiccans. When I purchased this book, I was hoping to find insights into Hoodoo practice; instead I got heaps of lore about practices Hoodoo does not use, nonsense about the amount of chi in some plants, a huge pepperings of \\"Blessed Be\\"s and a ridiculous invocation to Ra!Utter nonsense. I understand that Hoodoo is eclectic, but let's not scrape from the bottom of the barrel for stuff to add to the practice. That is what this book does. Toss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"I have to agree with those who wrote in saying that this is a work of nonsense. It is typical that Llywellyn would publish a book like this, and it smacks of the \\"fluffy bunny\\" style of most every other Llywellyn book. In keeping with the same tradition of Ray Malbrough's epic failure, \\"Hoodoo Mysteries\\" this book by Bird is just another waste of paper. If you are looking for books on the subject of Hoodoo and Rootwork, read Cat Yronwode's excellent book, Jim Haskin's work, and the Hyatt materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as bad as Hoodoo Mysteries","review":"The caption for my review about sais it all. This is yet another \\"new age\\" fluff bunny attempt at sterilizing a tried and true folk practice into some modern hip thing for anyone to go to Barnes and Noble to pick up. If you are looking for an authentic guide to african american conjure, I reccomend Mules and Men by Zora Nele Hurston and Hoodoo Herb and Root Magic by Cat Yronwode. If you want to still use this book too I suppose it would make a good substitute for toilet paper or perhaps kindling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhhh","review":"Might just as well lump this one in with \\"hoodoo mysteries\\" by ray malbrough.

The story is bland and gets derailed by pointless filler moments. The writing is forgettable. The acting is not great but pretty good. It's a crossover that was a victim of bad timing meaning this movie should have been made at the height of both shows popularity back in the 1960's not in 1987 the time when both shows were long gone by then.

He had a tough first 6 weeks, allergic to proteins in my breast milk. The only thing that would soothe him enough to keep him asleep for naps has been this glider. We have gone through 2 sets of batteries so far(4 D size duracells), but he is in this for about 4 hours every day while he naps at the fastest setting with music and mobile going. It does fold up, we have transported it with us several times. The mobile comes off to make moving it easier. He is now 16 lbs and the glider moves just as well as it did when he was first born and 8 lbs. Only wish this had an ac adapter. Can not say enough good things about this glider!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for our baby","review":"Our baby has reflux and colic...she hates the boppy swing we got her, but likes this glider, it just goes back and forth instead of in an arc (like the swing does) so I think she feels more secure in it, sometimes even falls asleep in it.

We paid less than this for it though...around $50"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"I checked this book out at my local library and loved it so much I have ordered it. I am new to juicing and didn't know where to start. I looked at some other books and they seemed more complex. This book has very good juice recipes with things I can easily find. I think the hardest thing would be the dandelion greens for the liver cleanse but she gives other options.A previous review said many of the recipes were similar to the Juiceman recipes; Calbom states in her book that she helped write a recipe book for Juiceman. I guess that is why they are the same. It is filled with lots of information on what vegetables or fruits to use for different ailments. The recipes are simple and taste good. She tells you how often to fast and how to gradually come out of it. I have not tried any of her other books but this one is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment...","review":"I was actually quite disappointed in this book, as I'm looking to get into doing my own juicing.

Their history has been written down in an immensely enjoyable book called wolves by Candace Savage. In the book, Savage suggests many plausable reasons why man has always feared the wolf, reveals the routine habits of wolves, and tell the general lifestyle of a pack of wolves. Additionally, dozens of amazinly close-up photos of wolves in their natural habitat help support what Savage is saying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best new band on the scene","review":"Sysyem Noise brings a new fresh sound onto the music scene by pushing the envelope that is reminiscent of past rock and jazz groups that weren't afraid to experiment with sound and rythym that transcends all the other sound alike bands that are out there today. The band is super tight and fronted by vocalist Sarah Mucho who has to be heard to be believed. If you like your music fresh and truly alternative you need to check this band out. I hope that their talent will be deservedly recognized. Do yourself a favor and listen to this group of musicians who unselfishly interplay off of each other to weave a tapestry of sound that soars.

This is a book for experienced cribbage players who are looking to improve their game. The book focuses almost entirely on how to peg more points. I thought it was great. I consider myself an experienced cribbage players and within a few minutes of picking up the book I learned that some of my pegging strategies were hurting my game.

It is so hard to remember all the rules but I am getting there. I thought this book would be more helpful but it sticks to one hand throughout much of the book. To be an expert I need more than different ways to score more than the same old hand. As I read the different ways to score, I was thinking I already learned that. Perhaps I am an expert already and don't know it. I did not learn anything new from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Bar Band Material","review":"Def Leppard's original songs are already a much better tribute to these artists than this recording. They've already shown that they can masterfully blend all these influences into their own powerful sound. Most of the tracks here, even in their original state, are flat-out average. My brother in law's cover band does a version of \\"No Matter What\\", just as convincingly as it's covered here. To me, most of these selections just don't do anything to showcase Def Leppard's strengths. Where is the opportunity for ripping Vivian & Phil guitar solos? Where is Rick's great bass line in \\"Rock On\\"? These are not Joe's lyrics and overall they lack his unique way of phrasing and singing them. I've listened to this disc over and over hunting for places where they shine. 20th Cen. Boy, Hell Raiser, Street Life and maybe He's Gonna Step are worth downloading. The rest should've landed on the editing room floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"stop please","review":"at this point it would be far better legacy-wise to stop this release of new stuff until they get to the point to where they can groom it like they once did in the heyday. this is weak, bordering on hhhhhhhhhhhweak.....does every album ever get 4 stars on here?? this is funny. pyro is 5 and this is 4??? yeah, right...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Empty","review":"I'll start by saying I am a fan of Def Leppard, but haven't much cared for them post-\\"Hysteria.\\" I wouldn't have even given this album a shot except for the fact there were so many good reviews. I hoped I'd be pleasantly surprised, but a cover of 70s glam by what is, theoretically at least, a metal band?Some of the track selections really intrigued me. For example, I really looked forward to a driving version of \\"Rock On.\\" Unfortunately, what you get is a flat, anesthetized version of the song, sapped of all life. The band's attempts to cover Bowie and ELO also fall completely flat.Not all of the tracks are bad, \\"Hangin' On the Telephone\\" is a lot of fun, and \\"No Matter What\\" is a faithful, if uninventive cover. \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" is also an ok track.Overall I'd say pick and choose a few of the tunes you want and download them, but avoid the entire album. For me, this seems like yet another nail in DefLep's prematurely closed coffin. And that cover? Ugh...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ummm... I'm sorta embar... uhh... Damn this Rocks!","review":"Well I was an original Lep fan. Listened to them back in the 80's. Yeah loved Pyromania. But I kinda fell off their wagon about 15 years ago. Last thing I bought was Hysteria.I saw them on Craig Ferguson a couple months back. Thought the concept of the album was cool. What the heck, I'll get it.This album is great! The selection of tracks is wonderful. A fine collection of things rocking, melodies, guitar licks, great vocals (with a special nod to Phil) and the boys clearly love the songs. These guys are playing their guts out.Impressed as hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Deffer","review":"Def Leppard put a lot of feeling into this cd. You can hear their fondness for the music covered and their performances are some of the best ever. Some covers are better than others. My favorites are \\"Hangin' on the telephone\\", \\"Stay with Me\\" , and that Overture originally recorded by ELO. Remake albums are good if they're recorded with a true respect for the music..Def has given these classics a 21 gun (guitar?) salute..add it to your shopping cart now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh NO not another cover disc","review":"Let me start with saying that I really don't like cover albums and although I like def leppard, I am not a hugh fan. What made me buy this cd was I saw the video for No Matter What, I loved Badfinger and feel that no one has ever done them justice. Def did a great job on it. I also really enjoyed the fact that they choose many of the near hits and not the biggies! Waterloo Sunset is just magnificent, doing Ray Davies proud. Golden Age of R and R is just as much fun as the original Mott versian and Stay with Me is just wonderful. If you close your eyes, you can picture a drunk Rod and Ron dishing it out! My only dissapointments are Hanging on the Telephone and He's Gonna Step on You again. Hanging sounds weak and He's Gonna Step On you again is a little obscure even for me. This is a really enjoyable disc for anyone who grew up with this stuff. Even my 15 year old son enjoys it( and he hates anything I grew up on)."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"this is a new twist on def leppard. i have always been a fan of their music, and listening to these older tunes from the 70's in which they were influenced was cool. i'm not sure if they should have done blondie's HANGING ON THE TELEPHONE though, i was scratching my head on that one, but otherwise i was highly entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Def Leppard CD","review":"If you grew up listening to Def Leppard or recetiently got into Def Leppard, an absolut must for all fans.All the songs are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS AWESOME!","review":"Def Leppard is the greatest band in the world, this cd is a great addition to anybody's collection.

It's like they have lost most of there music writing ability. I think they need to go back to the drawing board and dig deep into there feelings to come up with a new sound.

Spread the word.I bought this watch and it ran fine for 8 months in Denver, near the WWVB transmitter in Ft. Collins. Then I went to California. When I attempted to set it to the new time zone, it went bonkers. It could not recieve WWVB, and the manual settings did not work. In fact, the watch did not work as the manual said it should. I thought I might replace the battery, but there is no way to get the back off. I'm an engineer,and this was very frustrating.I spent a week adding three hours and subtracting 22 minutes to figure out what time it was. As I was leaving to return to Denver, the crystal cracked. When I got home I threw it in the trash and ordered a LaCross WT-967, a model in a line of watches that I have used worldwide without difficulty for many years. Not quite as pretty, but they work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read","review":"I purchased this to replace another E.Howard Atomic Watch. My husband loves it because the larger numbers are easier to read, it keeps accurate time and is comfortable.He loved the old one, until the battery died. Then we couldn't reset it. We followed the instructions, but it didn't reset to the correct time. He went back to a \\"regular\\" wristwatch and was very unhappy and missed the accuracy of the atomic watch.So I ordered him this newer model, which I couldn't set either. After 3 days it went back to a different time zone (Eastern). I called Amazon.com customer service. They ordered a new watch to be sent and asked me to return it, postage paid.There were no problems setting the replacement. He loves it. It keeps accurate time and the leather band is comfortable. The next time we need to replace the battery, I will take the instruction book to the jeweler along with the watch. My husband will always wear one of these atomic watches, we hope this is the last one we buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seconds are dead on, check the minutes.","review":"I love this watch but can only give it four stars. It receives the WWVB signal every two or three days in Maine, so the seconds are dead accurate, but it once lost seven minutes. I was able reset it and it has not gone off since. I find this extremely careful tracking of seconds along with careless loss of minutes somewhat endearing - it reminds me of some of my own misplaced priorities.The size and clarity of the display are also good for my tired aging eyes, like a kitchen clock with a strap. The watch it replaced had a plethora of little dials trying to tell me things I don't need to know and I had to find my best reading glasses and stare at it in good light just to tell the time.So this \\"atomic\\" watch is my favorite among a drawer full of time keepers, but I check the minutes every now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"First failure: Restaining strap came apart.

A friend told me I was wrong when we compared time. I have an atomic clock and a comparison showed the watch is a minute behind. I checked on the Atom Time program on the computer and the watch is exactly a minute behind. To boot, the watch comes with a meaningless nice wood case to store it in. Why I would want to store a watch in a wood case instead of wearing it to tell time, the purpose for which I bought the watch, is beyond my understanding. And, if you are still thinking of buying the watch, the wrist band is just big enough to get around my wrist although I am medium build and only 5ft. 9in. At least the watch is consistent and so it is too big of a hassle to return the darn thing. Besides, hopefully it is one of a kind if the company quality control is any good - which is doubtful by my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I was given this watch as a gift in November of 2006.

When I received the watch, the problem was fixed for about 2 or 3 weeks then it went back to being 5 minutes slow again.

That's why I believe that this show is so disappointing in the first place. Since she was a pioneer of the type of TV musical special in which only the star performs (as opposed to the star and \\"a whole host of musical guests,\\") that's what we were looking for. This was such a departure from that format that it was a bit jarring.In the second place, it might have been saved had the entertainment been more ... entertaining. The music wasn't great, the comedy wasn't very funny, the drama wasn't poignant. Although the show might have been a faithful recreation of a real vaudeville show, I think it served more as an example of why vaudeville died."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST PLAIN AWFUL","review":"WHY BABS WOULD RELEASE THIS AS A SINGLE SINCE IT WAS IN HER RECENT BOX SET IS A SURPRISE BECAUSE ITS A GIGANTIC FLOP DESTINED TO THE .99 CENT BOX IN THE SUPERMARKET.IT REALLY IS DREADFUL UNLESS YOUR AN IDIOT WITH BAD TASTE.INSTEAD, GET MY NAME IS BABS, COLOR ME BABS, AND BABS IN CENTRAL PARK IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED NON-STOP BY AN ORIGINAL AMERICAN GENIUS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas classic that you're never too old for","review":"I have loved A Flinstone Christmas ever since I was a little girl.

Tenner's books remind me of Henry Petroski's books in a way -- engaging nonfiction. The most fascinating thing about Tenner's book is his description of the interplay between technology and technique: how humans evolve along with our technology to get maximum utility out of our inventions. There are numerous stories about how an advancement in technology wasn't used to its potential (or was even able to match the performance of the old technology) until humans' techniques changed as well. There are also some interesting sections about how/why \\"improvements\\" never took root (piano keyboards and typewriter keyboards, notably).

I have long naturally wavy brown hair and was expecting better results from this flat iron that the usual ones you can pick up for about $20 at a department store. Instead, my hair was limp and lacked shine, even when accompanying the use of the iron with some hair smoothing milk. The flat iron failed to straighten some areas of my hair; there were kinks left even after using the iron for 20 minutes. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really is worth the money!","review":"I purchased this flat iron because I'm tired of spending money to get my hair done at the salon on a regular basis. I was sketpical of buying it, but figured if it didn't work I could return it. I am African-American and I have very thick, curly, long, relaxed hair. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. My hair came out great! It was thicker and a little less straight than if my stylist did it, but MUCH MUCH better than when I'd done it in the past. It won't replace my stylist unfortunately, but it will make my visits less frequent!If you have ethnic hair this will definitely work for you. I think the only reason I'm not speaking more praises of the flat iron is because my hair is honestly some of the thickest and hardest to manage that you'll ever see. Even people at the salon say so! So, I'm sure you'll be more than satisfied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.","review":"Naturally, my hair is very frizzy and poofy. Not so much curly, but wavy and as if every hair is going in a different direction. My previous flat irons were a Hot Tools one and a Bed Head. Using those it took me about an hour to straighten my hair. It was so annoying if I ever had to go somewhere in a hurry after work because I literally needed about 2 to 3 hours to do my hair (with washing and drying it).. so I bought this Sedu. I was AMAZED the first day I got it.. I was able to shower, blow dry, and straighten my hair all in under one hour.Another great thing about this flat iron, is it keeps my hair straight all day long. With my old flat irons, my hair would be straight when I was finished, but within an hour or so it started to get poofy again. And if it was humid or muggy outside... my hair was DONE for.

My hair was not \\"softer, silkier, or smoother than ever!\\".

We both have strong, coarse, thick hair and mine is frizzy, too. I was persuaded to spend the money because of the excellent reviews on the Folica website. I have not been disappointed. I use mine heavily, nearly every day. It heats quickly and works wonders on my hair. After washing I let my hair dry naturally as long as possible and finish drying with a blow dryer. Then I go to work with the Sedu on a section at a time starting with the bottom layers. It takes me about 20 minutes because I have so much hair! Subsequent days in between washings only take about 5 minutes to touch up. My hair is smooth and silky and not frizzy at all. I live in Florida so I have to deal with the humidity, too.
