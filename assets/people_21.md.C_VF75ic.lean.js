Mariah had finally experimented more with r&b and hip hop, but kept her classic original signature sound too. The melodies are enchanting and the music is a timeless classic and very soothing. This is the album that can truly appeal to a young audience as well as entertain the older folks, the music on this CD is universal. This CD, mary j blige's share my world and janet's velvet rope are the best CD's of 1997."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad follow-up...","review":"This album is a bad follow-up to \\"Daydream,\\" probably her best album to date.

The only difficulty that I have is that no one seems to be able to hear the effects of all these vocal pyrotechnics on her voice. She has taken a gift and completely destroyed it. IF she ever had seven octaves (a piano covers 7 and a half), I would be surprised to learn that she is functioning with anything more than three right now. My advice is to get rid of some of the rollercoaster and opt instead for some smoother sailing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS IF I COULD.

She always packs alot of decent songs among the few big hits from an album. Not so with \\"Butterfly\\". Not only do we get the new sexier Mariah here, but we get an album that's pretty much filler-free. \\"Honey\\" is as irresistable today as it was in 1997. \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"My All\\" are both wonderful and lyrically deep. I love \\"Fourth Of July\\", and I really love \\"Breakdown\\". Both are so good. Mariah also drops the expected cover, but this one is tops, and \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" truly is beautiful. The \\"Rainbow\\" album is similar to this, and I like it as well, but there's just no beating the music here, and of course Mariahs cover shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah Turns 5th Sparkler in a Row...","review":"For years I thought that no one could touch Whitney Houston or Madonna as the best female musical artist of our time, but I think that Mariah has finally taken over the crown that she seemed destined to wear when she burst upon the scene in the late 80s with her self-titled debut album. Well, 5 albums later, she appears invincible. Every song on BUTTERFLY is either well-constructed pop/R&B or well-conditioned enough for Mariah to propel its mediocrity with her amazing voice. Her voice is so versatile that she makes such unique songs like \\"Breakdown\\", \\"Babydoll\\", and the \\"The Roof\\" work wonderfully. \\"Honey\\" still remains my favorite song because it bounces with a great rhythm. Of course, I cannot forget Mariah and her ballads. Pick any of these: \\"Butterfly\\", \\"Fourth of July\\", \\"My All\\", \\"Outside\\" and you have a winner. I hope Mariah can keep delivering brilliance like this because another diva-Celine Dion-is hot on her tale to take the crown from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah's the best singer of the decade.","review":"I've always been a huge Mariah Carey fan ever since her coming-out year of 1990.

It doesn't work.

It seems like she just faids away every now and then and returns to the same old drum beat, background chatter and scale crawling exercises (junk that people who can't really sing try to do!). There is no variety in the pace, no difference in the music, and no real quality in the songs. Really dissapointed in this one. Maraih, whoever told you that this was good music and that you should sing like this --- FIRE THEM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply dreadful","review":"Overproduced in spades by that overpaid Puffy guy.

Aside from the title track and Honey this album is incredibly dull. Mariah tries to mix in some R&B and hip hop but doesn't deliver anything edgy. Her mindless fans may enjoy this nonsense but casual listeners should stay away. Mariah continues to recycle the same kind of songs over and over again-a good example is her new single heartbreaker. She never takes any artistic adventures or records any edgy or controversially themed songs. Pop Music lovers with an ear for creativity and a sense of adventure should stick with Madonna and Janet. Mariah may have more number 1's then them but their songs have a lot more depth, heart and intelligence then her's ever will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear!!!","review":"After hearing the delightful \\"Honey\\" I figured Ms. Carey had finally decided to brave new frontier so I bought the cd.

The rest of the cd is pure dribble in true Mariah Carey fashion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh!!!","review":"this album was a terrible dissapointment!!!!!!! i liked daydream, so i thought this might be good, but it was boring, and she had to many songs that she sang with rap singers, if i could i'd give this zero stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Cd ever!","review":"I think that \\"Butterfly\\" from Mariah Carey was the most boring, factory-made CD ever.

Reading over the other reviews, I can't believe how many people enjoy whiny, girlie music. This woman has NO TALENT and is only where she is because of her ability to hook up with powerful MEN in high positions (Tommy Mottola, Puff Daddy, etc.) I don't really know where Derek Jeter fit in. Anyway, the music, if you can call it that, is like noise pollution. Absolutely wretched.

She sheds her sweet, innocent sound for a rougher sound. Unfortunately, she changes too much. Her album is TOO rough. Yes, she may have needed a change, but adding too much roughness can be a little bit...well, too much. Mariah has a wonderful voice, but on this album, she strains it too much. The good songs are Butterfly, Honey, and My All. Unfortunately, this album isn't worth the price I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH!!!!!!!! YACK!!!!!!!!!

Now c'mon, Mariah could've done a lot better of than this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Mariah","review":"While Mariah's Music Box will probably go down as her classic album (and rightly so), Butterfly reveals the depth and versatility which Mariah can aspire to with success. Butterfly, her emancipation album from her failed marriage to Tommy Mottola is a pained but smooth soul/r'n'b/hiphop affair.The album's title track steals the show with its soaring chorus and aching lyrics of release, while Whenever You Call continues the refrain of being with a loved one who is no linger there. Prince collaboration Beautiful Ones is sexy & Honey drips sex appeal. The Roof and Breakdown show La Mariah has cred & the gorgeous No1 My All is worth buying the album for alone, where Msriah wishes for the return of a lost love. The album is very much themed about loss, but Mariah finds, upon singing so, true identity and solace in a musical package which is breathtaking, consistent & a joy for any music listenr if they like opo/soul/r'n'b/dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insanely Awful","review":"This \\"Butterfly\\" set is confusingly monotone, yet unfocused. Her crumbling musical prowess is thinly spread, with each dance number sounding like the one before. Carey's \\"Fourth of July\\" sounds like an elevator tune, while \\"Honey\\" is an embarassing hip-hop number that pales to the likes of Lauryn Hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Heart","review":"Mariah Carey's Butterfly may have a couple of catchy tunes such as \\"My All,\\" but overall, the album lacks heart and soul. Throughout this set, Carey sings without meaning. Sometimes her notes hit above the stratosphere without reason or feeling -- it often appears as if Carey does not know why she sings. Carey is disconnected, lacking artistic rapport. Also, Carey's lifted lyrics (we all know Carey is the cover queen) and vocals are less than stellar and often end up sounding weak. Her title track, \\"Butterfly\\" sounds unconvincing and thin. The rest of the album are fillers, mindless tracks that are neither infectious or cute. \\"Honey\\" is an out of shape dance track, while her rendition of \\"Whenever You Call\\" tries to recapture the magic of \\"Music Box,\\" but fails... miserably.Many credible music critics still have yet to accept Mariah Carey as a true artist; let's just say this album won't make them change their minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butterfly should turn back into a catapiller","review":"If you think this is the best album, you must be nuts.We all know that Mariah has an excellent voice which is demonstrated in Emotions and DayDREAM, but lately, mariah has gone stupied in her voice and these days sounds crap. If you have seen recently in the MTV awards, tv shows, and divas live Video, you will realise that for the first time after her break up with Tommy, her voice is often out of tune and not sounding well. Why don't you take a listen to the new concerts and compare it to the eary videos she made from 1990-1995.You will see what i've been talking about.Carey used to be respectable and a real lady while all along she wanted to be Nasty Madonna. I have no respect for her any more and would not care if her next album flops. If you want real singing, collect her early albums and also Celine dion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Torture Already","review":"This album was not my favourite at all. I use to like Mariah Carey until she started getting all into rap.... It's a waist of time. She isn't what I would call a \\"Diva.\\" Please, I don't want to put up with her annoying, squeaky, high pitched voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more flavasome side to Mariah","review":"The album is very good, but don't get it if you're hoping for more of Mariah's older stuff- this one's very different, it has much more of a rap feel to it, and 'Honey', 'The Roof', 'Breakdown' and 'Babydoll' are the ones that show this most.'The Beautiful Ones' was a let down, but 'Whenever You Call', 'Butterfly' and 'My All' prove that Mariah is still very much the talented diva she always was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad...but Janet is still better!","review":"Breakdown...Honey....My All...good songs, but Mariah get played out too fast!

Butterfly marked a watershed in the career of Mariah; a fusion of urban beats and soulful ballads which continued the direction she had started to take in Daydream with 'Fantasy' and wanted to follow up musically. Those only familiar with mariahs higger register will be suprised to find this albulm is a study in vocal restraint; the vocals croon over slick beats and meander with the music to create sublime songs delivered with passion and heartfelt honesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying Towards Creative Freedom","review":"What a landmark album in music. Mariah has freed herself from the ties that bind. Way to go Mariah. And the music tells the story. Butterfly was a completely underated music event in Mariah's career. Some were threatened by her new sexy image. Some were threatened by her love of hiphop music. Some were just pure haters. Mariah truly blossomed into women hood on this 1997 album. She revealed a more personal and real side of her personality that was being held back for purposes well known. Job well done........."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTED TALENT..","review":"THis girl is very badly produced, she could be much better if people didn't tell her to scream instead of singing.

But than again...can she fail? I strongly recomend the songs \\"Butterfly\\", \\"My all\\", \\"Fourth of July\\", \\"Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)\\" and her Def Club Mix of \\"Honey\\". It isn't as good as her \\"Music Box\\" album, but if you already have that, buy the Butterfly album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah keeps it coming","review":"I've always been a fan of Mariah.

Mariah Carey's voice is raspy and thin, and her songs aren't very influential. Some songs, for example, \\"Honey\\", have pathetic rapping in them saying stupid things like, \\"Mariah on fire.\\" Her recent CDs were much better, because she had a stronger, more powerful voice instead of the sore throat one she has on this CD.

I used to enjoy her lovely voice and beautiful ballads, but now she had turned into somewhat of a skeezer. Does she think that this new type of so-called music gives her credibility? She already had that. Now she just makes the crap du jour, and looks like a tramp on top of it. It's a shame that someone who was such a role model with songs like \\"Hero\\" has turned so trashy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah at her best","review":"Butterfly, in my opinion, is Mariah Carey's best album. Mariah Carey herself even thinks that it is, calling it her magnum opus (which means \\"great work\\" in English).

The dreamy \\"Fourth Of July\\", sexy \\"The Beautiful Ones\\", thoughtful \\"Close My Eyes\\" and powerful \\"The Roof\\" are some of my favorite tracks here.Sensual, sexy and very R&B; with little pop, Mariah's 1997 disc is solid. Look toDaydreamandThe Emancipation of Mimifor more enjoyable efforts overall. This is my second time reviewing this disc but this is just a quick run through.

Mariah grabbed my interest first in 1995 with Daydream and when I bought Butterfly, I was AMAZED. It turned me into the hardcore Mariah fan I am today. The album is filled with eye popping uptempos and ballads that will make you cry. The songs will take you on an emotional rollercoaster and I cannot wait for Mariah's next project 'Glitter' since Mariah said 'Glitter' might even be rivalling 'Butterfly' for her best album she's ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"An MC Classic","review":"Butterfly is definately the best album MC has ever put out.

The songs on here are just so pure and beautiful and from the heart and it is hard to believe that there are brainless people on this planet who thinks she can't sing. I mean come on people, she has one of the best voices in this universe and there is no denying that she is a beautiful woman who has enjoyed more success than most artist ever will. A lot of the songs on this album were written or co-written by her which just goes to show she is not only a talented singer but a songwriter as well. This album truly deserves a 5 star and if you like any of Mariah's other albums, then you'll love this one. I strongly recommend this album to everyone and if you are not a Mariah fan, you will be after listening to Butterfly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth as Honey....","review":"To think i bought this album over 5 years ago, and I still find it beautiful each time i hear it. Mariah probably has one of the most beautiful, impressive voices I have ever heard. Butterfly is my favorite Mariah Carey Album though, because it has some of the most inspiring, soulful, and heartfelt tracks you could ever ask for. \\"My all,\\" she sings her heart out on, and her voice just goes right through you. \\"Butterfly\\" is very R&B but completly inspiring. My favorite tune on here thoug would have to be \\"Close My Eyes,\\" which really gets inside your emotions. \\"I still feel like a child when I look at the moon, maybe I grew up a little too soon. Mariah also writes her own songs, and I have to give her credit for that. What this cd offers for you is heartful, soulful, heartpouring emotional tracks. Along with funky, dance r&b hits. This cd was definetly one of the best from the 90's, and is a classic pop album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Giant Step Backwards","review":"After watching American Idol tonight, and watching and hearing Mariah's newest release - a truly moving number - I'm ready to get back in her corner. It's been awhile.As a huge Mariah Carey fan, I had always bought all of her albums, But this album, Butterfly, turned me off so much it took a long time to overome it. The opening song, Honey, was so bad, and the video so suggestive and vulgar,that I was turned off for years, and haven't bought a Mariah album since.I know that wasn't fair - though not unlike the downturn another favorite, Olivia Newton-John took for several albums. But she has matured in recent years, and is again one of my favorites. So maybe the Mariah I missed is back. I still cannot recommend this album - I believe it is by far one of her worst.But Mariah is still an incredible talent, and \\"Bye Bye\\" is so good, I may give \\"Butterfly another chance!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cacsa","review":"Rank Male name Female name1 Jacob Emily2 Michael Emma3 Joshua Madison4 Matthew Olivia5 Ethan Hannah6 Andrew Abigail7 Daniel Isabella8 William Ashley9 Joseph Samantha10 Christopher Elizabeth"},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKS!","review":"This album is a real stinker, there's not really much singing on it, just her humming a lot of nothing (but then,she's a no-talent anyway)...a waste of money, wish I hadn't bought, will be selling--any takers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Size Misunderstood","review":"I was looking for a full size croquet set that could be played indoors.

Not only was it not who i thought it was, it sounds like poorly written wanna be Bone Thugs to me(I might not be the best judge, but thats my take on it). Then I started wondering why this guy calls himself \\"Elemint\\", I mean I get why Elemint calls himself that(a play on the word \\"mint\\", because he is FRESH, hence the full name Elemint B. Fresh)but after listening to this track I am pretty sure that this guy just spelled element wrong. Maybe I wouldnt have thought it was so bad if I hadn't expected someone else, but at the end of the day I have to say I was upset with my purchase. In short, don't buy this song, go download Born Fresh, it's free and actually well done!

There was no way I, myself could fix it--there's no lint jamming it, and there is no ball to check and see if it's secure. The layout of the mouse was OK-I liked the additional buttons. It is specifically designed for a right handed user as you can see. I thought I needed a new mousepad. And I got one. It continued to be jumpy just before it died.

Sadly, they haven't held up over time. While I haven't had students complain about some of the other criticism mentioned in these reviews (too big, too many easily clicked buttons), more than 50% of them have stopped working or only work sporadically. The problem seems to be that the wiring in the mouse \\"tail\\", at its point of connection with the mouse, breaks after extended use, rendering it pretty much useless.On the other hand, I use one on my home computer, where it gets less frequent and easier wear and haven't had a problem yet. The upshot is, if you're a heavy duty mouser, or have machines that get hard and constant use, the Intellimouse simply won't last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ball mice are finito","review":"Control with this thing is lightning quick and precise, like no other mouse I've seen -- and I've gone through a lot of the older variety.It's a bit bigger than the older Intellimouse, and the side buttons take a little getting used to. All buttons and the scroll wheel seem a lot more sensitive -- in the early going, I was sometimes clicking when I didn't mean to. But I've used this mouse to finish Half Life, and I know I'll never go back to the old technology. All in all, a superb product and well worth the cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tracking Stinks","review":"I wonder if my mouse is broken? The tracking is not good. Sometimes the pointer just jiggles on the screen and sometimes it goes whacky and goes to one corner of the screen. I found the tracking is better on a non-reflective surface, such as paper or a soft mousepad. The tracking was worse on reflective surfaces, including my hard mouse pad and tabletop. I liked the idea of never having to clean my rollers, but after forcing myself to use this mouse for hours, I ripped back off my computer. Maybe I'll return it. I spend a lot of time cleaning everyone's mice at work, but I guess I'll have to keep doing it.

Having used a Logitech wheel mouse at less than one third of the price I paid for this mouse, I was disappointed that the Web Wheel option has not been included as a choice for button assignments to the wheel button. The Web Wheel is a disc that is invoked on clicking the wheel button. It allows the user to assign five sites to five segments of the wheel, each of which can be clicked to reach its programmed site. There are five other segments in that wheel that correspond to standard functions in a Browser.The position of the small thumb button is awkward and could be accidentally pressed. Imagine somebody assigning the Close function to that button and then clicking it while reading a page or composing a mail.Buy it if you like a good grip and hate to clean mice balls.

Believe me, I am no technophile, but I do use both the keyboard and mouse a great deal in either writing or surfing the net. As a consequence, I have loved the Intellimouse in the short time I have had it. Since it operates on an optical basis, it is faster and much more flexible and convenient to use than the traditional mouse products I am accustomed to using.

BUT, the shape of the mouse makes it ackward to hold, and the switches used for the buttons are very poor quality. The buttons are flimsy and require almost no effort to click. This leads to accidental clicks on a regular basis when just moving the mouse. Further, my mouse has started to signal double-clicks when only one click of the left mouse button has occured. This problem has progressed randomly, but is now occuring with greater frequency.

Also, this is a great mouse for gamers (I use this for Half-Life all the time and it's great). You have 2 buttons on the side, 2 on top, and a spin wheel that if you push it down, it is actually a fifth button. With no cleaning necessary because of the laser light and no mouse pad necessary, this mouse just glides. When surfing the net, you can use the wheel to scroll web pages with ease.

As a gadget nut, I thought this would be a clever upgrade. While the electronics worked as well as a conventional mouse, the shape was so annoying to me that I returned it after 4 days. The problem was that the sides are so sloped that it was awkward to lift it to move it. I hadn't really payed attention to the way I use a mouse, but now I notice how often I lift it when it is at the end of the mouse pad and I need to move backwards up off the pad to get more travel in the same direction. It was just not natural to do that with the Explorer. Also, since my computer is in a sitting room just off my bedroom, the bright light was annoying at night.

Second, its tracking ability is very poor. If I try to move it in a straight line it will jiggle slightly from side to side. VERY ANNOYING! Third, and probably the worst feature is that the wheel which replaces the middle button is too sensitive to downward motion. I had it set to give a double-click but had to disable it.

Mice are really easy to use with your right hand all you lefties out there, take it from me.The optical sensor is very accurate, and the mouse slides across my desk easily. The buttons are easy to click, and easy to use.One of Microsoft's first 5-star products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, But Not Reliable","review":"I purchased an IntelliMouse Explorer in Dec. of 1999. This mouse tracks beautifully and has such a pretty red glow when in use, but there are plenty of shortcomings when it comes to this mouse. 1) This mouse it HUGE. If you have a small hand this mouse will be extremely awkward to use. 2) It can not track too fast. If you like to keep your mouse sensitivity low, it will not track properly. 3)My final quarrel: this mouse BREAKS. I have had this mouse for aprox. 8 months and I am on my third one. Microsoft warranty's this mouse with a 1 year free replacement but, who wants to wait 2-3 weeks for a replacement.Do yourself a favor, buy a mouse that last longer then a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversized Mouse = Clumsy Use","review":"My hands are huge and I think this mouse is way too big. The design raises your palm to high for commanding use. The optical eye is great just like a normal mouse, but it can't be raised off a surface at all. A rolling ball mouse still tracks and spins when lifted off its surface--not good for gaming. I think the design had this problem in mind, so there are no edges and the base is wider. I think Microsoft knows this so they have made a smaller one with optical eye so get that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did Microsoft really build a better mousetrap?","review":"Here are a few quick reasons to purchase this mouse: 1) No cleaning of the ball and rollers. 2) 4 Buttons provide little reason to move the mouse to move back and forth when web surfing. 3) Excellent ergonomics. 4) No need for a mouse pad. 5) Intellimouse software is easy to configure and adds important extras. 6) Included USB Support will allow you to use the mouse when the PS/2 port diappears from future computer platforms. 7) Dark grey cord and mouse body helps to keep things looking clean. 8) Scroll button allows for double clicking as well as scrolling long web pages and other long documents and spreadsheets. 9) The red glow eminating from the underside of the mouse will impress all who view it. 10) Macintosh support allows you to use the mouse in a \\"mixed PC/Mac environment\\". There is no comparison. This is the best mouse available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this mouse!","review":"Within a week of using this mouse my hand was hurting. The longer shape is nowhere near as comfortable as the previous Microsoft mouse. The extra two buttons are nice but aren't in the best positions. I would recommend going with the other version of this mouse with the standard shape. I wound up having to take the cover off of my mouse to be able to use it. The laser works great though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This is an ok mouse if you do very light mouse work, it's nice as a novelty item and an \\"wow look at that no mouseball\\" item but if you use your mouse hard or quickly forget about this! I play games and do a lot of graphics work on my computer and noticed that the mouse would lose it's plcae on the screen if i moved my mouse at any speed above normal, even at normal speed the mouse has a tendency to leap of in odd directions, which is very annoying when you do precise graphics work. I tried about 15 different surfaces and even tried both the USb and ps/2 interfaces both yielded the same results. Unless something was wrong with my mouse i recommend you steer clear of this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, love it, love it!","review":"Guess I can't agree with the review from the magazine printed here. The mouse is certainly not over featured. I am left handed and am buying a second Intellimouse because it has been one of the only truely comfortable mice I've used.The extra two buttons are precisely where you need them and where they can be used the easiest. Sure, if you've used a three button mouse forever and change over to this five button model it is a different feeling that takes a few days to get used to.This mouse makes for the fastest Internet navigation I've ever experienced. Built very tough. I'm buying another one in black to go with a new PC and moving the vanilla one to my sons computer. Just can't find it in black here.I'd buy another one in a heartbeat. Uh, I guess I am buying another one at the moment. See?"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE! Well worth the money!","review":"I must say, I am very pleased with this mouse. I have had it for nearly a year now and I have never had any problem with it whatsoever. I have never had to clean it and I have never had to fix it. Most people say the mouse is big and bulky, however, I have really small hands and I think this mouse is more comfortable than any other mouse. I am also an avid gamer and the accuracy with this mouse is incredible. Even when you're not playing games, but you need the percision, it is great. I definately recommend this to anybody who wants to get a new mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Performance","review":"Running this artfully-crafted mouse over 7 different surfaces produced very disappointing results. On most surfaces, the mouse would only track reliably if the \\"grain\\" ran directly parallel or perpendicular to the up/down orientation. Even my existing *mousepad* performed badly. Even more surprisingly, so did plain white copier (laser printer) paper. With the mouse only slightly out of perfect up/down position on the surface, the pointer would jump and \\"jiggle\\" in 40- to 250-plus pixel areas on the screen. Roughly the same symptoms as a mouse badly in need of a cleaning.I tried this mouse for a week, and even exchanged it at the store (suspecting a defect), but was unable to get it to work reliably. Sadly, I'm now back with my old ball-and-chain.Maybe one day Microsoft will get the algorithm a bit more iron-clad (and hopefully, create a cordless version)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mouse destined to DIE","review":"It seems like Microsoft designed these mice with planned obselesence (meaning they are designed to quit working after a while so you will buy another then another then another) It should be a piece of cake to design a mouse that has no moving parts so that it lasts virtually forever... I have heard from several people about their microsoft mice quitting working and for the reason previously mentioned, I laughed at them saying that they were probably yanking the cord or something. These people had gone through 1,2, and even 3 of these mice. But then mine died... I bought a different brand optical and have been quite happy so far. Save your self A LOT of money and don't buy this mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convienient And Comfortable","review":"Microsoft Intellimouse is a great mouse possible the best out today. The price may be a tad steep but its well worth it.The mouse has 5 buttons, 2 normal buttons, a scrolling button and 2 buttons on the side. The 2 buttons on the side are for forward and back in the browser... but keep in mind that these buttons can be modified to your likeing.The Mouse is optical so no cleaning is required, neither is a mouse pad.If your a gamer like I am the 5 buttons on the mouse are great for all games.. it keeps ur hand comfortably on the mouse and gives you quick access for gameplay needs.Finally the mouse is comfortable to handle for long periods of time.

I went home to install it and had more problems with this simple mouse then I have ever had with any other external feature. First, the adapter was broken (but I have both ports, so it's not that big a deal). But.....installing was a @#($%! When I searched for new hardware, it listed ALL of my devices. It wanted me to reinstall drivers for my scanner, modem, cd-burner, printer, etc. Excuse me, but they were there from the get-go. I shouldn't be told that there are \\"new hardware devices\\" when they have always been there. I had my brother, a computer major, to help me install it, but it frustrated him also.

IT WORKS FINE WHEN SURFING THE 'NET, ALTHOUGH IT ISN'T VERY PRECISE AT ALL AND THE ACTION IS SLOW. WHEN YOU LIFT THE MOUSE OFF OF THE MOUSEPAD OR DESK, IT KEEPS TRACKING AND THIS CAN BE A REAL PAIN IN THE YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN PLAYING 3D SHOOTERS. I RETURNED THIS MOUSE AND PURCHASED A RAZOR BOOMSLANG (WHICH USES A BALL INSTEAD OF A LAZER) AND IT TRACKED MUCH BETTER AND FASTER THAN THE INTELLIEYE. DO NOT BUY THIS OVERPRICED MOUSE.

The optical tracking seems to work pretty well. However, the shape makes my mouse click finger hurt. Also it feels light and flimsy. I am a big fan of the rollerball intellimouse in terms of feel (heavier), comfort, etc. This mouse feels \\"cheap\\" I guess. Came with a computer I ordered unfortunately.

I would reccommend this mouse to everyone and anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just... not right","review":"I wanted to like this mouse, what with the cool red light, but I use a mouse all day, so comfort and accuracy are much more important, and on those scores, it really doesn't work that well. First off, some people think it is too big, but I find that I have to cramp my hand to hold it, and with sides that slope inward, there is no comfortable way to grasp it. OK you think, so I'll rest my hand on it and just slide it around. But no, if you do that, you'll find you're constantly pressing buttons (especially the right one) you never meant to. In the end, you find yourself trying to squeeze it and hovering your hand above it to avoid false clicks; all of which is very tiring. So, sadly, thumbs down from me. Back to Logitech MouseMan, which IMO is a much better \\"fit\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Bill Gates isn't so bad...nah he still","review":"I have had this mouse for over a month now and so far it is one of the greatest buys I have made for my pc. Gone are days of slow response and sticky dirty mouse balls. It is very responsive and you will not need a mouse pad ever again. No need to clean and the many buttons give you a lot of control. Just like when the track ball in the middle came out, the two web navigation buttons on this will become a MUST HAVE for all other computer mice 9if that is the right term).It is a bit big, but I have big hands, I can see some people having trouble with the size. But investing this mouse if you are tired of your slow responding mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ayurveda","review":"I was truly disappointed in this book. I bought it so that I could understand Ayurveda, but this writter discounts the true principles. He refers to Vata, Pita and Kapha as Body Types A,B and C. I think he should call it by the proper names and not try to take shortcuts. It is not a well written book on the subject. If you are interested in Ayurveda, I highly recommend Deepak Chopra's \\"Perfect Health\\". Not only does Chopra cover the topic completely, his book is inspiring. Perfect Balance is unrealistic. It recommends that people take teaspoons of spices and herbs daily. While the true way of following Ayurveda is to cook with the spices and herbs in the food. I do not recommend this book. It has some helpful information, but not enough. Why read more then one book on the subject? Deepak Chopra's book covers it all and he also has a website that offers Ayurveda products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those Die Cast Car collectors","review":"Even though I ordered this late, it arrived on Christmas Eve in perfect condition.

The title drew me in and I was excited to see what this Fyodor guy had to say about the subject. Not much, as it turned out. He seems to write ok with good sentences and proper punctuation and stuff like that, and he's probably some sort of media star in his own country, but the whole thing was a major flop. I'm guessing the author is from overseas, maybe from a country like Germany or Europe, and therefore doesn't know much about American politics, but to write a book called THE IDIOT and then not once mention George W. Bush made me really annoyed. If publishers are going to mislead their readers, then they'll soon find that educatted people stop buying books and switch on the TV.

I can tell you this for a fact - you wouldn't find Larry King pulling a stunt like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story has been changed","review":"What else can one say, the story has been altered.

Sure, if honor entails leaving one's spouse and children at the mercy of one's rapacious enemies while going off and hiding in the hilltops. Rob Roy as portrayed by Liam Neeson is a pompous, foolish humorless dolt who values the safety of his loved ones less than he does his dubious principles. Jessica Lange plays the Supportive Little Woman; her entire performance consists of saying 'How fine you are to me, Robert McGregor', and getting raped. On the bright side, Tim Roth is given the utterly enviable task of tormenting the annoying protagonists, and he does a brilliant job of it. He gets one star; the gorgeous scenery gets the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marred by unnecessary rape scene.","review":"I remember seeing this years ago and thinking it had a lot of merit, a hero who refuses to slander and pays a high price. A well made movie with great acting and beautiful music and scenery. I thought about showing this to my boys, but the other reviewers reminded me of the unwatchable, unnecessary rape scene. The filmmakers did Tim Roth a disservice by thinking this was necessary to enhance his brilliantly evil performance.

But does that mean that cunnying, intelligence, leverage, and knowledge is to be discarded? Rob Roy does everything wrong in this film from the moment he allows one man to act has his financial agent to the fact that he doesn't use his allies against those that are trying to kill him and who end up raping his wife, he acts in typical Hollywood fashion as an idiot.The film would have been quite short if he would have done the right thing from the very beginning. But, alas, we would have no film so hence the stupidity from which we are tortured.The film has some great scenery and the acting is enjoyable except for the brutal rape scene of Roy's wife. Other than the scenery and acting, there's not much to see let alone giving cause to buying the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridicuouls","review":"The film was fencing about all right, until the last sword scene. To pretend that someone can halt an expert swordsman at bay by grabbing the blade of his sword with, of all things, his bare hand, so that the attacker can neither plunge it past his grip or pull it out, is just outrageously silly. That this simple point should have eluded most of the reviewers on this site is, to say the least, almost as amazing. It is so silly it just metastisises over any enjoyment one might have had of the whole.

Good guys depends on bad guys. Caton-Jones' Rob Roy presents one of the most refreshingly evil bad guys ever to appear on the silver screen; Tim Roth as the ruthless Archibald Cunningham, the hand and sword of the Scottish leader's worst enemies. Roth visualize evil as both an arrogant swashbuckler who rerely miss an opportunity to ridicule his clumsy opponents, as well in his immensly bad behaviour towards his mistress when she informs him of their pregnancy. True evil, and a comic relief in a film shadowed by hammy acting by its main character played by Liam Neeson. Credible performace by the handsome Jessica Lange, showing her age and beauty without make-up in the portrayal of Rob's strong and brave wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Splendid scenery, I grant you. I don't know how authentic the costumes were, but the filmmakers succeeded in dressing their male highlanders in kilts and tartans that looked like they actually could keep a guy reasonably warm in a chilly latitude. Nice to see a movie, too, in which the physical lovemaking is between two people faithfully married to one another. (The rape scene was hateful, though artistically defensible.) But at the end of the movie, the hero does something that is physically impossible. It really bothered me. The filmmakers could have given us a fully satisfactory conclusion without that. This was the crowning example of quite a number of implausibilities. If you haven't seen Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, THAT has the last word in cinematic small-scale battle.I can hardly wait to re-read Walter Scott's novel, which, as someone else pointed out, has no overlap with this movie.

This solves the problem. As far as the light rifles performance, It is good. The kickback stinks,but who cares about kickback. It is fun to point the rifle at the tv and blast away at terrorists.

Except for Gregor & Bennis (who are the only decent parts of the novel), the characters are all shallow and two dimensional. The murderer is obvious & more of a caricature than a character. Gregor gets quite testy with the games that his fellow inhabitants of the island are playing -- who could blame him? Not me.

If you are looking for good arguments for why alternative work concepts are not just the wave of the future but a real necessity today, the book will provide real examples and some forward thinking about how to get your point across. It's written from a North American standpoint, but these are global issues! My only concern is that sometimes Froggatt seems a bit overly critical of the corporate office (sometimes deservedly). The fact is that many people are highly productive and thrive on and learn from the \\"distractions\\" in the office.

This was probably a severe challenge to the wardrobe and makeup departments. C. S. Lewis once claimed that fictional evil women should be above average in physical beauty and flashy clothes.

Most rookie traders are sure that there is a relatively easy route to the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow. Veteran trader John Hayden, who has traded stocks, gold and U.S. Treasuries since 1976, disabuses his readers of any such notions; there is no way to short-cut the system. The book is divided into two sections: The first offers a sort of trader's self-improvement manual and concentrates on developing the attitudes needed to be a successful trader. As in many books within the personal growth oeuvre, this advice often consists of reiterating the glaringly obvious in condescending fashion. The second half is the more technical, and will be of more interest to the novice or intermediate-level trader, to whom we [...] recommend this book for its original observations and conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuous","review":"The substance of this book could be reduced to about 10 pages of text...the rest is just fluff and filler.

He was a very unique and complex character, but more interesting to me was the illustration of many Latin American cultures Che described on his travels. It is more like a historical account of how capitalism has kept most of Latin America in poverty and explains many of the political problems with the Americas that we have today.

I highly recommend this, nothing beats this biography!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the life of a rebel","review":"A well written book about a legendary man. The reader gets to see the truth about one of the greatest men of this century. He symbolized the need for social change in all of Latin America. He didn't do this for personal greatness, he did it to make lives better for the people of the region. In this book we can see what a complex man he really was. At times cruel, hard driving, at others kind and compassionate.

Really nothing more to say, read the book, I guarantee you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"VIVA EL CHE!","review":"If you want a book on politics, you got it.

Basically, if you want a perfect biography of Ernesto Che Guevara, and you wanted to know 99% of everything about him, buy this book!VIVA EL CHEVIVA EL PUEBLO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpacked, understuffed. I was left wanting","review":"The author takes his understanding of his subject more seriously than the task at hand: Showing us why we should care to read about this guy. It seems Jon Lee Anderson gets a little too caught up in some of the hero worship and recounting Che's luck with the ladies instead of showing how this guy rose to be such an effective leader and a powerful influence in the world. The book seems to be a series of adventures - Che helping lepers, Che on a motorcycle, Che and his revolutionary guerilla buddies - rather than an exploration into the evolution of one of recent history's most interesting people.If you want to actually know more about the guy, pick up some of the editions of his own journals. They'll get you the closest."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY Interesting and informative book about Che!:)","review":"Anderson's book gives a very detailed and informative account of Che's life. Provides in-depth information from a variety of sources that truly brings Che back to life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gateway book for those interested in our revolution!","review":"If influential reading is what your looking for then this is a grat book to pick up. The story of the most complete man to live in this century is documented from childhood to his heroic death. A book that makes you want to improve your own life and knowledge of self. Their is a common enemy out their for us , and Che stood up and fought against them physically , mentally, and now spiritually as his words teach us of a time when people had the guts to sacrifice their lives for the cause of peace. This book is a must for those seeking a way to take our freedom back from the hands of the devil( IMPERIALISM ).May god's people live on and learn!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"warts-and-all\\" portrayal of Guevara","review":"A comprehensive portrayal of one of the most important men of the 20th century. Anderson generally puts Guevara's actions in a positive light, but this book is by no means a canonization. Anderson vividly describes what made Che a great revolutionary leader--his courage, intelligence and great powers of persuasion. At the same time we learn about the \\"dark side\\" of Che's personality--including his brutality and uncompromising self-righteousness. There are some parts of the book that will make you laugh as well--like Che's brief, unsuccessful career in guerilla dentistry. If you want to know more about Che, Cuba, or Latin American history you should read this book. It looks imposing (800 pages) but once you get into it it won't seem that way at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"An appalling whitewash of a sociopath","review":"This work is a piece of trash, an appalling whitewash of one of the 20th century's great, murderous sociopaths. Guevara was a cold-blooded murderer, nothing more, nothing less. He was committed only to sleeping with as many women as possible, and killing as many men and boys as possible. Next to Guevara, Charles Manson is a boy scout. That this monster, Guevara, is an icon on our college campuses today is merely indicative of the moral degeneracy of higher education. Revolting, simply revolting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent chronicle of Che's life","review":"I am half way through this book and I have to say it is amazing. It has sparked a surge of interest in me to learn even more about Che. I strongly recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn more about this amazing man's life - start with this book! The details that Anderson provides are impeccable, and truly give an honest, beautiful, and gritty account of his life. I can't wait to finish this book and read others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a little rambling, but heavily inspiring","review":"A great insight into the character of the man. Very compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Romanticized Fictionalized version of Ernresto Guevara","review":"Are you kidding me? He was a failed human being, a trigger happy opportunisit who took advantage of Cuba and Cubans for his own personal profit. In today's Cuba, the elite are the Castros and descendants of Guevara. This is Che's/ Castro's legacy. Not the romanticized fiction that sells books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Starter book on Che","review":"This is the first book on Che Guevara that I read and it is an excellent way to get the whole story, before moving on to other works. I followed this up with reading Jorge Castaneda's \\"Companero\\", and the combination of the two is outstanding. I would suggest reading Anderson's book first as it has more detail, and then moving on to Castaneda's.This book very well written, well researched and up to date. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"well researched and unbiased","review":"what's great about jon lee anderson's biography is that the author seems to take no stance on his subject's actions. he remains unbiased throughout the text and manages to show all angles of the iconic che. because of the sheer bulk of the book i was unable to finish it as quickly as i have others, but i was engrossed the entire time that i was reading. if you are looking to learn more about ernesto guevara i would recommend a revolutionary life. the book is thoroughly researched and covers everything from the union of his parents, to speculation concerning his untimely death. it is one of the better biographies that i have read. i also found the inset photos to be a pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Serviceable Biography","review":"The first major biography of \\"El Che\\" comes three decades after his death. It is well worth the 30 year wait. At times it can be a grueling read (750+ pages, what do you expect?), but it is evident that Anderson worked long and hard on this book. Very well-researched, and, as another reviewer stated, makes you question the authenticity of some of the documents. Honestly, how can anyone be so well-connected? It has no pro- or anti-Che tilt, which is good. A great biographer lets the facts speak for themselves, and that is what Anderson does. All in all, this is a well-researched, well-written, well-footnoted biography of Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara. I gave it an extra star because it is the only decent biography of Che to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winner!!","review":"This book was outstanding in every way, shape and form! THE ULTIMATE bio on Ernesto Che Guevara Lynch! Any serious historian who wishes to conduct meticulous and complete research on this internationally highly-renowned icon (there's a 50-foot bust of him in my town of La Coruna--no, NOT in Cuba, but in SPAIN! And they even named an avenue after him as well. We Galicians have always been revolutionary-minded. Fidel Castro's grandparents themselves were of Galician background, from the province of Lugo), I highly recommend this work. It's alot of reading, but I assure you it's worth every page, and, as you will find, very difficult to put down. Author Jon Lee Anderson's writing style can surely captivate even the gloomiest reader. Highly recommended for the serious Latin American, World and, yes, even Military historian, and for general readers as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Biography of a Revolutionary Evolution!","review":"This book is the best biography of the life of Ernesto \\"El Che'\\" Guevarra, bar none! Jon Lee Anderson does a fantastic job documenting and following this controversial historical figures life. As Che evolved through his life's experiences; so does the readers understanding of him when reading this book. Reading about this man provokes the readers thoughts and emotions on every level.I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to know more than the political propoganda that is so readily spread about this man's life and accomplishments. This man was clearly a person who wanted to change the world. His place in history will always be questionable and debated. However, his dedication to his ideals and the lives of others was not. Excellent reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"why collegiate idealism is best grown out of during college","review":"i thought this was a very objective, balanced and well researched biography. i've given this to a rabidly right-wing cuban friend of mine. i'm dying to see what he thinks.after reading the book i came to see che as an immature egomaniac with artificially enhanced (asthma) will power and drive. politically, he seems very much a product of the u.s. banana republic policies coupled with youthful idealism. if only we'd been a little less heavy handed in guatemala, but i guess we're almost always a little heavy handed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing Propaganda","review":"This is the most disturbing piece of propaganda biography I have ever read concerning the radical left elements in world society. The whole book by Anderson is written as an adoring look at one of the world's most aspiring murderers who is idolized by much of the world who know nothing more about him than as a quaint screen print for a T-Shirt. This book helps bolster this blind loyalty to the human epitomy of evi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Bio","review":"I'll be the first to say I am not a big fan of Guevara's politics. But I am fascinated by his history. This book is a long read but well worth it for any serious student of Latin American and/or Cuban politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete and correct, but not the best choice","review":"Here in Brazil, this book was translated as \\"Che - a Vida em vermelho\\".In English, this means:\\"Che, a red life\\".Yes, this book is complete and correct, but the book \\"Ernesto Che Guevara: Mito y Realidad\\" (Spanish Edition) by Enrique Ros is a better and a little smaller, choice to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Biography on Controversial Che","review":"This is a very well done biography of Che Guevara, someone who did not lead a life that would make a biographer's life particularly easy.Anderson seems to have followed Che's path everywhere, and does a good job of exploring his character. It is certainly not a book that paints him as a left wing saint; nor does it pander to the many on the right who despise him.Anderson shows Che as a personality best suited for revolution and war; one who was ill suited to the detailed,, desk bound work of managing a state once his side was in power.It was a surprise to me to learn the extent to which Che influenced Castro toward Communisism, that Castro was proclaiming himself to be just focused on freeing Cuba from Batista right up until he seized power.The book is strongest in the days leading up to Cuba and in Cuba itself, and somewhat falls apart in the last quarter of the book when Che tries and fails to spread the revolution beyond Cuba."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok but not good enough","review":"Language was not particulary literate, but everyone should know about life of Che and this book gives a pretty good picture of that. I recommend highly this book.. Kaikkien suomalaisten pitäis varsinkin lukea tämä kirja, ja ottaa opiksi että joskus jotain voi saada aikaan tekemällä jotain, eikä ainaa vaan valittamalla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Che","review":"The glitterati and hipster intellectuals are often quoted saying things like 'Che Guevara was such a complex individual you couldn't grasp his brilliance in a lifetime.' I think there is no historic figure that has been more often compared to Jesus Christ -- and it's a sure bet that every last one is an athiests, and Marxist, too.That said, do yourself a favour and read Fontova's \\"Exposing the Real Che Guevara.\\" Fontova managed to capture the deepest, richest nuances of Che's true character in an economical 200 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commies Aren't Cool","review":"The recent rise in popularity of Che among urban youth inspired me to do a little research on the man. I learned that he didn't think prisoners had the right to a fair trial and he would order their execution (and you though Abu Grahb was bad!). He did say he wanted to save the world's poor, but don't all commies say that? Stalin, Lenin, and Pol Pot promised great things too! Just look at Cuba and ask yourself if the one success Che had can really be called a success? The main had good intentions, but terrible means. He was a terrorist that thought just because he wanted to help the poor he could kill whomever and cause chaos. Bin Laden probably sports a Che shirt. Che tried to toppled dictators, but he wanted to replace it with Communism. After seeing 85 to 100 million people die as a result of Communism, why do people still like Che? Why don't they just wear Stalin or Pol Pot t-shirts?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The narrator spoiled the fun of listening to a good book","review":"I think the book has a lot of merit and I should have been very satisfied with listening to it. But, as Spanish is my native tongue, the horrendous pronunciation of Spanish names by the narrator was extremely irritant, spoiling my listening experience. Obviously, the man is too arrogant or ignorant (possible both) to bother to ask how to pronounce spanish names. Also at fault is the production of the audiobook. This is a very unprofessional attitude just due to this fact I wouldn't recommend hearing this audiobook to anybody whose mother tongue is Spanish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jon Lee Anderson is a dope!","review":"For a real picture of what Che Guevara was really like (a thug, a pathological murderer, an incompetent guerrilla fighter, a loser, a liar and a coward) read the book by Humberto Fontova \\"Exposing the real Che Guevara and the useful idiots who idolize him.\\"Exposing the Real Che Guevara: And the Useful Idiots Who Idolize HimFidel: Hollywood's Favorite TyrantShadow Warrior/the CIA Hero of a Hundred Unknown Battles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Forget the Puppy","review":"If and when you decide to waste your money on this account, don't forget to place a bookmark on the pages describing Che's slow suffocation of a friendly puppy that his team had adopted as a mascot. PETA folks should especially love this part - following their recent adoption of his granddaughter as a new spokesperson. Oh, yes, a lovable, dashing, iconic figure for the Hollywood left and sad, pathetic revolutionaries from the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very funny!

All these other books come straight from the Source: His family or extremely biased admirers. He was so good at warfare that he got killed because he couldn't even lead bolivian campesinos who were on the left. the irony is he became what he hated most: A capitalist Icon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Incredible!","review":"John Lee Anderson's work on Che Guevara is beyond praise. His attention to detail and sources is meticulous and the depth with which he plunges is unparalleled. Quite possibly the greatest single book I have ever read. An imposing 800+ read was transformed into a captivating biography on one of the most enigmatic people of the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Che's adventurous journey as a man intimately revealed.","review":"Over 800 pages of very minute details of one man's life. Incredibly Anderson ties everything together to make every day from Cordoba north explain the enigma of Che Guevara. I felt the author emphasized the man, not the political or revolutionary. He did not moralize on the revolution, but sought to understand and explain. Who knows, Che could have missed the boat and landed somewhere else, another Argentine youth looking for some meaning. He found it in Cuba, and the rest is history."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about \\"Che: The truth about him","review":"Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life\\" How many more of these tomes glorifying this mass-murderer do we need?

Mr. Anderson spent several years researching his subject and as a result offers one of the most in-depth works that this reader has yet to find (and I've found many). Aleida March, Che's second wife, collaborated with Mr. Anderson giving him access to information about Che and also to some of his writings, allowing us an even deeper glimpse into the hero. No Guevara fan should ignore this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Biography","review":"This is actually one of the better biographies I have ever read.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very enlighting","review":"Book is well written but some profiles lacks insight. In many cases historical info is really shallow, you get only dates and facts and no explanation why and how something was achieved, ie. profiles of Coca Cola and General Motors. Slightly better are biographies of IT companies, but sometimes they're drowning in the tangle of details. When I read profile of Apple I got impression that it's more about company failures and weaknesses than about what they really brought into the world. If they were and still are so bad then why to give them no.4 on this (artificial) list ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, poorly constructed","review":"this is a great book for any aviation enthusiasts and history buffs alike.

Other than the too-stupid-to-believe incident when Kate Beckinsale meets up with some plastic, this is a good movie. Because it offers characters like Ribisi, Caleb Landry Jones (who was outstanding), Ben Foster (also very good), and David O'Hara in a mix of bad guys that doesn't seem normal, it still works. There are lots of unexpected turns. Ribisi is a different bad guy. Creepier than most, but less violent than most. It's not a typical action film because the writers and director of this film are not American. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst film of the year","review":"This film is a direct remake of \\"gone in 60 seconds\\" with different characters. The direction was unrealistic, childish and painful to watch. You keep hoping for a climax that will salvage the movie but it never comes, it only gets worse and worse and worse until the utterly stupid ending. A genuine waste of time and money.

I didn't turn it off, however the film was predictable and half assed. the typical, \\"I was the best at what I did but now I'm retired and now someone in my familie's in trouble so I have to get back into the game for one last job,\\" deal. And of course one of his best friends has set him up. As always, Giovanni Robisi is awesome, however even he can't really save the film. The actors themselves aren't the problem as much as this is obviously just a paycheck for Whalberg and everyone else is there to say they were along for the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"If you like Mark Wahlberg, you will love this movie.

There's funny situations but its not funny not even in a clever way. There's action but it's more bad boys 2 than Mr. and Mrs. Smith. There was dynamic plot twists, however it was more ridiculous than italian job but with none of the background and character development that makes it fun or suspenseful.This movie has smuggling, Drugs, fights, a high end art heist, good actors, a hot chick (they made ugly?!), decent budget and camera effects, all things I love and anticipated and its still falls on its face. It must have been a combination of written, produced, and directed by too many people that didn't get along.Everyone on set had uncontrollable attention spans. Fell short of usable material so only able so they brainstormed and added in what everyone wanted to fill that extra 45 minutes that should have never made it past editing. If there is a directors cut I hope its nothing like what I saw in theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entirely and completely forgettable","review":"All performances are phoned in. The cast is good, but everything about the script and direction is derivative and bland. This is a textbook example of a rehashed, unmemorable film. You've seen everything in it five times already. Imagine a TV heist drama. Now imagine another TV heist drama that uses the first as a model. That's what you have.Also, the evil character's motivations are very obscure. It's never really clear why anybody does anything. This movie makes a Statham movie look like Blade Runner."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Digital Copy","review":"It just came with the Blue Ray and DVD.

In the 1940s, noir movies had a manner to separate the good/bad guys from the bad/bad guys, and keep us from leaving. For example, in 1947s Kiss of Death, Victor Mature is a crook who eventually goes good, while Richard Widmark, as the notorious Tommy Udo, was not only bad, but probably created a role that dogged him his entire career. (Just check out how Tommy Udo deals with \\"Rat fink\\" grandmothers in wheelchairs.) In Contraband, a vile drama, much like The Departed, Man on Fire, and 52 Pickup, we must endure enormous cruelty and gratuitous violence merely for the sake of a self-indulgent director and badly written script. The stories are not made more clear, the characters more understandable, the dramatic resolution at least satisfying. Instead, Thank God, that's over!

If you pause the movie long enough for it to go the \\"Universal\\" screen, it will never start again. It freezes at the point of resumption, and will not play. Similarly, if you eject the movie, re-insert, and try to select the scene you were watching, it freezes on that scene and will not play.I fail to see how the Blu-Ray industry can keep shoving the \\"Blu Ray is so awesome\\" speech down our throats, when I have YET to see a single blu ray that will play from start to finish without pausing for several seconds at some point in the middle of the movie to \\"catch up with itself\\". DVD never did that. And DVD on a blu ray player looks great! All the industry needed to do was make a better dvd player, not an inferior new movie format.This blu ray needs to be recalled until the formatting bugs are worked out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time (or money)...","review":"This is the worst Mark Wahlberg film ever.

I usually like Mark Wahlberg movies, but even this one, he couldn't make it good. I just sat there wishing it would just end already. He basically did drug carrying before, but went straight afterwards.Now, he needs to do one more job or his family will die. Pretty basic. He manage to do it, of course. Then, it all worked out at the end. Nothing too great worth mentioning happened in the movie.No one should but this movie, and even renting would be a bad idea. Nothing worth wild to see at all. Maybe it was just the trailer that got everyone excited about this one, but the actual movie fails to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!","review":"Don't get sucked in by the trailer. This movie never entered the realm of possibility, which I can live with, but the movie did nothing to generate any interest in the outcome for the characters. My greatest concern was the fact that I lost that time forever and can't get it back. Don't let this happen to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame....","review":"I like Mark and Kate, but this movie is very lame, in fact I fell asleep while watching it! Do not waste your money or time buying this DVD, unless you are a truly a Mark Wahlberg or Kate Beckinsale fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this movie even made?","review":"Bleak, poorly acted, cliche plot, awful direction, little or no action in the first part of the movie (full disclosure: stopped watching because it was so awful). And those are the good points."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not bad","review":"There's nothing really new in this movie, it's not mind blowing, it's marginally suspenseful in moments, much of it is unbelievable & too good to be true, but it's not bad. I'd recommend watching it on a boring day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic and Silly","review":"To put it simply, if you've seen Gone in 60 Seconds then just replace the cars with cash/drugs and you have Contraband. It's a ridiculous movie that, unlike Gone in 60, doesn't know when to have fun with itself but is unwilling to actually commit to being a more realistic movie either. What you get is Mark Walburg being the typical tough guy he loves to play in a movie so gutlessly predictable that you'll actually find yourself wishing you were watching Nicholas Cage or even Jason Statham instead. Towards the end of the movie they have a very real chance to get some emotion out of Walburg's character from the audience, even if the circumstances that lead there are frankly comedic, instead they turn what could have been a very real tragedy into a miracle the defies modern science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read The One Star Reviews First","review":"What a convoluted (plot) waste of time. Although Mark Wahlberg plays what he plays best: A low IQ blue-collar worker/thief, it still does not save this mediocre action doper film from the waste can. And poor (blond, tattooed -- WTF!)Kate Beckinsale has absolutely nothing to do in this film other than to say stupid wifey dialog. Any C-rated actress could have filled this role (e.g. Lindsey Lohan stoned). As they say, Kate couldn't resist a payday for 6 days of work, so she took the money and ran. Even the bad guys in this film are pathetic, non-menacing.Mark has to stop thinking he's a great producer, actor, and judge of scripts, and fire his agent & manager, and return to being a simpleton sidekick of real A-list actors (e.g. George Clooney in Three Kings). Dumb, dumb, dumb movie. Don't buy, don't rent. Watch on HBO for 15 min. and then take your wife out to dinner. Now you are guaranteed a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I was impressed by Waglberg's previous movies like shooter, fighter etcBut this one is poor story line, unwanted drama, total time waste , bad buy for me.2 * just for his acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"action","review":"great movie, learned a lot about cargo smuggling, actors believable plot, intense edge of your seat, surprise ending, blast til the end"},{"rating":"1","title":"too many F-words","review":"I counted one f-word in every sentence in the first five minutes. Come on! That's a little ridiculous! Mark, you're better than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"get the popcorn ready","review":"Pretty good action scenes, but more important, it had a story line which was pretty plausible. Have to be careful about the sound level. Some of the scenes get really loud. Good story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violently forgettable","review":"Weak acting, weak script, weak plot, seen it all before, and done far far better.Plus, the mindless killing of all those guys during the heist kind of makes the celebration at the end rather sick. So it's fine if dozens of people die so a few crooks can get rich? Nice. Marky Mark needs to stick with his fawning talentless entourage and leave the dime store philosophy to someone who actually cares about more than just WINNING! Charlie Sheen would have fit in well here, actually.Not worth your time. Well, mine at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, check it out","review":"I was worried it wasn't going to be that great of a movie after reading the reviews. It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. It was a good movie....check it out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Long & Not Enough Kate","review":"My foolish baboon of a bride Bessie has always had a thing for Marky Mark. He's usually pretty good when he's not singing and he's decent in this movie as he does a good job as the duped reformed criminal gone good gone bad gone good to support the Mask lookalike baby brother of the stupidly blonde (and everhot) Kate Beckinsale. Boom boom boom, but no matter. The movie is too darn long, too unbelievable, and there is nowhere near enough Kate to make up for the 107 minutes of stupidity and boredom. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst","review":"I'm a big fan, but this is Mark Wahlberg's worst movie that I've seen.The foul language is just absolutely unnecessary. I think they were getting paid by how many “f�?bombs they could utter per scene. And the plot was a little thin too. Just hated it, no redeeming points I can make about it"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful service","review":"The product was sent and received in a timely fashion. The movie is great Mark Walberg. I don't think he has made a bad movie. I would definitely use this distributor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This movie was action packed from the beginning until the end. It will really keep your attention. I watched it on a short plane ride and the time flew by."},{"rating":"1","title":"snorrrrrrrrreeeeeeeee","review":"The plot barely moved along. After being very excited for this movie I ended up falling asleep before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"another with lots of talent...","review":"but awful. Logic be damned. Get drunk or drugged, because then it might make sense to you. Otherwise, abandon hope. It could be a primer on what not to do. Go to Panama, while there have meetings, buy fake money, rob armored truck, escape police, drive thru congested city, all in one hour. On what planet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The reliable Mr. Wahlberg","review":"It does seem that everything Mark Wahlburg touches turns to gold. The only movie in which he appeared that I didn't thoroughly enjoy was the Planet of the Apes redux. The man is always a sure thing in an action/adventure role and I wish there were some way that I could thank him for supplying me with hours of entertainment.The strangest thing is that his brother is probably the better actor and I enjoy just about everything he appears in as well. The two of them have come a LONG way since they first came to public attention.I highly recommend this movie as a pure action and adventure vehicle. Screw the awards and just enjoy the movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Contraband","review":"What more can a moviegoer ask for? Mark Wahlberg and Kate Beckinsale! The duo makes a great couple in the movie which makes the action and suspense that much more exciting and enjoyable. It was definitely worth renting for date night with my girlfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This was a pretty good movie with a great plot and an even better cast. It kept my attention throughout. Great for home entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contraband","review":"It was a thoroughly enjoyable adventure thriller action flick - Wohlberg filled the hero's role perfectly. The movie's glimpse into the shipping and dock industry was interesting - a side of the issue that we do not usually see or think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"overdone","review":"Poor character development, unrealistic, and overdone plot. A waste of time. The preview did not reflect the reality of the movie....misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT good","review":"My wife and I were not impressed.....it did not hold our attention. I guess there's a reason you never heard anything about this movie when it was in theaters. The trailer was better than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what i was expecting","review":"Good movie, but not quite what I was expecting. Thought it would be more action less drama, but still a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Wahlberg does it again","review":"If you're a Mark Wahlberg fan, read no further--you're going to love this movie. I prefer comedy and historical dramas, so I had to be cajoled into seeing this movie with my fiance. But 30 minutes into it I was hooked. Although the general plot line isn't original, there were some interesting subplots and twists throughout. The main characters are fleshed out and realistic, not cardboard cutouts of your friendly neighborhood racketeering ring. The dialogue was succinct and there were some funny moments too. Add in a couple of fight scenes, a shootout and a heist and you've got yourself a great movie. Definitely worth owning on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Guy to Forced Bad Guy to Good again, and he wins in the end","review":"I was hesitant about this one - but after watching it, I have to say \\"Marky Mark\\" has come into his own as an actor. This is definitely a terrific movie, filled with action, adventure, family drama and acceptance as well as non-family betrayal. My recommendation? DEFINITELY buy this one! Pop a gigantic bowl of popcorn with melted butter ALL over it and enjoy it with the kids! Yep, with the kids. Phooey reference the fat content in the popcorn butter - 'cause this movie is also butter baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good movie, no doubt","review":"This movie will not get an Oscar, but it's definitively a good movie, I enjoyed it and I think most people will too. As I said is not getting an Oscar or anything like that but it's good enough for an afternoon at home, spending some time, relaxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"its really bad","review":"Wow, its really bad. Bad acting and story line. don't waste your money.I just wish i can rate this less than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boring. I like Wahlberg - decent acting but this storyline was farfetched and extremely unrealistic... Wait till it streams for free on netflix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The movie took around two days to download to my iPad. When I say \\"two days\\" I don't mean it took a long time, and I got impatient. I starting downloading it to watch it on an international trip. It took around 48 hours to download. I wrote to Amazon customer service to complain, but I was already out of town when they responded asking for the title of the movie I was complaining about. It slipped my mind until now and it's probably too late to do anything now. It's the second time I had an issue and I don't think I will ever use the service again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply the worst...","review":"Poor Dana Plato, forced to take such bad roles in such awful movies. Too bad she never got the chance to really act. This is not a good movie by any standard. The writing is awful, the directing is bad, many shots are out of focus, and the acting is unintentionally funny. My guess is people view it to see Dana naked. But even those few scenes are very brief and so badly directed it doesn't even matter. God bless you, Dana. I hope things are better for you on the other side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compatability","review":"I ordered the Microsoft Force Feedback Pro Joystick and upon receiving it, I discovered that it had a 15 pin game port plug on the end of the cable.

My other computer, an slightly older model came with a Creative Labs SoundBlaster sound card with a game port so I removed it and installed it my newer computer. Windows XP recognized it immediately, I plugged the joystick into the game port and now it works like it should. I am very pleased with this older joystick as it is a joy to use. I hope this information helps someone else that has had the same problem.

This is just another example of Microsoft's contempt for their trapped customer base. I notice the current model(FF2) has software to make it compatible with XP, which seems to be FF2's only real improvement.

It seems geared more towards advanced and serious chicken owners and not a good book for beginners or someone just wanting a few pet chickens. I was overwelmed with information and had a hard time picking through and finding answers to my questions. It was rather dry and read like a text book. There are also no good pictures of the various breeds and kinds of chickens. The section on choosing the perfect chicken is a table with a list of the chickens, no pictures.

This book alone has made me feel prepared and capable of keeping chickens and raising my chicks. I would highly recommend this book.

A co-worker told me about it and said that it was really good and she was right. This is a very good book. It's divided into three parts and the first and second parts were the best (I'll admit, the ending was a little stale and unbelievable). I thought Ashley was a pretty good heroine. Based on this book, I will definitely read more of Sheldon's books (I'm already reading The Best Laid Plans now). So if you've never read a Sheldon book, before, read this. You'll get hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I've been a huge Sheldon fan for many years so was eager to read Tell Me Your Dreams.

Come on, Mr. Sheldon - you owe us one."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXCELLENT READ","review":"I thought this was one of Sheldon's better recent works. With his skill at handling many different female characters, the topic was perfect for him. The first third of the book and the last third were fantastic. The trial in the middle wasn't bad, but it wasn't really anything new either. Sheldon always impresses me with his capacity for research and his ability to create interesting characters. He's also fantastic when it comes to laying out a gripping plot, and that certainly was the case with Tell Me Your Dreams. Sheldon writes with style and confidence, and thankfully for us, takes pleasure in pleasing his readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mysterious novel with twists and turns","review":"Tell me your dreams, by sidney sheldon is a book I never thought I would enjoy so much. Stopping myself from reading on was something I never wanted to do. This excellent mystery starts off with three beautiful young women who are suspected of commiting a number of brutal murders. After the police finally make an arrest, we are then taken to one of the most nail-biting murder trials you will ever read. The story goes from London to Rome to the wonderful city by the bay, San Francisco. The climax of this novel leaves you so stunned that I cannot give it away. What I can say is that this book is like a haunted house with door that lead you to places where you think you've figured it out. This book has a way of sucking you in with its goose bump arousing chills. It is up to you(the reader)to figure out how the murders are connected. If you simply want a book you cannot put down, this is the book to read!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sidney is the BEST!","review":"This was a little different for Sidney, but you just can't put down his books once you begin reading them.

While it is a thin,fast reading book, the plot-line was very easy to figure out & while some of the info about MPD(Multiple Personality Disorder) was quite interesting; this was not Sidney's usual high-standard quality of work. It is as if he just wanted to submit a quick story to his publisher but didn't really bother to go over it and polish it up. Sorry, but this was a true waste of time(and money). Hopefully his next will be back to his usual fine storytelling best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Predictable","review":"I have always been a fan of Sheldon's, but the last Sheldon book I liked was If Tomorrow Comes. After reading the reviews in the publishing journals for Tell Me Your Dreams, I fully expected to enjoy it. Now before you read the following, I have to admit that I am not the world's best judge of good writing and plots and been know to enjoy the trashiest of novels (I select fiction for a public library and am known as the Trash Queen for what I order). However, even though Sheldon based this on an actual case, I found it to be quite predictable (I can also be a little dense when it comes to figuring out a plot or theme) and trite. I finished the book but was quite annoyed with myself for doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twists and Turns you would never want to take","review":"I loved this book.

Most of them are fantastic, can't put down books. So when I saw this one in the new release section I grabbed it. It was a disappointment to say the least. Unfortunately I caught a glimpse of the Acknowledgements page at the BEGINNING of the book. Just that quick glance told me exactly what the book was about. So none of the plot twists were surprising or even interesting.

And we both couldn't believe that a celebrated author like Sidney Sheldon could stoop to such a low level!! This book was a sad and uninspired copy of William Diehl's masterpiece 'Primal Fear'.

For all those who haven't read 'Primal Fear', please do so, and I am sure that all of you would agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had expected","review":"I haven't read Sheldon for many years. I bought this book with generally good memories of his previous works; I was very disappointed. A very quick yet superficial and disjointed read. I would not recommend this to anyone. Perhaps books in this genre have become more sophisticated over the years; however I can still read the latest Parker (Spenser) novels, which are also an 'easy' read, and enjoy them much more than this book. Martin L. Freifeld"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sidney Sheldon is NO John Grisham","review":"I generally enjoy Sheldon's books. However this one I only finished to find out if he had invented a quirky finish. I felt it was poorly researched, quite repetetive and seemed to have been written in a hurry..If you are a Sheldon fan this one can be skipped. There are many more good fiction books on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and predictable","review":"I usually enjoy Sheldon's work. This one was so predictable I felt that it lacked suspense. He seemed to be on the MPD bandwagon and the book was just an excuse to disseminate information. His cause (and we as readers) would have been better served had he written a pamphlet on MPD and saved his talent for the kind of gripping tale he does so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, shallow - what happened to the REAL S.Sheldon??","review":"WHAT A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. I haven't read a Sidney Sheldon novel for a few years - I saw this at the library (thank goodness I did not spend my hard earned money on it)and thought \\"great - a new S.Sheldon novel\\". But was I ever disappointed! I had it figured out almost from the very start. I must echo all of your other 1 & 2 star reviewers - this was so elementary I could not believe I was reading Sidney Sheldon. His earlier works were superb - this was trash. No depth - short choppy sentences - and so predictable. I had to force myself to finish it - just in case there was going to be a big twist at the end. Sidney - what happened to you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh come on!!!","review":"This was one of the most predictable books I have ever read. We like to share books in the office and I had this one figured out after 80 pages which surprised some of the earlier readers in the office. It was not only predictable but it was written in a very choppy style that just seemed to irritate me. It seems like too many books are going for the 'incest' theme these days to account for the main character's behavior. And the split personality -- remember Sybil??? But, even though this book irritated me, I had to read through to the end because I can't leave anything unfinished! Sorry, Sydney Sheldon . . . better try again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not his best.......","review":"I have loved all of the Sheldon books and always look forward to them. This book was just slower and never really grabbed me. I have found all of his books to be strictly for \\"entertainment\\" but this was at the bottom of the bunch for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time and never again...","review":"Being in a hurry, I snagged this one because it was the #1 of some best seller list. My first and last Sheldon. The man may have had some great books but it's no excuse. If you take your work seriously, you'll forego deadlines (I'm guessing) and stay away from the predictable. In this case, Sheldon didn't. The story was well told but had the orginality you'd expect from an ABC made for TV movie. If you plan to buy your first Sheldon, do yourself a favor, buy another title and stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second rate work from a first rate author","review":"I have read several books by Mr. Sheldon, and I must say that this is his worst yet. Halfway through the first section, it was obvious what was going to happen. I only finished this book out of a sense of obligation, that being that I hate to not finish a book. My advise would be to not waste your money on this book. If you absolutely have to read it, check it out from a library or borrow from a friend. It certainly is not worth the sticker price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book I'd been saving for a real treat was a downer.","review":"After being released from surgery in the hospital,I'd been looking forward to my favorite -Sidney Sheldon - and found this multiple personality book extremely morbid. He is an absolute master as an author and hope he comes out soon with a real delight as he usually does."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is not for entertainment, but for enlightenment.","review":"Sheldon will always be my favourite writer, although I believe the storyline in this book was not very innovative when regarding his previous books. As a novel, the book was not very exciting for an experienced Sheldon reader. I understood the characters and their roles immediately, and I expected the events before they arrived, which made me loose interest. The end was although very well written, as I begun to understand the underlying reasons for it all, and I begun sympatising and justifying Ashleys rage and hate. I HOPE THAT THIS BOOK WILL SCARE CERTAIN PEOPLE AWAY FROM THEIR CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book if you like reruns and predictability.","review":"I've enjoyed reading other Sidney Sheldon books but have to say this one was a disappointment. The first third of the book was interesting enough, although somewhat predictable, but after that it was nothing but a rehash of the first part in the form of a court room drama. Unfortunately, there was no drama involved. I kept waiting for an unexpected twist or something to happen but it didn't. Mr. Sheldon has done much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Sheldon Is Phoning It In","review":"Just because a book is a fast read does not make it a good read. This was a predictable, been-there-done-that story that appears to have taken about four days to write. If I were Sidney Sheldon, I would start to worry when my novels resemble my screenplays. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Half Stunning","review":"Oh my Gawd! The first half left me breathless. Excellent penmanship displayed by Sidney. The MPD revolving around the three beautiful damsels was an astonishing concept. The class and the elegance was completely lost in the second half. I expected a lot more in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"I've read and enjoyed a couple of Sheldon's books before this one, but this book turned out to be nothing short of disappointing. The fact that Toni and Alette were in fact Ashley's alters was SO obvious, long before the 'revelation' of it. Sheldon's attempt at creating a Grisham-style courtroom drama totally failed and his efforts to give us an insight in the complicated psychology involved in merging alters was boring, to say the least. The different stages of the book felt as though they had been badly glued together and, as it happens, it did all far apart long before the end was near. The storyline simply didn't work out and that's a pitty because Sheldon has been known to dazzle (loved 'If Tomorrow Comes'). I bought Sheldon's 'Best Laid Plans' already and I pray to God it turns out better than this one, as it failed miserably in trying to entertain the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Sidney Sheldon really write this book?","review":"I think I was Sheldon's No.1 fan. I have read all of his books and they were superior. I always told my friends, nobody can write like him. I am asking myself, What on earth happened to him? Was he forced to write a book quickly or he'd lose his contract? I am not only disapointed but also sad because if this is what he is going to write from now on, then we lost the greatest writer that has ever been born. The book is horrible and I can't believe he had anything to do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WAS MY FIRST SHELDON, AND UNDOUBTEDLY MY LAST.","review":"Sheldon needs to make up his mind what he wants to do with TELL ME YOUR DREAMS. He starts of with a barely acceptable thriller, then switches suddenly to a trial drama, a sorry take-off on Grisham's A TIME TO KILL. Realizing how poorly he failed, he changes to a psychological drama. In the words of Beavis and Butthead, \\"It sucks!\\" The only thing that keeps you reading is that it's bursting with potential, and, with a better author (Grisham?), could soar. An appropriate sequel should be entitled SORRY SID. But could it be any worse?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it was a mistake.","review":"This book reads like a rough draft. I can only guess that Sidney Sheldon sent the wrong copy to the publishing company, and they in turn didn't read it before they printed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wins the predictability award","review":"Sidney has lost his edge. This book was so bad that if his name was not Sheldon, I can't believe it would have been published. This reader was always five steps ahead and it was so predictable, you couldn't believe it. Not to mention, but Sidney should brush up on his courtroom drama. Accustomed to Martini and Grishom, even a non-lawyer could tell that the court room scenes were amateurishly done. This was a very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A God-Awful Book","review":"After hearing of Sydney Sheldon for years, I decided to borrow a copy from my local library and give it a try. All I can say is that I am happy I didn't spend a dime on this nvoel. This has got to be some of the worst trash I have ever read. Mr. Sheldon writes at about a third-grade level. His dialogue is trite and the whole story is predictable from beginning to end. It is amazing to me that he is a best-selling author. This book was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheldon has sold out on his public","review":"As with his last four or five books, Sheldon wastes his innovative mind on shlock, presumably so he can churn out books faster and reap the reward$. The book is uneven, written on an elementary school level, has terrible character development, and is utterly predictable, particularly if you've read his books before. Even the protagonist, who potentially can be the most complex character Sheldon has ever created, is passed off to us as one-dimensional. I wouldn't be so hard on Mr. Sheldon, except after reading \\"The Other Side of Midnight\\" and \\"Master of the Game\\", I know what he is capable of. My advice to Sheldon is to take a few extra minutes/hours/days/weeks/months to develop his books, or he'll have at least one less reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the REAL Sidney Sheldon?","review":"I cannot believe this is the work of Mr. Sheldon. Most of his earlier books were filled with suspense and many twists and turns of the plot. This was way below par and very predictable; I was very disappointed. I see Mr. Sheldon is scheduled to be on A&E's Biography tonight (1/18/00) - I wonder if he will apologize to his longtime readers for this trashy work? As another reviewer suggests perhaps he has just run out of ideas. It's very sad to see that he has come to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his finest effort","review":"Sheldon skimps on characters and action in favor of a lengthy discourse on Multiple Personality Disorder. The main character, a woman on trial for murder, is totally eclipsed by the public and private life of her attorney. The book loses focus and stumbles from hospitals to courtrooms. Avoid this one, a mere contractual obligation for Sheldon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Up","review":"TELL ME YOUR DREAMS is a first rate international thriller. It's a page-turner with an amazing plot and amazing characters. It goes from exotic locale to exotic locale, and is the best suspense novel since Craig Furnas's THE SHAPE, with the wonderful similarity of roots of the plot being based on actual historical events, which makes TELL ME YOUR DREAMS even more gripping. S. Sheldon, right on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeping the pot boiling","review":"\\"Astounding, startling... almost impossible to believe\\" says the back cover of this book. Well, if we're talking about how bad it is, I'd agree. A Flesch-Kincaid readability test would probably indicate a third-grader would have no trouble understanding this book. Good for you if you're 8 years old, but I'm a grown woman.The shocking truth about the murders was so easy to figure out I kept thinking this can't be it, can it? There must be a twist on top of the twist. I actually came up with a few ideas myself, without much mental strain, so why couldn't Sheldon have done it? After all, he's the author here.Bad, bad, bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, boring and a waste of money!","review":"After reading such Sheldon works as \\"Other Side of Midnight\\" and being held spellbound through the entire book, this was one of the biggest disappointments of the year. The plot was so predictable, and I couldn't help but feel that I have read many books with this same story. Wait for it to come to your public library, and don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to Sidney","review":"I have read all of Sidney Sheldon's books. The last 3 books have been a waste of my time. What has happened to the Sidney Sheldon who wrote books that you could NOT put down? It has never taken me 2 weeks to finish one of his books--until now. I don't think I can pick up another one of his new books. Maybe I'll start from the beginning and read his old stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too, shallow","review":"I started out enjoying the suspense Sheldon offered with his earlier books, however the last three disappointed me. The topic (MPD) was unique but alas Sidney you're becoming too elemntary. After reading John Grisham, Sheldon has become too predictable and mundane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worn out theme and totally predictable","review":"I was very disappointed in Mr. Sheldon's latest outing. I've always enjoyed his books. The MPD theme has been used too much in mysteries and I was sorry he chose it. I had the entire story figured out by the time I reached page 50."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible first impression!","review":"This was my first Sidney Sheldon book and it will definitely be my last. Sheldon does not pique the reader's interest one iota...he merely drags you along for a rather unenjoyable and uninteresting ride. This book was incredibly simple minded and predictable. It lacked a flair for detail that I believe a best selling novel should have. Very slow and sloppy. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget it!","review":"I have always enjoyed Sheldon's books in the past...but forget this one! BORING!!!! It took determination and many efforts to finally finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Predictable!","review":"This book is an utter disappointment! It deviated from the usual suspenseful and riveting works of Sheldon. The plot and the characters are very predictable. It would also make you think whether it's realistic for a person with MPD(Multiple Personality Disorder) to be good and terribly evil at the same time. The modern Dr. Jekkyl and Mr. Hide crap. This book is a waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"I have always love Sheldon, I have read everything he has written, and this one I think lacks the usual Sheldon touch. I mean after reading Master of the Game, Rage of Angels... it's like something is missing. I don't like to think that he lost his magic already. But as always, he just don't let you read but makes you learn a thing or two about the subject. I am still eagerly waiting for his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLUFF!!!","review":"This the first (and last) time I have read a Sidney Sheldon book. Talk about waste. This book is written for people that have a 5 second attention span. There is NO development of characters. The author glosses over months/years of time by saying... \\"Five months later\\"... or \\"It had now been three years...\\" This book reminds me of a Melrose Place episode...a lot of action, no substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable...trashy...a fabulous read!","review":"I had never read a book by SS before, and all I can say is, despite the fact that this book was incredibly predictable and written in rather, shall we say, \\"simple\\" language...this book was literally impossible to put down! I feel that through the authors lack of description and depth, the emotions were emphasized - the reader is left feeling almost cold by how remote and somewhat \\"distant\\" every character and situation appears to be...if this book was \\"well written\\" with colorful descriptions, I doubt the book would have the same effect...less is more in this case. Certainly there were no huge surprises - but still, I for one, enjoyed every page of \\"Tell Me Your Dreams\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't beleive that Sheldon wrote about MPD!","review":"Sidney, Sidney, Sidney! You can do so much better than that.I have been reading Sheldons books for over 15 years, but this one was a real dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally predictable...the book jacket gives it away!","review":"Its sad to see more and more of the authors I once enjoyed are bombing. This is amateur all they way. The Ashley character and her two alters are not too bad, but a little challenge for the seasoned reader as well as some suspense would have been nice. This is 9th grade reading at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a lame Made-for-TV Movie","review":"This book was quite predictable and pretty weak. The introduction he made to Toni & Alette didn't even hint that they might be alters of Ashley's - it's like he made that up after the first chapters were written. I went back and re-read the first few Ashley/Toni/Alette chapters and it doesn't \\"jive\\" with the rest of the book.This was quite a disappointment. It was written like a bad made for TV movie - especially the chapters on the trial. The arguments were weak. It sounded like something written out of a junior high school mock-trial. And the reasons for her creating her alters (I won't give it away) - oh come on! He could have come up with something a little more creative. Who didn't see THAT coming?After \\"The Doomsday Conspiracy\\" I promised myself that there would be no more Sidney Sheldon novels in my life....I wish now I would have stuck with that thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sidney Sheldon Writes An MPD Story With A Masterful Hand","review":"Ashley Patterson seems like any normal woman, but beneath her lovely exterior lies many secrets to behold, and a terror that she has trouble accepting. Once Ashley sees the whole story, another ghost from the past enters to bring to light why her life has turned out like it has. Her father, Dr. Patterson, stands behind his daughter through the whole story, reminding her that she is all he has. Is he as heartless as he seems, or is he just trying to cover up a past from long ago that still haunts his daughter's life?Tell Me Your Dreams is an intricately woven story with surprise twists and turns, revelations that make one wonder, and the brutal murders of innocent men, all due to one man's abnormal passions that link Ahsley, Toni, and Alette together in a fiendish nightmare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Factual!","review":"Sidney you have done it again. The suspense of knowing in the back of my mind, the three were one made the book that much enjoyable. It kept me turning the pages wondering how in the world is her Lawyer going to pull this one off.

Too predictable...like a bad made-for-TV movie. I was able to predict the outcomes before I got to them. So unlike some of Sheldon's other works. Maybe Sheldon produced this book quickly because he needed a fast buck - consequently the quality suffered. I'll definately be more cautious about picking up one of his books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Mr.Sheldon use a ghost writer???","review":"I kept checking the cover of the book to check the author's name! Did Mr. Sheldon use a ghost writer? What a disappointment! Not at all in keeping with Mr. Sheldon's usual great style and superb character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fast-paced story","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I had a hard time putting it down. It moved along very quickly (like all Sheldon's books). The only disappointment was the ending. Usually the ending is a surprise, but not this time. Other than that, this book is very entertaining. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same old Sidney Sheldon stuff.","review":"This book is a typical S.S. stuff.

And did someone say, \\"surprise ending?\\" I had it all figured out by the end of the first chapter, INCLUDING the so-called exciting climax. This story has already been done--about a hundred times! Maybe that's why it is so predictable? Anyway, it reminded me of why I've never cared for Sidney Sheldon's books. I'll never read another one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GRIPPING !!","review":"This novel was very gripping. Although, it dragged a bit towards the end, but it's first half was absolutely great.

I learned more from 2 pages of my book on the Moors than this whole dvd. The dvd even has her biography on it! Not information about the Moors, about HER!Do as you please, but I'm trying to tell you so you won't be angry about the price you paid for this boring dvd.The Europeans may find it interesting, but we (AA)didn't.

Very educational but very misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating and Informative","review":"Like many Americans, I have been unsure of what to think of Islam and the history of its interaction with the West. One thing of which I am sure is that I am not getting the straight story from major media outlets. I have therefore embarked upon research of my own. Much of the reading is heavy and at times requires that one become familiar with many new terms. This documentary was, however, an extremely informative video that allowed to relax and learn at the same time. It reinforced much of what I have learned while reading about Islam over the past few years and was overall very enjoyable. I recommend it for anyone who is trying to learn more about the relationship between Islam and the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a interesting history on the Moors","review":"When the Moors ruled in Europe is a documentary with some good educational value.However, I still suffer from the price versus the content problem.

It never says that in the film.","review":"This Film was ok but i spent almost 2hours and they only made it seem like they were Muslim. Being Muslim is not a race! They never said that the Moors were black! That's what Moors means! Its a colors.When you mention Moors its talking about Black people. They made it seem like they were Arabs! That's like telling the story of Michael Jordan, telling all the great things he did, but never saying he was black! Saying the moors were Muslim is like saying Jordan was a Bull. If you were going to tell the story you have to say they were black! White people wanna always tell a story with leaving out the fact black people were involved. Just like the Egyptians!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Positive learning to be taken out of a sloppy documentary","review":"Many things to be learned from this documentary but full of glaring holes to be taken too seriously.One example is the use of the term ethnic cleansing when the historian herself kept re-iterating that many residents were local converts (even though that is disputed by an interview she herself conducts near the end of the documentary). How can you ethnically cleanse when you claim to have native Iberians, Arabs, Africans and others being expelled because of their beliefs? Perhaps she means ethnic cleansing of Muslims but then Islam is a religion and not an ethnic group so that doesn't really apply.This struck me as good Muslims, bad Christians propaganda that unfortunately covers up what the historian meant to shed light on and that is the positive contributions that were made by a Muslim state in Europe that has been forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS DOCUMENTARY SEEMS TO HAVE RATTLED A FEW FEATHERS","review":"This documentary focuses on a period in Spain's history (711 A.D - 1400's [a period of Muslims from North Africa rule -- Moors]) that is being consciously wiped away -- in Bettany Hughes estimation. One thing this video is not is an argument against Christianity. Visually, we are able to see some of the great structures built by the Moors: the Córdoba for one, along with a layman's explanation of the geometry that went into its construction. We are able to see ancient texts with translation and additions to Greek philosophy. But Miss Hughes went as far as interviewing the Duchess of Medina Sidonia. The Duchess pulled up documents from the 13th century showing that her ancestor -- the great Guzman El Bueno -- was a Muslim of Moorish decent. The quality of the video is sharp and Bettany Hughes style honest and engaging. I highly recommend this documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear of a Black Hat DVD - Quality issues","review":"First of all, I love this movie.

It's just jam packed with hilarious moments. If you watched any MTV in the early 90's, I think you'll be able to appreciate this. The song parodies, videos, and just the band and their misadventures in general are wickedly funny and just plain goofy. This is a more overt, slapstick movie than This is Spinal Tap. As for me, I preffer it. If you can deal with all the crudeness that's in it, then I highly reccomend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This movie is a cult classic.

I eventually broke down and did rent it. This movie is a great satire/parody of rap and its' various movers and sometime shakers. The obvious comparison between this movie and This is spinal tap begins and ends with the music element.

The group NWH is made up of 3 stereotypical rappers and they are surrounded by many other characters which are parodies of real world rappers of the time (Vanilla Sherbet, M.C. Slammer). It is not movie with people who have a sensitivity for cursing or rap culture at it's fullest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear of a classic comedy!","review":"FOABH is a side-splitting comedy/parody that even Tom Metzler could love. Rusty Cundieff scores big as writer, director and co-star of Fear of a Black Hat. Pure 90's entertainment. This is a cult classic flick with lots of gags and mockery.

Other family members will want on it so you will have less time for DDR and other Xbox games.4. Very expensive ($40 for the game, but dance pads range from $30 for a pad [think the kind of pad that you get in twister], $110 for a stronger pad [what I have] but may break down from overuse [I recommend that you get a warranty for the pad], and an over $500 one for you hardcore fans, but it's only available online and shipping costs are a burden [over 30 lbs.])Final Verdict: Deserves being bought for the Xbox Live enability alone, but if you are on a budget, don't even bother without getting hit with a hefty cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game","review":"Good songs and varied settings.

It does not provide any detailed information about ADO.NET nor does it give me anything to go on when it comes to database tips and tricks in the managed world. I was going to give a rating of 1, but decided against it, because I believ the author must have spent many hours doing screen dumps of the way too many pictures in the book!

There's nothing in this book that deserves a rating like that. Its written in arather awful English although it seems that the editors have been able to improve on it. I also think its evident that theauthor really does not know too much about databases in practice as suggested by another reviewer. There are so manyplaces in the book were I wonder if even a price of $[money]would be justified, but I just do not think so.

You get this mixed feeling right from the beginning of the book and then as you continue to read the chapters you sit back and realize that the author has absolutely nothing to offer you, because he doesn't know what he is talking about. Why on Earth would anyone prefer 2-3 shots of the same dialog within the space of just a few pages? Okay, the content of the dialogs are not the same but its much neater to just reference a dialog once its been showed once.I am not exactly a beginner, but even if I had been I am convinced that this book wouldn't have given me much to go on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I find it curious that a reviewer from New York and a reviewer from Bombay use identical language to give this book a rave review.

Good coverage of XML Services and intro to Web Applications. An above average book for ADO.NET, XML and Web database programmers. I agree with other reviewer that the author's style, which makes the book feel like a discussion with an enthusiastic co-worker rather than as a dry treatise. Normally you would think developing Web Services are a \\"BIG DEAL\\" but author explained in a way which makes Web services a \\"Peice of Cake\\".

However, I found it to be the most tedious programming book I have ever read. The author would list 3 pages of code, then change one line, and list the 3 pages again (with the one line difference)! Also, the author never tired of explaining in some depth (like 3 paragraphs) how the 3 different .NET providers had the same basic class taxonomy (but different implementations). After reading the same 3 paragraphs (more or less) for about the 10th time, I swore to myself that I would puke if I encountered those same 3 paragraphs one more time.

I don't understand the mentality of authors who treat their readers as \\"You're a novice and you know nothing so before we continue, let's start at the beginning, the very beginning...this is the START button...\\". I would say that the author knows little about optimization because he never gets beyond the kindergarten level of expertise. Don't look at the sample code!

This author visited our forums and could have learned lots from the consumers' perspective; but I believe she ignored our input(IMHO). She appears to instead have missed the mark (IMHO)and written from the developer's perspective.....what a shame/loss; it could have been a helpful book.

I bought this book last month and thought it was interesting, well-researched and extremely unbiased and forthright, considering the author used to be a timeshare salesperson. But, when I read some of the reviews, I didn't understand the comments and nastiness. My wife and I have owned a timeshare in Orlando for the past five (5) years and have had no problems at all. Been to Hawaii, been to Myrtle Beach, even went skiiing in France one year---it works great. I also thought the information on resales was interesting enough to look into getting another week at a lower price. What's all the complaining about? Nice job, \\"Dummies\\" people.

One author states, \\"If you ask any five Pagans about their favorite books, you'll get five answers. My solution to this dilemma?

The singer (I don't know his name, and don't care to find out) sounds something akin to a drunken, whiny cat being churned through a blender. The guitars clang at random, and once in a while the band gets really ambitious and throws in a couple notes of piano. Whoo. Hoo.

The first few minutes of this CD are just noise. OK. I get it. You're trying to be artsy-fartsy. Please spare me, I don't like paying money to hear you 'warm up.' Although you think you're cute and innovative it has been done before.One other thing about this album that irked me was the liner. A whole page is dedicated to describing the vintage instruments used and to emphasize that the record was recorded in 'their very own studio.' It all seems a little self celebratory to me.After the first few minutes of noise the band then at least makes an attempt to put together some songs, but they all sound the same. The singer needs to stop whining. Its really irritating to hear spoiled little city boys lament their suffering.Probably the worst thing about this CD is the music critics slobbering all over themselves as they spew out praise.

Boy was I bumbed. This album is singular in its awfulness. I can't think of an album that has come out in the last twenty years that people have hyped more and which has turned out to be a bigger piece of [poop].Lets start with the overall sound.

I would say w/ this Walkmen album. You can hear bits of Gang of Four, The Chameleons, PIL, early Cure (17 seconds and Faith), and Joy Division throughout. The guitar sound completely rips off The Chameleons circa \\"Script of the Bridge\\". Completely empty is how you feel after listening to this - and you'll find yourself reaching for your copy of \\"17 Seconds\\" or \\"entertainment!\\".

For days I had been hearing the catchy intro to \\"We've Been Had\\" on a Saturn Ion commerical, wondering who this band was. I had fallen in love with 30 seconds of piano and indie-style singing. In fact, I was so desperate to know who this band was, I emailed Saturn, begging them to tell me. The first song on Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me is Gone is worth skipping in my opinion. But \\"Wake Up\\" is phenomenal and fun to get ready to. \\"Stop Talking\\" and \\"It Should Take a While\\" are the other good songs, as well as \\"We've Been Had\\" and \\"Rue the Day\\". One fun thing about this album are all of the creative song titles like \\"Revenge Wears no Wrist Watch\\" and \\"French Vacation\\", which (unless I'm mistaken) have nothing to do with those titles. This cd ends better than it started, \\"I'm Never Bored\\" is a good ending song and fun to (attempt) to sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody sketches of art","review":"This record is not easy to describe.

I recommend it to all who can read, young and old. Perhaps the only flaw about this book which prevents it from becoming a true classic, is the fact that most of the stories come from the recommended reading section which is already of classical status. Secondly, the book never made it well as a paperback. This is probably because of the fact that it was too long and some parts even a bit too corny.

It's just a bunch of disparate stories involving one man.When I was on the last page of the book, I had no idea I was near the end. I finished reading that page, and wondered, where is the rest of the story?The book leaves most of the stories in the book uncompleted.I wish I had the time to outline the stories in the book and show how many went nowhere or remained unfinished.I guess the strangest part of all this is that you can write a book like this and people will say, Hey, great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly overrated.","review":"The author should stick to what he knows about (Paris and the French language) or do more thorough research on what he does not. Most references about Budapest and Hungarian customs are incorrect. The poem that he cites is total gibberish: makes no sense is any language, some words are in Hungarian but have no contextual meaning, accents are misplaced, existing words are misspelled. If you know nothing about this language and its culture, this won't bother you. Characters are shallow, underdeveloped. Plotting is superficial. John Le Carre, to whom this writer has been compared, has nothing to worry about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relentlessly inept","review":"The adulation being heaped on Alan Furst proves only the extent of the debasement of both literature and history in American letters. His plots meander from one cliché to another, with no care given to consistency, sense, or relevance. His style seems almost willfully poor and is given to gross lapses of grammar. (Fire his editor, I say.) Furst is apparent unable to frame a character that is complex rather than merely opaque, and the words \\"suspense,\\" \\"rationale,\\" and \\"causality\\" must be foreign to him. The new Graham Greene? Hardly. An ugly American? Certainly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didactic","review":"Sorry -- a quick judgment. I only read a bit. The author seems very inent, and heavy-handedly so, on filling us in on details of Hungarian culture. This gave every sign of weighing the plot down so that it could barely move. Two of the principals are having lunch in a seedy cafe. They talk about a friend who died and they take the opportunity to review Hungarian customs and beliefs surrounding dealing with the dead. Of course, we will pay close attention to their eating habits, too -- equally well researched.

Finally, I discovered Alan Furst, but only after someone in Australia told me about him. I had never heard of Alan Furst, which is really strange, I think, since he's an American.

It is difficult to empathize with the characters because they are all so superficial.

What does it mean for Christ to be in you? Major Ian Thomas explores the issues and the implications of Christ's life and death in his book The Saving Life of Christ. In it he covers such topics as The Saving Life of Christ-The Exchanged Life, To Be In Christ-Total Dependency on God, Christ In You-Victorious Christian Living and much more. It is a probing evaluation of the deeper meanings of the Christian life. Thomas offers key Scripture passages for study and meditation, questions for discussion and response, quotations from classic Christian writers, and personal reflections from his own life. He takes you on a journey through familiar biblical passages and brings new life and application to them that encourage you, teach you and deepen your faith.

Larry Larsen gets right down to the basics with few frills. He discusses the various senses and physical attributes of the largemouth bass. How, why, and when a bass feeds, strikes, and reproduces are all carefully explained. Techniques to employ to catch a bass when he is most likely to strike are clearly illustrated and annotated for both lakes and streams. Bass habitats and staging areas are revealed so the angler can fish the most likely spots. Later chapters feature specific techniques and locations for areas of the South from Florida to Texas.

And why make up stories when the material you have to work with is so juicy? Why roll Henry's two sisters into one when they were so fascinating (one smart and plain, one beautiful, both shrewd)?The real jewel here is Maria Doyle Kennedy. Her presence is awe-inspiring, as was the historic youngest daughter of Ferdinand & Isabella.

Instead only a 3 extremely short features are on the final disc, along with advertising for other Showtime series. Finally, the information on each disc about which episodes are on which discs is incorrect!Not only that but these discs featured DRM, so I could not play them on my laptop when travelling, I could only play them on a windows Vista machine that I happen to have an HDMI compliant videocard and monitor.

I'm not terribly knowledgeable about this period but after a certain point I found myself muttering.. \\"Oh come ON.. no way they looked like that.\\" or \\"I'll bet what REALLY happened was WAY more interesting.\\"It doesn't HAVE to be historically accurate to be entertaining.. it doesn't HAVE to have actors cast that remotely resemble who they are playing or have more to offer then eye candy to be interesting.

Rhys Meyers is outstanding as the young King Henry VIII, as are Maria Doyle Kennedy as Katherine of Aragon, Sam Eliot as Cardinal Wolsey, Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More - the list goes on and on. The production values are impeccable - costumes, sets, all are first class. It's fascinating to see Henry from this viewpoint, as a young man. He was indeed the \\"rock star\\" of his age."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Tudors\\" satisfies Henry craving!","review":"If you've got any interest in the history of the Tudor reign under Henry VIII, then this series will amply provide. Fans of Phillipa Gregory will have a few problems with some of the incongruencies, but overall \\"The Tudors\\" is just what the doctor ordered! The casting is excellent, the drama very intense, and there's just enough hanky panky to keep everything moving along."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sudsy try at tarting up history","review":"This show is not good history and only intermittently interesting as soap opera. Some of the actors play interesting characters, but they should have all sat down and watched \\"Fire over England\\" together to get a better idea of how people used to act at court.If it wasn't for all the graphic sex scenes, you might think it was some sort of school series intent on slooowly grinding through the details of the early reign of King Henry VIII of england. Except that even a California native like myself can spot the inaccuracies in the history of a place far away and long ago.I've walked the halls and park of Hampton Court myself on holiday and it was fun to spot the scenes that take place there. In fact, there are several plays put on in the series in those halls that I enjoyed very much.Not enough to make up for the other 9 hours and fifty minutes of the first season, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I was expecting a historical dramatic series, but this was more about a romp in bed than anything else.

This series is well worth the watch and is hard to peal away from! Johnathan Rhys Meyers is not who I would pick for a physical match for Henry VIII but I can see why he got the part! He earned it! He is commanding,powerful,hot-headed and his masculinity is palpable!! With an excellant supporting cast such as Sam Neil and Jeremy Northam and beautiful,fantastic costumes,dialogue, music and cinematography this is a must see! A feast for the eyes as well as the mind. You will be glued to the set!!

We are drawn into the politics of the day as well as daily life at court. Henry is passionate, sensual, playful, and all powerful. His interactions with the women in his life are captivating. The acting, costumes and sets are spectacular. I am now inspired to read the \\"real story\\". I am presently reading The Six Wives of Henry VIII by Alison Weir. The book is even more fascinating than the series. See the series, and if you want more, buy Alison's Weir book. I recommend both highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccuratehistory and terrible acting","review":"This series caters to people who want history served up on a sexy dish, and nothing else. The Henry VIIIth portrayal is crucial, but we get a thin, short specimen of a Henry, and loud, exclamatory rantings, with a lot of sexual interplay. This series ignores the history of the sisters of Henry VIII, and also depicts one of them in a completely inaccurate way.This is Tudor life as run through the off the top of head e-mails on religion, history, geography, and politics we get so much of these days.This series should be titled \\"the Renaissance: The Declining Years,\\" aptly applied to the modern world as well as the series it spawned."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Commentary. Bonus features repeats of Showtime series","review":"I was very disappointed with the DVD set. I loved the series on Showtime and saw all the \\"making of\\" types of features, so naturally I preordered the set. Not a single episode had audio commentary. The bonus features were previously aired episodes of Californication, Penn & Teller's BS, and This American Life. The other features (such as a Tudor London tour) had already been available as Showtime filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening!","review":"This movie was not tastefully constructed.

I am a devoted Tudors fan. The costumes are fantastic and the actors are brilliant. I am on wait list for the 2nd season."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, I can't get past the hair","review":"Everyone in this series looks like they just got back from Super Cuts. Why would they go to such lengths to make costumes and sets authentic, and then give everyone 21st century hair? I can't watch it. Everyone's hair is just so ridiculously anachronistic. It's not as if there is any lack of portraits of these people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled","review":"As a serious Tudor buff this series was on a whole disappointing - a soap opera set in Tudor England starring Henry the VIII. The costumes, the hairstyles and even the speech patterns all wrong! Forget about historical fact. Tudor history has so much rich political and religious intrigue it could keep any scriptwriter in material for years why the writers felt they had to fictionalize I do not know.The cast is ok, although Henry the VIII never ages, and some of the cast choices left me scratching my head, Sam Neill as Cardinal Wolsey just was not convincing.I would recommend this for anyone who likes costume dramas without any expectations. This is not historical fact, but that is why they call it Showtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Menus are INCREDIBLY annoying!","review":"I'm giving this one star for the frickin' menus, which they couldn't have made more difficult to navigate if they were trying to torture the user. I almost put my fist through my new high def display when I got the umpteenth \\"This operation prohibited by disc\\" message just trying to get to the main menu to select an episode. Clearly they didn't test this on actual humans to determine its ease of use.The show itself is OK, with decent acting in most roles. There are, of course, historical inaccuracies for the sake of drama, and numerous times when the dialog sounds anachronistic. The cinematography is gorgeous, and it looks great in high def."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tudors - 1st Season","review":"Very entertaining. As noted by other reviewers, the historical inaccuracies are disconcerting (combining Mary and Margaret into one person was rather inexplicable). I also don't understand the title \\"The Tudors.\\" The series starts with Henry VIII - ignoring his father's rise, a fascinating store on its own.Now I'm well into the second season and Henry is still not fat. Also has designer hair. How can this be?Still, it's fun - a great way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain boring. No sympathetic characters.","review":"I was hopeful after seeing the positive reviews, and I do not demand perfection from my entertainment. I do, however, demand that it be entertaining. I couldn't make it through more than three episodes, this show is so boring. And it's not because it is too high brow either, it is decidedly low brow.My husband pointed at that there is not one sympathetic character here. You will not care about any of them.I was marginally interested in the historical aspect of the show-- but don't be fooled, even if you don't care that the show isn't accurate, that doesn't mean you will like it. There are a lot of other great new TV DVDs you should check out instead-- Dexter and Extras are both great finds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical drama for the \\"hip\\"","review":"Historical drama for viewers who need sex and violence to make it more interesting and watchable. Myself, I don't need that edge. Yes, the times had both, in abundance, but it doesn't need to be shown on a tv show in abundance. But then I remembered this was \\"Showtime\\" not \\"Masterpiece Theater\\" I'll take Masterpiece every time. Glad I got the first episode free, because I certainly won't pay to watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As soon as I heard about this series, I couldn't wait to buy the DVD since I'm not a Showtime subscriber. What a disappointment it has been.The historical inaccuracies are annoying but forgivable. My biggest concern with this version of Henry is that JRM plays him in a way that makes the character very unsympathetic and unlikable. This Henry is only arrogant, obsessive and cruel. Does he truly care about anyone? There is very little vunerability or true kindness ever shown. Without showing a more multi-faceted, complex character, it's very hard to care how things play out for Henry and his court. If not for the other characters, the costumes and photography, this series would be not be worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I am a history dork as well. But I don't think you need to be to love this series! It's beautifully made, and suprisingly accurate (in a world where so many series and movies are completely inaccurate it's a refreshing change). I was hooked after the first episode, I saw the first two online and then I was so addicted that I actually upgraded to digital cable so that I could see the rest! It's a fabulous series, I just hope that they keep it going for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tudors- review by Nick","review":"Fascinating...intriguing...powerful....dynamic....rich.... this is how I would describe this series...

I was excited to see this after reading the reviews, but barely made it through the first two hours. Incredibly boring, like a lavish network soap with all that implies. The history is sketchy; if you're going to twist history, at least make it fun and appealing in some way that the truth does not.This is one of the slowest and most unpleasant tv shows I have seen in some time. Then again, I don't watch tv, only tv shows on dvd that reviewers I usually trust found to be good. Guess that's not the best way either!

Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Henry the Rock Star","review":"If you like your Henry IIIX with the mentality of a spoiled rock star or NFL player, then this series will be okay for you. While his advisors run the ship of state, this Henry is busy hustling the court groupies and tearing up hotel (er, castle) rooms. Although intelligent and subtle performances are turned in by the actors who play supporting roles such as Thomas Moore and Cardinal Wolsey, this version of Henry could never have separated from Rome to form the first secular nation in the Christian world. He cares far more about chasing booty and jousting and running his dogs than picking up a book or a treaty and actually sitting down to think (and behave) like the most cunning and significant king of his time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Captivated\\"","review":"I purchased the 1st & 2nd series to put in my motor home, to watch when I become bored traveling, \\" Wow I watched the 1st dvd and could not stop untill I finished with the 2nd set, yes all in one weekend, this was like reading a book.

I will also be buying season 3 when it comes out on DVD. The wardrobe and jewelry are exquisite. Although some parts of the series is a little off from the actual history, the acting by Jonathan Rhys Meyers as King Henry VIII and fellow cast members are fantastic! I am fascinated by this era.

The sex scene was so graphic that it ruined any possibility of it lending itself as an educational resource. Totally unnecessary to the historicity and story.

Unfortunately, just too crude for this viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is disgusting!","review":"I was so excited to see this show after watching the first episode online months before the DVD was released. When I got the first season from the library I was over-the-moon excited to watch all the episodes. I began watching the first episode, & I was revolted to see how much sex and nudity there was. I'm an 18 year old girl, I love shirtless guys, but I don't love naked guys. It could've been such a good show, if there wasn't so much sex. It's just wrong! If there wasn't so much nudity, I'd surely give this show 5 stars, but that totally ruined it for me, & I never finished watching the first episode.

I ordered on Tuesday arrived Wednesday afternoon. After opening the box I was pleasantly surprised. The stock strings were not bad at all, Ovation has the option to lower the action by removing shims under the saddle, and the factory setting is surprisingly good.

The chapters are well written (I wish \\"Middleton's Allergy Principle and Practice\\" was this well written) and complete. Charts are clear. There is a small picture section in the front which as some nice clear pictures (although some a a little small)--Perhaps the authors can expand this section with the next edition, which I'll eagerly purchase. Let's hope someone can come out with a similar quality book for the adult population."},{"rating":"1","title":"written by a fan for fans","review":"Neil Slaven is honest about his personal love for Frank Zappa music. Unfortunately the result is a sycophantic homage which tends to be a bit pedestrian. A very sincere book, painstakingly assembled from many sources, but it told me nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little That's New","review":"Not a bad read if you're a fan, although it's mostly a mashup of reviews, with very little comment from the author himself. It concentrates excessively on the early (\\"original\\") Mothers albums which is really a very small subset of Frank's overall output. Very little content about Frank or his family, and disasters like the breakup of the 1988 touring band are glossed over in a paragraph or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight into Zappa's life and career","review":"This was a great overview of Frank's life and music. It gives decent insight into some of his compositional techniques as well as nearly every one of his 60-strong catalog. Every major event in Frank's life is covered. However, I kind of wish I would have read his autobiography, \\"The Real Frank Zappa Book,\\" first so I could hear things straight from the horse's mouth before moving on to this book. Great one nonetheless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cited in \\"The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play\\"","review":"... I decided to track this one down in the the public library to no avail. So buy it I must. additional note: \\"The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play\\" is a definitive critical and interpretive discourse covering the entire length of Zappa's career and even has a closing section in which Zappa participates in a reading and critique of the manuscript before its actual publishing. Written by Ben(Out To Lunch)Watson, it is objectively projected to an apostrophic nth degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Business return disappointing","review":"(I have not yet used the state yet, but) using the business return was very frustrating. Program would unload on every error, so I would lose my work and have to go back. The interview always started from the beginning. I could not name my return (it just saved somewhere). I deleted a worksheet, but the entire 1140 form was deleted.For the money I saved, I burned it in labor. I will go back to Intuit next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't use again","review":"I found this software package to come up very short. I purchased this edition only to find out later,in the very very small print, that I needed the business all-state edition to do the state return. (Intuit's is downloadable.Taxcut is not.) The personal state tax software won't work either. I searched every office supply and computer store in raleigh and could not find a copy of the business all state edition.I did not like the process to fill out the federal return either, nor the way it printed the form. I found it very cumbersome and impossible move around during the \\"interview\\".It was my mistake though, I have alternated every year between turbo tax and taxcut for the last 12 years, I cannot seem to remember that intuit is the one that I like so well. I hope I don't make this mistake again.I have found the purchase of TaxCut to be very inconvenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"It is awful. The interview process asks all the easy, basic stuff, but when it comes to the tough parts like filling out schedules, you're on your own.The \\"free state software\\" is not the business edition. It's for personal taxes. Pure deceit. And guess what? The only place you can buy the Business Tax State edition is through TaxCut for another [$$$]. Pure greed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While the personal return, both federal & state were OK, they were difficult to get accustomed to and even after doing several returns, difficult to navigate around in. Also had a hard time printing which may or may not be related to the program, but don't usually have a hard time printing.The Business software was appealing because it had fiduciary (1041) forms. It did, but it didn't do much other than let you type them in and do the math for you.It was also very maddening to find that in order to get state forms [an additional fee] was required, even though I only needed one state. What's with that???? The advertising info says that state forms are included... it doesn't say only for personal returns. A \\"chat\\" with HR Block, was a relative waste of time.I might use thier personal tax software next year, but I sure won't buy the business package again!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Norman Vincent Peale: a new collection of three complete boo","review":"Norman Vincent Peale's collection: a guide to confident living, stay alive all your life and the amazing results of positive thinking is extremely inspiring.

This is a collection of his music taken from some of the Black Emanuelle films. The music on this CD is not Fidencos most groovy and funky stuff so that's why I don't give this CD five stars. But it's good anyway, many of the slow and sensual tracks are really good. But I guess you don't read this review to decide if you gonna buy this CD or not. If you are a fan of these cult films or Nico Fidenco you are probably going to buy it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"thanks for the fast delivery..","review":"i love how the shifter fit on my 2006 kawasaki 636 ninja.. i would recomend this shifter to all my friends.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right color","review":"This light looked more brown in color in the picture, but when I received it, it was actually a smoky gray color.

In this story are shown many different Problems. For Example: Father-Son-Conflict,Problems for immigrants or living with an other culture. The story is written very good and I think many people can identify with this story. In Germany I think there are not so many people who know this Problems. This story can informate people about the problems which many other people have."},{"rating":"1","title":"A FATHER-SON CONFLICT","review":"We think that the story wants to show the problems between father and son, because of different attitudes and religion. Although it shows the problems of immigrants. At the beginning, the is boring but later it gets interesting. We think that the story is truthful and comprehensible, but we're not interested in this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a conflict between father and son","review":"I think, the story sounds very realistic. This make it interestant for the readers. The conflict between father and son, which is spoken about in the story, is not only a conflict because of religion it is although because of problems of teenager's growing up. In my opinion, reading this book could help parents and children to understand each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religion conlflict","review":"In my opinion the story is not realistic, because I have never heard that a young boy believes in God so strongly that he gets into trouble with his father or his parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing up and intolerant parents","review":"It is an interesting shortstory. It is a story about a father son conflict, about intolerant parents who try to force their will by exerting violence on someone.A big problem in this story is the contrast between western civilisation and the Islamic world and their religion. I think this story is a good example for problems like different religions, intolerance, growing up, family problems, conflicts, etc. An extreme situation is shown to learn from it and to draw attention to the problems of the readers. In my opinion it could be very helpful not to do the same mistake as Parvez, the father in the story, did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A conflict which exists all over the world","review":"I don't like the story so much, because social stories are not my taste, a little bit action must be. But save for my personal taste the story isn't so bad. It's a theme which exists all over the world. It's an easy-to-understand story. So if you want to read a short and interestering story, i can prefer it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring short story","review":"I find the story boring.

Bottom line: You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giddy About Gillian","review":"Anyone who loves James Horner will fall in love with this soundtrack. The quite intimacy and warm setimentality are vintage Horner. Indeed, it would be safe to say that some of the exquisite motifs in this soundtrack--particularly the melodies played by the oboe in several tracks--are a prefiguring of the delicate themes Horner developed in Titanic."},{"rating":"1","title":"CUT to pieces!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!I watched this years ago on VHS and was very impressed. Owning a multisystem DVD player, I figured I would go ahead and get the PAL version.The movie is not only severely cut, missing important scenes and lines, but whenever someone curses, the volume goes way down. Absolutely AWFUL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary because it is realistic","review":"I had seen this movie on cable many years ago, couldn't forget it, and searched to find it.No-it doesn't have a succinct (predictable) plot line. It is the randomness of the murders that is truly cautionary. A girl hitchhiking, a woman whose car has stalled, a woman with a broken air-condition, and so on.The scenes are intense. Generally the women become leery-and their fear is palpable. They try to extract themselves from the situation, but generally fail.The scene where a girl is attempting to escape through a field had me on the edge of my seat. As a matter of fact, every scene where I could see a murder coming did. \\"Hollywood\\" horror flicks do not affect me so. I routed for the escape of the victims, but to little or no avail.In my estimation, the directing was right on, as was the acting. I prefer realism for intensity.This movie stands on its own. Why must it follow the book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ug!","review":"would not watch this if I could. My son bought it, but could not watch it. Not the right format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut version loses all impact","review":"I saw the original version years ago on VHS. I was hoping to watch it again on DVD. The heart of this movie was cut out along with various scenes, including part of his childhood memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"Supposedly based upon the story of Henry Lee Lucas, one of the most notorious serial killers in history, the film starts out well, but soon degenerates into a typical low-budget slasher movie,with a script so fictionalized that all resemblance to the story upon which it is alleged based is soon lost. The plot goes nowhere, and the abrupt ending leaves the viewer wondering if the creators simply ran out of ideas. It's unfortunate that the screenwriters responsible for turning out the script failed to realize that fact is far more interesting than fiction. Don't waste your time on this sorry excuse for a film."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a fish tale","review":"Even readers who have never caught a fish will appreciate Howell Raines' eloquent descriptions of fly fishing and its connection to life. Like Hemingway's \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" Raines' memoir beautifully captures the struggle between man and nature. At the same time, he recounts his love-hate relationship with The New York Times and the events that led to his firing as executive editor in the wake of the Jayson Blair scandal. Raines concludes that being fired was the best thing that could have happened to him because it allowed him to pursue the things that are truly important -- writing books, fishing, and enjoying life with his wife and sons. Let's hope there will be more books like this from Mr. Raines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin Metaphor","review":"Raines uses the metaphor of hooking and losing a large fish to describe his career; the surprise of getting a job that was beyond his expectations (hooking the fish), the long tedious years of work (fighting the fish), and his unexpected firing (losing the fish). Raines' first fishing book outlined his political agenda. In his second book, he explains his management oversight that resulted in his dismissal. I prefer fishing literature that makes an environmental point, an ethical fishing point, or is just an entertaining story. I am finished buying Raines' books because I do not care to spend my entertainment money to listen to his personal agenda. Raines' books are editoral pages thinly wrapped in fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"The One That Bored Me To Death","review":"This book is another tome from the guy who offered insight into how to fish through a mid-life crisis. When I saw the book's cover, I thought this would be a work in which the author shared with the reader how fly-fishing allowed him to wade through a difficult time of professional disaster. I was very disappointed. What I was treated to instead was a random series of vignettes woven around fishing and the author's professional development. Neither one was very informative. The were superficial and vapid. The author also takes the perspective of someone who is very elevated from the day to day struggles of most Americans. In addition to this, he is always name dropping more well known fly-fishers. This is too pretentious to allow the writing to be enjoyable. In summation, I would avoid this book unless I was one of the individuals who likes to engage in the pursuits of the common folk."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is the one who got away!","review":"While at the new york times, the author 'got away' with lies, innuendo, misstatements, and untruths that he believed he could pass along to the readers as unbiased reporting and news. Under his supervision, reporters were uncovered as fiction writers and the truth about his political agenda was made known. As a result, he was forced to leave in shame. Now for him to try to re-write history again is a mistake. He doesn't get two bites of the apple. We are aware of his campaign to undermine the values and traditions upon which our country was founded. He has no shame and is an embarassment to to the journalistic profession. The book is an attempt to elevate his low standing and to recover from the shame that has been heaped upon him. Shame on you howell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but loud.","review":"My daughter enjoys playing with this toy, and treats it like a phone (as it resembles a cell phone). She likes pushing the buttons and listening to the music, but she holds it up to her ear while it's playing music. The problem with this is that it is very loud, and there is no sound adjustment. It's so loud you can hear it rather well from upstairs. It's a good idea, especially with the whole bilingual education it provides, but I wish it had a volumn adjustment so it wouldn't cause any negative effects on her ears. I wouldn't advise this toy for kids under 3 who don't understand not having loud objects so close to their ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chakra Meditation","review":"The narrator goes through the seven chakras with a \\"christian\\" meditation for each.

TaxCut will not print to HP printers, there is no work around and there is no patch available and no word on when or if one will be available. Customer Service is no help. Not only do they not know anything about Macs, but they have no solution either. The online help is similarly worthless. This version should have never gone out the door this way. I would NOT recommend buying it until the bugs are fixed; by that time you could do your return by hand and have a rebate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT as good as TurboTax Products","review":"You may pay a few more bucks for the TurboTax software, but you will certainly get your money's worth!

It imported my last year's data with no problems, and continued to work without a hitch. (MacOS 9.2.2, lots of memory). (haven't tried the state version, or printing to an HP printer.) If I had a nit to pick, it would be that the point in Taxcut's interview where you enter your state tax refund begins by saying \\"Did you or your spousereceive a form 1099-G for2001?\\" It eventually goes on to mention that this is the place to enter your state tax refund even if you didn't get a 1099-G, but I missed that the first time through.On my wishlist for Taxcut would be the ability to \\"print\\" a PDF of the finished tax return.

I have combed the online help pages and have not found anything useful.

It pointed me effectively to three beautiful churches (Notre Dame de Sablon, Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula, Eglise St Nicolas), but had little detail about them (nor did the churches supply the same). A specialized art/architecture guide would have been desirable for a more in-depth look at the artistic features and history of such a rich and old European center. But no specialized guide would have been as useful as this guide in advice re restaurants, shops (I was directed to a great chocolate store!) and other practicalities. To travel light, with a single guidebook, this is an excellent choice. (However, the maps are very basic; you will also need a detailed street map. An excellent free map was available at both hotels I stayed at.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Astronomy book not to be missed","review":"With currently 2-3 dozen astronomy books on my bookshelf I recently found this book without actually looking for it. Impressed by the extraordingly well structured contents table I felt this urge to purchase it and I was even more impressed after starting to read.The author is gifted at explaining complicated issues in a way that most beginners will understand without difficulty and more advanced backyard astronomers won't get bored (I started dealing with astronomy on a regular basis in 1992, my first books being T.Dickinson's \\"Nightwatch\\" and the \\"Audubon Field Guide to the Night Sky\\" by Mark R.

Even though graphically speaking this game is a step up from Atari's Frogger, the game is very frustrating to play. I don't think I could call it \\"fun\\". Story Mode is too long and complicated, and Challenge Mode is okay but you only get two lives! And trust me it takes about two seconds to use them both up, then you have to start all over.

She started weaving stories that never came together, and she could have delved deeper in the magical side of the story, since it was so heavily lauded on the back. Elissa started out as a likeable, steadfast, courageous young woman thrust into a terrible situation, and what happened at the end was infuriating. It was like the author decided to end the book there and be done with it, throwing away all that Elissa had fought so hard for. The book passed the time, but I'm glad I only paid 1.35 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor execution","review":"The heroine of this novel is intended to be atypical in fantasy novels: a strong, heroic woman, who nonetheless is very feminine. Unfortunately, she's just too shallow and full of too many contradictions to be believable. She's a determined woman who learns to wield a sword -- but she cries herself to sleep at night, for a different reason every night. She was in love with her dead husband -- but she's lusting after his best friend about a month after he's dead. She's full of all these good ideas -- but she never thinks them up, they just come to her. The characterization in this novel was so poor that I did not care about any of the characters, even by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy story with a breath stealing ending...","review":"I was prepared to love this book, the premise was a fine one, it promised a decent story. I was miserably let down, the characters did nothing to endear themselves to me and the ending was so abrupt I questioned whether or not there were pages missing. I will chock this poor storytelling to an inept editor and maybe look over something else by the author but I was very disappointed with the Winter Queen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather curious because this book was pulped by court order","review":"Shortly after the original edition of this book came out a bunch of US Navy admirals sued Howling Mad for libel, won, and got a court order to have the remaining copies destroyed and all Howling Mad's royalities turned over to them. For the \\"good\\" of Navy/Marines/Army relations the court case was kept rather quiet. Guess this makes this book one of those \\"banned\\" books of high collectability.

In fact, I would place this album after Diesel and Dust, Blue Sky Mining, and Head Injuries in my list of favorite Oils' albums.Breathe is indeed a \\"mature\\" sound; the track are, as always, well written by Moginie, Rotsey, and co but the difference is in the music. They scrubbed off the \\"heavy\\" sound and resorted to a more satisfying, \\"simple\\" sound which you find in Bring on the Change, Common Ground, Time to Heal, and Home.All around great effort. If you're a die hard Oils fan, you will find that this album takes a little getting used to. After a while, however, the sound definitely grows on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-round disk","review":"A turn back to the roots but, also, something new. A lot of styles in a compact form.Overall, it is a wonderfull album that clearly shows the maturity of the Oils.After Earth and Sun and Moon, one would expect a progressive tendency towards light pop (althought it isn't light itself), but Midnight Oil launched this album makes me remember of previous ones, like 10, 9, 8..., Diesel and Dust or Blue Sky Mining.Also, it is a very ecleptic collection: from the sweetness of \\"Home\\" to the aggresivity of \\"Star Of Hope\\", the full-of-message ballad \\"Common Ground\\" or \\"Bring On The Change\\", not to mention the little masterpiece that is \\"Underwater\\".In a few words, a very good proof of the quality that Midnight Oils distils in everything they do, even though it is not a \\"classic\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Breathe has a different sound than previous albums, but it is every bit as good. I couldn't stop listening to it once I started. It's more of an acoustic sound for the band, but the songs are every bit as powerful as their previous stuff. This is one of Midnight Oil's best. If you consider yourself an Oils fan, this CD is a must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sorry effort, bordering on an insult","review":"Listening to Breathe, I get the feeling that the Oils were pissed off with Sony, the process of making music or both when they went into the studio. The songs sound tired and simultaneously overproduced. A real disservice to their fans. Blue Sky Mine was really their last solid album; perhaps after that, success jaded the Oils."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mirror was dirty","review":"When I received this cd I didn't know if it would even play the surface looked so back.

Imagine the shock of receiving the CD and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - The remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse. Perhaps Barbara, with her tremendous unlimited wealth, felt she would be giving away a \\"free album\\" to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film. Shameless misrepresentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Score","review":"The Mirror has Two Faces is one of my favorite movies (within the top 10-15) and I found myself watching it for the zillionth time, and I was humming along with the score, bobbing my head, etc. I realized how intricately the music is woven into the fabric of the film. I decided to buy the sountrack, and I love it. It's the perfect studying music, relaxing music, romantic music. Upon playing the songs, I could see the corresponding scenes in my head. That's how well the songs mirror (no pun intended) the action in the film.I give the sountrack 4 stars just because some of the songs are quite short. I was looking forward to the full version of Nessun Dorma but was disappointed about that (so I still have to purchase Pavorotti).

You won't find anything better in mainstream SF literary Cyberpunk, or even from William Gibson himself. The science is accurate and comprehensive, with several pages of footnotes in the back indexing the various references he makes in the novel, and the artwork is incredible. This book has true attitude, following the exploits of a female cyborg police officer tracking an international hacker. It explores the question of where humanity begins and ends, and what defines \\"alive\\" and \\"sentient\\". A recommended purchase for any cyberpunk fan, even if you're not into manga/anime, and for any manga fan for its outstanding artwork and unusually detailed plot, as well as its length.Personally, I'd recommend it over the movie version any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut content, Clumsy translation.","review":"While the book is an exceptional print and much of the story is consistent with previous editions, there are two jarring details that keep this from being a \\"must buy\\"Firstly, scenes of \\"adult content\\" that are very important to the development of characters and of the universe have been cut from this edition. It's not a lot of content that is missing, but the edit interrupts the flow of the story and is heartbreaking for lovers of the original Japanese version.Secondly, in tandem with the scenes removed, some dialogue has been rewritten/retranslated to make up for the cut content and to soften the universe as a whole.

The cushions were included in the price so I can't complain. I plan on purchasing two more pieces to finish my collection. In comparisson to the price of teak this is a much better deal.

But what really disappoints me is the cushions. Within a few weeks of having the furniture they were covered in mildew.

Time: A Traveller's Guide combines mathematics with an intruiging plot. He weaves some non-fiction into the math and information to make it all the more interesting. I have had the privilige to contact Mr. Pickover myself and he is an amazing man! This book is one of the best I have read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book for anyone wishing to travel through time.","review":"Once again, Clifford Pickover has taken tough concepts in physics, mathematics and philosophy and made them available and enjoyable to all. This time with Time: A Traveler's Guide.As in previous works, Pickover places the reader into the story. The reader along with his companions perform many experiments and mental excercises. The actions of the characters and the experiments themselves are then explained in sections called \\"The Science Behind the Science Fiction\\". This makes the book enjoyable for anyone interested in time and time travel. And of course, Pickover includes computer algorithms at the end of the book for us computer junkies!An excellent book for anyone wishing to travel through time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"Elizabeth Harbour captivates the reader with her illustrations - a delicious castle, rows of delightful topiary and a gorgeous palatte of colours.

For those that aren't too framiliar yet, Potty Whispering is based on the logical thought that you can totally notice when any infant (like my newborn) is ready or starting to go to the bathroom. Instead of deficating in the diaper as usual, the technique teaches how to eliminate over a toilet, potty, etc.I think this method is great. I am a new mom from NJ, (5 day old as of July 4th 2007) and caught my daughter's first poop today. I am using disposable diapers like most people, and consider this a \\"part-time\\" trial for now - which they teach in the tapes and books.The way I see \\"part-time\\" is, even if you \\"catch\\" one poop and save ONE diaper, that's one less to buy, and one less to send to a landfill. If you like this tape, you might also like to buy \\"Diaper Free Baby.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"bad for kids!","review":"I was very skeptical about this product and decided not to use it after purchasing it.

We already have the Play-and-Charge kit for two white battery packs that work perfect and we attempted to use it to charge the pink one. It would not charge at all as it would read as a full charge on the play-and-charge cable. Once the cable was removed the controller would shut down in a mater of seconds.We reported this to Amazon and they sent another pink battery pack to replace it. The new one performed just as well. Did not hold a charge. We sent it back as well and received a refund.I believe the pink batteries may be just a bad batch or they are too old to work properly anymore. They were initially made for the Pink Wireless Controller released back in October of 2007 and are now out of print.

I guess I could still return it, but at $8 it's not really going to be worth waiting to get a replacement in two or more weeks. I'm just disappointed.

My suggestion is to buy rechargeable batteries from any other company than Microsoft. This review may sound like I have a lot of hostility towards Microsoft.

The music isn't so loud that it drowns out the words and its more than just a bunch of guitar riffs thrown into a sequence. That's not to say that the guitar is bad, because its very good and compliments the vocals well. The whole disk is excellent but the songs that particularly stand out to me are \\"Whatever I Fear,\\" \\"Come Down,\\" \\"All Things in Time,\\" \\"Throw it all Away,\\" and my new favorite song \\"Little Man Big Man.\\" Toad knows how to write a song that means something.

If you like the freestylers and or freska nova label.... GET IT! If you are a b-boy and you need a new compilation of some damn good breakin tunage then GET IT. This CD is one of my CD's i dont let just anyone barrow. Dont loose this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best remixes around to date!!!!","review":"This remix album is superb. The freestylers once again use their Super Ginger Glue to stick all the tracks together. You cannot tell that there are 18 tracks it just sounds like one big beat tune!! Cut and Pastes \\"Half term Break\\" uses samples from Granege Hill and makes a stompping tune, Agent Sumo and Hal 9000 produce equally cool tunes but theres a rare Freestylers song called LOWER LEVEL is really good!! Freskanova Have done justice alowing the freestylers to remix their other band signed on their lable. If you like this Album check out The Future Sound Of The United Kingdom 2 (remixed also by the Freestylers) More of the same with Fat boy Slim & Jungle Brothers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have gave it one star, but...","review":"So, I've been looking for a leather scent to put in my closet with my leather jackets. I bought this in the hopes that it would do the trick; NO WAY. These things smell NOTHING like leather. More like a mens cologne. I was ticked, I couldn't believe they even would suggest that it smelt like leather! So I threw it in my outside trash can. The thing is, that trash can smelled horrible, like kitty litter and other horrible outside trash can crap. The next day, after throwing this sucker in, it smelt, not too bad. I was pleased that is served a purpose, so I gave it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to love it!

It smells nothing like leather...I wasn't expecting something amazing but it really just smells like cheesy ax body spray or something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Dr Feelgood-collection","review":"Dr Feelgood was (is) a bar band. A pub rock band. They played short, unpretentious rock songs, muscular and melodious R&B; loaded with crunching guitar riffs...you must've heard their renditions of \\"See You Later, Alligator\\" and \\"Violent Love\\".These forty tracks are really everything that the casual Feelgood fan needs. \\"Roxette\\" is here, as is \\"Keep It Out Of Sight\\", \\"No Mo Do Yakamo\\", \\"Sugar Turns To Alcohol\\", \\"Milk & Alcohol\\" and every other well-known song, including four from the post-Brilleaux album \\"On The Road Again\\".Not every song may be of the caliber of \\"Roxette\\" or the other classic hits, but there is nothing bad on here either.I'm sure that dedicated fans can find a couple of worthy album tracks missing (like \\"I'm A Hog For You Baby\\"), but this is really a very good and thorough compilation, and should satisfy almost everyone.You really should get the live \\"Stupidity\\" as well, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Party Album Ever","review":"No frills pub R&B that Dr Feelgood turned into an art form ... I was lucky enough to see them live and the whole pub went off! This compilation is as good as you could hope and well represents the Feelgood era. Even if you've never heard of Dr Feelgood, you (and everyone else) will have heard many of these songs that no-one can resist singing along to. Like I said ... the BEST party album EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, except for ...","review":"The treatment of Galileo could have been more accurate and less crude, but I really like this book.

I got the cable out of another defective 1 year old mouse. Why fix a mouse? Long story but the mouse is sentimental and I have had it 13 years!!! It is very well used and has no logo any more (worn away). I have gone through countless other mice in this time but the intellimouse is still going. How is it that the first products often and last forever but the later ones are just junk? Anyway I fixed it in 5 mins and am happy as Larry and googled the product for the first time (to see how old it actually is) and low an behold I am here (I don't believe Amazons listing date of 1975??).So I would recommend this mouse but sadly you cant buy it and, sorry but mine is not for sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!

Minor problem. The second is game performance. It seemed to have choppier movement than my old mouse, however this is only with one game. Also I do have a slight problem lifting the mouse high enough to clear the optical sensor and keep it from registering movement. You don't have to lift it far but in the heat of combat you tend to not lift high enough. On the whole this mouse is worth the money, especially if you are upgrading from a straight 2 button mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of software glitches","review":"The ergonomics are great - tracks on just about any surface (including my knee) and no more cleaning the trackball and rollers. But... there are issues / incompatibilities with some software, including MS office products. Be prepared to spend some time with product support (after all, it is from Microsoft). I've also had intermittent problems using it on the USB port - once you've got it working, don't go swapping things in and out. All in all, though, I like being pad-free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft IntelliLemon","review":"First of all, this is an excellent mouse. The only better mouse for gaming is the Logitech Mouseman Wheel, and it's a close race between the two.At least for a while.After a month, however, the buttons on my IntelliEye mouse began to stop registering clicks and they soon stopped functioning altogether. Microsoft gladly replaced it for free, so I was okay with the whole ordeal, but unfortunately, after a few more months, the new one suddenly stopped working. I'll probably consider getting the free replacement again, but if it happens one more time, I'm probably just going to forget about it.If you don't mind having to call and order a free replacement every few months, this mouse is a great buy. Otherwise, have a look at Logitech's line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defected MOUSE, do not buy","review":"The IntelliMouse with IntelliEye is one of the worse Optical Mouse. I had 2 of these and both of it were defected. Sometime the mouse would stop working, move by itself, and scroll speed would go up and down.

David Chase has said that when it came time to cast the Sopranos, he had been so impressed by \\"Trees Lounge\\" that he went ahead and got the same two casting directors who had worked on this film.The film is a consummate example of dark humor. You watch this character screw up his life, in slow motion. Persistently and consistently. Given that life is ugly, and that some people do choose to squander it, I found the way this film unfolds to be darkly humorous and in fact to be the funniest film I saw in 1996. Buscemi has not acquired an especially strong reputation from this film, but I find this to be masterfully done. And I can see where some of David Chase's darkly humorous \\"The Sopranos\\" picked up on a bit of the bleakly humorous vibe of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"Maybe the movie got better during the last half...I turned it off.

I saw the movie on Showtime when it premeared and it was superb. It wasn't the greatest movie ever, it did have it's flaws but all and all its good viewing material about life. Oh and it's interesting to see all the bar tricks pulled during the film. And Jackson was a great touch. Good job Buscemi! I enjoyed the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What \\"Barfly\\" could have been....","review":"The film \\"barfly\\" was great because it showcased both the acting talents of Mickey Rourke and the great script by Bukowski. \\"Trees Lounge\\" lets Buscemi go one up on both of them by fufilling both duties and putting out a film thats even better than its inspiration. \\"Trees Lougne\\" is slow, subtle and slight. Yet the way it lingers on certain poignant moments, on certain characters and their emotions reminds me of Jim Jarmusch and his use of space and time. \\"Trees Lounge\\" lacks the idealism of \\"Barfly\\" but this is a good thing. It holds its own on story and dialouge. In fact, its a far superior film. I get the feeling that Buscemi will mature into a great director if given the time and MONEY (damn hollywood money machine, business round table controlling the world!!!!) See the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The transition from actor to director doesn't always work. Right, Steve?","review":"Good Gosh almighty, watching Tree's Lounge all the way through is in a way like allowing an embittered Croatian nanny rip your back hairs out one at a time, all while she sings the song 'Scarborough Fair' in her festive native tongue. In other words, it's a rough experience.Okay, so it's not that bad, but it is like hanging out in your garage on a Saturday afternoon, watching your great uncle throw back cold ones while he drones on about politics and the state of the economy. It's not entirely horrible, but you know you could be doing something better with your time.I tried to like Trees Lounge, which deals with a man who owns a bar and drives an ice cream truck around town doing his best now to be seduced by a local teenaged female, but I just couldn't. Be warned. This is not your older brother's independent film. It's Steve Buscemi with too much power and too little wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adaptec AVC-1200 Video Converter - Can't get much worse","review":"Purchased product (incidentally, it is discontinued by Adaptec).Could not install on Windows XP with SP2.

It has also been great to keep them entertained and having fun in the car as well as at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kids Favorite!! ... and it's great exercise","review":"My kids love this CD. It's their favorite. I think it is very cute, but as with any kid's CD, it will drive you crazy if you hear it too much, so add this to a good kids CD collection and rotate it out (also buy the Barenaked Ladies Snaketime CD, it's great). I would give it 4 stars...but I am a grown up, so I don't count. Both of my sons give it 5 stars.

Other phat songs like \\"we gon buck\\" and \\"da bridge 2001\\" have also been cut. whats phat about this cd are the freestyles featuring big pun, busta rhymes, and just mega by himself...however, most of these are also available online or on bootlegs, throw mega your money if you wanna support his music (i did!) just expect to be disappointed although its not his fault!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic material and unreleased songs from cormega","review":"I really enjoyed this album a lot because I got to hear all the classic cormega songs and freestyles and what I heard I liked a lot. The only thing that was a problem was that some of the songs were cut off and some were real short. Overall I think all cormega fans will enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic","review":"I've had the foreign version of this CD since I walked into a middle eastern restaurant and heard Gotan's version of Frank Zappa's \\"Chunga's Revenge\\" playing on the stereo. (I'm a HUGE Zappa fan and I really enjoy it when other bands tackle the challenging music of the master.)Everything else here is pretty good, too. I like their other cover version here, as well--Gato Barbieri's \\"Last Tango in Paris.\\"You're not gonna get up and dance with this one but if you want to relax or fool around with your significant other, this CD will do you just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Café, Factura y Gotan","review":"Memorable. Desde el momento en que se abre el disco y hasta el final -un tanto gaucho-, sabes que el sonido (instantáneamente clásico) de Gotan Project no lo olvidarás. Bases rítmicas sobrias acompañan al bandoneón, cuerdas y piano en un viaje por las cashesitas de BsAs y París. Samples muy bien escogidos, adornan tracks, sin perder el norte de la música. Es mucho más música que \\"el festival de los efectos\\", como lamentablemente sucede con frecuencia en la música electrónica.\\"Queremos Paz\\", \\"Música Brutal\\", \\"Tríptico\\" y una notable versión del \\"Ultimo Tango en Paris\\" de Gato Barbieri, hacen de La Revancha del Tango un disco para viajar, incluso si no quieres moverte del lugar en donde estás.Aguante, Astor Piazzola :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW! This cd is the best!","review":"I had heard Gotan Project previously sampled on NPR and I thought it might be an interesting cd to purchase, but I never thought it would be this good! I love it. I really like ambient and low-key music right now, and this really fits my mood. It is not so upbeat that it makes you nervous and overly excited, but it is great to just chill out to, and is also great background music because tango is inherantly sexy. Each song on this cd has its own taste and flare, and honestly I don't think I can even pull a favorite from this album because they are all favorites! The bonus disc has the video for Santa Maria, which is really cool and sexy! This album is a must have for any music listener!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Album","review":"Not only was this CD Fantastic - So was the supplier !!!!

I caught the name of the group and began to get more info on their music. Wow, how fun and interesting! Some of the songs are great to dance to (tango and rumba) or just listen and enjoy.In an age where we hear so much \\"noise\\" that tries to pass as music, it is enjoyable to hear the simple sounds of the instruments blended together for a unique sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little short","review":"I did not understand that I was ONLY buying the Extra Tracks CD, the CD with most of the tracks was ABSENT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music","review":"This CD presents a different kind of genre that inmerses you into the old times at Buenos Aires, Argentina with the traditional tango while at the same time gives you a taste of some new smooth electronic kind of music. love it!!!

A bit of a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"The Gotan Project were going to perform in Sydney, Australia in January. I had never heard of them, but loving tango music, I decided to buy this recording to test the music before booking for the live performance. And what did I hear? An unimaginative electronic rhythm beat, recorded too loud in comparison with the rest of the instruments, a colourless female singer, an outstanding bandeneon player (whom you could hardly hear over the electronic beat), works that have hardly any tunes - just a change in harmonies, with frequent overtones of other tango composers. Terrible! The only 'reasonable' piece was the last one by Piazzolla from the film 'Sur' - but the performance by the male singer on the 'Sur' CD puts this the dull female to shame. Needless to say, I did not book for the live performance, and gave the CD away to a person I do not particularly like."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not make myself sit through it","review":"Maybe it works as backround music, or a soundtrack, but to simply sit there, and take these songs for what they are just doesn't cut it. Can someone please tell me what is so incredible about sampled tango tunes over boring, programmed drum beats.If you're expecting something innovative or fresh, you'll be dissapointed with something that sounds as bleak and uninspried as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slinky, seductive and addictive - listen at your peril!","review":"The name says it all - \\"Gotan\\" is a twist on \\"tango\\", the dance that's famed as \\"the vertical expression of a horizontal desire. Gotan takes the distinctive sound of the Buenos Aires squeezebox or bandoneon, plus violin plus the basic \\"slooow, sloooow, quick-quick sloooow\\" pulse and the sultry attitude of the tango, overlays loping bass'n'drums'n'dub and filters the whole mix through a witty Parisian post-modern sensibility.It's slinky, seductive and very addictive.And provocative. The opening track \\"Queremos paz\\" (We want peace) samples Che Guevara's 1964 address to the UN General Assembly and \\"El Capitalismo Foraneo\\" (Foreign Capitalism) echoes with the ghostly presence of Evita Peron. There are cool reworks of Zappa's piece \\"Chunga's Revenge\\" and Gato Barbieri's theme for the movie \\"Last Tango in Paris\\".It's lounge, it's mellow, it's sexy and it has just the right edge of sweet Argentinean sadness."},{"rating":"2","title":"cooking has never been so easy","review":"Since I bought this CD, I almost exclusively listen to it while I cook. Why, you ask? Well, I am no music expert, so I don't have the highly critical perspective of some others who reviewed Gotan on this site. I do know that I enjoy both french folk and techno, as well as south american dub. Gotan marries these influences seamlessly. An accordion fleshes out the sound, taking what would have typically been purely electronic music and infusing it with three dimensional life. Most of the dubbed voices are in Spanish, providing that essential \\"world\\" flavor.It's a great disc to play when cooking because its so easy to get into its groove. Pop it in, get to work, wait for friends to stop by, sit back with a glass of vino and just enjoy the company. Gotan won't rouse your deepest musical senses, but it plays well just about anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Todo Bien!","review":"Gotan Project's come back is definitely having its strong sweet revenge. The album is a collaboration of sexy tango modern classic beats. I love it and I know you would too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as dance as Bajofondo, but still enjoyable","review":"I came to this CD through Bajofondo Tango Club (by the way, if you haven't bought it yet, do so ASAP), hoping to find the same dance-ish type of tango.I have to agree with another reviewer - Bajofondo's dance-ish patterns and sounds are nowhere on this CD - but nonetheless, it's a cool and energizing compilation of 'modern' tango tunes. Definitely enjoyable, even if you're a techno/electro/freak like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next-Generation tango","review":"Let me tell you a little story: Once upon a time, there was a musical style known as Tango. It first appeared sometime around 1857. It was very popular in Europe and Argentina, then spread all over the world. In 2003, It was thought that nobody could do anything new in Tango music. Three guys decided to try it - they created a project called Gotan.They succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tango Music at Its Best","review":"This is definitely worth the purchase.

I was looking for a good thermal barrier that would help control the little fly away hairs I would get. Boy did this product deliver! I put to squirts of this in my hand and rub it in before drying and it works wonderful! My hair is very long. It touches my bottom and 2 squirts is all I need. It's a very thick creamy lotion. My fly away hairs have gone away since I started using this. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"I have loose curls, but my hair is very thick, coarse, and stubborn. I've used a lot of straightening products over the years and this is my favorite. I got it as a gift almost 4 years ago from a friend with curlier hair than me who said her stylist used it to blowout her hair. I notice such a difference with it. It cuts my blow-dry time alot (when my hair was very long, took about 30 minutes vs 45 without, now that it's short, it takes 20 minutes versus 30 without). And I never use a straightener unless I want pin straight ends, whereas without this product in my hair, my hair is still wavy and my ends looked dead so I have to add serum to ends and straighten, which adds another 15 min (30 when my hair was long). And a little bit goes a long way- I recently donated my hair so it was very long for 3 years and I am only now to the point where I need another bottle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T GET IT","review":"Let me say first, I love Kenny Loggins. I don'tcare for celebrities telling us how to liveour lives and how fabulous their's are. Howmany times has he been married???......That aside, the cd is boring and non-descript.Kenny can do so much better. I know he stillhas it because his \\"December\\" is perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MUSICAL MISFIRE","review":"The good news is that Kenny sings his heart out, obviously committed to this personal catharsis and his book THE UNIMAGINABLE LIFE. And the talent of the musicians is impeccable and near flawless. The bad news is that this late 90s effort finds Kenny sounding like every pop boys band out there--N'Sync, Boys II Men, etc. Little of Loggins' fun-loving persona shines through. The songs aren't that remarkable and they all overstay their welcome, most of them clocking in around 6 minutes average. The best tracks are more straight-forward and capitalize on the song's strengths: ONE CHANCE AT A TIME and THIS ISLAND EARTH. While I'm a firm believer that artists should stretch and explore new territories in their careers, there's only so much African rhythms and ecological messages I can validate. I really like Kenny Loggins and recordings after this brought him back down to earth. If an artist is allowed a misfire, this is Loggins' biggest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duh! Why did'nt I think of that...?","review":"Honestly, this book may be over the heads of some folks, as they may not be able to grab hold of such a lofty ideal. I picked it up after hearing the CD; they complement each other completely, so it's not a marketing ploy. Yes, the wording can be flowery; yes, you're gonna say \\"that was more info than I needed to know\\", but that's just the point. Kenny and Julia's story point out how, more often than not, we all are hiding; from life and from love. This book is a personal journey to that love that we all crave, yet seldom find. It's a thinker. Whether you want to or not, you'll come away feeling and finding; hopefully finding something within that'll make you say. \\"duh, why did'nt I think of that?\\", or \\"that's exactly how I feel.\\" Be prepared to be slapped in the face with honesty, openess and fear, as K & J expose themselves to their very souls. But also be prepared to open your heart to the possibility of Big Love.

We do not care about Julia, or anything else in your whiney new age life. Airing this much laundry makes me think \\"thow doeth protest too much\\" If you are really this happy, you just act it, and dont need to constantly explain it.

It looks like it was made in Wittenberg's basement. Nevertheless, we shouldn't judge a book by its cover.This is weak in content. Absolutely weak. It will not help you gain any insight on social work. It's descriptions are pathetic. For example: \\"Physical child abuse means that some physical damage is done to a child\\" (Page 93). It doesn't get deeper than that, seriously. It is very bland. Worst of all, it repeats itself over and over. I was very disappointed.Don't waste your money. This book is not for written for the scholarly. You won't learn a thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monitor, buying a second one!","review":"We bought this monitor about 2 years ago to replace an older 900MHz Fisher Price monitor. It picks up sounds great and the battery holds a VERY long charge. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars is that it is not a \\"clean\\" signal, and there is fuzzing/white noise on the monitor most of the time. However, we keep it between 2 and 3 (on a scale of 1 to 8) overnight, and can hear my son perfectly, and the noise of the monitor doesn't bother us. We have tried about 5 other monitors, and are buying a second one for our second child.Also - a note about the other two review of \\"this\\" product. Neither of them are reviews of this one, because one says that they have the walkie-talkie feature, and the other says that they have the pet detect feature. Those are both on higher-end versions of this monitor, NOT this exact one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the baby waking us up!","review":"This monitor is terrible. While we can hear our son okay through the system, it's the random alarm sound going off at all times during the night that keeps my husband and I from getting any sleep! We do have the \\"pet detect\\" option on this model, and even with this option deactivated, the alarm still goes off! Changing the channel didn't help either! We keep the monitor plugged in and charging at night and we still get an alarming unwelcome surprise about 4 to 5 times a night! Even after contacting Evenflo and recieving a new system, the alarm still keeps going off randomly. Don't waste your money! This monitor stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this product","review":"We got headaches from trying this monitor -- the low-droning, incessant static was annoying, and it barely picked up any child-related noises. One night, my daughter just came downstairs and into my room to wake me because the monitor didn't -- with both units at full volume, I heard nothing! We bought this to replace an Evenflo from 9 years ago; we liked the feature of that one to talk to the baby (almost like a walkie-talkie). This one has that feature, too, but it's useless because the sound quality is so disappointingly poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent project. Wonderful group of young people.","review":"I really enjoyed listening to this new project. It lets you know that there are some young people with their priorities in the right place. This artist and his group should go a long ways with the Holy Spirit being their guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldie but goodie","review":"For the past ten years, this boook was the standard of financial time series and cross sectional analysis. There are several more recent books on the subject, but as the first good book in the field, it is still keeping up. Lot of the derivation in the book is a bit spotty - but that is expected at this level of sophistication and originality. There are some frustrating parts in the book, but if you cannot chew through that material, you should probably read an easier book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back On Track","review":"It had been so long since Gato had released an album, I thought he had disappeared from the music scene. From Tropico on, Gato seemed to have lost his bearings only occasionally showing glimpses of his storied past. Now here he is again after a ten year hiatus and he's back on track. Que Pasa opens with the wonderfully smooth Straight into the Sunrise and winds up with the moving Adentro. Though I like every cut on this CD, the best are Straight Into the Sunrise, Blue Gala, and a tremendous rendition of Stevie Wonder's Cause We've Ended As Lovers which is even more powerful than Jeff Beck's standout version. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates saxophone and especially to Barbieri apostates who had given up on him.

Sabzi is good, but I personally don't think he can hold a candle to RJ's ingenuity. If you like just tight beats then checkout Dead Ringer by RJD2 on the Def Jux label. Blueprint's rhymes are socially relevant with songs like \\"Hand Me Downs\\" and the tales he tells in the recent CD \\"Things go Better with RJ and Al\\" on the songs \\"Keys\\" and \\"Drugs, Sex, Alcohol, Rock-n-Roll\\" (also a personal favorite of this type of song is \\"A Night to Remember\\" from the Unlimited EP) are great to hear even without music in the background. But, at the same time they can keep it light with songs like \\"Blame it on the Jager\\" and \\"I Need My Minutes\\".IF you are a true hip hop fan and think that the Blue Scholars CD was at least a 2 out of 5, then check out Soul Position with RJD2 and Blueprint.

Therefore, as soon as it begins to labor (10 min. max), the teeth break off. Wasn't even worth the $3.99. Customer service was of no help either.

The lemonheads was turned from a gritty but funny/slapstick punk band to an awfully happy pop band. I am surprised that the new kids on the block aren't singing in the back in some of the songs. This album is filled with way too happy songs-it just doesn't fit the lemonheads image. \\"Into your arms\\" is probally the best song on the album but still, it's way too cheerful.

What a heap of nostalgic crap some people write in reviews, talking about Nirvana and \\"at that time...\\", making excuses for this crap being listenable. Please. If you have to do that, it's on par with explaining a joke nobody got. If it was funny, people would have laughed. With music, if it was good, it would hold up.

A man is on trial. What is he charged with? We do not know. Neither does Joseph K. Ludicrous plot, I thought.Then it stuck me, that each of us face the same situation in our lives. We face many a trial on unspecified charges. The society is one crazy conglomoration of oddities that all seem to bear down on us. We can put up a valiant fight against it, but with one fell sweep, it is all over.The Trial is an chilling reminder to us all that we live in a world where the currents of lunacy sweeps away even the sanest man.The bottom line is, we are all guilty by default."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it to push through.","review":"I read The Trial last year and followed it up with The Castle. I must say, Kafka must have been one of the most brilliantly messed up writers Earth has ever seen. His works leave your mind reeling under the social implications and truth of the world around us. Though I had to push myself to finish this book (as happens with all depressing books I read), I enjoyed it immensely. (Just for the record, I am now a junior in high school.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A chilling reflection on the modern bureaucratic state.","review":"Kafka's work stands as the best literary expression of one of the key pathologies of the bureaucratic form of organization: the marginalization of basic civil liberties and the denial of individual dignity. Prophetically, Kafka relates the inaccessibility of the judicial apparatus to the lay public. Relatedly, THE TRIAL is perhaps most valuable for what it does not afford the reader - a precise understanding of the circumstances facing Joseph K. In short, the reader's exprience with THE TRIAL mirrors that of its main character. Kafka never fully reveals his purpose, offers only glimpses into the structure of his own thought, and torments the reader with details that are at once compelling yet excruciatingly tangential to reader's principal concern: ascertaining the exact nature of Joseph K.'s predicament. The result is a novel that speaks to our most personal fears and asks us to reconsider the purposes of civil government."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking a tunnel of darkness with no light at the end.","review":"Never have I read a novelist who has offered so narrow yet profound a vision.Kafka's world is like walking a corridor darkening with every step.Descriptions of life are faint to the point of dissapearance.All that is registered is the concern of the main individual,who is truly a child of the world that intoxicates him in perspirating delusion.No work of modern realistic horror comes close to this,an incessant outpouring of mankind's bizarre but hidden dillema's that are regularly met in everyday lives but fully realized in this underground work of chanelling digression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practically Unreadable","review":"I don't owe Franz Kafka or his publishers anything. If you have a good idea why not just write it on a page and publish the one page? If you want to use the good idea to write a book it has to be entertaining or readable or at least interesting. Looking at the other reviews by people who have given it five stars I wonder if I have just read the same book. There are no new paragraphs when he changes the dialogue from one person to the next and the publishers surely should have done this for him because, in not doing so, you keep having to stop to work out who is saying what. The book just crawled along and was so boring. After about sixty pages I remember saying 'alright, I get it, do something else!' Part of me wonders if it's like the emperors new coat and I should just join in with five stars. Although the other reviewers praise the book they don't seem to actually say WHY it's a good book. It was pure mince."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need an asprin","review":"So I read this book for a small book club and I could NOT make myself finish it. The whole \\"no paragraph\\" thing totally made it unreadable for me. I got through like 2 or 3 chapters before shuting it closed and throwing it on the floor. It had the potential to be a good story too. I say skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly dissappointing!","review":"Perhaps there is too much hype surrounding the genius of Franz Kafka. This book talks about a stupid idiotic eloquent guy named K. Situations as experienced by him, such as constantly keeping faithfully to appointments, when he should try to report to the police or run away or do something else just illustrates how incredible the story is....It's as absurd as you could get.The style of publishing by Schocken Books is weird. No one arranges the dialoque like they do. Very difficult for readers.All said, if you still think this book is worth a star - because it's FK, at least a credit for his efforts - go ahead and be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbed Psychobabble","review":"I thought it was time I expanded my literary experience to include a higher-education type author. Big mistake. I always try to see a book through to the end no matter what but this one really tested that conviction. I was ready to pitch it into the fire after the first chapter as Mr. Kafka himself suggested we do with all of his 'work'. And why didn't I like it? Because it's nothing more than disturbed stream-of-consciousness phychobabble...dark, depressing, manic, mundane, absurd, surreal. Very Lewis Carrolesque but without the imagination and color. You feel as if you're trapped in this guys never-ending disjointed dream with the vague awareness that you will eventually wake up. You do, after you turn the last page and realize that you've just wasted far too much valuable time dedicated to finishing a work that hasn't enriched your knowledge, sparked your imagination or widened your scope of understanding. I don't care how cheap you can buy it...don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriquing, Catchy, But Maybe a Bit Unsatisfying","review":"I cannot claim to be a fan of Kafka,but still I enjoyed this book very much. The book grabs you from the start--the sudden arrest of the main character, Joseph K. for mysterious reasons--and keeps going from there. This central mystery is matched by equally mysterious characters, who like the arrest are unexplainable. This is not your typical novel. The setting seems vague, the characters seem irrational, the plot twists unusual. At one level, all this surrealism is quite enjoyable, amusing, and fascinating. On another level, it can be quite frustrating. You're never quite sure what you're really reading and the resolution, if you can call it that, doesn't feel very resolved at all.

The emotional detachment of K., who is not terrified, should illustrate this for us. The impossible, occasionally horrifying imagery in the story is so clearly surreal that it does not provoke a real response. I interpret the action as occurring in a dream: specifically, Josef K.'s dream. K. is the center of the action; the trial is his trial; everyone wants to \\"get\\" him. He is the only real motivating force in the story. While this fact illustrates his importance, what gives him power is his logical and insistent defense of himself. He never considers himself anything but innocent; even the end of the story only shows his refusal to succumb to the court's will. This independence keeps K. in a position of self-actualized control. Now why does everyone read the book as terrifying? Maybe if one neglected to look at the review on the back cover before perusal of the book, one would have a different view."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big Deal???","review":"I didn't enjoy this book at all.

I wanted very badly to finish it and find out what happened to K., but it was simply too hard to weed through Kafka's verbose style (well, maybe not Kafka himself.

The cruelty and the bizarre nature of politics derive from the perplexities of life itself.Kafka's short story The Metamorphosis has nothing to do with public life, but it has almost the same message.Readers are more likely to appreciate Kafka if they know what he is talking about.

You take from this book what you want to, and can find something new, or look at something differently almost everytime you read it. Some of the sentences run-on and there are almost no paragraph's but that's because the book wasn't ment for publication (refer to kafka's letter to Max Brod) but once you get past that it isn't an overly difficult book to read compared to some of his other writtings and it's length isn't very long so pick it up from the library first, and if you like it buy it because I'm sure you'll read it again"},{"rating":"2","title":"franz k at his best","review":"Kafka's allegory comes a full circle in this story of unusual twist of circumstances. Joseph k get's arrested one fine morning for an unknown & unrevealed crime and is forced to encounter some unusual circumstances thereafter. From the nature of his crime to the judicial authorities, it is an elusive world that surrounds joseph k. His relationship with his landlady, his interaction with his lawyer, his lady love are all witnesses to his downward spiral as k. struggles to make some meaning of his life. He only get's entangled between his self-esteem, his values & the realities he is forced to face. A lost & defeated k. gives in to circumstances at the end. Trial is perhaps the most forceful work of kafka with his allegory being extremely apt in expressing some very profound dilemmas of human existence. Joseph k's character is a symbol of an entire mankind struggling to intrepret and manipulate the bewildering circumstances victimising it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kafka's Wieeeeeerd!","review":"Franz Kafka was a bit odd.

I think they're both technically unfinished, actually. Anyway, in this novel \\"The Trial\\", a man named Joseph K. is charged and arrested, but he never knows what he's been charged with or why he's been arrested. And one absurdity follows another. This tale is a powerful warning and the logical extreme of what bureaucracy can look like when wedded to totalitarianism.

This first draft is an unclear mess. The premise is fine and I suppose it has some interesting philosophical ideas but it fails as a novel. The book is frustrating because it might have actually been a great one if it had been finished and rewritten. From what I can tell, the draft we have here is less than half the length of what the finished product might have been.If you want to read a confusing first draft that ends abruptly this is the book for you.

Left it with a friend, and just recently got it back. I had been looking forward to read it for a long time, but I was not at all impressed. \\"The Trial\\" is a book that was just that, a trial, and it gave me nothing but frustration.

Punctuation is missing, sentence structure is all but absent, and the end result is enough to make Kafka emerge from his grave and punish those who have so mistreated his work!I do not even know what to do with this book. It is impossible to read, too awful to donate to the library; and yet, I cannot bring myself to destroy it. Guess there isn't much to do except to leave it in some boring waiting room, somewhere- God knows the world is full of those. I hope to find a translation that will do justice to this master, but realize that I might have to order a French one to avoid any further mishaps.

The book creates a world and atmosphere in which you become completely engrossed - it is a disturbing place to be.The story follows Joseph K while he is on trial by a seemingly arbitrary court system. What starts out feeling like a cautionary tale about misplaced and abused power quickly gets stranger and morphs into a story of a deeper and more personal trial. Before long, you notice that K is the one who seems to be doing the work of trying himself.I was left thinking for a long time about the meaning behind the story and a lot of its symbols and components - I don't consider the fact that I still had questions to be a bad thing.

Shoot High Aim Low is fairly moving despite the fact that Jon Anderson's vocal style contrasts sharply with Rabin's.

As a Rock guitarist myself I always found Steve Howe to be way to classical for me in a prog rock band. Yes, he is a great guitarist with a lot of chops. But compared to Trevor, he's boring, and his sound was always flat and thin.

What made 90125 stand out among Yes offerings was Anderson's limited involvement; Chris Squire and Trevor Rabin penned many of the songs (with limited input from Anderson), and the album shot to number 1. Unfortunately, Anderson is back behind the pen for BG, and it shows - typically awful prose streaming from Anderson, coupled with an oblique, flashback-to-flower-children mentality (\\"Song for the Harmonic Convergence\\") reduces this album to a shadow of what it could have been.

A big disappoint from a great artist like Brandford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zenith HD Antenna Amplifier -- A lemon","review":"This is the worst electronic product I've ever bought. It does not deliver on its promise of \\"adjustable gain up to 20 dB\\" -- not even close. I used the signal checker supplied with my HDTV tuner and the most gain I saw was about 3 dB.The instructions tell you to turn the knob clockwise to increase the gain but they don't tell you it's a multi-turn pot (about 5 turns) without a hard limit (a slip shaft) so it's difficult to feel where in the range you are. Actually, the highest gain was about a full turn before the limit and would drop off to zero at the full clockwise setting.I also checked its performance visually, on several analog and digital TV channels, and saw no noticable improvement.It deserves 0 stars but Amazon doesn't let me select fewer than 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zenith Antenna Single Amplifier Doesn't Do Much","review":"The Zenith antenna signal amplifier is designed for the Gemini ZHDTV1 HDTV-UHF Digital Indoor Antenna. I have the Gemini antenna and it works fine alone with the DISH 811 satellite receiver. I gambled on the Zenith amplifier and lost. If the Zenith antenna amplifier works, the improved effect on reception is so marginal I could not notice it. I have found that elevating the front of the indoor antenna's base on a VHS tape or similar support, skewing the angle of the antenna, improves reception more than just moving the antenna laterally. You need to plug this amplifier in an outlet, than turn a thin cylindrical plastic adjustment extension clockwise to increase gain. This device did not work for me. The Gemini indoor UHF antenna is another story, it is the next best thing to an outdoor antenna."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"My seven year old actually begged me to remove the amplifier as it made the reception worse. Either it's junk, or my tuner doesn't like it. Actually, these amplifiers are probably a conspiracy by cable and satellite companies to sign you up for service. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting something great, and I didn't get it with this antenna. My reception was improved marginally, I got no extra channels (I still only have ONE channel). To make it worse, I now have to constantly adjust the antenna; I cannot go through one thirty-minute sitcom without having to get up and readjust the thing. Very annoying. I would not recommend spending money on this antenna. You would do just as good with some old-fashioned rabbit ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are My Eyes Deceiving Me?","review":"I expected to some some significant improvement in my signal.

I hooked it up about 10 minutes before my favorite show came on and we had our first experience watching an entire show in HD. We are getting about four other channels without even moving the antenna around. A little tweaking of the power adjustment and we ended up with 8 bars of signal strength where we didn't even a channel before. For the price, this was an upgrade I would recommend before spending a lot more on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great complimentary item","review":"Ordered this as a gift and it was recommended to accompany the antennae.

I have rented the earlier, Canadian DVD release of Da Vinci Season 1, and I own the Acorn releases of Season 1 and 2. They are not censored or edited in any way! I'd hate to see misinformation like that lead to people not buying these sets, thereby putting future releases in jeopardy.

When I returned the cartridge to my printer, the ink continued to leak, and got all over the inside of my printer. Now, when I hit print, the printer goes through it's usual workings, but produces a blank sheet of paper.

However, you will howl with laughter at this conceit as you endeavor, gamely, to trudge through this tripe.Someone should inform Roy that simply typing drivel in a form that sort of looks like it might be poetic does not transform the drivel into poetry nor does it make the typist a poet.Would make good required reading for detox though.

This is never explicitly stated in the book, though.By contrast, it is explicitly stated (I think -- I'm doing this from memory) that the Object is named after a movie by Luis Bunuel called The Obscure Object of Desire.

I read a lot, and typically whiz through every book. It took me almost 2 weeks to get through this. Do not read this if you are looking for something easy or a page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much unnecessary detail","review":"I read this book because I have a strong interest in genetics and thought a novel about a hermaphrodite would be pretty interesting... Unfortunately, I found the book unnecessarily long winded and for the most part I was just waiting for it to end. Eugenides devotes the entire first half of the book to the history of his grandparents, which, while necessary to understand how this mutation got passed down, was far too detailed and I found it quite boring. He also goes back and forth between the past and the present which can be a bit confusing. Maybe it is just me and maybe it's because I am 25, but this book was disappointing and the most interesting part to me was the short bit where Cal is getting tests done in NYC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Societal themes","review":"This book has a number of themes that relate to society as a whole. Adolsence can be hard for Calliope and struggling as a hermaphrodite can be even harder. I think this was a great read the way the author uses tone and diction, there are a number of passages that portray symbolisim excellantly.

It isn't everyday a preconceptual embryo talks to you! The best attribute of this book is its multidimensionality-instead of focussing on the personal experience, it draws on medicine, history, contemporary & ethnic cultures to narrate an intensely personal story that darts freely between the past and present, I thought this style wonderfully emphasised how tightly the two were intertwined in this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 10 books.","review":"One of the best books I've ever read.

I'm not saying hermaphroditism/intersexuality is not intrinsically interesting on its own, but that's just the problem. Eugenides waits until 7/8 of the book has been written to get to Cal's story. It's almost an afterthought. Cal's recent ancestry and Detroit's history since the first World War take precedence in this book, and that's not a bad thing; it's just that as a theatrical backdrop, it fails. It assumes the importance of primary plotline; when it's time to shift perspective to the protagonist, it seems contrived.Everything else about this book is wonderful and deserving of the highest reviews; a writer transitioning to greatness.

I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money.

The book was really split into 3 parts: Cal's grandparents journey from war-torn Greece to Detroit, Cal's parents in WW2, and then Cal's life. I loved the start of the book about Greece and immigrating to the US, like a nice slice of history. What bothered me was how disconnected you become with the characters once their part is over and you move to the next. I love the book until we got to Cal's life...I couldn't have felt more detached and uninterested, which surprised me. Anything relating to \\"the object\\" seemed totally out of place in the book and irrelevant to the story. Eugenides is an incredible author, but I wish he wouldn't have changed the pacing with Cal's life. It's a great read, just don't go into it thinking it's going to be a breezy easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"It's not just about coming of age or sexuality, this book is fantastically written: J. E. won the Pulitzer for this piece for crying out loud! It chronicles the life of Cal, a hermaphrodite who has to find things out the hard way. It's funny how J.E. manages to touch on topics that ANY person can relate to, yet you think these problems would be soley specific to that of a juvenile hermaphrodite (whatever they may be) and you're constantly left wanting for more.

This book was a great follow-up to The Virgin Suicides. Just when I thought he couldn't come up with a more twisted plot, he proved me wrong. I certainly know more about hermaphrodites than I ever thought I would. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Recommended by a \\"friend\\". Got 1/4 into it and gave up - couldn't stay awake. Seriously? Incest stories about the protagonist's grandmother is what makes good reading these days? No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read","review":"I didn't care about any of the characters in this book. I know the author was trying to make rich characters that you'll remember longer than you'd remember the real topic of this book, but honestly I didn't care about even one of them. And I can't care about the characters, I can't care about the book, so this one gets two stars. It's not as completely awful as Palahniuk's \\"Haunted,\\" though, so I can't bring myself to give it just one star. Congratulations, Middlesex. You're not as bad as the book that made me puke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Story","review":"We read this book for book club and had the best discussion group. The book is long but never seems so because the story is so involved. I can see why it took Mr. Eugenides so many years to write it. The research on Greek history and \\"getting into thehead of a woman\\" must have been exhausting. Most men I know would have no idea of the brand names of cosmetics we used in the 60's.This book is one of my favorite reads. I reccomend it to all of friends. I hope it doesn't take Mr. Eugenides another eight(?) years to write a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined my summer","review":"I guess a Pulitzer Prize and being on Oprah's Book List does not make for a good book. I spent my entire summer trying to get through this book. Fianlly on Saturday, September 15th at 10:38 am, I finished.I was not drawned into any of the characters, found that the narrative was all over the place, found that the descriptions were overwhelming and as far as being controversial, I don't even think that the author really touched on the subject but skirted the issue.I was very disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I have to try it again","review":"I read the first 125 pages of this book and wonder what all the delirious reviews are about. To me, it's just dull and I can't seem to develop any interest in the story or the characters. I usually trust the reviews posted here. And Pulitzer winners always spark an interest in me. For now, I'm putting it away... maybe try to read it again some other time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and disturbing","review":"This book is beautifully written and truly unique. The style of prose, though sometimes drawn out, was creative and delicious. The taboo subjects of the book combined with the beautiful style made is a very pleasurable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive and ambitious achievement, with an oddball ending","review":"Eugenides is such a convincing writer with a great eye for trenchant emotional details--so much so that I kept wondering if there was any chance that he actually was a hermaphrodite.However, Middlesex is often a strange hybrid of the boisterous Greek-American immigrant novel it begins as and the far more interesting late 20th century Frankenstein it slowly evolves into.It is to Eugenides' credit that both these novels are extremely readable and satisfying--but combined into one novel it can be thematically and aesthetically awkward. Which is why any ending for Middlesex wouldn't have worked any better than the odd one that's there."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite book","review":"I have, for most of my life, answered the question \\"what is your favorite book\\" with something along the lines of \\"That question isn't really fair. I don't have a favorite book. You have to be more specific. etc.\\" Now I can answer with a certain finality \\"Middlesex\\"From the first words, we're dragged into a complicated maze of emotions, genetics and a little comedy along the way. The author starts the story as the greeks did with their epic poems, by invoking the Muse. From this gripping and complicated invokation, we get a foreshadowing of all that comes. A beginning of the narrators infatuation with her mutated sixth chromosome and much, much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Reading Experience.","review":"\\"Middlesex\\" tops my list of favorite books. The author is an ingenious writer who spins a web of creativity and sensitivity in portraying the compelling story of an hermaphrodite. The author has been gifted with an unusual talent. Thank you for the opportunity to become involved and informed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Life","review":"I am still in the process of reading this book and am about 2/3 through it. I like this book because I have always liked books about family that start from a long time ago and bring you current. Traveling from country to country and the generations of family and things they go through. This book is no different. This book is a good page turner in that there is always something going on and it lets you learn about different cultures as you go. The main character takes you on a journey with her family and of her as a little girl growing into adulthood. It does not dwell on her sexuality but touches on it so the reader is aware of her \\"difference\\" but you get a mix of the main character and her family and all the changes occuring in their lives. I am enjoying the book and can't wait to see how it ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I'm not a great literary critic. In fact, I don't think I've ever even tried to review a book before. So, I don't feel up to the task of priasing this novel in flowery prose. In fact, attempting to do so seems silly. It is just a wonderful, remarkable and memorable book. It is the kind of book that I keep liking more and more in retrospect. I keep remembering different passages and saying to myself, \\"was that also in Middlesex?\\" Sometimes it seems like I read 5 different books, but no they're all part of this one wild, funny, interesting, mysterious, sad, heart-wrenching story. \\"I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me.\\" Trite, but true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual subject","review":"I enjoyed this book although it is of a rather unusual subject. It held my interest, and I wanted to read to find out how his life turned out."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"This is the type of book where I'd be looking forward to leaving work in order to go home and read.An epic feel with the protagonist's previous generations described in order to explain context. Great descriptions of several decades in the 20th century and truly realistic characters. You'll be glad that you read this fabulous novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a page turner","review":"I interrupted reading The Historian by Elizabeth Kotova, which I was barely into, to read this book because it was so highly recommended.I found it to be very plodding. I had to make a great effort to stay with it & found myself skipping over several paragraphs to get to the point, when often, there seemed to be no point.I found it hard to relate to Lefty & Desdemona's \\"sin\\"....so what!The best parts of the book were about Cal's plight & the resolution of it near the book's end. That story was very interesting & could have fit into a much shorter book.I feel that society's pressure to perform sexually & to be well endowed give a false sense of empowermewnt to the male gender.What Julie & Cal decided what their relationship was going to be about, in the end, is what relationships that last are really about.Thank God I am finished with this book & blissfully back to my page turner...The Historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too epic and off subject?","review":"Nearly 300 pages into the book and hardly met the main character. I could easily stop now, but all the 5 star reviews have me curious. Not a stay-up-all-nighter by a long shot. This is a well written novel, but I am almost at the \\"who cares\\" point. It really needs the central figure to hold it together. I keep asking \\"where is this going?\\" and it just keeps going along in true epic fashion. If you picked this up for enlightenment on the life of a hermaphrodite, you have a long read before you get into his(her) story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I don't know, but to me this book was...bland. The beginning was slow and didn't really delve into feelings, I would of loved to learn more about the love between Desdemona and Lefty- once they were married the love affair drizzled out. And if the subject of Callie finding herself and falling in love with The Object could of moved on, gone deeper. Instead it was like some called WRAP and they just quickly tied up all the ends very quickly with grandeous happenings- like the car chase and club sixtyniners. The subject was very interesting but some of the turns the book took were unrealistic. It was just plainly nothing special!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular read, if it is your taste.","review":"I can understand why some would find this book rather boring, but I absolutely loved it. The author is fantastic; I was marveling over his poetic writing for the entire book. One of the best I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Reviews","review":"I don't get all the great reviews. I do read a lot of books, and a lot of long involved books with intricate plots and multiple story lines, but this book was so boring i had to stop 100 pages into it. I just need to know if the reviewers read beyond the first 15 pages, cause the first chapter or so is great, and then it falls off a cliff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I can see that alot of people read this book and loved it, but I am not one of them. I am only half way through it and am truly bored. I have absolutely no problem with the subject manner so I thought the book would be about factual events in the family history leading up to this persons challenges, growths, disappointments and frustrations. Being at the half way point and still not getting to Cal's personal story is a little unnerving. I'm moving on to something more \\"meaty\\" and mentally stinmulating, this just does nothing for me. It's sad because this is the 2nd book that Oprah suggested (the Road) that just did not thrill me. She should recommend \\"Kite Runner\\" or \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" Now there is some literary works that you can sink your teeth into!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!!!!!","review":"I love to read, and belong to several book clubs so when one of my book clubs decided to read this book I thought it would be an interesting read. Boy, was I wrong, I think the telephone book has a better story line. I don't know what I can add to the other 1 star reviews, I found it slow, confusing, pedantic, wearisome, and at times mind numbing. The main character and the premise of the story was never developed, and that was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't bear to finish it!","review":"I bought this book on Kindle after reading some rave reviews about it, and honestly I don't see what all they hype is about. This book is incredibly dry, boring, and tends to wander. I read about half of the book thinking it would get better, but it never did. This is one of the few books I have not finished reading in my lifetime. It was a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why won't this book go away?","review":"I can't believe this book is a book club selection for my library. It's a long boring rambling ridiculous story that I attemped to read 2 years ago and could not even finish. Why does it still keep popping up?? I think its fame alone is keeping it famous, though its actual content is not worthy. I guess it has become a fashion item, with the momentum of any arbitrary, mindless fashion trend. Let's break this trend and stop making our kids read this thing! There are better books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering Drivel","review":"After two hours of listening to overly detailed, disjointed, not interesting anecdotes I skipped to the middle hoping to find a plot. I didn't and was not willing to invest any more time searching. I don't understand the positive responses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middlesex","review":"Intriguing and well written. Poetic at times, as all Eugenides is. No loose ends. A Coming of Age tale with a big, big twist, but of course you know the twist from the outset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middlesex","review":"Honestly, the best book I have ever read. The story reminds me of a messed up, endearing, coming of age in many eras version of Odyssey. The only part I could live without was the creepy sex sections...otherwise, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give this ten stars if I could!","review":"I'd give this book 10 stars if I could, it's that wonderful. The author handles the conflict of Cal's being caught between two genders so authentically, I actually found myself wondering if perhaps the author was himself a hermaphrodite. How else would a person be able to convey with such genuine emotion how such a plight might actually feel? This author carries it off beautifully, and the result is a book like Middlesex: A Novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern masterpiece","review":"Of all the books I have read this year, this stands out from the crowd. The story and characters are utterly compelling and fascinating. The way the author weaves the impact of the families peculiar genetic history through time is unique and seamless. The characters are richly detailed and expressive. I loved the story itself and watching the characters lives unfold. But the real bonus of the marvelous book is the author's beautiful writing style.It is literary and complex without being dry or sanctimonious. For example, the way he makes the rhythms and numbing repetitiveness of the floor of a car manufacturing plant come alive is remarkable. You know you are in the presence of a great writer when the description of something so mundane and industrial as a car plant leaves you in awe.The book is long and worth every page. I slowed down at the end just so I could make the pleasure of this book last. You wont be dissappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FREQUENTLY RECOMMENDED","review":"This is a book that I MOST OFTEN recommend to fellow-readers. I think this story is very well written, and I was captured from start to end. All of the subjects discussed are interesting. Most of what I ended up loving about this book was the hermaphrodite storyline. It was so interesting how Eugenides took the story way back into the past to give possible reasons why this poor child had to endure this particular difference. But then Eugenides brings it back to the present and shows how this character learns to live with the difference, embrace and accept it. I just absolutely loved everything about this book. If you are considering buying this book, take it with an open mind, and I'm sure you will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique and absorbing","review":"In the early 1920's, a Greek brother and sister from rural Turkey fall in love. They move to Detroit, have children and one of their children marries a cousin. The result of their marriage is Calliope Stephanides, the narrator of Middlesex and a hermaphrodite.Eugenides takes readers through an epic history of three generations of a Greek family and the 50-year transition of Detroit life. The characters are unique, vivid and evoke sympathy and understanding. The writing is evocative and the story epic, taking readers from a remote Turkish village to the growth of the American automobile industry, the Detroit racial riots, and the San Francisco sex scene.The last quarter of the book, after Calliope (Cal) finds out that she's a hermaphrodite, the action is rapid and sometimes seems over-the-top. Despite this, the book successfully comes full circle and is a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I thought this was a book about the author's life as a hermaphrodite. Instead I got a richly told story of history and family leading up to the discovery of his medical issue. It was fascinating to learn about how he became the person he is, not just how he lived with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Middlesex is told from the eyes of a man named Cal, who was born a girl, name Calliope. While as a child nither him or his family knew he was a hermaphrodite, but the struggle Cal faced inside of himself, was very selfaware. The story starts with the journey his grandparents must make from their home in Greece to the United States during the 60's and the family secrets that hide behind the lies. During his younger years into adulthood, he must face the social and cultural impact of growing up while keeping his family traditions close.I very much loved this book, while its tricky to keep track of who's related to who and how, once you get into the story its very good. While I expected a stronger ending, it does leave you wondering how a child and teenager can deal with feeling different and being told one thing when they are something else. The descriptions of place and people are very vivid and you really feel like your in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a pediatric Urology Nurse's view point, well done","review":"I am a pediatric urology nurse by profession. Intersex was a specialty of the physician I worked with for years. These days, ambiguous genitalia is treated with a great deal of care, compassion and concern. There is a supreme effort at identifying the correct genetic disposition of children too inky to be dinky and to dinky to be inky at birth. Whole courses are taught about it. And despite what the Society for Hermaphrodites with an attitude say, medical professionals try their best not to gender assign someone based on what they think best.That said, this work of fiction was a great read. I read it when it first came out, and again when I was given a copy years later. I also loved the family history and the glimpse into Greek America, of a sort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come back Cal!","review":"I've been sitting on my porch, relishing my last few moments with you, Cal. ( the fascinating narrator of this book.) I will miss your wonderful descriptions, and insights, the way you get into every character's head. I've taken to addressing you as \\"they\\" because you have so many distinct male and female characteristics, the best of both really, and I can't believe that you are only a lone soul, an observor of history and an understanding forgiver of human nature. I don't want to let you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took entirely too long to get to Callie's story","review":"I found this book....brilliant! However, it took entirely too long to get to Callie's story. I labored through the first half of the book, and then I simply could not put the book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read","review":"I love this book. The plot is extremely entertaining, the characters are wonderfully fleshed out and the quality of the writing is top-class. I felt the ending was a little rushed but it's really a minor quibble. This is just excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"This book is a classic Greek drama, encompassing both the comic and tragic aspects of a family over many generations and several continents.When I finished this book, I had that pang of loss familiar to ardent readers -- the loss of a good friend. As much as I regret the loss, just the knowledge that such an accomplishment of human talent exists is exhilarating.Cal was as real to me as anyone I have ever met. I will miss him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Club Favorite","review":"One of the fasinating stories ever. I could not put this down...movie material? I have a feeling that this is not just a story, but something that actually happend. I wish the writer and the subject would reveal themselves. My heart goes out to whoever it really is. The doctor should be charged with malpractice."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"I picked this book up in the airport because I had forgotten to bring a novel with me. Despite its location, this is not \\"airplain reading\\". It is a deep rich novel, with little quirks and annactdotes to the reader that make you feel a personal connection with Callopi (the narator). Even in the ending, it never fizzles, does not feel strained or contrived as so many other books do. It simply carries the reader along the journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, boring, stupid misleading book","review":"(1) Sexual ambiguity is not caused by genetics, especially incest. It is insulting to \\"inter-sexed\\" people everywhere.(2) This book is horribly boring(3) The book got interesting just as it ended, when the teenager ran away rather than become something he wasn't. The book should have started here, not ended.I was really disappointed. The Virgin Suicides was a small gem of a book. This book not only has a faulty premise, it's at least one third too long.What was the point of this book? I'm still wondering... Blech! What a poor choice for a Pulitzer. Considering the current publishing climate, though, I'm not surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically Good Writing - Nevertheless, Awful","review":"The only reason I could justify 2 stars is because Eugenides is, technically anyway, a very good writer. He writes fluidly and expertly. So, it's not the way he says it - it's what he says that's awful. I chose to put the book down just over quarter of the way in, rather than continue participating in the assault on my sensibilities.Eugenides has the emotional and intellectual cowards' talent for relying on cliched irony in place of thoughtful and original observation of the human condition. He's managed to jam into this large book every piece of sexually, emotionally and politically corrected tripe offered up by the most vulgar members of our society and the overall effect is of well composed regurgitation. The writer seems not to have been able to resist even one cliche. As a result, the book is relentlessly predictable and boring. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not Pulitzer Worthy","review":"It must have been a weak year for literature if this kind of boring tripe was winning awards. Eugenides is awful. It's a sorry state of affairs when smart people can't spot mediocrity right in front of their faces. I'd give him five stars for spelling all his words correctly, but no stars for everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIDDLESEX","review":"DID NOT CARE FOR THIS BOOK AT ALL.....STOPPED READING THIRD OF WAY THROUGH....LOST MY INTEREST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middlesex","review":"I ordered this book because my teacher recommended it and i was so excited to read it but 2 pages are missing..

It has been over 30 days and the book has not yet arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful surprise","review":"An engrossing story of three generations of a Greek and Greek-American family, molded by historical events, personal tragedies and genetic destiny. It's a family saga, and yet it isn't, because it's more a coming of age story, and yet it isn't, because it's a sexual awakening drama, and yet it isn't, because it's really just about life and death and humanity--and only incidentally about the \\"middle sex\\" of the title because, as the protagonist/narrator tells us, \\"it's amazing what you can get used to.\\" and the \\"change from girl to boy was far less dramatic than the distance anybody travels from infancy to adulthood.\\" Readers expecting a salacious look at the life of a \\"hermaphrodite\\" have been disappointed in this book. They should have been delightfully surprised at getting so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BOOK TO LISTEN TO","review":"I Just finished listening to Middlesex. I had reservations getting into this story due to the subject nature, however because I am an avid reader and open to new kinds of material, coupled with the reviews I read I figured I'd give it a shot. Once I got the tape from the library and saw the 27 cassettes I was a bit concerned it would take forever, and then what if this drags???? Now that I'm finished listening,I wouldn't mind 27 more! KristopherTabori's voiceovers brought every character such realness in their own special ways. The thousands of different emotions he portrayed throughout all the stories and plots and subplots and charaterizations were right on target. I became engrossed to a point where I wasn't just listening in the car, I carried a walkman with me. And when the last words were spoken, I must say, I miss Cal and everyone else already!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I'm glad I bought it for half price from an Amazon seller. I listened to the first CD and it bored and depressed me. Too much family history exposition, not enough about the main character. Who cares about his mother's ovulation cycle and that thermometer? Who cares about the Grandma and her predictions? Why does the author keep at the \\"Chapter 11\\" joke? Doesn't the brother have an actual name? Humor ineffective. I gave up on it early and sold it as quickly as possible to another Amazon buyer. Good thing we have Philip Roth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transparent rip off Tristram Shandy","review":"I finally settled down to red Middlesex after all the hype and was shocked. From the very first page it is a transparent rip off of Tristram Shandy (Sterne, 1760)Narrator speaking from the womb - CHECKFather and Uncle with weird ideas of how to get a certain type of child - CHECKOdd doctor/ old family friend at birth - CHECKBrother assisting too - CHECKAfter opening chapter: flip to backstory of Parents, and narrator doesn't actually get born till half way through the book - CHECKNarrator goes through life with an unusual feature/deformity that distinguishes him from others - CHECKand so forth...Chapter One is a plain rip off, oops, I mean 'Homage'. The author then attempts to disguise it enough with 20c. Greek history to hide the roots of Sterne. Why aren't reviewers pointing this out? Read the original its far superior, funnier, and was written 250 years ago..Shame on Mr Eugenides and shame on Pulitzer for being so gullible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I read Moby Dick and that was boring. This one is a close second.The author seems to be obsessed about the incestuous relationship between a brother and sister and went to describe how she was turn on by his woody.

Well, there is a small section toward the end that is about such a person, but it's very short in relation to the size of the entire book, and it only covers a small part of the character's life. The remaining 90 percent or so of the book is an expansive history of the hermaphrodite's witless, boring, incestuous relatives and eugenides is careful not to leave out any of the details about their bungling, banal adventures. [...]another reason I purchased this dog of a book is that it won the pulitzer, being under the false impression that this indicated above-average writing. won't be making that mistake again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, and boring","review":"I bought this book because of all the positive reviews I've read on this site. I was expecting an entertaining and titilating story about a hermaphrodite. I am 3/4 through with the book and it has yet to develop the main character. The generational story of his/her greek immigrant family heritage is dull and flat. The characters are not well developed and frankly, none of them are likeable. To me it's like seeing the movie \\"The English Patient\\" ..an oscar winning film that was touted as superb by the critics, yet bored me senseless. I guess it's a matter of taste, but be forewarned it's not a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious At Best","review":"I chose to read this book because of someone else's recommendation. I was sorry I did. This book just dragged on from page one. I was really looking forward to reading Callie/Cal's story but for a good part of the novel all you get is a detailed family history filled with incest. That idea wasn't too bad but it was just too drawn out. I wanted to read more about Callie and I just didn't get it. Save your money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My New Favorites","review":"I love this book! The characters come alive and I found myself totally wrapped up in their stories. Eugenides tells a complicated yet endearing tale of incest, adolescence, and the struggle to belong. I was amazed by Eugenides ability to be the convincing voice of both Cal and Calliope. While the main character and narrator is a hermaphrodite, don't expect a lurid or freakish story... Truly a touching and funny book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Contemporary Fiction I've Read In Years!","review":"This spellbinding novel is informative, entertaining, and has just the right touch of dark humor sprinkled throughout. I couldn't put it down, and was sad to see it end. Cal is a protagonist for the 21st century, and you will find her...him... irresistable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior writing","review":"From the first few pages, the reader feels as though the protagonist is going to become his (or her) best friend. He (once she) confides his sexual secret immediately and then takes the reader on a journey through his past and subsequently, the reason for his physical/sexual dilemna.This is not a novel of perversion, but one of explanation, family devotion, ethnic description, historical perspective, and truly BREATHTAKING writing.It will be difficult to find a book to read after finishing this astonishing novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I loved this book.

If I did not enjoy our book club discussions so much, I might not have finished this one. So many good books, so little time. The writing seems a little cumbersome, and the story is just OK. I do think that the 2nd half was easier to read -- maybe it moved a little quicker, or I just got used to the author's writing style. Some Greek and Detroit history woven nicely into the story. Would've really appreciated the Detroit info more had I been familiar with the area. Not one I would pass along to friends and family, but one of the girls in my club is a third of the way through and enjoying, so, who knows?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful novel","review":"Georgously written, this book was a pleasure from the first word to the last word. The kind of book one hopes to find but rarely does. An uncanny account of a complex family, covering three generations. This is a must read for anyone that loves getting into intimate details of the characters and really caring about them on a highly intelligent level. This is honestly one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic and Fabulous!","review":"I couldn't put this book down...it's been a while since I've read such an epic and interesting novel. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"Killer book! Starts with a kind of lengthy backstory in Greece, but I actually liked that part a lot. I recommend this to anyone interested in LGBT, or anyone who just wants an interesting and entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly shocked","review":"I thought the writing was wonderful. The title \\"Middlesex\\" was certainly proper. I plan to read the author's other book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where to start.","review":"I was very excited about this book. I'll start out by saying that when the author responded to a question on Oprah about \\"having trouble\\" writing the book (it took nine years); I can tell.First off, I found an error that should have been found in editing. Remember the Sixty-niners poster? Before and after that poster graphic. A line is repeated. Careless.Not mentioning Cal's grandmother in the last half of the book and then explaining in a quick excuse...sloppy.I loved the first half of the book. Laughed out loud in some parts; but the second half seemed rushed.Loved the Detroit history, but thought Cal's little \\"tour\\" in his brother's car after coming home was cheezy and merely filler.That's the ticket. The second half didn't resemble literature to me...it just seemed like page filler. The main characters lost their character that they were so richly developed in the first half.Can't recommend it and can't believe the attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torturous read","review":"I love to read but found this book difficult to finish. If it wasn't for my book club, I would have given up on it. The author goes off on so many tangents that it is annoyingly frustrating. The first 200 pages could have been left out completely. The real crux of the story is buried in inconsequential details, infuriating details, unending details. The author really should have written several books instead of overloading this one with too much history. And he left out the stuff I really wanted to know, how did Cal live his life after finding out about himself? When it really started getting good, the book ended. I am surprised at how many stars this book got, very misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype about?","review":"I expected so much from this book! People at my book club RAVED about it. I trudged through it, expecting it to get better, and it finally did--in the last quarter of the book. Why did I have to trudge through 350 pages of Greek history to get to the meat of the book? I don't get it, and I certainly don't get what makes this book Pulitzer-worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much with too little.","review":"Eugenides attempts to make too much of too little plot and he shrouds this shortcoming in lengthy (and sometimes impressive) research ability. The Desdemona/Lefty backstory, while interesting, is not at all important to the purpose or direction of the novel and this reader feels as if the entire opening 200 pages could have been dropped to make this a much better read. As much as Euginedes feels like he needs to write a very lengthy, epic novel, he does not succeed but for the fact that he won a pulitzer as a result of such a poor year for fiction. The book is not terrible on the whole but it is not entirely engaging as popular belief would suggest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It!","review":"This book was just terrible!! I loved his book \\"The Marriage Plot\\", so I was looking forward to reading this one, which was so acclaimed, but I absolutely hated it. I hated the point of view, but mostly the incredibly ridiculous amount of extraneous detail that he put in, which only took away from the story itself, which was interesting. I stuck it out for half the book, hoping it would get better, but it didn't, and so I moved on to another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"I had great expectations for this novel after reading such glowing reviews but it was a disappointing read for me.

Sorry Mr. Eugenides, I really wanted to like your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So wordy","review":"My book club read this and I was so bored with it, so darn wordy!

It's written in an erudite highschooler's Vonnegutese. We have to wade through chapter upon chapter of unlikely incest and marriages in order to arrive at the narrator's rare genetic mutation...A great contemporary novel, in my view, is something like A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry. I state this so other readers will see where I am coming from. I got a huge kick out of The Quincunx by Charles Palliser.I suspect that a younger audience that hasn't read much would be impressed by Middlesex, or by themselves for finishing it. I nearly recycled it but decided to give it away instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's alright.","review":"I don't know what to say, really. Jeffrey Eugenides either hits a mark, or doesn't. I know it's easy to compare this to his other book The Virgin Suicides, seeing as he got success from that. However, while I find he may have some good plot ideas, he is not the kind of writer I enjoy. Eugenides writing doesn't strike chords with me, and I lost interest fast. Sadly, all I can say is it's a love or hate book and feel free to try it yourself. You may like it. I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"200 pages in...I still don't get it","review":"I read the first 200 pages of this book and wonder what all the delirious reviews are about. The plot is going nowhere, and I just don't see where this book is going. To me, it's just dull and I can't seem to develop any interest in the story or the characters. I'm going to skip the remaining 325 pages of this bool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy into the hype...","review":"I am soo glad that I took Middlesex out of the library instead of wasting my money on this dull, uninteresting and pretentious book.

I have to agree with what Courtney M. said about the first 100 pages or so being a little slow. If I hadn't read that comment before starting the book I may have given up. I'm so glad I didn't.Only complaint was, I wish we could have gone on just a little longer to see how Cal spends his time. The author did give you hints as to how things were going, but I wanted more.Definately read this book. Don't skip the slow parts in the beginning they make you understand the grandmother a little more. I think otherwise you would come out just hating her!This will probably be a book I re-read & I haven't done that with very many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"This is the best book I've read in a long time!

Well, I bought it, paid too much to have it shipped to Europe from the US and it has taken me 5 days to read maybe 20 pages. I HATE this book and do not understand the fuss.

Interesting to learn more about the life and experiences of a hermaphrodite. A history lesson at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enticing !!","review":"MIDDLESEXBy Jeffrey EugenidesMr. Eugenides' novel of a hermaphrodite is one of the most moving stories I've ever read. The story of a young girl named Cal, whose life is altered when discovered her true sex mistaken. We follow three generations of Greek immigrants to the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. Whose pursuit of success in a new land cost far more than heritage. As we learn the soul of the child, the mind and heart which conflicts, traveling alone, un-ravels the ills, and pain of a life of lies. Family secrets revealed, bring not only the courage. but curses of Desdemona and her husband Lefty. The writing is compact, and brimming with life, richness as curiosity of Cal's idyllic memories. You'll love and laugh at the characters in this story, their lives are familiar and their falls, benign of beauty, leave us in agony. Beautifully researched, the author weaves a heroic tale against a backdrop of war and American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking!","review":"What a wonderful journey! Middlesex took me a week to read...I could've done it in a day but was determined to savor every moment. Written so beautifully that I not just endured incest and numerous other unconventional sexual situations but in the end, had me rooting for everyone involved. I can't say enough about this book...just read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"immigration and its viscissitudes","review":"Though this book is narrated by a hermaphrodite, to argue that the book then is about a hermaphrodite or the condition that causes hermaphroditic people, is to miss the point of the book. Though Cal's condition is central to his character, it is only incidental to the narrative arc of the book; it is a symbol of the dysfunction with which he arrived at the point that he tells the story of his family's travails.This is really a story about ethnic strife, war, immigration, assimilation, materialism, social unrest, and, finally, making peace with one's past and heritage.At times funny, sad, ironic, and witty the novel investigates the attempts of the Stephanides family to come from Greece to the United States and assimilat themselves into the boiling cauldron that is the American dream.Where Eugenides excels in this novel is his descriptions of physical location and his characterization of the people populating the novel's pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middlesex","review":"I found the box to be somewhat interesting in terms of culture and customs with the beginning starting off well enough but it became somewhat tiresome as it progressed. Would have been better if it was written with a lot less words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck in the middle of MiddleSex","review":"Eugenides Pulitzer winning novel about a hermaphrodite (supposedly) is quite an ambitious story, but I'm thinking it's really a turn-on for those with more salacious apatites. Once I get over the literary trick that allows for the central character who's also omniscient, the only thing he seems to settle on is the variety of ancestors and their dysfunctional sexual relationships. Of course, there's also the occasional historical character who's thrown into the story for some kind of Forrest Gump effect.The writing is excellent, and the story may yet end up being wonderful. But I'm halfway through and I could care less about how the poor hermaphrodite will eventually tell his latest girlfriend about his mixed up genitalia. I wish you better luck than I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but Too Long","review":"The writer uses five examples when one would suffice, over and over and over. That makes the book a good read for the unemployed (the very educated unemployed) but not so good for people with jobs and kids. Have a heart, Eugenides. There are those of us to have to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great novel","review":"A powerful and complex story that shows gender identity is rooted within genes, physics, emotions, culture, community, and family background and structure. It shows that complex human beings cannot simply fit into scientific findings, norm, or social expectations. It is a great read and I stronly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Middlesex","review":"An American- Greek story complete with tragedy, drama, comedy, despair and love. Wonderfully detailed, the Stephanides' story is one \\"wild ride.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I really enjoyed this book and the perspective it gave to growing up as a hermaphrodite and not knowing anything was different about you. Cal is a character that you sympathize for, yet he doesn't want or need that. The beginning of the book was difficult to get the flow of, and therefore it took me a while to get into it.

Not a single member of the club enjoyed it and reviews all around were terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flowery","review":"I wanted to enjoy this book, but as the author discloses at the beginning, his work is very poetic and sappy, and he goes off on so many tangents, it is hard to follow the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost didn't finish","review":"Very disappointed in this book. I just can't understand how this book won a Pulitzer Prize. This is not so much the story of Cal and his gender identity but more of his family which just didn't need to be explained in such detail. The family background was important, but it took up too much of the book. Just too much in this book that didn't need to be there. And seriously, the sex scenes with the grandparents - what value did this add? I wanted to hear more about Cal and was left feeling empty. This could have been a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking, well-written, a little long.","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable read, unusual characters, all well-developed.

Very unique story line and amazing character development. Very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly researched and beautifully written","review":"First of all, there is no doubt in my mind that this book deserved the Pulitzer Prize. It was both brilliantly researched and beautifully written. Eugenides does so much more than tell the coming of age story of a hermaphrodite. He does so against the backdrop of three generations of Americans, from pre-war immigrants to their second generation baby-boomer grandchildren. Middlesex is a tale fo the American experience, from depression through to the eighties, where hermaphroditism almost becomes a metaphor for the cultural alienation that so many of us feel from the previous generations of our own families to the neighbours we grew up next to but differed from ever so slightly. If anything, it reminds us that the one true thing we share as (North) American is the experience of never quite feeling that we fully belong in the time and place in which we find ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard read, but well worth it","review":"his book was hard to get into a first because the story starts out with a brother and sister who want to marry, but as you learn the story of Callie, it is such a wonderful, heartbreaking, weird, erotic story that you can't help but want to find out what happens to her. I would recommend this book to anybody.Bonus, she has my name, so I liked that! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring long story","review":"To me there was nothing exceptional about this book.

I always pass on a book when done...this one I left in my hotel room trash bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book by Jeffrey Eugenides was an unexpected disappointment, when I read it after many friends suggested it. The setting was familiar to me, especially Petoskey and Bay View. My reading of it was depressing and sad. Even though I finished the book, I was left feeling down and that I was cheated. I still cannot figure what many others have found to be so interesting about Middlesex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, EuGENITALS, write something honest.","review":"How in the H-E Double Hockey Sticks did this book win the Pulizer Prize? I thought it was really bad--pretentious; full of flat characters (when a main character kicks it, I felt absolutely nothing); the main thrust of the novel, no pun intented, is a cheap trick (I only kept reading to see what the protagonist's genitals look like--hey, Bookie's human); FULL of $5 words and completely irrelevant details. The writing style is average, nothing special, and certainly nothing literary. And for all the research Eugenides did (and why did he have to include EVERYTHING he discovered in that research?), the early '70s portion of the novel is full of anachronisms. Nobody had feathered hair in 1974, and at that time, Meryl Streep was a movie star of the future. Bottom line: annoying, too long, too fakey-fake and TOO flat. All that said, there were two or three truly beautiful sentences in this cluttered-up book. Hey, EuGENITALS, write something honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was so boring, I don't see what all the fuss is about with this book.

This story is not about one thing, one person, one place, or one time period. Part of the story's beauty is its ability to weave together many pieces into one great story. I know a few who read this and were upset by some of the sexual/gender issues. But, that is not the focus of the novel. This novel truly is like a family. All of the pieces and parts come together to make what you read, but the story is more than the sum of its parts. And like all families, there are parts that might make you uncomfortable, but you don't give up on a person, or a novel, because of their past. I highly recommed this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"Middlesex is written in a modern, creative style, its characters are real and the story itself is engrossing. If you're looking for something a little different, something with a little of everything, give this book a try.My only warning is for those who expect a story that is solely or mostly about hermaphroditism--this is a well-rounded tale that encompasses several lives and experiences, over the course of two generations. In a sense it could almost fall into the genre of historical fiction. Personally, I found this added to the depth of the novel, and I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Unique and Fascinating to read.","review":"I couldn't put this book down from the very beginning! Eugenides follows the lives of the Stephanides family through three generations, and does it in a way that leaves the reader completely attached to the characters. His historical references are told with a believable point of view, and his writing is so eloquent that I had to stop reading for a minute just to contemplate the power of what he is saying. Most of all, the reader can really get the sense of who Cal (Calliope) is. You can hear his voice, even during the story of his grandparents and parents, and can really get into his mind as he grows up and transforms into what he discovers himself to be. Parts of the book are pretty difficult to get through, but that just leaves you even more attached to the main character. Overall, this book is just so beautifully written with so many metaphors. Eugenides really did his research and took his time with this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middlesex","review":"I loved tis book I thought it was a great rad and very well written.

But nothing happens. Or more acccurately, none of the things that happen matter. A city is destroyed, an incestuous couple fall out of love, a father dies in a slapstick car chase, and none of it sticks, none of it hurts. This is a smooth, easy, painless epic. A novel over five hundred pages long needs to break your heart a couple of times. The one complaint I'd heard was that the Greek family sections were great but the Cal/Calpurnia stuff never took off. For me, however, the Greek family didn't take off either. Eugenides writes very well and he had a great idea for a novel here but some kind of emotional/dramatic disconnect in his art has resulted in a weightless cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"If We All Could Understand Ourselves","review":"This is an excellent novel about self discovery, love, and human sexuality.

It's so fascinating to learn about Cal's life and what it would be like to feel all those mixed and confusing messages that we all feel growing up as a man or woman.

I couldn't put it down and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"genius","review":"It's simply a work of art. Eugenides' sentences are fluid and full of irony and depth.

There were a few times, in the middle, when I began to get a little bogged down in all of it, but I soldiered on, and was well rewarded for my effort.Cal's narrative voice is so engaging and unique, that had me hooked immediately. The descriptive force of this book is very powerful. Plus, let us not forget the \\"elephant in the middle of the room\\"--how many pulitzer prize winning novels about hermaphrodites are there?

When it stopped holding my PDA I took it a parts and found that gear shaft is bended because it was subjected to the high temperature inside the car meanwhile it is side-loaded by the racheting mechanism's spring.

What is worse about this book is the fact that he uses pious, flowery language without an ounce of content. A good and insightful Roman Catholic perspective on the Lord's Prayer is A. J.

I pray that music fans from all categories will enjoy Collin's music as much as I do and purchase this CD. I am very proud of Collin and consider him to be one of the best friends I have ever had.

This cd, however, will serve as a wonderful primer to those who have not yet listened to Collin's other work. The guy has nevere, EVER recorded a bad track. Once you hear this disc, you will buy all the other Collin Raye cd's. It's just that ggo. Whether he's belting out a rocker like \\"That's My Story\\" or making you fall in love again with a tune like \\"Love Remains\\" or \\"Love, Me\\", or even his so called preachy stuff such as \\"Little Rock\\" or \\"Not That Different\\" Collin grabs you and holds on to you.

All of you Americans should forget all about Nine Inch Nails and Korn and listen to this wonderful group from England. It's a shame that they don't get many recognition in the States, but then again most of the really good bands don't. Favourite tracks are \\"Trash\\", \\"Filmstar\\", \\"Lazy\\", \\"By The Sea\\", \\"Starcrazy\\", \\"Picnic By The Motorway\\" \\"Saturday Night\\" and of course, the best Suede single after \\"Animal Nitrate\\" in my opinion- \\"Beautiful Ones\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing pop ride","review":"\\"Coming Up\\" offers such a splendid display of Suede's exceptional vocal, lyrical, and musical talent. \\"The Chemistry between Us\\" is the perfect example of how Suede, after giving us two amazing albums, being stripped of its guitarist, and adopting a new pop style, still manages to spoil us with its genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely album","review":"i bought this album at first to impress someone (yes, i now know how stupid that was) i thought it was going to be a crappy album simply because i'd never heard any of their songs, and actually never even heard of the band. but when i got home, and listened to it, i fell in love with it. my favorite song is definitely By The Sea. it's so soothing and Brett's voice just soars. it almost reminds me of a lullaby, it's that beautiful. the rest of the album has an eighties feel, with songs like Trash, Filmstar and Beautiful Ones. even though i really dislike music from that period, Coming Up rises above that genre and is an absolutely wonderful cd. i really like the vocals, brett has a lovely voice that can contain so many different emotions and styles. it is a very impressive cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah, yeah...","review":"You can argue, with some validity, that with this album Suede's sound became somewhat more simple.

Unfortunately, I found \\"Coming Up\\" shallow and forgetable. After a few listens it becomes grating and I can't bear to listen to it anymore. \\"Saturday Night\\" is the nearest thing to previous glories but even that isn't quite there. Richard Oakes is just copying, and I'm not sure what Neil Codling adds other than to the song-writing effort. It hurts to slag Suede as they WERE one of my favourite bands and the first two albums will always be special to me (and I went to school with Neil Codling so it feels like I'm having a go at a mate) but really this album isn't very good.

Coming Up has 10 songs, all concise slices of Britain, but this time quite a bit cheerier. New guitarist Richard Oakes maintains Butler's impeccable technique but tightens it up to drive the songs. Standout cuts include Trash, Lazy, Beutiful Ones, Picnic by the Motorway, and Saturday Night.

The acting is not great (impressive considering the actors have almost nothing to do acting-wise). The actual filming of it varies from interesting to annoying (think Blair Witch Project), with emphasis on the annoying (lots of badly shot action, blank screens, slightly nauseating shaky cam).

That should have indicated to me to press \\"stop\\" on the dvd player. But no. I had to waste the full 90 minutes of my life. The entire dialog of this movie must fill only one page. The \\"story\\" is so obscure that the writers had to make a little cartoon animation at the end to explain it, and it still made very little sense. The guy crawls and climbs through various rooms, tunnels, tree roots, and goes nowhere. If this was a student film, the prerequisite being that the director had to use whatever rubber tubes, garbage bags, and tree branches could be found just lying around, and a strobe light, then OK. It might get a passing grade. But as a commercial release, nah. This movie should have been titled \\"crawl,\\" and boy, does it ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the.....","review":"I watched this.. expecting something cool like the cover.. you know.. alien trees or something.. .. what you is a confused mess of sea sick making camera work of someone slowly walking around in the dark.. .. then ends up on the surface.. and that is all there is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The movie had good acting and excellent special effects, even for today's technology.

It's one of those movies that have you saying, HMM! Make sure you watch 2001 A Space Oydessy first. If you don't the movie probably won't make much sense to you.

It was very creepy and atmospheric. However, I found myself to be infuriated by the idiocy of the Blu-Ray transfer. I hate dubbed movies. I believe that a movie should be watched as the director intended it to be seen, and in the language it was created in. I always watch foreign language films in the language with subtitles enabled. However, on this Blu-Ray, there is NO OPTION to watch the movie in the original language (French) without going into the special features and selecting it... IN STANDARD DEFINITION! In HD, one can only watch the English or Spanish dubbed version. To recap, a brilliant film and a truly despicable shortcoming on the Blu-Ray.

I guess that had to do with the picture of the Maroon Bells on the cover - which are nowhere near Rocky Mountain National Park.This book talks a lot about bringing pets into the park, obtaining permits, keeping mosquitos away, and what kind of camper I should buy. To me, this is pretty useless information. I need maps and route descriptions for day hikes. This book devotes less than 30 pages to that subject.I have a camper, I know what bug spray is used for and I don't take pets with me on hikes. If you've never been outdoors, there may be some useful information here, but it seems like common knowledge to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"This book is a dissappointment.

The story is engaging and like in all of her other books, there are commentaries on religion, society, and what not (which is not surprising to a Tepper fan) but I like this one best, along with Sideshow and Fresco. This book has a more coherent plot and style, and while not without its plot twists, made more sense than some of her other work like 'Gibbon's Decline and Fall' and 'The Visitor'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Familiar Tepper themes; a good read","review":"Tepper's themes (opression of women, ecology) are perhaps over-familiar from her other works, but this is a well-written and well-plotted book that holds the interest and is hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A struggle to read","review":"Nice plot and all, but the writing was boring.

Enjoyed a \\"mystery\\" in a rich fantasy setting. The exploration of sexist roles and the oppression of women is not a new area for her, but the characters, world, and story line are interesting enough to make this much more than a rehash of something she's written before. I was quite well entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foreshadowing shoulding be 90% of a book","review":"Tepper has two themes close to her heart.First, that some people (moslty those she doesn't agree with) should just be killed, they can't be reasoned with and punishment is just cruelty. (She's been preaching that, and killing off the religious types she disdains, since The True Game novels).Second, that the universe is filled with wonderful, loving, ecologically balanced aliens with only humans as the disruptive source (ok, she dropped that in Grass, but it is a constant theme otherwise).She writes well, but I long for something more from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to disagree with the rest....","review":"I have been reading Tepper for many years. This is by far one of her most predictable plot-lines. Anyone familiar with feminist thought will know exactly what is happening and why. The symbolism is too obvious. I like Tepper for her unusual connections and creations of complex new ways of viewing old worn out ideas. This book is sorely lacking in either. :o(I love Tepper, but not this book. I left it in a common room at a local college dormatory in a small Mormon town for whom ever wished to read it. I figured, knowing the lack of feminist education in the area, that the teen age girls who might pick it up might actually be enchanted or at least educated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful story!","review":"Can you believe she's turned out yet another marvelous book, so intelligent, humorous, moving, well-written, and always teaching us stuff that we have to learn over and over again, in a way that illuminates our own lives.

Otherwise, I might have formed an extremely negative opinion of the book given my experience with this one. Reading the book was a struggle, because the author's hostile views towards other views and women and the poor were shocking. I would be reading along and then it was like someone hit me in the head with a stick. I eventually gave up on it.

Faithful translations, the translation is as pure as mother's milk!I found the \\"The Journey of Self-Discovery\\" book (by the same author) extremely useful. I benefited a lot by first reading this as it gives the solid background information and was amazed to know that the author was a pesonification of greatness and turth! My recommendation is pick this one along with Bhagavad-Gita.I've read all best sellers (on leadership, personality development, self help, etc.) and numerous books on Psychology and Philosophy and belive me that these 2 books (Bhagavad-Gita & Journey to Self-Discovery) are unparalled. I've benefited much and it's been life changing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bhagavad Gita as it is . it is not as it is","review":"This version of the gita was commented by Prabhupada; a sincere truth seeker and leader of HK movement. The only problem is that along with any verse he writes 5 pages of comment; so this Bhagavad gita is not as it is but as he was able to see it. I am not arguing whether the commentary is good or not; the fact which remains is that this gita it is not \\"as it is\\". In order to get such a book you have to buy one without any commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are women inferior?","review":"This appeared to be an interesting interpretation, until I reached the page where the author, A.

If you can suggest, I will buy another book,just an english version of the original poem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and Good","review":"This book contains not only a translation of the Gita, but the original Sanskrit text, transliteration, and word-for-word translation. It's very useful for Sanskrit students wanting to have their own hand at translating this very popular Hindu poem.While I don't agree completely with the interpretation advocated in this translation by the Krishna Consciousness movement, it is interesting to read how others have interpreted the Gita.The meaning of each verse is explained, and further tidbits of interesting information is included. This book is well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows teen the way back to Godhead","review":"Hare Krishna! I am a 17 year old catholic-born high school student in new orleans. I have been searching for the Truth for many years and in many places.

I realized by reading this that Krishna is the source of all pleasure and I will continue to chant the Holy Names of the Lord. God bless you all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Distortion of a great spiritual treasure","review":"This is NOT the Bhagavad Gita (Thus it's deceptive title The Bhagavad Gita As It Is) but a cultish distortion. It twists the true meaning beyond recognition to serve the philosophy of the Hare Krishna Movement. Essentially the Gita teaches many paths to enlightenment whereas the Krishna Consciousness Movement claims the Gita endores only one, thiers. Read the Bhagavad Gita. Steer clear of this farce. One little tidbit should suffice: the Gita teaches meditation as a spiritual path--this commentary claims that mediation was only valid in the past 'when people lived 60,000 years, but not now with modern lifespans.' If you can swallow this sort of [fluff] you may be ripe for the Krishna Consciosness movement. Obviously all of the five star reviews are written by Krishna Consciousness devotees (who believe they can take 'easy journeys to distant planets'), so caveat emptor. Read the Bhagavad Gita, not this Bhagavad Gita As It Is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original word of God","review":"Amazing details. No interpretation, true to its title \\"As it is\\".Take this test: If, after reading the word of God, you come to the same conclusion that Arjuna came up with after hearing the Lord's word directly in first person, you know your conclusion is right and the Bhagavad-Gita you read didn't dilute or change the original message.You wouldn't get the same message in Bhagavad-Gita by any other author other than His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"As it Is\\" A Galling Misnomer","review":"Due to the enthusiastic proselytization of the Hare Krishnas in past decades, this old tome by Bhaktivedanta a common find, and its claims to authority seem to be validated by its sheer mass. However, the actual text of the Gita is considerably obscured by the Swami's highly sectarian rendering and commentary. This safely removes the text itself from the reader's gaze, and in its place the Swami substitutes his own polemic theology. While no one benefits from this enterprise except the ISKCON coffers, the most shortchanged are those who accept this dumbed-down version of Bhakti-marga as the authoritative end-all and be-all of Yoga. In that respect, this translation and ISKCON are subverting the greater traditions of Moksha and Dharma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purports spoil this book","review":"While purchasing this book, I was hoping this to be an unadulterated translation of the original Bhagavad Gita - and I must say I was disappointed. The author structures the book well, for each original verse in Sanskrit, the English transliteration, the English translation and \\"purport\\" come subsequently. The issue I have is with the author's \\"PURPORTS\\". In almost all \\"purports\\" , the author liberally uses the term \\"Krsna consciousness\\", which makes me think whether the purports actually convey the meaning of the verses or whether they convey author's version of meaning. I am inclined towards the latter, and I have stopped reading the purports and have focused on the translations alone. But the fact that purports occupy major portion of the book, I would recommend readers not to buy the book, if you plan to ignore the author's purports. I would NOT recommend this book, even for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bhagavad-gita as it is","review":"This book is not the original book written by A.C.

Bring back the original manuscript!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As It Is NOT","review":"I've read the Bhagavad Gita for 35 years and it has guided my life spirtually. This commentary (including aspects of the translation) is a travesty, a blatant attempt to twist the Gita's philosophy to justify the Hare Krishna movement's very screwy philosophy. The commentary bears the same relationship to the Gita as the Book of Mormon does to the Bible. It is so off base as to be laughable except for the fact that some unwitting soul may actually buy it thinking he's getting an accurate commentary on the Bhagavad Gita.

The purports, while helpful in some cases, I am finding to be incredibly obnoxious. Not only from an atheist's point of view, but from any person of differing opinion, the repeated sentences of \\"those too ignorant to understand,\\" or \\"less intelligent,\\" are starting to really taint this book. If I had wanted to understand how condescending this guy was, I could've figured it out some other way besides reading this book. It's a shame, because he is trying to convey the essence of Hinduism and the Krishna consciousness movement, and through his actions, making me wonder if this condescension is not an isolated occurrence..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nectar in Print","review":"I've read a couple other translations of the Gita, and and they seemed ok, but not anything special.

I had aready read about 50 yoga texts, and so I wasn't expecting to learn much more about yoga. Then this book blew my mind. I felt like a beginner, only this time with the right book. I'm reading it again now for the 8th time, and I read at least 1 verse every day. I wouldn't trade it for the whole world.

It is a page turner, a fast-paced (no-pun) read that is inspiring for runner and non-runner alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun book to read","review":"I do not know any one of my friends who are ultramarathroner and I believe I also can speak for 99.9% of them that they also know no one who takes up this sport. So it is rather intriguing to read about the experience of the author. The first part of the book is witty and fun to read. But it gets to be a little bored at the second half as the encounters, the feeling and the races themselves are becoming routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be entitled \\"The Graham Name\\"","review":"I really, really wanted to like this book.I was looking for a deeper understanding of the Name Above All Names - of Jesus. The role of a name in the Hebrew culture, the power inherent in Jesus, an exploration of the name God gives (Revelation 2:17).If you are looking for anecdotal stories of Franklin Graham's public appearances (Bush inauguration, Columbine memorial) or his public ministry, Samaritan's Purse, you may be satisfied with the book.I think Billy Graham is the finest evangelist of our generation and can't wait to see him when we all get home with the thousands of thousands he has touched for the kingdom of God. I applaud his heart for God, his ministry, his family, and his son.But this particular book didn't meet my expectations. I was hoping for more of Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Deluded","review":"Graham writes \\"the God of Islam is not the God of the Christian faith\\". Oh really? Graham has obviously not read the Christian Bible. The Name is Graham's attempt to give himself a aura of legitimacy. Most of the book is devoted to describing his recent \\"great moments\\". Graham Jr. has some big shoes to fill and this book and his inflamatory public statements proves he hasn't a clue how to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived on time as expected","review":"Light-weight, stylish and a much better solution than the bulky backpack. I have to carry a purse and a lunch bag as well so this was a perfect solution for me. I like the handles that can be tucked in or stay out.

She used it for 3 pages of her journal and then the pen ran out of invisible ink. UTTERLY USELESS AND DISAPPOINTING! What started out as one of the best presents with a fun and exciting purpose ended up as a disappointing let down. The idea of the journal is great, but the durability of it was a big let-down. In all fairness, maybe it was an anomoly. I don't know. I didn't contact the company to return it. Maybe they would have replaced it. But the point is....I shouldn't have to after 3 pages of writing in a journal."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Sometimes there really is a good reason why an album remains in relative obscurity. But these days, FOREVER CHANGES gets more than its share of attention thanks to some obviously burned-out hippies that have become music critics.This album does sound dated, stuck in the sixties like the Monkees. There is a weirdness to it which includes flamenco-style guitar and lyrics like \\"Oh the snot has caked against my pants/It has turned into crystal\\" (whatever floats yer boat), but most of it borders on ATONALITY as well as notes and chord progressions that simply DO NOT WORK. These characteristics make for an uncomfortable listen, but maybe I'd feel differently ON ACID."},{"rating":"1","title":"forgettable then, forgettable now","review":"I bought this album not long after its original release on vinyl. My own opinion: Arthur Lee didn't have much of a voice, his lyrics had all the subtlety and poetry of a jackhammer, David Angel's arrangements are some of the cheesiest ever recorded, and The Red Telephone and You Set the Scene are among the most embarrassingly awful songs in rock history. I'll never understand why many people now think this is a great album. It was undeniably creative in places but also hopelessly heavy-handed, and most of it literally makes me cringe. Other than Alone Again Or, I really *never* want to hear any of these songs again. To put this on the same footing with the best of Tim Buckley and Nick Drake is laughable in my view, let alone the Beatles and Dylan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"This album sounds like generic 60s oldies that you hear every time you go to the dentist or when your aunt is driving.The first two songs are good... but only good when compared to the rest of the album or the utter garbage of the period. Way back in '67, there was good music. There was great music... Beefheart, Hendrix, Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, the Beatles and Stones, the Doors, the 13th Floor Elevators, Scott Walker and the Walker Brothers, and the flippin' Velvet Underground. Syd Barrett was helming Pink Floyd at their best, Can were forming, Van Morrison was coming into his own, and Magic Sam was working it out. All in all, a very fertile period. Do not waste your time or money on this album. There's plenty of good stuff out there for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"California Sounds","review":"Like the Beach Boys \\"Pet Sounds\\", This album should be called California Sounds. It has the sound and the fervor of a California drive or a California night during the time period. The musical sections are beautifully put together and the singing is very good. This album was something i had never even heard of before. After i listened to it I decided to tell all my friends about it. It has great grooves and even better atmosphere. It is definately an album that is good for a long drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love - 'Forever Changes' (Rhino)","review":"Originally released in 1967,this was the band's third effort.'Forever Changes' appears to be one of rock&roll's all-time most under rated lp's.Probably because it's technically considered to be 'hippie music'.As for myself,I think of Love to be part folk rock and part psychedelic.Love's two main members are vocalists/guitarists Arthur Lee and Bryan MacLean(R.I.P.) and IF you ask me,I sort of believe that if Jimi Hendrix were alive today,he'd be a lot like Lee.As I've listened to this reissue several times,I think I may like the seven added bonus tracks AS MUCH as I did the actual album.The most memorable tunes are \\"Alone Again Or\\",\\"The Red Telephone\\",\\"Bummer In The Summer\\" and the bonus cuts,\\"You Set The Scene\\" and \\"Your Mind And We Belong Together\\",which are both extended random studio rehearsals.Nice!Should appeal to fans of Moby Grape,Airplane,Buffalo Springfield and The Zombies."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could this happen?","review":"Forever Changes is one of the all-time great albums. Can someone please explain why both the ordinary CD and the remastered have changed the ending of 'A House Is Not A Motel' from a dramatic sudden moment to a bland fade-out? This is nothing less than musical vandalism. Rhino, please put this right! The remastered CD is missing one of the best moments on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated and sounds dated","review":"This album is not bad but it is no masterpiece.

UFO does a cool version of this song."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a masterpiece???","review":"This is a 5 star \\"masterpiece\\"????I just cannot believe all the accolades and sky high rhetoric written about this hunk of junk!! This album sounds like the soundtrack of some C grade wannabe hippie movie made in the late 60s that fails miserably and is already outdated when it comes out (you know the type).

This album captures the 60's like no other. The lyrics paint an era perfectly, especially 'You Set the Scene'.

I recommend this album in any format wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sounding Version of This Record?","review":"One of the greatest albums issued in the '60s and one that retains 100% of its impact. Deserves to be heard by everyone. I've been playing the original since it was issued in 1967 and it still grips me every play. This reissue has greater dynamics and is arguably better sounding than the original. Not surprising since it was mastered by Chris Bellman at Bernie Grundman Mastering and pressed at RTI. It goes without saying that it sounds better than any CD version...ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Great","review":"When this record came out in 1967, it immediately went on to my top ten list of favorite records. Many changes have been made to that list over the years, but this one has always remained on it. The remastered CD is beautiful. There were a lot of great records made in the late 60's and early 70's. Love was a group that did not get a lot of airplay, but deserved to be heard. If you have never listend to Forever Changes, it is well worth the purchase. Arthur Lee created one great record."},{"rating":"1","title":"A priceless journey to a time when the music was real....","review":"When I put the disc in my C.D. player, it would have been a lot safer if I had been home instead of driving my car. My Porsche quickly morphed into a VW Beetle with a peace-sign painted across the hood. Goose-bumps rippled up my arms as a rush of warmth overcame me. The vocals and guitar pushed me through the openning of the time-warp as I was thrust into an era I still miss dearly. This album is nothing short of SUPERB! I still don't know how I got to work that day. Arthur Lee and the band had IT. Tomorrow I'm going to unwrap Bathing at Baxter's and listen to it on my drive. With any luck, I'll end up in Frisco...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arthur Lee-Love MASTERPIECE","review":"I know-this needs no detailed intro or extensive review-I'll just say it is one of the greatest albums ever made and it got me through some of my best worst times as a teenager.

The greatest album by the master mind and GENIUS ARTHUR LEE."},{"rating":"1","title":"great album, bad quality","review":"Please, spend a few extra dollars and get the new Rhino edition. I was unfortunate enough to buy this version only one month before the new one was released. The sound quality on this is atrocious. I repeat, do not buy this version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really good to have the alternate mix","review":"I am satisfied with this release, particularly the alternate mix, which puts the rhythm section in the center, and splits the guitars between left and right channel. This is a much more \\"contemporary\\" mix, and has both more power and allows the listener to hear how the guitars compliment each other. However, this remaster isn't really better than the 2001 reissue, on which the sound was exemplary. I am not necessarily condoning a louder mix, but this is mastered much softer than that release, and seems to lack some of the detail that remaster offered. It is NOT an audio upgrade of the 2001 remaster! However, it does offer the remix, and since the original multi-tracks have disappeared, probably forever, this is probably all we will ever get. If you are really a fan of this album, you will want the alternate mix; it is truly a great listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album You Never Heard!","review":"The first time i heard this album i was hooked, and it never gets old. The fact that most people are unaware of Love and Forever Changes is sad, this album deserves to be in the same class as Sgt. Pepper. The first time i heard this album was three years ago, when my dad bought it. I am 23 and i have turned all of my friends onto it, and they all love it too. As for which songs are my favorites, they all are. This cd is also the perfect soundtrack for driving around Los Angeles, or California in general. I don't know if that is what Love had in mind, but it sure fits!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love","review":"Love is such a cool band.

Pepper\\" and Hendrix's \\"Are You Experienced?\\" in terms of truly groundbreaking albums of the 60's. That Love is barely remembered, much less regularly worshipped, comes as something of a mystery to anyone who has heard 'em.Then Rhino comes along and puts \\"Forever Changes\\" through the reissue mill: turn up the bass for a supposedly fuller sound, throw on a handful of studio outtakes and less successful singles, and jack up the price by five bucks. Then take the original version of the CD completely off the market. They did the exact same thing to \\"Dusty in Memphis\\" last year.Do yourself a favor: go out and buy the vinyl version and hear a work of art as the artist wanted you to hear it. No album on Earth ends as well as the original version of \\"Forever Changes,\\" with the life-affirming trumpet lines of \\"You Set the Scene\\" fading out gradually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edición de lujo","review":"Puede resultar un tópico, pero este disco SI es un clásico. Se ha escrito mucho sobre Love, sobre Arthur Lee, sobre las circunstancias que rodearon la grabación, las comparaciones con los Doors, etc. Sólo voy a añadir que esta edicción SI es de lujo. Contiene en el primer cd el disco remaesterizado, buen sonido, y en el segundo otra mezcla del disco y esos temas recuperados de maquetas, singles, etc. Buen documento sonoro. En ocasiones, ciertas edicciones supuestamente \\"de lujo\\" contienen un cd con un sonido muy similar al de la serie media y el segundo cd es un concierto o cualquier grabación que lleva navegando meses por la red. En este caso, afortunadamente, no es así. Como en el BOX SET de The Doors, el libreto también merece la pena."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Great!","review":"I first became a LOVE fan after hearing their 2nd LP; Da Capo. Loving 'Forever Changes' is very easy to do. Among my favorite LP's of ALL TIME!I own every LOVE lp and cd available to the masses.Unfortunately, for me, I grew up in the East Coast and never saw LOVE perform LIVE until Arthur Lee re-grouped, and I moved West and flew to Portand, OR to experience his live show in 2003.It's unfortunate Bryan is gone, but that show gave me goosebumps! How Arthur was able to duplicate that 60's LOVE sound was unreal!Forever Changes, in any form, is a MUST for anyone into Serious GOOD Music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums of all time.","review":"I have listened to this album so many times it makes me dizzy. But every time I listen, I am moved. Any self-respecting music listener who does not own this better hurry up and get one. Amazon.com has it at a great price. You might try the 2 cd set, Love Story if you want more of Love, and you should. I don't care what any critic says about Arthur Lee, this music is classic, great, genius. The Love Story set includes the entire Forever Changes and is well worth the money. I encourage people who like classic rock music, who like great singing, to give the group Love serious consideration. If you like the Beatles, Jethro Tull, the Byrds, Jimi Hendrix, Simon and Garfunkel, the Doors, Velvet Underground, Bob Dylan, you will definately love Love.

This was the case with me and Da Capo, an LP long ago left behind. Now, I have the pleasure of seeing my kids, 17 and 20, respond to this music. This isn't postmodern pastiche rock, ala Beck and other talented borrowers and adapters, but rough and immediate music from the golden area of this form.

This will not make you grind against a wall or a hot brotha. It will not make you move until you sweat. You won't say, \\"Serve the children!\\" when you hear this. It's just mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has been very helpful to me!!!!!!!!:):)","review":"This is a great book for young jump or nonjump riders like me!

As an honest, even-handed look at the history of the CIA...nah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced!","review":"The paperback version requires initial setup, paper and ink. The Kindle version requires only setup. So which one is available for $6.00 and which one is available for the low, low price of $24.99? Not what you'd expect. I bought the paperback version for $6.00 rather than pay the ridiculous amount asked for the Kindle version. The publisher ought to be ashamed! They should take lessons from Baen books who makes ebook versions available very inexpensively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio not the proper format","review":"This loudly lauded, enthusiastically acclaimed novel has been a disappointment at least in the audio format. It is one of those books where the reader needs to be able to turn back to re-identify characters or re-read certain sections for clarity.The numerous characters often appear out of nowhere with obscure code names, which is confusing. A most offensive/annoying feature is that the reader manages to mispronounce nearly every single foreign phrase, place name and reference. With the obviously lavish budget spent on a publicity campaign for this book, was the compnay unable to find anyone who can pronounce \\"Calabria\\" ? Continual reference to the character as the Ca-LAY-bri-an was jarring. I don't know that I would have enjoyed this novel in print, but I would not recommend the audio version under any circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story; weak writing","review":"Littell spins a good yarn, but he can't write dialogue to save his life. The inanities and cliches he puts in his characters' mouths are groan-producing and virtually destroy any sense of reality he creates with his plotting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks depth for its length","review":"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was anxious to read The Company. Now having read it, I am logging on to report my dissatisfaction. For a book of this length and the time it takes from your life to read it, it does not deliver. Although it covers major events in US history since WWII, it offers only the most sketchy analysis. Character development is terrible. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Great Story, But Count the Typos!","review":"This book was one great read, and my only wish was that it was longer. Littell tells a good tale, although many of his characters are lacking in much personality; they're by and large props for relating the storyline. But in the end, that doesn't detract from the tale told. What is detracting---and downright embarrassing for a publishing house, I should think---is the sheer number of typos! They're everywhere! Sometimes they're just obvious little typos, but at other points they change the sense of a sentence and leave you questioning what was meant to be said. I have never read a book with so many typos. It's certainly discredit to the author of such a fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have the time, a good read","review":"THE COMPANY is a great read about the history of the CIA, if you can make it to the end of its 896 pages. Littell's protagonist, Jack McAuliffle is the all-American boy turned spy trying to survive Berlin, Cuba, and the Middle East while trying to stay ahead of the Russian mole hidden deep in the CIA fabric. Following McAuliffle, and his mentor \\"the Sorceror,\\" the plotline is simple--every battle, every intelligence confrontation from the 50s through the 70s seemingly finds the Russians winning. And yet McAuliffle preserves, and in the end the Wall comes down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much book, too little content","review":"Although I had read some decent reviews of this book, I found it to be way too long and very poorly written. The book manages to touch on many topics/activities/individuals over its 40 year time span, but there is little continuity and no depth to the characters, with a result that feels more like the checking off of an inventory of story ideas than a well thought out, well developed novel. The only aspect of this book that is worse than its story develpment is its editing. The copy that I received not only was missing some 30 pages, but was rife with factual, grammatical and spelling errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding story","review":"This is one of the best \\"spy\\" stories I have read in quite awhile. Mr. Littell is one of the best writers of the genre and I have never been dissappointed by any of his books. This is a lengthy story, but one that is hard to put down. The characters are very real and present a side of the spy business that we never see in movies or television. I particularly like the depiction of James Angleton. I read a biography of this man many years ago, and found his character in \\"The Company\\" to be true to life. The plot covers a lot of ground, from Berlin in the aftermath of WWII, to the Russian conflict in Afghanistan, with a detailed treatment of the bay of pigs disaster. The story grabs you, however, and moves along well. Once you finish it, you will wish that it had lasted even longer.If you are a fan of spy stories or want to know more about the workings of the CIA, then this is a book you need to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pop fiction and more","review":"Liked it better than Mailer's Harlot's Ghost.

I wanted it to live up to it seeming potential. In the end this novel was a waste of time and a disappointment. This is a big book that traces the lives of a group of CIA operative from the post-War era to the present. Littel sets the story, covers the details, and gets you interested. The next thing you know Littel has spun out some amateurish and unbelieveable plot line, complete with factual mistakes and details that don't ring true. Littel is a reasonably talented writer who just can't tell a story or who doesn't really have a story to tell. To compare him to LeCarre or even Alan Furst is just plain wrong. The Company is just a waste of time. Too bad. This could have turned out to be a hell of a book in the hands of a better writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Detail, but Ultimately Unsatisfying","review":"There were parts of The Company I greatly enjoyed; Littell clearly did his research when writing this sprawling epic of the Cold War, but the book's somewhat plodding pace and poorly-defined characters hurt it greatly.The book starts of on a high note - an exfiltration of a Soviet agent goes wrong and the CIA agents are forced to flee for their lives; this results in a hunt for a mole within MI6, the British Intelligence Agency. Unfortunately, it can't hold the tension as it veers off into more conventional action sequences, having characters play out parts in events such as the Hungarian Revolution and the Bay of Pigs.Many of the characters are little more than archetypes - the shoot-first action junkie, the jaded field agent, etc.Littel's eye for small details makes it an interesting book, but as a Cold War spy novel, it doesn't hold up well to many of LeCarre's work from the same period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"A little slow in the beginning, the book really takes off.I expected it to be another spin on tom Clancy tpye gendre, but found I hate to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant-A Book For Our Current Times","review":"As soon as I saw Robert Littell's name, I knew \\"The Company\\" would be a wonderful read in espioniage, beyond LeCarre, etc. (I still have on my bookshelf one of his earlier books (1973) \\"The Defection of A.J.

No, I am not a member of the spy community, but I have lived through several generations, and I can attest that he knows from what he writes.

Hallmarks of CIA thinking.Book was intended to be a hatchjob on James Jesus Angleton and by CIA standards for effectiveness it may have succeed.Nonetheless, it is a screwy piece of writing. At the outset - in 1949 or thereabouts - the book's hero is driven down I-95 to a training camp. Alas, the interstate highway system was not even begun until the middle or end of the Eisenhower presidency. There was no I-95 in the 1940s.Later, our dauntless CIA staff disguise themselves as ConEd maintenance staff purportedly working on a street. Alas, the street is Wisconsin Ave. in Washington, D.C. where a ConEd uniform might attract a little attention.After reading those errors, I simply tossed the book on the basis that this was just another CIA drone trying to settle a few scores...something the CIA seems to have as a an obession - rather than getting its job done and keeping quiet. The book is every bit as inept as the recent CIA staff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stars & Stripes forever","review":"It's a shame that the CIA is belittled by this book considering the fact that it's the CIA along with our military that put their lives on the line day in and day out so that we can live in a safer country and world.

Historical figures are incorporated into the story to give it texture and heighten the drama. Apart from all this, the book also educates the reader and makes for serious thinking, inasmuch as the cold war incidents described occurred when most of us were simply too young to experience them. The questions implicitly raised about what happened behind the scenes are fascinating. If you like Le Carre, Furth or others in the spy genre, this book is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Page Turner","review":"I spend a lot of time on planes, and always buy a book before flying. However, rarely do I find a book that motivates me to keep reading rather than watching a movie or sleeping.The author presents an interesting faction mixing known history together with fiction and his own slant on what may have happened. As the story unfolds it becomes a ripping yarn that you just want to continue and continue.I have read a several books about the CIA recently. The Bob Baer book, based on his personal experience as an agent in the field was a great book to have read prior to embarking on this one.I would heartily recommend this book. There are very few books these days that grab your attention from the outset and then keep on accelerating the pace.

My only concern is that the character plug ins wont be able to handle the abuse by pre school standards..and the connection site with the characters wont handle the kiddie \\"man\\" handling..but we havent tested it yet! great service! we'll be back!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea","review":"I bought this for my 4 year old son. He really likes it and I love that it locks the rest of my computer. He loves going to the kid websites and playing. Many of the websites have ads on them one click and he is off to a place he shouldn't be. The launch pad locks all of those, he simply gets a ding when he tries to click on them and he goes on to something else. The launch pad also has nice parent controls like turning on/off the printer and setting a timer. It does have limits though you can only go to those 3 websites. Fisher-Price has already put out three more double packs to expand the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surreal","review":"I picked up this Ludlum at the airport on the way to Switzerland. Prior to beginning the book, I had had no idea that the story was set in the Switzerland/Austria region . I felt myself really drawn to the descriptions of the places and people, so that even though some were ficticious names and places, there were enough real places mentioned to lend to the \\"believability\\" of the piece and give \\"a ring of truth\\" to it all. It made it seem just a bit surreal to leave the Zurich Flughafen(airport) and head towards \\"St. Gallen\\".. and pass signs to \\"Chur\\" on the way.Wow!! I'd just been there in the book...I like that Mr. Ludlum does enough research on the places that he takes you to, so that you can really see it in your mind's eye"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sinister plot, worthy of Dr. Evil","review":"The book starts out well enough when banker Ben Hartman, in Switzerland on business, runs into an old college buddy who tries to kill him. Then through a series of accidental discoveries, narrow escapes, and unbelievable coincidences, Hartman learns that practically everybody he knows, and everyone new he meets, is involved in an evil cabal bent on world domination.When you finally find out who the criminal mastermind is, it seems like something only Austin Powers' nemesis Dr. Evil could have pulled off. Without giving too much away - I have to say that the ending involves the hero attempting a daring rescue from the villain's heavily-guarded, secret mountain lair. And of course there is a scene where the villain feels the need to carry on a long monologue to explain his evil plot to the hero. Yeah baby, yeah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The last Ludlum (?)","review":"I've been a fan of Robert Ludlum's ever since the original publication of \\"The Scarlatti Inheritance\\", many years ago. Sure, I know that his plots are often preposterous, the characters wooden, and the dialogue often quite stilted, but I really don't care! The man told a terrific story, one that kept me interested from beginning to end. Along the way I was given a glimpse of many interesting places in Europe (especially) and around the globe. The books were entertaining, and that's all I really ask from this genre. I either heard of read that there many be a few more Ludlum-completed works around, for publication in later years. That's some consolation to such a faithful reader as myself. If, and when, they are published, I'll read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Light, Quick, typical Ludlum novel","review":"Too many reviewers have criticized this novel stating it is \\"Predictable\\", \\"Slow\\" or not well developed, I would say these people are not Ludlum readers and are looking for a different writting style.I would not say it is Ludlum at his finest, but it is definitely a good, fast paced and entertaining read. The Sigma Protocol contains the typical international intrigue, good looking sexy characters, conspiracy theory, chase scenes, etc. that you could expect from Ludlum.If you want deeply developed characters and pages of profound filosophical thoughts, go read Le Carré. If you enjoy Ludlum or Forsyth and are looking for a light read, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action","review":"Ludlum will always be my favorite fiction writer.

The writing is incoherent and the story is irrelevant for our times. As a long time Ludlum fan, I am very disappointed; I found this book to be annoying, not suspenseful. For anyone just discovering Ludlum, I'd suggest his earlier works. For anyone just discovering international thrillers, I'd suggest Vince Flynn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I'm a big Robert Ludlum fan however, the Sigma Protocol hardly compares to any of his previous works.

The turns in the plot become more gratuitous. The narrow escapes from death become more far-fetched. Little mistakes in the writing become more annoying. The idea of a secret organization pulling the strings on the major events of the world gets more silly in the 21st century.Nevertheless, I will miss further writings by the author. I wish the publishers had paid him more respect by noting his passing in the book's flyjacket rather that referring to him as a living author."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable and preposterous","review":"If you want to waste time reading a book you've read before--probably many times before--then this one is for you. It's 600+ pages of formulas and cliches. All-powerful industrialists conspiring to rule the world. The high-tech creation of a new master race. A one-man rescue and destruction of the Evil Empire ensconed in an impregnable Alpine castle. A mind-numbing progression of traps, blackmail and false identities, all of which are easily anticipated by the reader (but not by our heroes). This book has it all--unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out interesting but getting boring after 10 chapters","review":"I bought this book for my extended trip in countries where english reading material is hard to come by. The books starts out to be interesting with a promising plot but after 10 chapters it gets to be repetitive and pretentious with all the foreign languages, exotic locations and throw in some liberal spin (e.g. one of the main characters is female of mexican ethnicity who was raped by an anglo in high school, whose mother was illegal immigrant cleaning houses...). Then more about corporate conspiracies. After a few repetitive plot lines like this, i just feel this is amateurish and lack of depth. Conan Dolyle's Sherlock Holmes this book is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wild West moves to Switzerland","review":"Robert Ludlum transforms \\"Verhuete Laerm!\\" idyllic Switzerland into a wild west shoot-out backdrop where bullets buzz around the peaceful citizens in the streets of Zurich. Yes, the plot moves at a breakneck pace and overdone brutality is the author's key ingredient. With political correctness, the old ... who are suckling the secret of eternal youth must meet their overdue demise. Go ahead and read it and don't say I didn't warn you! Gerborg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I tried my best to enjoy Ludlum's Sigma Protocol, but towards the end I found myself struggling to finish the book.First of all there are WAY TOO MANY INSIGNIFICANT CHARACTERS. From the first moment a new character is introduced, to the next time you read about that character again, you forget his/her significance because so many other characters are thrown in between. I had a very hard time trying to remember who's who and their role in the story.Furthermore, I didn't sense any chemistry between Ben Hartman and Ana Navarro. I could only believe they were growing close because the story calls for you to logically believe so. After awhile, I honestly didn't care about their mission.Word to the wise, if you're going to tackle this book, have a notepad handy to take notes.

The writing was clumsy and forced, and this proved to be distracting in many instances. The book was full of poorly researched technical info (Versed is an opioid??), mock-heroic and comic-book villain dialogue, and seemingly endless contrivances designed to stretch the plot out to over 600 pages. It did not approach the quality of the Bourne novels. There was some fairly interesting dialogue and information about the moral conundrums faced by both Germans and Jews during the holocaust, and at times I really liked agent Navarro. But these good points were overwhelmed by the overall silliness of one yawner of an action sequence after another. I became so tired of this that I skimmed the last 100 pages, unable to focus any longer during a time that should have been the most riveting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Ludlum","review":"I stopped reading Robert Ludlum several books back as they were tedious and boring.

Unfortunately the script has no real depth and there is no opportunity for the viewer to connect with the characters and actually care what happens to them. This is lightweight drivel! It is neither a romantic \\"chick-flick\\" nor a highbrow arthouse movie, in fact it doesn't really know what it wants to be. Quite why either of the leading men would be remotely interested in Demi Moore's character I just don't know! Don't waste your money..........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance","review":"I think most Americans might have a hard time with this film because it is like a foreign flick - French type of film - where the movie is character driven. After all the crap Demi did after Ghost, she took a chance on this film and she worked with actors not there to be celebrities. They are just masters of their craft and she kind of is better because of them. I think women would appreciate this film the most. don't write it off because you didn't see it in theaters. Rent it if you can. I will buy it at one point because this is a film I would go back to again. I love her dress in this film because her body was actually covered in an eclectic way - she stepped outside of her comfort zone and she isn't covered in heavy make up.Character films are good to see as much as the action packed and others because they all give us different perspectives and widen our point of view on life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Chick Flick","review":"I absolutely rank this in my top 5 favorite movies. For many people, we think about the road not taken...or the man we didn't marry etc... This movie is amazing in that you get to see Demi live two different lives and you don't know which one is real. They are both perfect lives in their own right and you struggle along with the characters. This is a great chick flick and also a great movie for men who want to earn bonus points with their girlfriends (if the women are sentimental). Get this movie and watch it with your girl...she'll adore you for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"This one may have been the final nail driven into the coffin of Demi Moore's career.

It is intelligent, intriguing, mystical, and thought provoking. I just wish more producers, directors, actors, etc. would realize there is an audience for movies that aren't just by men, for men. Not this men wouldn't love this movie as well, (my husband did) but there are so many books out there about supernatural experiences, time travel, love relationships, etc. that you'd think people would get the hint that there may be an audience for movies about the same types of things.

This would have been an interesting movie if the premise had not been done SOOO many times (I actually liked Sliding Doors, maybe it was the company). Ms. Moore is hopelessly out of her depth as an actress portraying a women with serious issues, and her attempts at introspection are seriously laughable (hopefully that is not an oxymoron).

But then you realize how grossly overrated they are, and how awful their tracks on this record are. The Who tracks are alright, if you like the Who. Highlights include the Neil Young track, and Aimee Mann's contribution,is her most moving ballad of her career. Other than that this Cd is worthless. The Elvis Presley track is pretty much an overrated outtake. The same goes for Bob Dylans tune, Shelter From the Storm. Paul McCartney has not written a good song since he left the Beatles. His Name Is Alive (who are they?) is very lame. The rest is nothing special either.

Hersh, Donelly, Narcizo and Langston... brilliant songwriters, masterful musicians, and an ear for the perfect song. Their ability to create haunting pop music with a mixture of carefully constructed key changes and at times scattered vocals. is unlike any other band I have heard. Kristin and Tanya compliment each other well, Leslie's soothing bass is no more evident than on their self titled debut, and David drives this quartet along with a style of drumming reminiscent of many a brass band.

Just awful.The experience got worse trying to take advantage of the \\"limited lifetime warranty\\" from Farberware. Their 800 number is just a recording that promises you necessary information and then starts over from the top without providing any actual information. In other words, it's an endless loop promising you details on how to seek service but then looping again. Before it starts over, it suggests you try their website . . . which also has no actual information about warranties or how to get service.

Anyway, this was an entertaining look at all of the Peanuts characters, mainly on the baseball field and during a spelling bee.

However, the Kindle editions of his books that I've read so far - Executive Orders, Clear & Present Danger, and Hunt for Red October are all lousy.The publisher obviously did not make ANY effort to proof-read the Kindle edition before release. There are many hundreds of typos in each book - missingspacesbetweenwords, ex tra spac es inse rted into words, swapping \\"e\\", \\"c\\" and \\"o\\", etc. It looks like the books were scanned and converted by an automated process and OCR software, but no human ever looked at them, and they didn't even run a spell-checker on them.Absolutely no professionalism in this publisher. Clancy should take his books to a better publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy's worst effort","review":"It's surprising that other reviews have mentioned his misogynist attitudes and not his Islamaphobic themes as well. I suppose that most Americans agree with his views on Islam and Muslims but it remains that this book is downright hateful. Even without his overplayed biases, the book is much too long, plodding, and even boring in many parts. What happened to this once-fine author?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZ!","review":"Ryan didn't enjoy being president but felt it was his duty. Well I know how he felt, I felt I had to read the one Clancy novel I hadn't gotten around to but I didn't enjoy it much. Ye Gods! It was as if Ryan was REALLY the president and we had to read every newspaper story of every crisis or roadblock thrown in his way. It isn't going to happen because of all the $$ Clancy makes for his publisher but it would be nice if someone told him he needs an editor with a very big axe. No wonder he's been linked with Stephen King in some articles lately, neither one has an editor who can say \\"No\\". I'll still read his next one though; duty calls."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to the Clancy techno-thriller collection!","review":"Classic Clancy! Continuing the Clancy tradition of intenational intrigue, Clancy puts Jack Ryan in the world's most powerful, yet vulnerable position. Tom Clancy is a master of knitting together international politics, military insight, technological savvy, and thrilling spy drama. Before reading this novel, I would recommend reading all the other \\"Jack Ryan\\" novels from Clancy. \\"Executive Orders\\" draws from these other works frequently and the reader won't want to miss any of the exciting elements that are alluded to here.Bring on some more, Tom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long book, but a good one at that.","review":"Executive Orders is 1,358 pages long. Not a book for the easily distracted. It took over a month and a half to read.President Jack Ryan is a wonderful character, and in spite that I disagree with the character's political views, I can't help but wish that we had a real Jack Ryan in the White House. The other characters such as Cathy Ryan (the first lady), Andrea Price, John Clark and Ding Chavez are great characters also. It confronts a lot of issues, such as chemical warfare, the media, and political intergity. The plot is outlandish enough to be interesting, but down to earth enough to be believable.I found the war scenes near the end of the book to be boring and too complicated. They don't help the plot one bit. This is the only weakness the book has, and otherwise, it is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"the effort & time needed to finish the book is not worth it.","review":"This is the first Clancy novel I have read and I was quite disappointed by this novel. The lack of an editor clearly shows in this 1300 page door-stopper in which T.C. flows from one subplot to another in a matter of a few lines. This makes it too hard to follow the different storylines and this back and forth style does nothing to impart suspense or inttrigue (maybe so if it were a T.V. show or movie). Several subplots prvoved to be anticlimactic or irrelevant to the major plotline. Mix in ALOT of T.C.'s endless ranting about the needs of today's government, and you have a recipe for overrated and bloated political fiction. I think Clancy is too big-headed for his own good and needs to take a long break and read books outside of his genre for refreshment ( I recommend A Game Of Thrones by George R.R. Martin)."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you want to kill your time - read it!","review":"His good guys are soooo good - they save the world every now and then, they are very caring, extremely honest. I guess they all have big and clefted chins, blue and terribly sincere eyes. His bad guys are really bad. I wonder, why he did not put scenes, where some bad Iranians or Iraquis would devour alive small defenseless children with large and sad eyes? And just for the information of Tom Clancy: DNA and RNA consist of nucleic bases rather than aminoacids. He really needs an editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Clancy's best -- but still wonderful.","review":"I enjoyed the drama of Executive Orders. Clancy's pace hooks me every time. For the first time ever, I listened to the cassette of a Clancy book before reading it. Much credit should go to Edward Herrmann, who does a superb job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too long","review":"The usual Techno-thriller that Clancy is so good at writing becomes lost in this overdrawn highly conservative book. Much of the story line was hackneyed and has been previously overdone. I found myself merely wishing for the pages to end so that I could find something more worthwile of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"End of the Jack Ryan saga?","review":"Following the life of Jack Ryan has been interesting, and his succesfull pursuits of evil have always been justly rewarded - by promotions within the system. He has now reached the ultimate rank in the World of Clancy: President of the United States. The last page of \\"Exective Orders\\" have been turned, the enemy has been beaten, and we are left to wonder America will be rebuilt after the disasters inflicted upon her during the last two novels from Tom Clancy's hand. But that is another story for another type of book, perhaps with another hero.We can now only hope that Jack Ryan is sincere in his wish to retire and become an ordinary citizen again. I also hope that Tom Clancy will employ his considerable writing skills in introducing a worthy succesor to Ryan, one whom we can trust not to reach the Presidency too fast and thus keep us entertained for some years to come"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!","review":"Without a doubt this is the best book I have ever read. It is suspenseful, exciting, and will blindside you with unexpected events. If you like to read this is the best book for you. I would recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A predictably disappointing bore","review":"Having read a couple of Clancy's previous novels I had a fair idea of what I was letting myself into upon reading EO: Yank-loving, rest-of-the-world bashing nationalist literature. Now in this novel Clancy gives himself what appears to be a lifelong ambition: control of the US. Now he finally has his chance to show all those politicians the way to really run a country! Which in this case would be badly, a return to the bleak old days of the Reagan era. The storyline is monotonous and is dragged on far too long and Clancy's right-wing militant view of the world is just getting boring. A terrible novel which should at all costs be avoided like the ebola virus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book was not only boring, but long. Instead of influencing peace in this world, this book influences war between countries in strife (Iran and USA). I personally feel like burning this book--but that is my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET AN EDITOR!!!!","review":"Word on the street is that Clancy is so successful he refuses to use an editor -- he needs one, desperately! His stories used to be intruiguing and well-written, but his work has steadliy declined to the point where one would think Executive Orders was written by a tenth-grader. The story-line has also grown tired and anachronistic, although there are obviously enough readers who want that. An editor might be able to temper Clancy's one-sided political bias so that his work could be enjoyable by all readers, but that must not be what Clancy wants. I used to enjoy Clancy's work, but Executive Oders was the last novel I will read by him. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME with this book if you are looking for exciting literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy's Worst","review":"This book sucks. It is criminally overlong, far fetched, full of right wing propaganda, is racist, and not even the military tactics are probable. Clancy has been spending far to much time hanging around military types and it their gung-ho attitude has rubbed off. While Clancy makes out that the results of the battles in his books are based on those of the Gulf War the US army got these resutlts by attacking retreating and demorilized Iraqies, not going head to head with far superior forces. I normally enjoy Clancy's books but this one is unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooooooooooooring","review":"The book was full of errors. For instance, the Air Force does not have \\"corporals.\\" In fact, it hasn't had them since WWII!!! I also found the book to be exceedingly tedious. Clancy reminds me of writers of the late 19th Century, who were paid for the number of words in their text and not for the content. Clancy says in 10 pages, what can be said in one. It is easy to lose the flow of the plot as the reader is lost in the mundaness of the techno-facts. Lastly, as a military veteran, I find it pathetic for Tom Clancy to wear the bomber jackets and military hats on the jackets of his books. He comes across as a wannabe. Well, if he wanted to serve so much, maybe he shouldn't have avoided military service during the Vietnam War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Customer Satifaction","review":"I recently wrote a very critical review upon receipt of a copy of this novel, where the pages were yellow from age, and the binding fell apart after the first 100 pages.

The service was exceptional and I am very grateful. I would definately buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Executive Orders","review":"This is the direct sequel to Debt of Honor, and while not as not as good as the previous novel, is still a goo read, following the actions of Clancy's hero, Jack Ryan's, and his early actions as President of the United States, picking up about 30 minutes after Ryan is sworn in as president at the end of Debt of Honor. This story is continued in the next novel, The Bear and the Dragon, which takes place about one year later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Winded","review":"Having read all the reviews, I must admit that I am going to be a bit of a heretic here. Well, here goes - I disliked this book. I found it long winded. At times, it felt like I was reading Tom Clancy's political beliefs as opposed to a work of fiction. I didn't think that it was at all suspenseful - he moved away from the plot line for such long periods of time, that it completely broke the feeling of suspense. I actually found it predictable in parts. I felt that the TV interviews of Jack Ryan served no purpose in the story other than to take up a few more pages. I genuinely believe that if it had been half the size, and just concentrated on events directly related to the story, it would have been an excellent read.Sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Bag","review":"The story is great, but there is a problem with formatting that made reading the book on my kindle difficult to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never received the book I paid for.","review":"The book I received was not new as I was led tobelieve and the back cover was nearly torn awayfrom the book. I will think twice about anyfuture purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you Tom for giving me so much free time","review":"This book was so bad that I will no longer feel obliged to continue reading the Jack Ryan series. The book was poorly edited, with plot lines that never came to completion. I still could have enjoyed the book however, if Clancy had not chosen to turn it into a forum to spue his political ideologies. Jack Ryan has become a superhero of mythic preportions, that does nothing but spout conservative retoric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Kindle Version","review":"This review is solely for the Kindle version of Executive Orders.This is one of my favorite Clancy novels. I re-read it every few years. I re-purchased it for the Kindle and must say that this is the most horrible conversion to Kindle I have seen to date. It's like they just opened up the source file, did a SAVE-AS and picked Kindle format and went to market with it. It is so full of typos and errors that it looks like it was OCRed. I will be re-reading my hardback rather than the Kindle version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying.","review":"I read the book when I had nothing better to read in the house. Thank goodness I got the book from the library. I would have been upset to have paid money for such an awful book. I kept reading it hoping that it would get better, but alas, it never did. There were a few parts of the book that were as exciting a Red October ( a great book), but the interesting parts (and indeed the whole story) could have been told in about 150-200 pages. Too bad Tom Clancy potificates throughout the book. He needs an editor that will cut his monsters down to an enjoyable size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth every second, every page","review":"I'm not going to waste your time with a book review that's as long as the book itself, so I'm going to get straight to the point and say I absolutely loved this book. Though I love stories/movies of this genre, I'd never read a Tom Clancy novel before reading Executive Orders. That's about to change. A large portion of this book is about how Jack Ryan learns to become president, which by its nature makes this a very political story. However, it was written so that readers not up-to-speed on political know-how and jargon (like myself) could easily understand and follow along. Basically, you learn about the presidency and its twists and turns just as President Ryan learns, and I think that's what makes this book unbelievably easy to read...despite its 1,300-plus pages. In short, this was one hell of a story that I couldn't put down. I even learned a thing or two. Totally worth the price of admission, five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jack Ryan series is going downhill fast","review":"Clancy's best work seems to be behind him. This book is nowhere near in the same league as _Red Storm Rising_ or _Clear and Present Danger_. I stopped reading about halfway through and then skimmed through the rest a couple months later. The plot was decent enough, but the excessive technical details and Clancy's endless preaching of his political views ruin it. This book would have been much better if cut down to just over half its size. Maybe two stars seems unfair but that's all this book deserves compared to earlier work. Let's hope that the next book, about a Sino-Russian conflict, will give us back the Clancy of the '80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"hugely flatulent","review":"I shouldn't complain - I was stupid enough to buy the book. The >1400 pages went fast though because I skipped huge sections of text - any time he got int one of his diatribes. These are worse than anything Ayn Rand ever wrote and much stupider. And while we're at it, someone should make a top ten list of his worst dialogue. I would but I cannot bear to go back through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Total Adventure","review":"The best!! I haven't read a book this good ever. I couldn't put it down. Tom Clancy has outdone himself. I never thought he beat Hunt for Red October. Jack Ryan is the most unlikely President. From the moment he promotes Price to the attack at the school and then the war, I was spellbound. What is next for President Ryan?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really a great novel","review":"After reading Debt of Honor, I was convinced that Clancy was a great writer. After reading Executive Orders I can only say it's even better than the previous one. All loose strings are solved, you can feel the tension as you read the pages. It can really inmerse you in everyone of the characters, and then it just turn into a great novel. With a very good plot that forces you to keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"An explosive book from the master","review":"Tom Clancy delivers a massive read that in it's own right is worth every page used. Jack Ryan, sworn into the Vice Presidency only seconds before now finds himself, his family, and his security detail the only survivors of an elaborate plot to kill the President, Congress, the Juctices of the Supreme Court, the Joint Chiefs, and the Cabnit during a joint session of Congress. Suddenly plunged into the most stressful job in the world he must find those responsible, moniter an assasination in the Persian Gulf, and respond to the most horrible of crimes, a biological attack on the U.S.!

Obviously written with movie rights in mind, this $28 doorstop takes its readers through the usual twists, turns and returns, stopping briefly to introduce characters of every conceivable stereotype, all the while creating a story line just barely within the realm of believability, even for Clancy. Pedestrian dialogue (unless there are acronyms in the sentence) and a weak ending make this one of his more disappointing works. Moreso than with his others, however, you can literally skip entire pages and not miss a beat"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty tedious.","review":"I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy, but I think that his last few books aren't nearly as good as his first few. Not much happens, it takes hundreds of pages to get into the book. Sound's like it's time to retire Jack Ryan and start with some fresh plots. Forget the terrorist stuff and get back to nation vs nation"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't wait for the movie.","review":"It's not surprising that the Clancy tomes have worked bestas movies. With the possible exception of \\"Hunt for RedOctober,\\" the movies have all managed to extract thefacinating premises and thrown away most of the lectures inhistory, political economy, geopolitics, military tactics,military technology and religion that Clancy insists onincluding in his tomes. This novel is not the exception.Clancy is at his personal best when he focuses on thepremise, as he did in \\"Hunt for Red October.\\" But, inthis latest novel, Clancy once again decides to includeall his background research instead of doing the novelist'sjob of transforming the research into textures and moodsthat convey authenticity in more subtle and less numbingways.Wait for the movie, or buy the audio book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"Tempted by the number of positive comments on Amazon.com about this and other Clancy novels I decided to purchase Executive Orders. What a waste of money and time. This book is too long, stuffed with technical details (is Mr Clancy 12 years old, looking around in a very big toy shop?), unbelievably naive and patriotic and absolutely black and white (we are the good ones, all the rest are bad). Publications like this make many Americans believe that the USA are the only reliable peacekeepers of the entire galaxy. Come on people, aren't we all too intelligent for this rubbish? Too bad the rating system does not allow me to rate on no stars. Or...is this novel just not my cup of tea?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and too political.","review":"Not only did it take forever to read, but it wasn't worth it. Tom Clancy's plots are generally good for fiction, and the movies made from them are excellent, but this one really was not worth the time it took to read. Jack Ryan became a reflection of the political beliefs of Tom Clancy -- and too much space was wasted on Clancy's (hidden through Ryan) views on abortion, gun control, etc. His dream idea of the perfect, responsible government was ever-to-obvious. And his attempts at showing off military and medical terminology, acronyms, etc. just got old after a while. Re-read one of his older books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Paced and Thrilling","review":"If you are a fan of Tom Clancy you will love this book. It has all the aspects a book require to make it a great read. Twist after twist this book will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page. The events in this book are so realistic you might as well be reading a non-fiction book, that's part of what makes this book so good. If haven't read the books leading up to this I would definitely recommend that you read the other jack Ryan books first. You will fall in love with Jack Ryan in this book and all of Tom Clancy's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fictitiously Fantabuluos","review":"The over all plot of Clancy's Executive Summary seemed to have been coming from all directions, that one wonders why.... but then again, if one has not read and liked Jack Ryan series, one will be bored from the seemingly endless and unconnected events of the story.... One thing that really bored me is the way the war was written.... too long.... too anticlimactic, but in the end, a very plausible fictional work, which I really wish will NEVER HAPPEN.... How can Clancy do this thing: keep one on the edge and asking for more Jack Ryan..... No wonder I am a Clancy addict"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent juant while driving","review":"While having to drive about an hour a day for work, I decided to give Clancy a try to help pass the time (NPR can only do so much after about a month <30 hrs of radio time>). The audio CD was wonderful and really helped pass the time. The story is interesting - lots of twists, turns, Clancy techno-battles, and interesting characters - without the volume issue that makes the reader decide what sections to skim.As well, I really enjoyed the reader for the book (even though I panned Mr. Hermann in 'A Beautiful Mind', he did a wonderful job here). He paced the desert war, the gun battles, and the moments of intrigue (the lead-in and standoff with the rogue secret service agent comes to mind) well, keeping interest and at times causing me to sit in the car for an extra 5-10 mins waiting for a scene to play out. All in all, a solid 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ending to Jack Ryan Series","review":"This was an excellent ending to the Jack Ryan series. He continues to develop the characters that started many novels ago. I especially like how he would refer to less than prominanat characters in his previous novels.

However, it's really time to get rid of this 'Jack Ryan' fellow. I mean, come on. It was bad enough when Tom Clancy made the guy National Security Advisor, but becomming President by a bizzare twist of fate such as the ridiculous one which takes place between this book's predecessor, Debt of Honor, and Executive Decision is practically laughable. I got addicted to Tom Clancy books because of their realistic portrayal of how the government operates and military operations; somehow, after The Sum of All Fears, this gets twisted into Science Fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Executive Orders","review":"This is one of my favorite Tom Clancy novels.

Jack Ryan and Cathy will always come out of top - it's a shame however, they have to climb over such an enormous dung hill to reach safety. God bless us all, everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An above average Clancy book but too much unresolved","review":"Executive Orders starts out like most Clancy books but then bogs down for a few chapters. Better editing would have made it move better. Excellent technical descriptions, as usual. The book does present an interesting scenario with most of the federal leadership dead and how will Ryan re-invent the government as a political kitten in with the remaining big dogs. The mountain men plot line was totally useless as was the resolution of the former VP resignation. Clancy takes some good shots at the Washington bureacacy, fat-cats, and the press"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy has become victim of his own success","review":"Clancy has become such a cash cow for his publisher that it appears the publisher no longer even bothers to examine his manuscripts. It's as though Clancy sends all twenty pounds of it over to the publisher with a note attached and something to the effect, \\"I want this on the stands in six months. Don't call me. Just do it.\\" This book should have been edited down at least 400 pages. The publisher is more to blame than Clancy. After all, an author who's settled for 900 pages likely thinks 1200 would have been more appropriate. Clancy's not alone here. Recent efforts by Stephen King, who probably sent his publisher the same note, and John Grisham also screamed out for responsible editing on the part of the publisher. Mr. Clancy and the publisher need to remember that just because we liked 'The Hunt forRedOctober' doesn't mean we'll continue buying Clancy books that short us on originality, craft and story telling"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack against abortion ?","review":"The follow-up to well-written \\"Debt of Honor\\" was a bit of a disappointment. I regret to admit that its the first Clancy novel which is boring, too long and sometimes irritating. Here follows some of my points. (1) Jacks conservative blabblings. Why does Clancy turn him into a hard core Republican? (2) The \\"mountain men\\" side story feels somewhat fabricated and the way it ends is anticlimactic, does Clancy believe that a link to the Oklahoma city bombing will make his story more realistic? (3) The \\"sleeper agent\\" story is very illogical, why do the Iranians not kill the President at their first chance?. Beside from these flaws I guess this book is a must for any Clancy fan including the few of us in Denmark."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment for this Clancy fan.","review":"I very much looked forward to to the exciting possibilities after Clancy's last book left Washington in flames and the federal governmetn crippled. I was extremely disappointed. This book is in dire need of severe editing. The story could have been told in half the space, certainly in less than the obscene 1300+ pages that it rambles on. I've read all of Clancy's books but I doubt that I will read another unless his publisher gets him back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this one last!","review":"Clancy's books usually read fast. This one doesn't really pick up until right at the end. Normally, I overlook his bland use of language because the plot and subplots are so rich. No such luck. Maybe this isn't really a 2 star book. But, if you want to read Clancy, look to his books. If you liked all those, punish yourself with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy has gone commercial.","review":"Well, at least it makes a good boat anchor. Clancy has obvously gone off the deep end with his effort to \\"make money\\" by commercializing his book. Give us a break: He throws in the kitchen sink trying to cover every possible plot for a story. We have the Oklahoma City Bombing, so he includes the Mountain Men. We have ebola popularity, so he tries to capitalize on it. . . etc. etc. etc. I assume that his next book with include a trip to mars for Jack who is offered command while he single handedly stops Pakistan and China from blowing each other up with their newly tested nukes while China launches its new hi-tech missiles at the U.S. only to see them destroyed by the new beam particle laser that is mounted on Ryan's mars shuttle. Maybe someday, Clancy will leave a few popular plots out of his book so that another writer will have something current to write about. I think he has turned into the Wal-Mart of novels. So sad, for such a talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too long","review":"I bought this book for the summer holidays, but soon found more interesting lecture and never finished \\"Ex.

In this novel Clancy brings alive two very major challenges to America's current role in the world.First, Clancy outlines a believable coalition of anti-American nations united only by a desire to profit from our difficulties. Second, he chillingly describes the horrors of a biological epidemic deliberately unleashed by someone who is driven by hatred.It is worth enduring the too long and too frequent Jack Ryan speeches and maudlin introspection to get to the 80% of the book which outlines a world that could be and dangers that are all too real. This is one of Clancy's more thought provoking novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as always","review":"The book could stand to lose between 200 and 300 pages. I also noticed all the good guys seem to think the same.What I like about the book is the insight it brings to the table. After reading a few Clancy books policy seems to make more sense. I also see the goverment reacting to a problem the same way a Clancy good guy would.

Each pass finds something new to focus on. Clancy 's knowledge of the Intelligence community, coupled with his insights of our military make this novel come to life. If you enjoy the what-ifs of the political world, you will love the concept of building our government from nothing.This story can be enjoyed by Jack Ryan fans or by anyone who loves a good thriller.Buy it for your Kindle and save your wrist from carpal tunnel. I own the paperback as well and needed a splint after holding it for hours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible tome that must be read","review":"In this, the latest Tom Clancy thriller, Jack Ryan takes on the greatest task ever asked of him by becoming President. Though the book seems to lose focus a few times, the last 200 pages were reminiscent of Patriot Games. They just seem to fly by! The ending is not a real shocker either, but for an almost 900 page book, it does not have to be. Every aspect of Mr. Ryan's character is explored, so this is a must-read for true Tom Clancy fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy Thrills Again","review":"Tom Clancy continues the saga of Jack Ryan's accidental climb through the US Government. A bit wordy and too many subplots, Executive Orders will still keep those familiar with Clancy's series up past midnight. White hats, black hats, spies, and jingoism: it sells!

At times, it was just too confusing. still, a must read book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undue hatred shines through","review":"I have keenly read all of Clancy's books from the first one.

There are some passages in the book which is not worthy of Clancy.Andrea Price says reg. Indira Gandhi's assasination \\" even though she had not sworn to protect such person's life\\". Is it that Indira Gandhi was not worthy of being protected from assasination.I can understand hatred but this sort of dirision is hard to stomach. I do not think India has at any time meant harm to any body. Poetic license be damned.It really left me with a bad taste in the mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Book - Good Pillow","review":"This novel reached a point when it seemed to embody Tom Clancy's vision for how a government should be organised in a perfect world, he just had to find a way of wiping out the existing government to do it! It's still an entertaining story, but I think I laughed more than the author was intending. Although I loved Clancy's earlier books, he's pushing the boundaries of credibility, and in this genre they tend to stretch pretty far anyway. On the plus side, I did discover that this book made a surprisingly comfortable pillow when reading on the beach. One for the big Clancy fans only I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish this book would have never ended","review":"My wife kept telling me to read the book, but I didn't want to b/c of its length. Now that I have read it, I am sorry that it is not longer. It was one of the best if not the best book I have ever read. I am a political junkie and this book really hit home on some things.

It's all there keeps you wanting more-hurry let's get busy with the next one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Clancy has woven yet another fine work of fiction","review":"Tom Clancy has done a marvellous job of interconnecting various action scenarios and pulsing each one of them at the right times to keep the reader informed and at times suspended to keep guessing what the next move from the other side will be.His research of defense information and tactics are definitely award worthy. In particular I was amazed at how precise he was in saying that the Bob Hope class vessels built at Avondale were diesel powered. This was great because the ships hadn't been delivered at the time the book was written. Not only that but also the fact that the Bob Hope(s) built at Avondale are diesel powered and those built at the other shipyard are gas turbine powered.Bravo Tom Clancy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Executive Orders offers intrigue but also tedium","review":"I don't think this is Clancy's best book ever. The Ebola threaat, the Iran/Iraq merger, and the assassin within the Secret Service were all fascinating but the book is bogged down with too many trite and idealistic speeches and tedious detail about the presidency. For example we don't have to be told three or four times that the president's plane is a VC-30 which is code named \\"Air Force One\\". I just felt that a lot of the analysis of domestic politics was oversimplified and was not really necessary. I agree that a good editor could have trimmed this book down to 600 pages without losing the suspense. It seemed idiotic that Jack Ryan took the VP job and had no idea that he would ever become president. COME ON! Ryan's naivete kind of got on my nerves. I mean it wasn't like he was an outsider to Washington who just fell off a turnip truck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Listening","review":"I've been listening now to numerous Audio Editions from multiple authors and this along with ICON from Forsythe is one of the best. Highly recommended if you like moving books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully the last Jack Ryan book","review":"Overall an entertaining read. Good action and technical descriptions as usual. Hideously canned dialog and character interactions. Plot labors along early, as usual, but flows nicely through middle to the end. Awful segments of political and moral commentaries interspersed throughout. Hopefully Clancy will retire Jack Ryan (a character as overworked as Dirk Pitt) and move on to more \\"complete in itself\\" novels such as \\"Red Storm Rising\\". This is entertainment not reality, so enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best Yet","review":"It is obvious from reading the reviews of this book, the reader either hates it or loves it. When I buy a Tom Clancy book, I know what If am getting -- imagination, technology, and an unbelievable ending. Tom Clancy outdid himself and I don't think he can write a better book. This book had everything. I did not think that it was too long because I like a book that will last one week (I usually read these books on vacation). This was just right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolutely Fabulous, \\"Can't Put it Down\\" Read...","review":"It had been a while since I read a Clancy book, and when I picked this one up in the airport book store, I realized how much I'd been missing. In this book, Clancy draws upon his talent for suspenseful, technical wordcraft, while at the same time bringing a certain personal touch to the characters that we haven't quite seen before. Took just over a month to read, and I wished it didn't end. Makes you proud to be an American...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"The character of Jack Ryan may be loveable and somewhat captivating, especially as he gets to play the role of the president. There's a certain amount of thrill and action, which is the only reason why I kept on reading. I recommend you don't even start reading it. The first third of the book is really boring and Tom Clancy's story-telling all over the book is too annoying. Clancy writes too much about combat maneuvers and stuff like that which isn't interesting at all. The worst thing is that he tries to get so much into the minds of the characters and he's doing an awful job. It feels so much like he (Clancy) is the only voice and mind in the story. He could have kept the story simple and short. The action would have sufficed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Clancy, action packed, great characters, predictable","review":"As I have read every Clancy book, this rates in the top 20%. The story is very believable and the action is non-stop. I enjoy how Clancy develops his characters and blends the plot lines together. This book does get a little slow near the end. The climax could have been more suspensefull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great finale for Jack Ryan.","review":"I think this would be the pinnacle of Jack Ryan's career. I don't think you can top being the Chief Executive of the country.Despite the number of pages, the classic Clancy thrill is there to keep you reading it. Reading this (again) post 9/11 and the Iraq Invasion gives me the impression the the current job holder wants to be a Jack Ryan (not).The pace is there. Clancy's attention to details is there too.However, for me, the Hunt for Red October would still be my 5 star Clancy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I bought it when it was first published in 1996. An incredibly gripping novel. So many plots, so many twists. Filled with bad guys, worse guys, and down right evil characters. Like many Clancy novels, EO pulls back the curtain behind everything from infectious diseases to the TO&E; of an Armored Cavalry Regiment. After several years, I bought a used copy and it consumed my entire weekend -- from Friday night to Monday night. I actually got weepy eyed during some parts -- Cathy Ryan as she was treating Ebola victims in Baltimore, the tactics of the North Carolina brigade as they clobbered the UIR forces.Just an amazing book. Worth reading...again. It is a long book though. The paperback weighed in at 1358 pages. I still can't believe I read the entire thing. lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best book that Clancy has written at this time.","review":"This book, Executive Orders, is one of the best and most intriguing books that I have read to date.Clancy has taken Jack Ryan on the adventure of his life when he assumes the role of president of the United States of America.By: Brian Minty"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best work, but vintage Clancy nonetheless . . . . .","review":"While contemporaries like Dale Brown and Harold Coyle have faded away into near oblivion, Tom Clancy has once again proven why he's top dog in the techno-thriller genre of literary fiction. This sequel to \\"Debt of Honor\\" has all the ingredients that we have come to expect and love in Clancy's novels: breakneck pace, complex and multi-layered plotting, interesting characters and nefarious villains, and of course the everyman hero in the form of protagonist Jack Ryan. Don't let the 1,000+ pages discourage you; the fact that his novels seem to be getting longer with every new book only means that you're getting more \\"bang for the buck.\\" I can't wait for his next novel to be released later this year, \\"The Dragon and the Bear.\\" China vs. Russia, let the fireworks begin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!!!!!","review":"I just finished this book, it may have taken me 3 months to read, but as a freshman in High School also taking college courses it was well worth the wait. Although I did read Debt of Honor before Executive Orders this book would be fine if you had not read Debt of Honor regardless of it being the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This story rocks from beginning to end.","review":"You'll find yourself wishing that a change of the government that takes place in the story could happen for real. The retribution sought by the U.S. was purely poetic. One of Tom's best. If you like Clancy, you will not want to miss this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - I gave up","review":"His first two books were brilliant. However, the quality has steadily decreased and this one was unreadable. I believe the author is too lazy to develop new believable characters or plausible plots. What happended to the author's self respect?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"I think that this is seriously one of the best books that I've ever read. The scary part is that this book starts with a plane crashing into the Capitol building, and I began to read this book on Monday, September 10th, the day before the planes crashed into the WTC and the Pentagon. That was truly bizarre. I think this book is a good read, although it did make me kind of scared to wake up in the morning, hoping that the book was not coming true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Clancy predicts the future?","review":"Just a very exciting book;however Tom Clancy worryingly seems to predict the future!! Nothing is sacred and I'm afraid life is stranger than fiction. I hope we all read Tom Clancy's books with real interest in future.God bless America!Our thoughts are with you all,Fond regards from Great Britain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good reason why Clancy has stopped writing.","review":"This is Clancy's first bona fide sequel, taking up exactly where Debt of Honor left off. As such, it's a little less egregious that he insists on using all the same old characters for every minor role. The battle scenes are still excellent, and his descriptions of hopelessly complex technical stuff, including the Ebola virus in this one, are his strong points. He again displays a total ignorance of espionage and how it works (with the CIA having exactly two field officers who do literally everything), and he relies on incredible coincidences for his sleuths to crack the mystery. As a conservative, I always love how he paints the liberals as limp-wristed, inept, corrupt swine, although he kind of goes over the top in this story. We can only hope that we have seen the last of Jack Ryan now, although at least Clancy didn't have have him slinging lead this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, tedious and boring!","review":"I am a Clancy Fan from the start. have read all of his books, have his computer game etc. I got bogged down on page 308 of 875 and never went back. A good editor could have knocked off 200+ pages easily. It did not have the snap of \\"Sum of All Fears\\" or his first two novels. Instead it had way too many subplots, a fairly ( for Clancy, boring main plot, and too much stuffing in between. If you doubt me, read one of his first two novels, and then big up this behemoth and see if you can finish it! If you have not read his non-fiction books on \\"Submarine\\", \\"Marine\\" , \\"Armored Cav\\", and the non-fiction account of Desert Storm, and you are a military junkie, don't miss them! The best book of all is \\"The Tom Clancy Companion\\", trust me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it.","review":"This book had everything you've come to expect from a Clancy. I loved it. One of the things I love about his books is his ability to have several story lines going at once and then connect them up at the end. This time however he had too many story lines. I think that the Mountain Men story line was totally unnecessary. It didn't connect with any of the other story lines and the book could have been shorter if that part was cut completely. I'm also pretty sure that Iran and Iraq would never agree to become one country"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Flaw","review":"First Clancy I read was Cadinal of Kremlin and enjoyed it. So, I make a mad rush to the store to buy this utterly flawed yarn.The main plotters in Tom's hostile world, China, Iran and India, happened to conspire \\"together\\" against US. Yeah, China and India on a same bunk bed!!! Tommy, if you're gonna mix facts and fiction, atleast get your facts right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it away...","review":"Have not read all of his books, but I'm quite sure no one of them will beat this. Clancy shows a tremendous sence of patience, when giving you the information bit by bit. He's jumping from one part of the world to another, waiting several pages before linking the acts together. Maybe the ending 2- or 300 pages could be compressed a bit... But I'd say: The best that could come from that side of the Atlantic..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull. Insulting. Bad.","review":"Tom Clancy was once my favorite author. \\"Executive Orders\\" pretty much confirms that I've out-grown his work. Clancy's skills have been in decline since 1989's \\"Clear and Present Danger\\". \\"Executive Orders\\" sums up many of the things that are wrong with his writing- the endlessly long plots, the technical-laden language, clunkey dialouge. Clancy's heros are dull- one-dimensional over-achievers who seem like xeroxes of one another. Clancy's villians are worse- charactures, one-dimensional bad guys. It is as if Clancy is so afraid of the reader thinking for him or herself he finds it necessary to stack the deck. Clancy's political sentiments are expressed with the subtlety of a jack-hammer. Those not sharing Clancy's right-of-center mindset will find their beliefs and their intelligence insulted time and again.Stay Away. Stay far away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher Did NOT Use SPELLCHECK","review":"I am a natural speed reader & just received a Kindle for Christmas. I have been downloading favorites to the Kindle & just spent a few hours re-reading Clancy's \\"Executive Orders\\". The experience was totally spoiled by the HUNDREDS of typos, most typically \\"c\\" for \\"e\\" and vice versa. It really ruined the experience of reading a 2041KB (896 pg) book. Didn't anyone ever hear of SPELLCHECK? The book was FIVE STARS but the printing was awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"It is interesting to see that most people who didn't love EO are either flaming liberals who have to press their agenda in their review or people who fear big things.I loved this book!How can you not enjoy a novel that gives you an education at the same time.Tom Clancy is the only author that can actually get an emotional response from me. In the last 200 pages I do not remember blinking once.Oh yeah, the other complaint from the detractors is that it is unrealistic.

He has created a novelization of the GOP platform! The first, oh, 500 pages are virtually unreadable, what with the ping-pong plotting, lack of pacing, etc. Clancy has stopped trying to entertain his readers and just bashes them over the head with his hard-right, jingoistic fantasies. Fortunately, he's not hitting them with his book--that would be assault with a deadly (but dull) weapon"},{"rating":"1","title":"How about some proofreading?","review":"Good novel, but extremely poorly published......at least in the Kindle edition.

Didn't anyone proofread this thing???"},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best Yet!","review":"\\"Executive Orders\\" was easily the best book Tom Clancy has ever written. I feel sad after reading some of these reviews, becasue many of them ask about the point of some of the sub-plots.Examples\\"What was the point of the Mountain Men\\"The point was to get across that people disliked Jack Ryan in the Oval Office, just like Ed Kealty and the SS guy plots.\\"Why do the UIR-ains want to provoke a country with nukes that can destroy their country\\"The point of this is to show how much some Arab's hate America (which Tom Clancy clearly explained in the book), and to bring all the subplots together for the Second Persian Gulf War, which was the best scene in the book by the way.I hope Tom Clancy's new book is as good as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit long; not as good as Debt of Honor","review":"I loved Debt of Honor and wanted to read this as it was the sequel. Too bad. It never lived up to Debt of Honor. I tried 3-4 times (over about 2 years) to get past the first 100 pages, which were painfully slow. I kept reading mostly based on the good Amazon reviews. The book ultimately picked up the pace and became more interesting, but it was just too predictable and lacked much novelty. At times it was dreadful slow and detailed. Overall, I can think of numerous other books that are far better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fan","review":"For a book this lengthy the character development was weak. Instead of developing the characters the author chose to fill white space with a tax policy proposal. Most people read novels as an alternative to reading about issues like tax policy. Additionally, what was up with the domestic terrorists? Their plot fizzled out as an afterthought. The whole domestic terrorist aspect should have been stripped from the book by the editor along with the uninteresting tax proposal content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining author who empowers his characters with his wishes vice reality","review":"Tom Clancy is a great author, I will not take that away from the man. From his first story to his masterpiece Without Remorse, he is without a doubt a phenomenal entertainer. His current novels stemming from Debt of Honor, yet exclusively within this tale, his viewpoints are too prevalent within the tale to truly appreciate. This would not be so bad, except for his characters internal soliloquy which are completely out of touch with cultural personalities (ie: when the Saudi prince \\"wishes\\" his country were more like America... not so much). If he were to stay away from detailing his perifial characters whimsical thoughts, the novels would be shorter and that much better. I feel he is trying to put too much of his perfect world into the books which ultimately take away from the great entertainment he provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Executive Orders too fragmented","review":"I've been a long time fan of Tom Clancy although Executive Orders was one of the first Clancy books that I've read recently. I was disappointed with this book partially due to its overall length. It seemed that the first 500 pages could easily have been dropped. I literally skimmed 100-150 pages just to get through it. I didn't feel that I was developing a relationship with any character in the book. Sure, President Jack Ryan was the main guy, but he was still way too distant to really feel that you cared that much for him. Only in the last 200 pages did the pace and action pick-up. Save your time for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"It's good to be the President...Good sequel to Debt of Honor.

I enjoyed Debt of Honor & Without Remorse more than EX.ORD. which was too wordy. I am excited by his next book - I hope Clancy squarely takes on domestics politics & shows how America can work.

In a way, it's as much \\"Hancock's World\\" as it is Gershwin's; it's a very personal interpretation of Gershwin's work, filtered through Hancock's lifetime of musical creation. There are echoes of the Miles Davis quartet in \\"It Ain't Necessarily So,\\" and a reprise of the 1970's Chick Corea duet sessions in \\"Blueberry Rhyme.\\"Hancock clearly passed on that personal vision to his guests; listen to Stevie Wonder on \\"St. Louis Blues\\" and Joni Mitchell on a stunning rendition of \\"Summertime.\\"This is one of the best CDs I've heard in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"That is one COOL cat!","review":"Great music to put you in the mood.

No it is not your typical Hancock 'sound' but what beautiful, imaginative and emotional work.

Embraceable you and Saint Louis Blues with the harmonic and voice of Steve Wonder is another outstanding piece.The only minor default may found in the lovable Ravel' s Piano Concerto in G Major' s Second Movement.

Went to Home Depot and saw it there in a bag with instructions describing how it had a fail-safe feature that shuts off water flow if the water pressure changes suddenly or if you turn the water on too fast. My washing machine didn't read the instructions, changed cycles and turned off the water flow.

The film is hampered by a confusing screenplay that confounds a fairly routine storyline, resulting in scenes being disunited and lacking in suspense, but Grey is always interesting to watch and performs creditably here, as does Currie Graham as procurer for the slain ladies of the evening, while cinematographer Curtis Petersen adds interest to the undertaking despite the script's flaws of continuity."},{"rating":"2","title":"the 1st review","review":"This is an eleven (11) track audio CD that was exclusivley released through BLOCKBUSTER MUSIC stores which , at least in my neck of the woods, are extinct.

And of all the suites he has written, the violin suite stands alone. Despite being labeled a suite, it is very much woven of whole cloth and every section works in kind with the others. The music is heady with soul and romanticism, and even occasional flashes of humor. Pinchas Zukerman is an ideal soloist, and Bolling wrote with him in mind, much as Duke Ellington wrote to the strengths of his musicians. The opening section may be the most singularly beautiful composition I have ever heard; I almost react to it viscerally, as if Bolling and Zukerman were speaking to my own heart.

In addition to a strong performance from Fonda, the film is especially memorable thanks to Laughton's grinning, snake-slick performance--sadly, his last. Smear campaigns, public-image management, and behind-the-scenes machinations are all part of the senatorial rat race in \\"Advise and Consent,\\" an ultra-realistic drama that seems timelier than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Seeing More Than Once","review":"This is politics as it used to be, when the Senate was composed mostly of people of good will, with differing ideas, and the meanspirited politics of destruction, so typical today, was unusual. Not that the story isn't controversial and interesting, but the backdrop is that of a Senate one could be proud of.There is the justly infamous, stupidly stereotypical, \\"gay bar scene\\" which is hugely hard to take. But otherwise the acting is superb and the characters fascinating and very real. This is a DVD to own, not rent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homophobia","review":"Personally, I think this is Preminger's greatest film. But it falls flat for today's audiences because its homophobia strikes people as oddly unbelievable.For audiences in the early 1960s, the film's frank portrayal of homosexuality was shocking and slightly titillating. The character's shame, humiliation, and ultimate demise is viewed as unbelievable by audiences today that are familiar with the likes of Ted Haggard, Larry Craig, and Bob Allen. The dramatic payoff is consequently dulled at the end.It is unfortunate because most of the A-Listers in the film gave the performance of their lifetime. Charles Laughton, in particular, was never better in this, his last filmed performance. I still like the film, because I remember those times of rabid homophobia and understand the characters' motivations. I can't recommend it to today's audiences, unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Advise and Consent","review":"Thank you very much for providing exactly what I was looking for and in such an efficient manner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Advice & Consent","review":"May 6, 2010.

Leffingwell as Secretary of State soon becomes an examination of the lives - and especially, the past lives - of Leffingwell and members of the Senate. In ADVISE AND CONSENT, no one is, finally, a hero - not even Henry Fonda's Leffingwell, who once flirted with Communism and who lies under oath. First-rate performances are given by each member of the all-star cast, with the most striking characterizations coming from Burgess Meredith as a meek former Communist who testifies against Leffingwell and Charles Laughton as the irrepressible South Carolina senator who opposes Leffingwell's values but who is ultimately magnanimous.

Advise and Consent is a solid film and still relevant 45 years on. The book's author fashioned his characters after real life counterparts which you'll recognize if you know anything about politics in the 50's and 60's.

Well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Granddaddy Of Political Movies!","review":"This ultra-realistic 1962 drama of the goings-on in Washington, D.C. must rank as one of the best films of its type ever made. It's a lengthy one (2 hrs., 19 min.), but it never gets dry. The many veteran actors assembled to comprise this cast see to that. The roster includes Henry Fonda, Franchot Tone, Charles Laughton, Lew Ayres, Walter Pidgeon, and Burgess Meredith! There's also Don Murray, who probably gets more screen time here than anyone else. And I think Murray shines bright in his role as the senator with a deep, dark secret! Pidgeon is also particularly convincing in this film. This was Mr. Laughton's final motion picture.If you've never seen Advise & Consent ..... then get it today! It's a thoroughly engrossing and powerful movie experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Adaptation","review":"Fans of the novel (like me) will cringe at how the vital character of Senator Orrin Knox is reduced to a minor figure (and played by the relatively obscure Edward Andrews as a buffoon) who disappears halfway through the film, but for the most part this is an excellent political film with magnificent performances by Pidgeon, Murray, and especially Laughton in his last role as Senator Seab Cooley who leads the opposition against a liberal nominee for Secretary of State. It's ironic that Laughton would be playing a character with such a grudge against Henry Fonda since the two also despised each other in real life (stemming from a bad experience when Laughton had directed Fonda in \\"The Caine Mutiny Court Martial\\" on Broadway). Watch for TV legend Betty White in a bit part as a feisty Kansas senator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Throttle Ahead!","review":"I have been intrigued with Steve Coleman's music since the early 80's when he and Greg Osby and Cassandra Wilson were moving boundaries with their M-Base concepts. He also caught my fancy with his exceptional contributions to Dave Holland's exceptional music on \\"Triplicate\\" and \\"Extensions\\". The music on \\"Resistance is Futile\\" is even more advanced than anything Coleman has recorded in the past. This music is difficult to describe because it excels on every level. It swings one minute and is funky the next. It can be soft and gentle and then drive a groove like a locomotive. It is structured and melodic while being spontaneous and creative at the same time. I hope this is the future of Jazz - a magical collaboration of intelligent communications between leader and band mates. This music is vivid and colorful - and I loved every minute of it.

All the elements for cinematic success. Although I have never been bald myself, I could empathize with the bald little boy because his tears were real, his smiles were sincere, and it looked like it really hurt when he got the glued-on-wig pulled off of his head at the soccer game.

While I understand their reasoning for not including Pendergast (the FBI agent from the books) it hurts the story of Relic so much that it goes from being a high intensity monster-thriller, to a failed B-movie.The two things that actually made the movie unwatchable is the constant darkness, and the terrible cuts.

If you want that, read the 1st 30-some reviews. The Relic has some great special effects, and even 3 years after it was made it still stands up to today's movies. The horror is top-notch. Running under the sewers with little or no light not knowing where the deadly beast is...how can that not be great? The acting is, despite what some other reviews claim, quite good. Tom Sizemore in particular does a great and humorous job portraying the cop D'Agosta. This movie is highly reccommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Relic was great","review":"In The Relic, a horrifying monster stalks and kills inside a gigantic museum, which just happens to be hosting a party for the opening of \\"Superstition,\\" the newest exhibit.

This movie is an embarrassment. The best character in the book (Special Agent Pendergast) was entirely deleted from the movie, and the dapper Japanese genius scientist who works with Margo was turned into a fat, bumbling Chinese guy. The part that especially disgusted me was when the museum beast was turned into a cartoonish 20 foot fireball galloping through the museum like Clifford, the Big Red Dog. I was as embarrassed as I was livid. What a waste! I guess it's a good thing that they left Agent Pendergast out, because they probably would have cast somebody like Keanu Reeves to play him, and that surely would have given me a stroke.

It had incredible characterization, fascinating scientific topics, and tremendous suspense. Such a complex story that took over 400 pages to tell is not meant to be made into a movie. Sure, some books are, but this one is not. For those who are looking to watch a quality movie that presents abstract ideas and new concepts, this movie does not present that in the way the book did. For those who read the book and have high hopes of watching the amazing story Preston/Child wrote come to life, don't get your hopes up. There's just no way a movie could do what the book did.

The problem is that the two works share very little. There are some superficial resemblances (the book takes place in a museum in New York, the movie in a museum in Chicago, some of the characters in the movie have the same names as characters in the book, but in several cases the resemblance ends there) but this movie is not a translation of the book into film. Among other things, it leaves out Pendergast, one of the three major characters, and possibly the most fascinating character in the book. It also handily manages to kill off the character who helped make the sequel to the book possible.I'd love to see the book _The Relic_ made into a movie. This movie, however, isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the book ... trust me.","review":"A major disaster that should have been left in the glorious print where it was born.

Not to mention, what is up with the lighting? The film is so dimly lit that it's hard to tell just what is going on and who is who, and the cast (featuring Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore, and Linda Hunt) is beyond wasted. The Relic does have some good gore effects and a good jolt here and there, but it's nothing worthwhile at all.

Stan Winston received kudos for monster design. But!! You simply cannot see it in the murk of this print. Even the laserdisc and vhs copies of the film are better than this alleged Blu Ray. Sound is a bit better with some nice effects/musical jolts. But!! Save your dollars. This Relic is a relic. Director Pete Hyams has a commentary.

A ghastly monster imported from the South American jungle stalks the halls of Chicago's Field Museum, while only tough cop Tom Sizemore and leggy scientist Penelope Ann Miller can save the day. Also fairly predictable, director Peter Hyams adds some extra twists and an intelligent script that separates \\"The Relic\\" from others of its kind.

I, like other reviewers, did read the book and found the film's departure from much of the novel to be a little annoying. However, the film does hold one's interest, especially with the great monster \\"effect,\\" a cross between \\"Predator\\" and a dragon, and the heroism and resourcefulness of the Penelope Ann Miller character.There are two truly memorable scenes: 1) the creature ascending onto a SWAT team member as he attempts a rescue and 2) the \\"revelation\\" by the creature of its true identity.

The movie takes place in Chicago's Field Museum with towering great halls, dark corners and sub-basements that have sub-basements. People start to disappear and the police begin to search the museum. As the gala opening night of a major exhibition approaches and the body count goes up museum officials try to downplay any possibility of danger to the invited guests. Of course an uninvited guest literally drops in with the idea of dining on Society's Upper Crust.The movie was based on the book \\"Relic\\" by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. The book was more gruesome than the movie and I couldn't put it down until the last page even though I had to go to work the next morning.

I'm involved with astronomy outreach programs at 9 elementary schools, and this scope will be perfect to show the heavens to the kids. It's portable (only 30 pounds) and the SkyAlign technology will allow setup within a few minutes. First Light was on Saturn, and it was beautiful, I could see the Cassini division in the rings, as well as Titan. I recommend this scope heartily!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price.","review":"I was quite pleased when I saw Saturn through this telescope first. Watching planet is fun all the time. It is easy to use. This is good as it is for beginners. However, I wish I had bought the 8 inch one. Urban area where I live is not ideal for sky watching. Watching deep sky objects with this one is fairly limited unless you go to a rural area, which I haven't done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xcellent","review":"Buy this product which meets all my expectations.

The mount had some issues and had to be repaired, twice. Celestron finally got it back to me. This scope is spetacular. The optics are top notch, the focus is crisp and not fussy, and the tracking is stable even when changing it's balance by switching an eyepiece for a CCD camera.

The thing is I haven't been involved much the past 15 years in astronomy for various reasons. I decided to get back into it recently and purchased this scope. Man I had forgotten how amazing their optics really are!! I am impressed with the ease of set up and the light wieght of this scope and most of all with the fact that in less than perfect light conditions I could still pick out the Cassini division in Saturn's rings with a 25mm lens and a 2X barlow. I look forward to using it for astrophotography of deep sky objects very soon.I also had need to call support about software and they were very helpful and quick. Solved my problem very simply within just a few minutes and the time it took to download the application."},{"rating":"2","title":"really nice instrument","review":"This is my second nexstar scope. My first was a six years old refractor. This one is a vast improvement. Optical quality is excellent, the tripod is rock solid, and the sky align technology can't be beat. Also, the quality of the included eyepiece is really nice.For the reviewer who thinks it should ship with such accessories as a carry bag, etc...well, in a perfect world, yes, but none of the other major telescope vendors include such things. Until it becomes competitively necessary for them to give away for free what is now a lucrative accessory market, they won't.Nice scope. You won't be disappointed. Good mix of optical quality and portability"},{"rating":"2","title":"SMTA volume 3","review":"It has a great variety of vocal selections. If you want modern, rock musical stuff though, this is definitely not the right choice. I think that, since this is soprano, they have put much of the music into a slightly higher key (when compared to the sheet music for the musicals themselves)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The least enjoyable story of Elizabeth's life","review":"I've read many books about Elizabeth, both history & historical fiction, and this one is the least enjoyable of anything I've read. It is ridiculously inaccurate; many actual events, quotes, etc. are mangled and misused by the author to no good effect other than to make Elizabeth very unlikable - perhaps that was the intent? There are rantings at the beginning of each section that were downright annoying, and the author portrayed Elizabeth as neurotic and unstable throughout the book. It just doesn't jibe with what numerous other writers have shown her to be. There are many other books on this topic more worth reading, such as The Diary of Anne Boleyn, Brief Gaudy Hour, etc. This one is sure to disappoint true Tudor history fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical fiction","review":"Elizabeth I is an amazing Queen who is still shrouded in some mystery. There is a quest amongst historians to get at the \\"real\\" Queen Elizabeth and Roslind Miles does a great job of doing this. This is an intriguing \\"historical fiction\\" read about Elizabeth from her young days of being the discarded child of Ann Boleyn to the beloved Queen of England. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in learning a little more about the Queen. Although this is a historical fiction, the author did do research into Queen Elizabeth so there is a lot there that is true, or semi true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"Ms. Miles does an incredible job at teaching history in a delightful thoughtful read While very long, the book is one i did not wish to put down I recommend it to anyone interested in this period of history"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simpering at best","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer (Delamaine?) I have about 70 pages left, which is the only reason I will finish this book. And I am in no hurry. I was expecting something with a lot more insight into how England's greatest monarch faced all her challenges. Instead most of the book harped on her relationship with Robert Dudley. It came across as a simpering romance. There were some interesting moments about Robert Cecil, the brains behind the thrown. The next time I want to read and learn about a historical figure, I will stick to history writers and away from fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"This is a fantastic book. Last fall my husband and I went to London. Prior to our trip we both decided to do some studying on the history of England - particularly of the various Kings and Queens - so we had some knowledge during our trip. I have always been fascinated with Henry VIII and how horrible a person he actually was, but during my research I've realized that ELIZABETH is actually the most interesting character in English history (of course in my opinion). This book, although fiction, is so dead-on with how I envision her. This book details her life with such clarity and so convincingly that I felt as if I was at court with her! If you have even a mild interest in English monarchs start with Elizabeth. She was an extremely astute, wise woman and this book clearly shows how her life was lived. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Fiction than History - AND IT'S BORING!","review":"ugh. I am a lover of historical fiction and I completely understand that LIBERTIES are taken in these books. BUT, Elizabeth was \\"the Virgin Queen.\\" Virgin. That was her thing - she was married to England and never succumbed to the pleasures of the flesh. I don't understand how a historian such as the author could completely disregard a major aspect of this woman's life and present her having sex with Robin.On top of everything, the writing is stale, uninteresting and it bored me to death. I rarely put down a book before finishing it, but this clunker is going straight to Goodwill tomorrow.If you want TO-DIE-FOR historical fiction, check out Sandra Gulland's three book series about Josephine Bonaparte. Those are a historical portrait worth spending time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was E R really a simpering, vapid woman?","review":"Argh, as a reader of historical fiction I was really looking forward to this book and it is only about 30% actual history and the rest is Elizabeth's vapid moaning about (a) men she loves, (b) men who love her, (c) catty other women, (d) men she loves, and so on. By the end of the book (around age 60) she is showing herself as a ruler who is being led by her heart, not her mind, with consequences for England that were not the best.Due to the excessive discussions of love and romance in this book I'd be more tempted to classify it as a romance novel than historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I am a Briton and a history buff, especially of my country. Elizabeth is one of the most fascinating women of history, British or otherwise, and I loved this personal insight into the extreme pressure of being a queen. From her speeches about Robin Dudley, to her worries about her face and body as she gets older to the threat of the Armada, this is a wonderful book, all around. Vive la reine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flushing out an icon","review":"This book was excellent. I would've given this book 5 stars, but I am a hard grader. This book made Elizabeth I real. Not only did she come alive, but the other players during her reign became more 3 dimensional. \\"Bloody Mary\\" and Mary Queen of Scots were rather one dimensional because this book was of course a platform for the true queen, Elizabeth, and I appreciate that not-so-subtle technique. Not to give too much away, there were a few scenes in the book that really challenged my beliefs on how Elizabeth ran her life and kingdom. There was a lot of preoccupation with men and love, but it did not distract from the story too much. At some points, I had to put the book down and shake my head at some of the preoccuptions with certain men. Anyway, this is a great book and an amazingly quick read for a thick book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This was one of the best book on Elizabeth that I've found. If you like anything by Margaret George, you'll love this. If you love this, read George's Henry VIII. Awesome stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let-down","review":"When I picked up I, Elizabeth, I was excited to have found a book that would present Queen Elizabeth's entire life. From the start I was annoyed with the weak and lust-led protrayal of Elizabeth. In the entire book, there were barely a handful of likeable characters, and Elizabeth was not one of them. Characters were never well developed and hardly ever memorable. The writing style was drawn out and boring. The plot was simply the same conflict over and over, with little variation other than a few names. The only thing that saved the book from being a complete failure was the amazing history it was based on, and the incredible amount of research put into it. In the end, it was still very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"As an amateur buff of Renaissance history, I really disliked this book. I found a historical error part way through which bothered me quite a bit. I also couldn't stand Elizabeth how she fawned over the men in her life, as well as how catty she was to other women, or the lack of regard to other political happenings. She was dull and whiny and by the descriptions you'd think she never ate ever. While some of the descriptions about her clothing were very good, there was no mention as to why her clothing was so ornate. (ie, the grander the clothing, the grander the persons station) This book as a whole was entirely too long. Don't bother buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!","review":"I hadn't been skiing in over 15 years, so I didn't want to spend too much money outfitting myself for a weekend trip. I definitely got my $'s worth with this purchase--it was great! The versatility is nice (it was a fairly warm day, which made being able to wear the jacket w/o the fleece perfect!). The only drawback for me is the hard edge of the hood visor (which I imagine might be quite practical)--when stored in the collar, it's a bit uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE.IT...LOVE.IT","review":"I needed a jacket to walk the dog in temperatures ranging 40-50 degrees F.

This one seems to combine a lot of elements that got the IG to where they are today with more modern sensibilities. They are never afraid to approach an issue or 2, however this CD does not get bogged down with a lot of 'emotion wrenching' stuff (sorry, fans) - they seemed to have focused on making more 'publicly appealing' stuff, however sticking to their guns (no sell out here at all!). Overall, a great CD to add to your IG collection, empty or not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Breathtaking","review":"Though the music doesn't hit me with the same strength that the Swamp Ophelia album did, the power of the music on Shaming of the Sun is undeniable. Shame On You shows Amy's softer side, which is a joy in and of itself. Emily gives us a soft new lovie tune in Get out the Map. Shed your Skin is strong, powerful, and full of shedding powers. Leeds and Everything in it's own time are two of Emily's best songs. Thought is a mite different than some of their previous stuff, a true and intelligent fan will not be able to put it down. Go GIRLS! ;c)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Strange Departure May Not Be the Best Idea","review":"This most recent of the Indigo Girls' studio albums is certainly a break from the folk-style music that made them so popular in the first place(not to mention winning them a Grammy or two), but the addition of the electric guitar and much more brash, overt lyrics made them not only less powerful to the heart and mind, but occasionally painful to the ears, as well. There are a few good songs here, notably \\"Don't Give That Girl a Gun\\" and \\"Shame on You\\", but all in all, this is the one Indigo Girls album that utterly falls flat. Granted, it's still the Indigo Girls, which makes it better than most of the new music out there, but I expected more from this abundantly-talented duo."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've been better","review":"I applaud their attempt to break into a new music scene - essentially electric. But this album is to produced, to executed - not the raw sound of their previous albums. They seem to be lacking in their lyrics as well as their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world were they thinking...Artists!!!","review":"The Indigo Girls going electric are on the same line as Michael Jordan's feeble attempt at playing baseball. The similarities are uncanny. If I wanted to hear electric, I would pop in Van Halen or Boston. I am an extremely big music fan with well over 800 cd's in virtually every style of music and, with the exception of a few selections on this cd, it is garbage. It is so disappointing when these artists cross the bounds that made them rich and famous. So many have lost there fans due to \\"creative expression\\". As Michael Jordan eventually did, go back to your roots IG and you will be on top again."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should limit ALL of these editions","review":"In fact, they should take existing albums off the shelf. The Indigo Girls are not very good outside their genre. Their move into rock 'n' roll is like Mercedes producing a Chrysler...what were they thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I worship all things Indigo! Especially this album!","review":"I was completely taken aback by the very different, but not completely unexpected styles on this album. It is certainly harder edged than their earlier albums, but I think they have been building up to this for ages. Amy's songs such as \\"Touch Me Fall\\" and \\"This Train Revised\\" just forshadowed songs such as \\"Shame on You\\" and \\"Cut it Out.\\" \\"Shed Your Skin,\\" which is my favorite song right now, is more of a departure for Amy. It is much more black and heavy, although, at the same time it is inspiring. And, not to forget Emily, \\"Get Out the Map\\" and \\"Its Alright\\" are absoltuely wonderful. Buy this album!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd rocks, the Indigo Girls are fantastic!","review":"I just recently discovered the Indigo Girls, although I've seen them around, but never gave them a chance. Then a few months ago, I was intrigued by their performance at Lilith Fair. Now that I've snatched up almost all of their cd's, I am totally captivated by their unique blend of talent. Emily is as soft as Amy is spirited, no other duo compliments each other better than they do. I have no favorite, I like them both equally. The songs that stand out for me are Caramia and Shed your Skin, although I also favor Burn all the Letters. They rock! They are talented women who should get more recognition than they do. If not for Lilith Fair, I may not have had the pleasure of discovering them. This cd is more than worth the money it costs, I've enjoyed it tremendously!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best work","review":"I have been a big fan of the IG for many years now, and find great songs and new things to be excited about with each new album. Sadly, this one is the exception to that rule. I get the impression that they were trying to hard to achieve a \\"departure\\" from their norm, with the more electric, harder-edged sound, more overtly political lyrics, and those very strange backup vocals. If you're a diehard fan looking for some of their more experimental stuff, this is the album for you-- otherwise their are better choices, both older and newer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girls ain't what they used to be...","review":"I've been an IG fan for a long, long time now, but I really don't like this album much. They seem to have forgotten that you can write a really great song using just a few chords and a couple of guitars. I also think that as their lyrics become more ideological, the music becomes less accessible. It's not a matter of whether or not one agrees with the statements made; I, personally, just don't care for politics on my stereo. I think the Alternative/Lilith Fair crowd will like this album a lot... but I'm interested to hear what other long-time fans think of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better luck next time...","review":"Being a fan who can sing every line forwards and backwards, I was disappointed with this album as a whole. Still, the song \\"Leeds\\" is 'poetry in motion' and once again my hat goes off to Emily's talent as a modern bard. \\"Get out the Map\\" is certainly worth mentioning, but all in all, I can only hope that their next album will take a turn for the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislabeled Product","review":"The audio cassette version of this product being sold is not the full product.

The concept of listen/repeat in your car on the way to work without alot of book-study at the lower levels is effective, easy, fun.The purpose of this particular French set of 4 cassettes is to provide an introduction into the Pimsleur system to see if you like the system and want to move directly up to the larger Level I set.If you are planning to use this set to get ready for a trip to France, this may not be the correct set for you. If you will only be in Paris two days or less, this might be OK.

However, it does this at the expense of teaching a more extensive vocabulary. It is an excellent introduction to the language, in particular the sound of the language. But if you want to really be able to communicate, you will need a much larger vocabulary than provided by these tapes.

I found the following problems:1) it is too sensitive in some instances - like near a plastic surge protector2) it is not sensitive enough in other instances - in outlets where the tip cannot go in fully3) it is erratic when touching the metal base of lamps (I tried two) - it indicates dangerous voltage when I know for sure that this is not the case.

So that is why I bought the Fluke non-contact tester. But it goes off when it is in your hand, or you move it to much and so on. Than when I checked a ck it said it was off and I know it was on. Than I checked it again it said it was on. That was the end of that tester, I could never trust it again.

I states it senses 90-1000V, which probably explains why the tip has to almost be touching a wire before the light goes off.

This book failed to transport me to the Rock.I wanted to feel how the doctor changed over time, what defenses he erected, and which turned out to be soul-saving.

Lusitania (An Epic Tragedy) has all the appropriate elements with its combinatin of action, mystery, double-dealing, cowardice, villiany, with even a little romance thrown in. She handles all of these elements with great aplomb and with even more skill than her previous ventures (Boxer Rebellion, A First Rate Tragedy, both recommended if you like Lusitania.) The set piece is, of course, the sinking and the author does not fail to deliver but even more interesting is her later chapters showing the impact of the sinking on Germany, Britain and, particularly, the United States. She still has a tendendcy to come across as an apologist but it is more tempered in this book. A wonderful summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pulitzer Gem that was overlooked.","review":"I cannot begin to describe how moved I was by Ms. Preston's work. Lusitania: An Epic Tragedy is a masterpiece of scholarship and style. Truly fascinating and monumental. I almost felt as if I were onboard on that fatal day. I felt helpless knowing that the majority of passengers were doomed all the while the sun shining and the shore in sight. Ms. Preston covers her bases allowing the reader to view the tragedy from all angles. We see the perspective of Germany, England, America and the remainder of Europe. In addition, she exposes the truths and lies that continue to surround the Lusitania tragedy to this day. Ms. Preston's book was an impulse buy, but I find the Lusitania sinking a memory I shall not forget and her book a remarkable work that I will always remember. Hats off Ms. Preston.

Are we really to believe that survivors had limbs amputated on the decks of rescue trawlers and without anasthetic? Come on! Fishermen gutting fish is one thing, amputations are quite another! Her play on the sympathy vote is quite extraordinary. Images kept her awake at night? Poor thing! Try hot milk, dear! (Or counting the money). I'm sorry, but I think the journalist in her won over the historian! The only thing keeping her book afloat is the sheer willpower of her publisher's promotional machine.

If you want a soundtrack with up to date as well as good old school songs, this cd does not dissappoint. What i also like, especially with chakas keep your head up is that it uplifts and give a positive message to all going thru trying times. I loved how Tyler incorporated The Ojays family reunion to tie in and fit so well with the family in the movie.

I don't care much for the lyrics, but his vocals carry the song.Chaka Khan's performance on \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" is a softer, gentler Chaka and works very, very well with the great concept and lyrics of this song.Not too thrilled with the rest of the CD, but still worth the price of the cd since they aren't doing a single for Johnny Gill's song and it, alone, is worth my money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best soundtrack out in a long time ;-)","review":"This is an amazing soundtrack full of all my favourite singers.

The nice deep cushion is really surprisingly firm which is wonderful. Some couch cushions can be a bit flimsy, but it's amazingly solid and comfy-firm for lounging. It keeps its shape and is sleek and modern. I had been worried about the wood as I'd never heard of it before - but it is really strong and has a deep rich honey red color that looks like it will last. I bought 3 pieces to make up a sectional and all pieces matched beautifully, no variation in the coloring.

This should definitely be marked as indoor furniture. The cushions are completely ruined. I put them on my deck and after a month or so they began to get stained and started growing mildew. I called Amazon and they sent replacement cushions. I then put the new ones on and what do you know, the same thing happened again. They covers are next to impossible to get off to even try and bleach and wash. I am really disappointed and angry that I wasted over $1000 on the patio furniture. I will never make that mistake again. I am now on the search of cushions at other stores that will fit this collection....BUYERS BEWARE.

I don't want to screw it up, so I will need to buy a router bit for my drill and try to shave the right amount off. I am not sure how this will affect the way the bolts go in though.Also, despite this comment in Amazon's description--\\"The chair offers a gently angled seat back on which to recline.\\"--this chaise DOES NOT RECLINE!

One doesn't make enemies very easily there but I can see that Ms Doyle perhaps left a \\"bad taste\\" to many.

Although, I skipped the long summaries after every chapter. If you subtract the 31 pages of introduction to client/server architecture, the redundant \\"tips\\" and, the summaries this \\"book\\" will come in under 100 pages.The few interesting points he makes, he refers later chapters for the details and some of his descriptions are so convoluted that I had to go back to my own code to make sure that I knew what was happening.

Why Wiley thinks they can charge this amount for no work at all is beyond me. It is littered with grammatical errors, incomprehensible sentences, and annoying repetition. In short, it is nearly unreadable. To add insult to injury, there are countless summaries which condescend to tell the reader that she should now have a good understanding of the covered material, and can move on. Don't be so sure you will have a good understanding. I did not, and I've been using RMI for some time.As others have stated, the examples are contrived, and not very well written.

I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact Errors vs. spelling Errors","review":"Quite frankly I wish I had read the many other reviews before I invested in this book. The author makes much of correcting Clark's spelling errors, but his own errors reveal he did not go much beyond the spelling. Especially egregious is the one where he tells us that we cannot know from the jouurnals how many canoes were made by Lewis and Clark at the top of Great Falls. The number is given explicitly in the journal entries for three days: July 9, 10, and 14. Because of this I will try to find other books about Burr, wilkinson and Pike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chasing the facts","review":"This is a laugh-aloud book at times. Our author is at times a funny fellow, clearly a revisionist historian, and unfortunately an omitter of details and scholarly references. Yet, in all, I could not put the book down. It's really quite droll, if you do not mind the occasional scatological jarring.But beware....our author is loose on facts. Most obvious example is in his lengthy misidentification of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase as \\"Salmon P. Chase.\\" Samuel Chase was tried by Congress during Jefferson's administration. However, Salmon Chase was born much later than Samuel and served on Presidnet Lincoln's cabinet and later was a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well edited, so is it truthfully written?","review":"The basic story is intriguing and very gripping, but is it the truth? The book could have been wonderful, but is seriously flawed. Snippets of tales appear haphazardly, making the reading of it less flowing - and on two instances the facts were contrary to basic knowledge of any 6th grade student in history:1.) Andrew Jackson was not destined to be President in 1820. (He took office in 1829, I recall without looking it up.)2.) Thomas Jefferson was not the 2nd President. (What ever happened to John Adams?)When these obvious errors appeared, I thought perhaps the rest of the book was junk too, so why bother reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting and, yes, slapdash","review":"For readers who have a passing knowledge of Lewis and Clark, Aaron Burr and even Zebulon Pike, this book provides interesting insight into American political life prior to the War of 1812. The ironic, speculative style will also be appealing to many. In this regard, the conclusion, a succinct muse on the significance of these actors in American history, is provocative.Here's the problem: even a nonspecialist reader like myself recognizes errors. I read the 2000 paperback edition and noted these mistakes: a reference to Burr's duel with \\"Madison\\" (pg. 216); a reference to Andrew Jackson's election in \\"1820\\", not 1828 (pg. 250); and mention of one of Burr's court hearings in Tennessee when they actually occurred in other states (pg. 280). This type of carelessness is disconcerting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish the publisher had lost this manuscript!","review":"This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I'm not sure what point the author was trying to make. What he does is present a random assortment of events from the Lewis and Clark expedition interspersed with some extremely sketchy information about Aaron Burr's attempt to create a country out of the Louisiana Territory, and confusing accounts of Zebulon Pike's misadventures.There are much better books about the Lewis and Clark Expedition(\\"Undaunted Courage\\" by Stephen Amborse for instance). There is more (and better written) information on the internet about Aaron Burr and the \\"Burr Conspiracy\\".I failed to find any humor in this book, just boring, disjointed, fragmented narratives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining reading, if slapdash at times","review":"Mr. Montgomery's book is a compulsively readable account of the exploration of the Great West, chronicling the triumphs and foibles of Lewis and Clark, contrasted with the incompetent bumblings of Zebulon Pike. Montgomery also explores Aaron Burr's treasonous attempts to detach a portion of the Louisiana purchase and/or Mexico for his own private fiefdom. I won't rehash the numerous and embarassing factual errors in the work, but would partly exonerate the author by noting that they are likely the product of haste and sloppiness, and would have been culled out by a better editor. Montgomery makes no pretension at serious history, but spins a good, journalistic yarn, casting light into an obscure corner of US history. His grasp of character seems particularly sharp."},{"rating":"1","title":"can I rate on a negative scale?","review":"This author should have tried his hand at fiction instead of attempting historical fact. This book is a laughable attempt at writing history and the author should be ashamed of himself. It is so full of errors that it should have been called \\"Don't Know Much About History\\". Unfortunately that title was already taken. I am stunned by the fact that the author holds degrees in history from major universities. I see no need to comment on the bizarre, repetitive writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I Give Zero Stars?","review":"Burr dueled Madison? Jefferson the second president? Andrew Jackson elected president in 1820? Unbelievably, you can find all these incredible factual errors in Jefferson and the Gun-Men.

I have owned a number of EA games such as NHL 2001 and 2002, which worked great. The latest arrival from EA simply does not work, so I would like to offer a few words of caution. First, don't trust EA system requirements on the box. You may later find that your NVIDIA RIVA TNT2 is not supported. You may be able to start the game, but it would be slow and choppy. Second, don't rush to upgrade your card. I now have GeForce4 MX420 card and the game still does not start, even after having all the latest drivers/updates/patches applied. My computer far exceeds minimum system requirements. A number of people complained about similar problems, so my case is not unique.

You want a game that feels sort of like real soccer and looks realistic, but when I want to play real soccer I go outside with a ball. The point of a game is to be a little bit fantastic. Hence the star powers in World Cup 2002.But the worst thing is just how the game looks. The graphics look great on the EA website, but in actuality the players all run like Gumby, the field appears slanted, and the goals are simply grey boxes.

The shipping cost to me was $13.50 and to return it to the seller cost me $15.50--a total shipping expense of $29.00. The seller was not willing to reimburse any of the shipping charges. Customer service rating an F. On the other hand, Amazon was extremely helpful and rates tops in customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pizzelle Iron","review":"The Palmer Pizzelle Iron is the real deal. Made in the USA, it's design probably hasn't changed in the 50+ years they have been made. No need to change. It's simple, it works. Makes perfect pizzelle. Backed by a 10 year guarantee. Why would you buy any other one? This one may cost a little more, but considering the time we'll spend making and enjoying them, it's insignificant.The unit is built solid out of cast aluminum. Looks like it could withstand anything. Once warmed up and seasoned (with the first pizzelle), this iron cranks them out, absolutely no sticking. No need for the teflon. Clean up is a breeze - just wipe it clean after it cools down.And to answer another reviewer's question, this iron makes two 5\\" pizzelle."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best.... if not the best","review":"I have a C Palmer Pizzelle Model 1000T made in 1981... works as well today as it did the day I got it.The Pizzelles with this iron are not as thin as with my VillaWare(I like thin and crispy), but thePalmer makes nicer looking sturdier pizzelles that don't break so easy... The shape of the ironwas well thought out, because any overspills can easily be wiped while cooking and the cookies lookgreat.Also even though my Palmer is 30 years old and I accidently had a problem and needed a replacement part,I called C Palmer Mfg in PA and they sent me new parts for a very reasonable price....and the people I spoke to at the company were more than glad to help. Try doing that with a chinese madeproduct.... you would most likely have to buy a whole new iron.I can't say enough good things about this product or this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware buying from this manufacturer","review":"I purchased this item a week ago, and anxiously awaited delivery. Once it came, I immediately opened it, and made a batch using my favorite recipe. After about 6 Pizzelles, I knew this iron was not for me as it makes them way thicker than any other iron I have ever used. They are actually more like thin cakes which is not what I'm accustom to. I have since contacted Amazon regarding a return, and my message passed on to the company that actually shipped it. At that point I was told that they do not accept used products back (3 minutes worth), and if I do wish to return it, I have to pay a 25% restocking fee! Yes, 25% not the standard 10%. I never bash companies at all, but being one of the more expensive irons out there, I would expect more from a US based company! I will now contact Amazon regarding this since I do not see anything about that return policy on the site or would never of have ordered from them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I was very excited to get my Pizzelle Maker!

Since reading her book and others, I've come to the conclusion that she doesn't. Her discussion of investments is particularly shallow and contains numerous inaccuracies. Better books that I've read include Bogle's On Mutual Funds, Random Walk Down Wall Street, Investing and Mutual Funds for Dummies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your share of money and publicity!","review":"Businessmen and politicians learned long ago that getting the money and publicity go hand-in-hand. Not just any publicity, but solid personal publicity. If we want people to value our abilities, we must first show that we value ourselves - by making sure our accomplishments are visible to targeted audiences. If we want people to invest in our companies, to buy from us, or to hire and promote us into the corner office, they have to know who we are, what we have accomplished and why they should do business with us! Self-promotion is a valuable business tool that businesswomen MUST add to their strategies for success. Following a careful step-by-step process will help even the most timid become comfortable with the concept of self-promotion. (from Marion E. Gold, award-winning author of \\"The Personal Publicity Planner: A Guide to Marketing YOU\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled!","review":"Having looked at this book, it seems obvious to me that it is basically a marketing strategy that differentiates it from it's ultimate source: Peter Lynch. Stav has culled from the advice of Lynch and some others a method to investing, combined this with her own story, and then written a book in whcih she suggests that this is some sort of \\"women's investment strategy,\\" trying to make female readers think this method is particularly for them. It isn't. It's just investment advice, and second-hand at that. What this book really proves is that you can put the word \\"Woman\\" on any book and guarentee yourself a share of the market these days, and that's pretty sad. Read Lynch, instead. Why not go with the orignal?"},{"rating":"1","title":"CANSLIM Through the Author's Eyes","review":"If Julie Stav's book is an everyday Woman's Guide to Striking it Rich in the Stock Market then William O'Neill's - How to Make Money in Stocks and 24 Lessons for Investment Success must be the man's guide. I was very disappointed that the author did not share with her reader's the Investor's Business Daily newspaper as at least one source for information necessary to complete her BEAPROFIT system. I think she does her readers, male or female, a disservice by not doing so since the majority, if not all, the information necessary to complete her BEAPROFIT system is included in this paper daily.

It's about the worst advice you can get in a volatile market (meaning prices are rising and dropping sharply and quickly). What this means is that you will be buying and selling stocks way too often and for no good reason.Mrs. Stav's advice is called Momentum investing and all it will do is generate broker commissions for Mrs. Stav (and other stockbrokers).Don't forget, the money to pay her broker commissions is coming out of your pocket and you will never get it back.There are many better and money making investing books on the market. This is just plain terrible advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is useless","review":"This book is horrible in its investment advice.

There is not one negative comment in anyone's review except for mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS ADVICE","review":"If you follow the advice in this book, such as sell your stocks whenever they drop more than 10%, you will become broke!!!Don't take my word for it. Many big-city newspapers and wire services have reported on how dangerous Mrs. Stav's advice really is.With the stock market now so volatile (prices rising and falling quickly), following her advice of selling so often is only gambling...and you will surely lose.To make matters worse, you will owe big taxes and stockbroker commissions by following this terrible advice. But, Mrs. Stav is a stockbroker so maybe her real goal is to get you to hand over your money for her to manage directly. Handing your money over to any stockbroker or financial planner is even more dangerous to your wealth.If you're looking to lose money, this book and Mrs. Stav's advice will help you lose it fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied with this book","review":"Unlike other books, I see the hand of a teacher here, starting from the beginning and guiding you through it, all the while encouraging you and making the book readable, light and even pleasant on the very serious subject of the stock market. This is my personal opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Stockbrokers Looking For New Customers","review":"Very hard sell from a woman looking to make commissions from customers.The advice in this book is mediocre at best but her real goal is to confuse readers enough that they will call her and hire her as their broker.The money I paid for this book would have been better spent paying down my credit card debt. JULIE STAV IS THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL \\"GET HER SHARE\\" from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have paid off credit card debt instead","review":"I stupidly followed the advice in this book and used the few extra dollars I had each month to buy stocks. What a mistake! I did exactly what Julie said to do and sold my stocks when they dropped by 10% in value. Between stockbroker commissions and taxes I am now $3,178 poorer than I was before I started. To make matters worse, these \\"poor performing stocks\\" jumped in price right after I sold them.Instead of buying stocks I should have paid off my credit card debt instead. Then I could have bought into some good mutual funds or better stocks.The advice in this book can cost you pleanty. I learned the hard way. If you want to buy a good stock-buying book choose the one by Peter Lynch called \\"One Up On Wall Street.\\" Peter Lynch's advice is so good that Julie Stav repeats it and Peter Lynch's name over and over again. So buy the original book (by Peter Lynch) and not this book which is just a bad rip off of his advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is not just for women","review":"Men, this book is very helpful.

As a Latina woman I am ashamed that Miss Stav would be preying on the fears and financial problems of our own people. The advice isn't new or well written and it won't show you the way to financial freedom. ONLY THE AUTHOR WILL GET RICH FROM THIS BOOK!!

She has such an impact on her listeners that's its astounding, she is one of those very rare true artists! She has it all a voice/lyrics/piano prodigy. She recently was also married. CONGRADULATIONS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD for fans and collectors","review":"I would recommend buying this CD in addition to the US release of \\"Under these Rocks and Stones\\". Not only are there four bonus tracks, the packaging features completely different photos and a better layout. Leaving on a Jet Plane (the final bonus track) was performed better by Peter Paul and Mary, but Chantal is much more personable, and has more fun with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This album is phenomenal. I remembered liking a couple of her songs back in the nineties, so I bought Under These Rocks & Stones on Itunes and am entirely impressed. The album takes a couple of listens to appreciate its beauty but you'll be happy you did. My favourite songs are \\"Surrounded\\", \\"God Made Me\\", \\"Believer\\", \\"Grace\\", and \\"Wayne\\", but the rest of the tracks are very strong and beautifully composed. Chantal shares with us her heart and it shines through in a powerful way. Her vocals and lyrics are unique and indescribable. I'm looking forward to buying her other albums but I'm sure it's gonna be hard to top this one. A must buy for people who enjoy meaningful and profound music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"What a debut CD from this multi-talented Canadian singer-songwriter. Chantal has the gift to rock and yet thug at your heartstrings at the same time. Her songs are brilliantly written, often poignant, and always melodic. \\"Surrounded\\" and \\"Wayne\\" are probably two of the most powerful songs I have ever heard-especially on \\"Wayne\\" the emotion just keeps building and building-masterful production and delivery.\\" Imaginary Friend\\" changes the pace to a slower,more reflective (yet still powerful), tone. You can easily see why this CD has firmly established Ms Kreviazuk as one of Canada's finest, if not slightly underrated, stars. She certainly has the vocal range and skills to have a long, healthy career-add the songwriting skills and you have a true superstar in the making...Bravo !"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD !","review":"Two words of advice: buy this CD ! It is *hands down* the best ever. In Canada, Chantal has already released her second album, \\"Color Moving and Still\\", and the US had better look out when some of these tracks hit radio, like \\"Before You\\" (featured on Dawson's Creek last week). Buy this album for the sweet simplicity of \\"surrounded\\", \\"green apples\\" and \\"hands\\" The power of \\"god made me\\", \\"boot\\" and \\"believer\\", and the bittersweet \\"wayne\\" and \\"grace\\". Chantal is pretty big in Canada, why isn't this all over \\"Billboard\\" ? Buy it people, and maybe it will be !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Chantal reminds me of Tori Amos sometimes, in that both are excellent piano players (in a contest, I'd bet on Tori, though) and great singers. However, Chantal's music doesn't have enough of that special . . . 'something' . . . that Tori has. Still, Chantal's fascinating in interview (she loves the piano, the best instrument ever!) and the songs are great too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow baby....","review":"I love this album! It totally rocks! Chantal has an amazing, powerful voice. Her piano playing is just amazing. I love Wayne. That is my favourite out of an album that is just outstanding. I'm looking forward to more stuff from this amazing talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"It is an incredible shame this phenom does not get more airplay. I found this album by accident two years ago while listening at random at a local record store. I bought it immeadiately and became an instant fan. A short while later she came to town with Lilith Fair and I dragged all my friends there early just to see Chantal. They all became fans as well. Unfortunately that was the only time I ever heard any airplay of this great album. It would make a great addition to anyones music library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new artist.","review":"Chantal is a great, talented woman. The CD has some great songs (thought some aren't so good). Why isn't this girl more popular? News for all Chantal fans: word is Chantal, who has already had two songs featured on the show Dawson's Creek, is going to sing next season's theme song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful debut from a talented singer/songwriter","review":"This is a very well produced first album. Chantal has a great deal of ability to convey honest emotions; this talent is by-passed by a great deal of today's artists. Sometimes her voice penetrates a bit too deeply, but overall it's quite effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very convincent rendition.","review":"There are many recordings of Mahler's 5th, but only a few capture thereal \\"Angst\\" of the work.

This book as stated before is a collection of schematics with no insight into the design or trade offs of one circuit over another. Only good thing I can say good about this book is, it contains an example of different amplifier circuits in one place. Most amplifiers in this book use opamps. Do not buy this book if you are looking to learn about amplifier design. This is at best a picture book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Useful and Interesting","review":"The great thing about this book is that it is an extensive library of working circuits with component values. This provides an excellent service as a reference design for a circuit designer, i.e. a starting point for someone who already has design chops. If you lack design chops, probably better to reference one of the thousands of books written from the perspective of explaining the basics of circuit theory. This book was never intended to be a primer on the basics of circuit theory but instead a collection of reference designs vastly useful to a design engineer."},{"rating":"2","title":"What would I do in Naples and Amalfi without it!!","review":"We followed most of the recommendations and guides and spent wonderful 10 days.

I have liked his WW2 era thrillers much better. THE EAGLE HAS LANDED and the recent FLIGHT OF EAGLES were both outstanding. THE WHITE HOUSE CONNECTION was the worst of the 10-plus books that I have read written by Higgins -- predictable, overly simplistic, and, in the end, rather boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that","review":"Same old stuff. The book has the same level of entertainment as his past books, but how about coming up with some new twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack is going downhill!","review":"The first books written by Higgins were excellent. They were realistic and fast paced. Unfortunately he is going downhill fast! The characters are so shallow they are almost cardboard and the plot is foolish. And does any really think that the Secret Service would let anyone in the same building, much less in the same room with the President without going through metal and weapons checks? I'm sorry that Higgins has sunk to the level of writing for money instead of producing good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avid Reader","review":"I very much enjoy reading and Jack Higgins is the latest in my \\"new authors\\" catagory. I've been able to find his books that I want to read at very good prices on line. Good delivery time and in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic but with suspense","review":"I think this book is not worth much. The story is simplistic and slow up to the half of the book. Then the suspense kicks in and you don't want to put it down. The description of the characters, however, lacks depth. On top of this the author seems to know his homeland (Britain) very well while his description of the United States is very much lacking. (see use of words, habits that are described)The characters on both sides of the ocean just seem to be interested in the case. The union worker is connected to the mob, a typical stereotype. The president, whose name is Cazalet, seems unrealistic. We never hear of his security detail and he just seems to think that smoking is OK but a trouble if his voters hear it. Otherwise he seems to lack any political convictions or plans (i.e. what is his take on the Northern Ireland problem?).The book also talks alot about the situation in NIreland and peace but very little about the issues involved. Should every reader be an expert?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writer, poor writing.","review":"I ordinarily like Jack Higgins' books, but the dialogue in this one was juvenile. The plotting was okay, but the character, Sean's, over-used, back slapping, \\"I don't care if I die\\" dialogue is just silly after a while. Ferguson is an over-stuffed Englishman. When Higgins writes dialogue for his Americian characters, their dialogue sounds English, not American. This book needed an editor familiar with American idiom. Higgins can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Me More!","review":"I love this book. Especially Sean D., but thats besides the point. It was worth the sleep I lost while reading it. This book and all the others are worth reading. Flight of Eagles is also worth missing sleep for. Only a few books have ever made me feel so strongly after finishing that I have wanted to read it again, just so I didn't lose that feeling. I WANT MORE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Higgins storyline","review":"This is solid Higgins stuff with a good plot that kept me turning the pages. My only complaint is that if he's going to write about Americans, he needs to make them speak like Americans. Having the Americans speak like they're British distracts from an otherwise good story. A great quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Higgins at his best unless you like alot of rainy days","review":"Usually Higgins is fun & entertaining. This book falls short in plot, character development and interesting narrative. The sun never shone one day, who needs a book where it rains every single day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never fails to deliver a great story!","review":"I have followed Mr. Higgin's work for several years, reread most of his novels. He truly is an author who has created memorable characters, great plot lines, and satisfying reading. There are several authors out there who have done remarkable work, among them: Ken Follet, Frederick Forsythe, and I can go on and on. On the other hand, a lot of the obscure authors, like Richard Greenwald's Spear of Golgotha, got little exposure in the US-too bad, it was a great read. There are a lot of so-called thrillers which are worth the time and money (books aren't cheap), that deliver. I stopped believing the so-called reviewers several dollars ago, and started reading what other readers on Amazon have to say. A lot of them are right on the money because they don't get paid to review books by the companies who spend a lot on marketing and distribution. Amazon has done a great service to readers. Thank you. And Mr. Higgins, keep up the GREAT work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Higgins has done it again!","review":"I have just finished this book and loved it! I have read a lot of books by Higgins (aka Harry Patterson) and have enjoyed them - especially the ones with Sean Dillon, Hanna Bernstein and Brigadier Ferguson.

(Next time a WASP says \\"Good God!\\" when confronted with shocking news, please notify me)(also \\"Damn you!\\" and many other old Higgins 'classic' cliches) all in all this book looks like taken from a bunch of his other novels cut apart and taped together in one big book. definitly not 'Eaglehas Landed' or 'Eye of the Storm'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable!","review":"The White House Connection is a predictable story. And not very suspensful.The novel is about a mother who avenges the death of her son at the hands of the IRA. The mother, in her late fifties, is the least believable of the characters in the book. When she finds out that her son was done in by treachery, she traipses between the US and England killing the bad guys. Huh? Where did she suddenly develop this uncanny ability to stalk and kill? This character, Lady Lang, threw me off the book from the start. I just wished that Jack Higgins had developed a better story than this. It would seem that he is running out of fresh ideas.I stayed, painfully, with the book until the end because of Sean Dillon and gang. It was nice to have them back again. Dillon was a bit laid back this time around. More action next time, Dillon.Higgins should go back to his WWII themes. They were his best. Try harder next time, Jack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please disconnect me from this nonsense","review":"Excuse me, with all the clues out there, why did it take these masterminds so long to figure out who was knocking off all the Sons of Erin? Higgins must be getting royalties from the tobacco and alcohol firms, with all of the gratuitus product plugs he's inserted between the lame storyline. I was starting to hope that Dillon would go the way of the Soak Hole, and I'm sorry, but I have no sympathy for Lady Helen, despite what the President may think. One final slam - this book was far too rich in Irish brogue and British colloquilisms. Go back to Thunder Point if you want to see Sean Dillon in good form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bottom Latch","review":"I put my lantern in the case for the first time, and the bottom did not fully latch.

Turn on the CD's namesake, 'So Warm' and you immediately slip into their chilled out world of melodic bliss.

This item arrived packed in a large box with lots of butcher-weight paper. It seemed well protected but there was still bits of chipped enamel in the bottom of the basin which all seem to have come from the rim. The rim itself is the most disappointing aspect of this item. It is rough and not turned all the way, as well as losing it's enamel. The enameled finish itself is the worst I've seen (but I only have GSI Outdoor and Le Creuset enamelware) - it is bubbly with raised points, and unevenly applied.

And it's tremendous fun. Based on the deadly dull novels by Anthony Trollope, the series was turned into a grand portrait of Victorian social mores. Bottom line, it's a soap opera set in the 1800s with politics, scandal and high society. A \\"must\\" for anyone who enjoys period drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Television","review":"I fell in love with this series when it was screened several years ago here on cable television. Although by today's period drama standards it could be called, 'tacky' due to the studio like nature of the filming, it is compeling viewing!

To be fair, I bailed early in season 1. (Does Plantagenet look like Ed Muskie?) There are other dramatizations of Trollope. Perhaps I'll try those.Raven's (largely UK) reputation as a novelist is quite high. Perhaps I'll try those. Rather ironic, considering my view of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pallisers-A monumental work","review":"Based on the political novels by Trollope, which few read since they are a total of over 2000 pages, this series is one of the most intelligent television renderings of a work of literature that has been done, illustrating the strength of television over movies for the dramatisation of literature. I hope the rest of the episodes will be issued soon, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and balanced","review":"MacDonald has successfully revealed much of the often clouded life of Intrepid, a man whose primary career goal was - of course - to remain in the shadows. The immensely likeable and non-descript Stephenson (Intrepid) was the penultimate spy: you wouldn't notice him in a crowd and if you did, you'd find yourself charmed and at ease. This side of the man has been overlooked in past books, but MacDonald reveals just how significant this particular trait is to an effective intelligence officer. In Stephenson, readers will learn how charm hid the great depths of intelligence, honor and violent resolve that made Intrepid a name to admire in the history of his profession. MacDonald also offers a highly-readable, compelling look at the events of Intrepid's life, keeping an admirable balance between objectivity and the thrills of a good story. David R. Bannon, Ph.D.; author \\"Race Against Evil.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The True Intrepid","review":"It seems that the author has researched and revewed previous books about William Stephenson.

It was one book I could not finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I read a lot and particularly enjoy biographies and books that relate to history. I was very disappointed by this book. Perhaps a person such as Sir William Stephenson is too shrouded in mystery to write a serious book. But if so, why should I waste my time reading about 'who said what' if nobody knows anything for sure? And, to be completely honest: I actually did not make it to the end - after reading half the book I gave up, utterly bored and disappointed.

They did!! They filmed some of the best and fastest fight scenes in the Ocean Shore Catalog.The story seemed to be about a man who was on the run and who was always being hunted down for no apparent reason. Villian after villian is hired to kill this guy but there is no way for them to match his high skills as he defeats them easily. Enter in his master who only begins to teach him kung fu after he has already beaten several other men.

Second, this guy who's the main character is doing the worst Woody Allen imitation I have ever seen. Worse than Jason Alexander during the first season of Sienfeld!

The real comedic moments in this exaggerated and ultimately strained comedy occur when Mr. Husband begins to realize that Mrs. Wife and the second woman in the sexual escapade can do very well without him in the bedroom. Predictably, he resents his wife's discovery of her sexual joy with females and his fantasy-come-true starts to become a nightmare. The Freudian pink elephant in the room is how she, who had no interest in exploring sexual adventures, is deemed the \\"sex monster\\" when it was he who had a sex monster inside his brain begging for an opportunity to destroy marital boundaries. And there must be something spiking this film's Southern California drinking water, because the married are either unfaithful or frustrated -- and the singles succumb easily to temptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for price but small size is not true gauge","review":"8 gauge would be a stretch for this wire!! maybe the diameter of the insulation would be 8 gauge if the entire insulation was made out of copper as well, either way I used the power wire for my speakers, which is nice cause it makes for good speaker wire, you can still wire a car or truck with it (and the size makes hiding it easier) but it is not a high quality wire for competition like set up, unless you use the stuff for speaker wire, then its cool, plus you get some nifty extras like zip ties and rca's excellent purchase for low budget installs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Parts","review":"The package came on time, and was nicely packaged.

Everyone especially wants to share how to write a script, but that is what we just went to film school for four years to learn isn't it? We don't need that, we need to learn how to get a job, what the different jobs really are and what they are advertised to be and what the pitfalls are. To do that we need canded advice and I think that anonymous interviews would have been better since that would have given some of the hard truths that film school and Hollywood staffers can't share truthfully or people up the food chain make grudges for exposing them. I agree with the pictures, they are so self-imporant it is funny. But overall I just don't think this book is as advertised. It's not really going to help anyone just out of film school unless you can flatter one of the people interviewed in the book. It's not bad, just not really what it thinks it is.

But then I realized that they didn't include the other favourite track of mine, ' Stripper Vicar'. What a shame!With their debut album, Mansun explored the new boundary of music that other new band don't dare even to think about. Song like 'The Chad who loves me' gives weird romantic feeling.

Pearl hunters, looking for quick riches, encounter the strange islanders and chaos ensues. Originally meant for children, Edie Romero's Beyond Atlantis is definitely not a children's film, though it is lacking in the nudity of other Fillipino movies of the time. Starring John Ashley, Sid Haig, and Vic Diaz - this is a must see movie for Edie Romero, Filipino exploitation, and Sid Haig fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I bought the first 4 books in the Bombshell Series, and this was the first one I read. What a disappointing start! I gave it 2 stars because although the author set up a pretty good plot, I just didn't care for what she did with it. It's always a bad sign when I start scanning through to get to the end, and that's what I did with this book. Also, there is very little romance in this book. Kai and Jake spend the whole time tip-toing around each other. Am I mistaken, or is this supposed to be a romance series?

I was hoping that there would be dogs, echoes, pigs on the wing II, wish you were here, shine on, high hopes, Time, Is there anybody out there etc. But the only good song in this book for playing with the guitar is On the Turning away.

Just looking for a description of some of the attractions.I found the guide difficult to use. Although I didn't need much in the way of logistical support, there was really very little. There were only about 4 maps in the whole book and they were spaced out all over the place. Virtually no information on specifics for those arriving overland. Worse, the descriptions of the attractions any sense of enthusiasm. Normally when I read a guidebook, I get the sense that sites are over-hyped, but this book almost made me want to skip the city altogether.I have found Frommers on-line a good source of info and reviews but won't be buying another of their guidebooks in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Frommers Fan","review":"We have a shelf of Frommer guides, US cities, Canada, Mexico, Europe & Asia.

First, the writing is snappy and enjoyable. Secondly, the author shines a well-deserved light (without fawning) onto Sir Hugh Dowding, who as leader of RAF Fighter Command, was one of the few people who had a clear vision of how to avert the destruction of the RAF and to repel the anticipated German invasion of Britain. He was stubborn, made enemies, and had to endure being undermined by some subordinates, but held it together long enough to deny the Nazis their 'sure' victory.

Examples: Leigh Mallory insubordination, no camouflage paint on planes, why 1932 jet wasn't developed, formation flying, no deflection shooting practice, insufficient swopping of fatigued/fresh pilots between groups, no calling back of semi-trained pilots who were jettisoned before finishing courses, etc, etc. Most of these errors were obvious before fighting started.A Summer Bright and Terrible: Winston Churchill, Lord Dowding, Radar, and the Impossible Triumph of the Battle of Britain"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book About A Little Known Hero","review":"Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding has long been known to me as one of the most important men in the defeat of Hitler and Nazi Germany, yet few Americans know who he is.David E.

Cuba Gooding does not have a significant role in this movie, which was a letdown for me. The action scenes are good; the flight sequences and dogfight scenes are well choreographed and produced. The movie seems a remake of Tuskegee Airmen and definitely not an improvement. The plot is loose; there's not much of a build to any sort of climax and at the two-hour mark (approximately), the movie ends.

Honestly the terrible characters and tepid story line could be forgiven, but the dialogue, oh the cringeworthy dialogue... Somewhere between robot and overtly racist minstrel cartoon. The white people's lines are read by Microsoft Sam and the black people are horrific parodies of a Chris Rock character.

I was not aware of this until I saw the movie and the facts check so based on a true story of a battle on 2 front (Nazi and race).Some of it is a bit surreal (how the guys who don't like them, likes them quite fast). The German guy is a bit comical in a B-rated way, but the rest is quite appealing and I went to check the facts.

Military discipline and procedures are very inaccurately portrayed. The plethora of characters are either played as stereotypes or barely developed. From the unit's commander to the the evil enemy fighter pilot, there is no emotional depth to generate the viewer's interest.

While some of the flying sequences were interesting, they were pasted together with entirely predictable....and dare I say stereotypical, performances. Anyone who hasn't lived under a rock must appreciate the struggle minority soldiers, sailors and airmen endured to serve a country where they all to often were marginalized and unappreciated. However, the acting in this film fails to connect those facts at a gut level at least from my perspective. Much better in that respect can be found in a film such as \\"Glory\\"...but of course just about anything with Morgan Freeman in the cast is pretty much a winner in my book. The bottom line is that if offered as a rental, it might be worth watching for the flying scenes.

What a slap in the face it is to not only the original Tuskegee Airmen who risked their lives fighting, but to the people of Alabama. The story line was impossible to follow. At no time did it give any of the history behind the \\"experiment\\" that was conducted. The dialogue was pathetic. The worst acting I've seen by Cuba and Terrence.George Lucas needs his butt kicked and this so called director would do better directing Sesame Street in Pakistan. The air scenes were good but that's about it. Keep your money in your pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda film?","review":"I feel this film is doing an injustice and glorfying the wrong airmen. This film make you believe that they won the war, killed Hitler and defeated the Japanese; while other troopsstayed in the trenches and were to afraid to fight.This is nothing more than a propaganda film. Much likeHitler did to the German youths prior to declaring waron his own people. Don't fall for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!","review":"Action sequences were fantastic BUT........the storyline and acting was just god awful! 10 minutes into the dialogue almostput me into a coma.

The writers of Red Tails should take lessonson what makes a great character driven story."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of money","review":"true story ok, but the acting sucks there's only three actors Ivé ever seen before and both me and my wife fell to sleep after thirty minutes of watching the movie,later I tried watching again and once again fell asleep(don't buy untill you've rented first)just painfully boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why don't they sell single Blu-ray's anymore?","review":"I have to say I have not viewed Red Tails yet. I have been looking forward for it to come out on Blu-ray since I honestly cannot stay awake in the movies anymore for any movie. One thing I would like to know is why in the world do I have to buy a Blu-ray, DVD and sometimes a Digital Disk, when all I want is the Blu-ray. I've noticed that on almost every new release, you have to buy the pricey 2 or 3 digit version. I now buy very few Blu-rays and when the movie isn't an action or big CG movie, I'll drop down and buy it on DVD or wait it out to buy the Blu-rays when they pop the price down to 9.99 because nobody wants to pay 25 - 30 dollars for the movie. So whenever I see a movie that I cannot buy as a single Blu-ray, it will get 1 star from me for that alone. Now about the movie again, as some of you mentioned, the movie in 1995 \\"The Tuskegee Airmen\\" is well worth the watch. If you haven't seen that movie yet, catch it before you view this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish watching it","review":"This movie was just awful - bad dialog, bad acting, etc. Last winter I saw a story on TV with George Lucas talking about investing his own money and was excited for this to come out on instant streaming. Then I saw the trailer on TV and it looked a little weak but I still had high hopes. Maybe my expectations were just too high. I was expecting a semi-blockbuster and this felt like a TV movie of the week. I turned it off halfway through the movie so I can't even give this a rating of \\"watchable\\".

I don't think any actors could have done anything to save a script so poorly constructed.

The plot was thin and trite; most everything was cliched. The only good thing about this movie - and you'd have to be a fan of WWII fighters to appreciate it - was seeing realistic CG renditions of classic Allied and Axis planes flying over the European theater. (The only reason I actually gave this movie a two-star review is because I DO happen to be enthralled with Second World War history, and period combat aircraft, in particular.) The aerial combat scenes were exciting, but almost comically blown out of proportion. Looked like Star Wars, with Messerschmitts instead of Tie fighters! Save your money for a better WWII air combat movie ... rent \\"Midway\\" or \\"Memphis Belle\\". Even the flying propaganda-poster movies of 1941-45 had better plot lines, and acting, than this movie (see The Flying Tigers or Flying Leathernecks). I can't exactly say that it did a disservice to the Tuskeegee airmen, but it certainly did not honor their memory, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie about great airmen","review":"I am a big fan of the Tuskegee Airmen. They are heroes in my book, but this movie does not do them the excitement or heart throbbing action that they deserved. I found the movie very slow in many parts and the connection to the characters was distant. Maybe George Lucas needed Spielberg to tell their heroic efforts in a much better way. Movie only gets one star. These heroes deserve five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Redtails!","review":"I met many of the Tuskegee airmen at an air show in Columbus, Ohio several years ago. (\\"Mustangs and Legends\\") True American heroes and key men in the advancement of civil rights! I enjoyed the movie and found it to better than I had heard. One major negative- the left wing George Lucas took his racist shots at the brave American white pilots. What a \\"surprise\\", George. They deserve better- Lucas should be ashamed. Otherwise, the movie does portray the struggles and the bravery of the Tuskegee airmen. It's a story that needs to be told, and one that shouldn't be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Video Purchase","review":"The video stopped playing and turned into a black screen twice while we were watching the video.

The racism and struggles these brave men had to go through was treated like a sick joke.In every possible way, this movie stinks.

It's not better than that.For the not famous portion of the cast the acting could have used some polishing because the capacity of the people involved is there, you just don't see them doing their best, except for maybe Ne-Yo as the comic relief.The dialog is clumsy and somewhat C movie quality as is specially noticeable in the first scene.Special effects are o.k. the top shots of the base leave something to be desired.All in all this movie requires two things to become actually good.1: Better direction and demand on its actors.2: Better edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great american heroes... warriors","review":"The story of these men is very moving... they fight for a country that treats them like dirt.As others have said, This story was told in \\"Tuskegee Airmen\\" not that long ago; but maybe some people need regular reminders.I'm of Irish/German ancestry, and being white, hear a lot of trash from people who don't think that they're racists.Keep reminding us.Another movie especially worth watching is \\"The Miracle at St. Anna's\\".In any case, I thank these men; and all American warriors. My continued freedom is thanks to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story deserved a better movie","review":"The Tuskegee Airmen is one of the great inspirational stories of WWII. The fact that these men sacrificed a great deal and overcame much more is a story worth telling. Red Tails fails to do this in spectacular fashion. It's obvious they wanted to tell this story but were either too cheap or didn't have the respect to use the common names so we were stuck with Red Tails. The characters are stock movie fashion, the solemn leader, the hot shot, the joker and the rookie. It's obvious that no research was really done and the dialog is laughable at best.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie. It does no credit to the story of the brave airmen and combines the worst quality of script and shooting. Don't waste your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I looked forward to seeing this film. I was disappointed because it did not depict the real history of the Tuskegee airmen in World War II. Instead it is a fictionalized account that is about as accurate to the Tuskegee airmen as MASH was to army field hospitals in the Korean war.It is rife with technical inaccuracies including unbelievably advanced radios on their planes, high explosive machine gun ammunition, cameras on their planes to record their kills and cavalier, free style military tactics that would have resulted in court martials in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie!","review":"The actors in \\"Red Tail\\" are phenomenal and, more importantly, this movie tells a story which has been ignored and left out of our history books. These african-american pilots and airmen had to fight every step of the way to be part of WWII. Their job was to protect the bombers from enemy fighter planes and in reality, they did an exceptional job, never leaving their bomber(s), protecting them every step of the way. There was plenty of action and also a good story line in the characters. Anyone would like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!","review":"This was a GREAT movie...

The movie Red Tails is a poor example of a movie telling a compelling story. The attention to effects, costumes, locations, and other technical aspects was very impressive.

It failed to tell a great and true story in a great way, but it did succeed in remaining family friendly.

Apparantly, other reviewers are afflicted with bias but this movie nailsa realistic portrayal of these heroes. As for those who criticize the CGI, well you can't watch 95%of anything on TV and in the theatre without CGI, what's the problem now? Actually, I thought it's use was properlybalanced.

One black colonel and one white colonel believe in the 532nd and are in the states to convince those in charge that this black unit is capable of serving.Though it has the typical language of a war movie, the blood is less than I expected.

Human males produce this stuff at the height of extacsy, at which time the aliens (beautifully portrayed by three vixens one being JJ North) suck this stuff out of the men leaving them like raisins.Some funny moments in this movie but the detective's slapstick and stupid humour really made this movie stink.

Any serious music student needs to hear each note.Back In The USA is probably the musically weakest for thin sound. In a attempt to get back to roots, the band are too light on the guitar growl and the attempt at playing it straight translates into the MC5 playing it flat.Still, even as a run of the mill 1970 album, which this is not historically but may be musically, this is very cool, and no truly comprehensive rock library will be so without this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most overrated albums of all time?","review":"I really don't get why this album gets so much praise.

And if you're looking for classic punk, I'd say look somewhere else. This is just old time rock 'n' roll performed pretty poorly. Look at what Alice Cooper did at the time - way more punk, way more interesting, and way higher quality than this.The reason I give this two stars and not one is that The Human Being Lawnmower is actually a cool song. The rest I could do without.My opinion of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"MC5 at their most mainstream and least essential, but still fine stuff","review":"First of all, I'll state the obvious, just to be clear: the MC5 were one of the greatest, and also most criminally underappreciated (both then and now) bands in rock history. They, along with the Stooges, played rock'n'roll at its most basic and essential, and both bands paved the way for punk to come in several years later.Having said that, this is a very good, not quite great, album. I've docked a star off my rating because of the album's slick but lifeless production quality, which lacks the sheer roar and bite of the MC5's other albums, and a few tracks that should have been left off including two cover tunes.

This was witty, funny, sexy, and one heck of a good mystery. Belinda Hennessey is starting over in Atlanta. While car pooling with some friends from work she runs into a hunk of a policeman. The banter between the friends while car pooling is humorous. The people at Belinda's Company start dying, is there a serial killer on the loose? Belinda seems to just fall into one thing or another. Of course all the good looking, hot, hot guys have the hots of Belinda too. The book was easy, fun, sexy reading, the mystery will keep you guessing until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Once again the book started slowly but eventually everything came together and I could not put it down.

I enjoyed getting to know Belinda, the main character. She moves from Cincinatti after an embarrassment that the reader doesn't get all the details of until Belinda is under suspicion for murder much later in the book. We find out when her coworkers and friends do. The reader is definitely along for the ride and it's a fab one.I don't always dig the description of 'romantic' anything, but I made an exception for this one since it's labeled as a 'romantic mystery'. I thought of it more as a humorous mystery with a tinge of romance thrown in.Please do yourself a favor and find this book, whether handheld, e-book or audio.

I started with a book penned later than this, which references the \\"advice manual for Grown Women\\" that the characters in the carpool have decided to create during the nightmare commutes to work in Atlanta.What was funny is that this book grabbed mu attention from the start - mentioning an area and a situation with traffic that is all too common on the news here. And it continued with a theme of starting anew, being the 'new kid' in the room, a horrible boss ( we have all had those ) and the amazing intimacy of the time spent in commuter traffic with 3 other people you don't know.A thoroughly enjoyable read, with a whodunit tossed in there that was a surprise to me, at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps You Guessing","review":"Very enjoyable read. I liked the characters, especially the car pool girls. Some of the male characters are interesting and some are down right HOT! Lots of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty much what i expected","review":"Having read other Stephanie Bond books before, it's pretty much what I expected.

Not a great deal of higher learning on the trail. The book reminds me of many of the sales/goal setting/motivational courses I have taken. If I wanted that type of book I would have purchased one like that. I expected more about a man who overcame illness and learned a great deal about himself by his time alone in the woods. What I got was a training class on goal setting. My rating is based on my dissapointment.

In fact, it's barely a book at all, since the font is huge and on most pages the text ends way before the page does. Nevertheless, this book reflects the high character and admirable spirit of the author, Jay Platt, who hiked the entire AT with a debilitating disease. My hat is off to him. Although I didn't think much of his book, by the end of it I liked the author very much. He strikes me as a straight-forward, honest, and kind man. His book is intended as advice for life (\\"life lessons\\"). If you would benefit from learning that life is like a hiking trail (sometimes it goes up, and sometimes it goes down), then this is the book for you. But since I had already figured out that life has some ups and downs, and that attitude can be quite important, reading the book was for me, a down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This is a book about the author's hike on a trail, and the lessons of life that he learned along the way. He tells his story in a fascinating way, and keeps you wanting to turn the page. It is a funny, adventurous, inspirational, and motivational story that leaves you thinking about your own life and whether or not you are living your life the way you want to. He makes you open your eyes and make a conscienous effort to pay attention to others and by taking 5 minutes with someone you may be saving their life. This book made me re-evaluate my life and the way I live it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life lessons for everyone","review":"\\"A TIME TO WALK\\" is an outstanding book.

She captures the sheer fun of observing and participating in a foreign culture better than any writer on the subject I've read to date. Her empathy for the French despite their quirks - naturally, only quirks when seen by an American - resonates well with my experience. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you expect from the cover!","review":"'Sorely disappointed' best describes my feelings after finishing this book (I almost quit after finishing about 60%, but I kept hoping for something better!). The cover description offers more than the book delivers. Some of the first articles in the book were entertaining, especially to one who lived and worked in Paris for a couple of years. However, the last half of the book is probably of interest only to serious (and elderly) patrons of the arts or to persons who might be practicing for Trivial Pursuit or Jeopardy. Having read the Herald Tribune daily (except Sunday) for 3 years in the early 1990's, I cannot recall having read any of the author's colunmns, which may well be an indication of why I was not enthralled with the collection in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"QuickBooks Pro - Quick to end support.","review":"QuickBooks 2001 is no longer supported.

We are from an Ulster-Scots/Scotch-Irish background, and during those three weeks we fell in love with the land that our forebears had settled in so many centuries before, bringing thier fiddles and folk songs with them, creating what was the core of mountain old-time music and bluegrass.

I completely agree with the above review except for part about the \\"best actor.\\" I think all of the acting was awful. Kurt Sinclair seemed to be trying a little too hard at moments to be psychotic and menacing... and the wig(s) he wears to portray his being younger is rather distracting. In spite of the directing and (lack of) special effects, the guy who played Scott was the most authentic actor in this movie.The directing and editing was awful. The acting was even worse. The sound track was mostly predictable and at times completely inappropriate. The overall effect is reminiscent of watching a Saturday Night Live skit spoofing a mix of Silence of the Lambs, Kiss the Girls and Saw (at one point, Scott says \\"I want to play a game\\" in a deep dramatic voice). Yeah. The only thing funny about it though, is that it is so bad.

Then that one went dry. I had to switch to yellow... and you guessed it. The yellow ran dry as well. So I thought, okay, at least I seem to have plenty of green. And then the green went dry.

I bought two sets - one for my son, the other for my daughter, they're enjoying them. I've used them to color in some pages of the kids' coloring books, and see two shortcomings. First, the amount of ink is inconsistent from pen to pen - some flow very heavy ink, others much lighter. This results in inconsistent color depth in the strokes. The second shortcoming is the color of the pen's plastic often poorly matches the color of the pen's ink. For example, what looks like a dark green pen from the color of the plastic, has ink that flows very close to black. Many other colors vary greatly from plastic to ink. When these pens need replacing, I'll try a different set for comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Pens & Bad Service","review":"I have purchased several brands of markers including Staedtler, OfficeMax metallic, TUL ultra fine, Bic Mark it fine point, and the Pentel Color Pen Set.

When I contacted the Pentel company via their online web site to ask how I can return the whole set, since they are guaranteed, there was no response whatsoever. On the other hand, I returned one of the Bic Mark it pens for replacement & I not only received my new pen in short order they also threw in several $1 off coupons for future Bic purchases!

Now one of the wheels keeps falling off because the locking nut is defective. I am so disappointed. These things are all fixable, but for the amount I paid for it, I would expect it to just be right.

Today the name \\"Disney\\" evokes a huge multi-million dollar corporation. I think people forget that Walt Disney was in fact a remarkable human being with some very revolutionary ideas about entertainment. He constantly pushed the envelope and never rested on his laurels. (Don't associate the name Disney with pushing the envelope? Consider this: Disney repeatedly risked bankrupting himself to push his studio and the industry forward... going from black and white to color cartoons, going from shorts to full-length feature cartoons, from cartoons to live-action films, and from films to theme parks. If you've never read a biography of Walt, this isn't a bad resource to get started and find out what the man was made of. But honestly this should have been a day calender, not a book.

I strongly recommend this to every body. It's a great family movie, on the count that there is a little bit of sex-related humor.

Lighthearted, breezy and full of romance, \\"Three to Tango\\" boasts a wonderful comic performance from Neve Campbell, who, with this film, shows she is an actress capable of an amazing range of emotions. Dylan McDermott, Matthew Perry and Oliver Platt also turn in nice performances, but it is Campbell and the romance factor that steal the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny and sweet romantic comedy; perfect for weekend..","review":"This film has a very funny plot and and a great dialogue, too. I really enjoyed it as a light romantic comedy for a Sunday evening screening. The whole family could watch it together, I suppose. Neve Campbell and Matthew Perry had a beautiful \\"on-screen chemistry\\" together, and that accounted for a lot of charm in this movie.

So he enlists him to watch over his girlfriend played by the always cute Neve campbell. I don't know why this movie was blasted by just about every critic. Because it is a rather good romantic comedy. Matthew Perry and Neve Campbell are both good looking so they look cute. They have a courtship that is genuinelly funny and touching in which you hope that they will end up together which i was hoping because they were so good together.

Quite frankly, that was the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. Perry is extremely funny in the TV show Friends, and he is also funny in this movie. He has good on-screen chemistry with both Neve Campbell and his co-star Oliver Platt. This movie was amusing and light, and that's all it was intended to be. I quite enjoyed it! The only part I thought was kind of dumb was the part where Neve was in the bathtub and allows Matt to come in and watch because she thinks he is gay. Then she proceeds to tell him her secret lesbian fantasies. As if! THAT part must have been written by a guy (maybe it was the screenwriter's secret fantasy).

This is okay, but not about where to find gold in Washington State. The actual section with information on where to find gold in Washington State is 1 1/2 pages long if printed in 14 point font.

Basic errors abound, lack of variable initialisation is everywhere, C features are used where better C++ features exist.Additionally, the code typesetting is poor, indentation varies wildly from place to place.Not recommended, because i) the title is misleading and ii) the code within is very poor C++.Try Scott Meyers Effective C++ and More Effective C++ or Large Scale C++ Software Design by John Lakos instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be Optimizing C, not C++","review":"I think the book illustrated some useful implementations of speedy algorithms, but it is in no way is related to C++.

The police commence stake-outs to catch the killer. Detective Carrie Blass poses as bait. When she gets nipped in a struggle with the vampire . . . she finds herself changing and comes to understand what they are really dealing with. This movie keeps you guessing as to the outcome right down to the end. The characters are believable. It's one of those rare finds, a vampire movie set in modern times that does NOT claim any characters or story line from Dracula.

This movie is clearly an homage to the Demy films (to the point of casting his son as the leading man, even though he doesn't really fit the type), but \\"Jeanne and the Perfect Guy\\" lacks the charm and the visual inventiveness of the Demy films. The best thing about the movie is Virginie Ledoyen, who is as beautiful and appealing as the young Catherine Deneuve was in Demy's most popular films. The worst thing is the music. It's downright awful and the mediocre songs only made me aware of how important Michel Legrand's score were to Jacques Demy's films and the importance of a good score to any movie musical in general. I'm sure the filmmakers heart was in the right place (especially in their efforts to bring topics like immigration and AIDS to the musical genre), but their musical and visual execution falls short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun though mediocre quality","review":"Has all the favorite Abba songs with lyrics highlighted one word at a time (not one letter at a time) and passable background music.

In fact it slowed down my computer so much I upgraded that too. When I called to get the key code to transfer it over to the new computer there was no problem. When I went to do payroll I found out that none of the information had transferred over. I called customer service and was told I was only allowed one free download.

The alteration is evident on the tour de force first track, \\"One More Heartache\\" which became a early FM radio favorate.

His description of the outbreak of the First World War is basically wrong and he gives far too much credit to pan-slavism for prompting Russia's entry into the war than he does the alliance system or any of the other international events of the July Crisis. He continues to repeat the myths of the Russian Army fighting with sticks which were demolished back in the '70s by Norman Stone.As for the Revolution, he is contradictory in a number of areas, at one point describing the attack on Poland in 1920 defensive, and then a few pages later portraying it as a measure to spread revolution to Germany.The use of a mass of material combined with lack of analysis don't make a good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complex, impracticable","review":"While reading I found myself folding numerous pages to flip back and forth trying to understand information the book is trying to convey. Too complex, too time consuming, too much minutia, too tedious and basically impracticable reading.

What sets this book apart from most other history's of this time period, is the author's explanation as to why the Russian revolution was different from others (i.e. French or American). Detailed statistics on land ownership and other factors help the reader understand why Russia turned towards such a harsh and unforgiving political system. The only problem with the book is that it is assumed that the reader has some detailed knowledge of the time period and the various historical characters. Otherwise, it is an excellent detailed view of the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly how Russian history should be written","review":"One will rarely find a Russian history book that is so stimulating, detailed and original. Its greatest strength is its combination of the traditional \\"top-down\\" narrative - what went on at the Tsarist court, in the Duma and in the upper reaches of the Bolshevik party - with \\"bottom-up\\" accounts of what life was like for ordinary people in the cities, factories and, above all, the far-flung rural estates and provinces of Russia. Many histories of late Tsarist Russia, the Revolution and the early Soviet period are difficult to read because they are arid, lacking in human detail and burdened with abstract theories of little interest to anyone except self-important historians. But this book is extravagantly rich in detail and often written in an exuberant, entertaining style. One last point: the photographs reprinted in the book are absolutely first-class, telling as much about this period of Russian history as the text itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tour De Force","review":"The author takes the reader on an informative journey through the Russian Revolution. Much of the text is devoted to elaborations, justifications, and explanations of persons and events, and this can be soporific, especially if you aren't caught up on your sleep. But if you forge ahead, you will be well rewarded. Colorful and historically important characters like Nicholas II, Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, and Gorky are brought to life with insight, along with the important events they take part in. A large supporting cast, with characters like Alexandra, Rasputin, Kerensky, General Brusilov, and Prince Lvov add to the dramatic saga, highlighted by many tasty anecdotes.You get only a few, unremarkable maps, but you get many photos, and they are good.\\"A People's Tragedy\\" is a great accomplishment, and a reading of it will enrich you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of information","review":"This book gave me all the information I wanted to know about the Russian Revolution. It shows what a deeply disappointing tragedy the whole affair was, to just about everyone involved except Stalin and possibly Lenin. This book was written shortly after the creation of the Russian Federation in the mid-1990s, so the author spends a great deal of time analyzing \\"what went wrong\\" in founding a democracy in Russia in 1917, and how to hopefully avoid those mistakes in the 1990s.I have a small criticism to make about this book: the author hardly ever introduces a character with his full name, which makes it difficult to search for information for the person online. I don't think any author should ever introduce a historical figure by calling them only by their last name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start but gains momentum","review":"I found the first hundred pages of this to be really slow. I felt like a lot of detail just seemed unnecessary to understanding the subject matter. I am so glad I kept on reading though as the whole book seemed to improve dramatically from that rocky start. The detail was good and interesting, the history well written. Even though I know a lot about the period I found the way it was delivered here to be moving. I would definitely recommend this as a great book on this period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Product Description","review":"When I was searching for Davidoff Cool Water to buy as a gift for my husband, I came across the product - Davidoff Cool Water Eau de Toilette Natural Spray for Men.

I couldn't get into it and had a hard time finding any humor in it at all. I got half way through it and had to turn it off. Maybe I was expecting a satire on politics, instead what was revealed was the truth in politics and that isn't funny. If the movie had fallen under a drama, I may have been able to get through it, but then again I probably wouldn't have bought it at all.

This is only in print because no other current textbook in listening is available.The only reason to buy this book is because it is assigned reading. The subject is exceptionally rich but boredom awaits you. The end of chapter exercises are decent. Learning and communication theory is insufficiently applied in organization and presentation of ideas. Key themes & phrases are buried deep in paragraphs and the wrong sentences get bolded.

If you like good traditional live gospel music, than this album is for you.

I was looking for a stupid, pointless, and thoroughly predictable romantic comedy. What I got was a wry, funny, and unexpected movie more than willing to poke fun at itself for the silly premise. Rather than a Pygmailion-like story of a creation come to life, this movie was more about understanding both sides of the gender line.When Justine becomes Jake, her computer designed fantasy bloke, she gets (or has) to go places always barred to her before, and to puzzle out the mystery of what makes a bloke tick. Trailing along with Chas, Justine's computer-geek-next-door, Jake ventures onto the basketball court, into the locker room (yike!!!) and even onto the dance floor with Hoover (guess why she got the nickname).This movie is hilarious, and well worth watching as the clueless and shallow Justine gets a good idea of what life and love are all about, both as a guy and a girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"sexual Virtuality","review":"This little no name film was a delight....originally I had thought it was going to be some b-movie bore, but in actuality, it proved to be a DVD Champ! Something has to be said about the wonderful cinematography.....don't get me wrong this film is most definitely not an oscar contender, but it does have some vivid footage....with wonderful camera angles as well as an infectious array of well played and thought out characters.... I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a cleverly written comedic and charming teeny bop love story, which just so happens to have a groovy soundtrack, which is produced and utilized in a very hip and audibly enjoyable fashion... for what it's worth, I paid $9.25 for this, but had I known that it was this entertaining, I would have paid up to $20.00 for it....

I've been living yoga for about 2 months now (I know it's just too little time) and this one really satisfied my need and curiosity on a more challenging yoga session. There are 3 secquences in here (30 minutes, 60 minutes & 90 minutes long) so you can adjust them to your timetable. The pics are very useful and show precisely what the posture should look like and includes step-by-step instructions on getting in and out of the posture. There are lots of useful tips on using props and varying the depth of the posture depending on your level. Let's point that this is not Ashtanga/Vinyasa Yoga (which is a bit more demanding but also less flexible on the length of the sequences and the postures you must include) but can actually be used as an introduction to more powerful types of yoga so you can later on try Ashtanga/Vinyasa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is a must-have for anyone who likes the \\"guitar god\\" style.

It is quite a bit thinner, the elastic straps that hold it on may need to be supplemented, and some double stick tape or latex costume adhesive are a must to get the mustache to stay in place. That said, it's a costume wig, and as such, it's fun. I certainly can't complain too much--just don't buy it for your church thinking that you'll be able to use it for years for an Easter/Passion Play.

But the other songs are great especially Love Disease, but also So far so good, No amount of loving, Where did my baby go and last but no least Walking by myself with a great guitar solo of Buzzy Feiten. The Woodstock line up is also my favourite. I know that this album was not received very well by the press and the buyers, but I never understand that. I think because I am more a Paul B. fan than a Mike B. fan.

There is no way the monster-sized brush is useful for filling in anything but the largest sky pieces. You are better off ditching the brush and buying the smallest acrylic brush you can find.I was also a bit disappointed at the size of the cartoons in this one. The finished product was a little blocky which is not what I have come to expect from a paintworks kit. Also, as usual, the number wear off the paint-pots long before you finish the piece so you are better off getting a permanent marker and marking the numbers on the bottom of the pot before beginning. 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun to paint and beautiful finished!","review":"This project is definitely not beginner level, but it was fun and the finished product was incredibly beautifully. I have purchased several other projects from Paintworks directly and they do provide one brush, but that brush is of a low quality. The bristles are usually toast about 1/3 of the way through the project. I used my own brush set on this one. The directions for this one come in two pieces that you have to hold together which was a little annoying. Some of the smaller spots are not marked on the canvas so you have to look them up on the two piece chart or use the reference picture on the box for an idea. There was more than enough paint for the whole project also. Overall it was very enjoyable and I had fun which was the whole point. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard for Adult","review":"This was a gift to my sister, age 55.

The pan is thin and light (compared to other Calphalon pans ... and to Circulon ones, too). It does not conduct heat as well as my Circulon pan (so it doesn't cook food well). And it warps under heat.The pan came in an unmarked, white box: not like other Calphalon plans are sold. Nor is it engraved or marked Calphalon. I think it is a grey-market product and not geniune Calphalon. B/c Calphalon comes in a box marked \\"Calphalon\\" and is engraved Calphalon on the handle and/or pan bottom. Calphalon is also better quality.The shipping was also bizarre. It came in a HUGE box. 15% of the box contained this product: the balance was empty.

This pan is NOT at all what I expected. As I still had the ruined pan, I was able to compare them side by side. The pan above does not have Calphalon printed any where on it (nor did the box). The pan is significantly lighter, not at all sturdy. The handle appears cheap, almost loose. The finish looks like it was scratch at the slightest touch. If you are looking for the quality typical of true Calphalon cookware, do not buy this. You need to search for Calphalon Uninson Grill Pan.

With that said, I have never had a sauna suit tear 20 minutes into the first use.Obviously, once they tear they are useless as they no longer keep in the heat. You are better off using trash bags even though they do not work as well. They will save you the aggravation and the feeling of being had after dropping money on this item that goes straight into garbage after one use.I am not usually the type to write reviews, but this product has disappointed me to the point that writing a bad review was a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy for a Big Man","review":"I would reccommend any one who is of a larger size to buy from this company because it is so hard to find these sizes in regular stores for a sauna suit.

I came to the realization that I am not cynical and the music is dreadful. In fact it is embarrassing. These guys are much better than this effort shows. The musicianship and vocals are top notch but the songs are just terrible, shallow, tripe. What a disappointment and all the more so considering how great they sounded live just a few nights ago in Atlantic City in the company of Stephen Stills. Clearly these guys are NOT over the hill but I cannot fathom what compelled them to release this material. Thankfully they did not perform much of it in their recent live outing. They are capable of much more. Avoid this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crosby and Nash didn't do it !!","review":"I was sure that this album would be a treasure, but after listening to both disc I found it to be a rip-off. I thought there would be more than two tracks worth listening too, but I was wrong. It's been a long time since I bought an album that I wanted to toss out my car window after only the second time through. It sounded like they had a couple of pretty good songs and then had to finish with something (filler) I could have, or any amature song writer could have come up with something better than this crap! I am very disappointed and I hope this wasn't the album to launch their new career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crosby/Nash","review":"Their new album/cd is OK, a few good tunes but is not worth spending 19.99 for. It is sold as a 2 CD set, but the first cdcontains about 45 minutes of music and the 2nd cd has only 24 minutes. All of the combined music is less than 70 minutes which would fit on one CD. It should sell for a one cd price !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, not good at all !","review":"Advance radio airplay with the first track got me to order this CD on its release date. Upon playing the album, it is the only decent track. They (Crosby and Nash) are clearly just collecting a paycheck from this very sub par set of songs and music. Nash particularly seems way past his \\"use-by-date\\".Some of the tracks are simply regurgitated clones of their stuff from 25 years ago, but nowhere near that good.If you are intersted in this album, listen to it all first before (probably not) buying it. Mine goes for a quarter at the wife's next garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crosby Nash","review":"As I read the other customer reviews, I am extremely surprised at their positive nature. I think this double CD is junk. The first CD is acceptable; I would be able to forgive CN for this one. However, the second CD sounds like something they wrote in a weekend and recorded in a day. The only redemption for the second CD is that it's short (another rip off in reality). I bought this piece of music without hesitation as I relied on the quality of music I expected from this great duo. If I had listened to it first, I would not have wasted my money.

There was a danger that with such a large amount of new C&N material - 20 songs - there would be too much \\"filler,\\" but I really dug just about all of the tunes. The musicianship is superb, both singers are in excellent voice, and - most important - the songs themselves are fresh and relevant. I've always looked to Graham Nash as the half of the partnership who wrote the most compelling and memorable songs, where David Crosby was the one who delivered the breathtaking vocals. Well, David's singing is still as amazing as ever, and many of Graham's new songs are strong, but I also appreciated David's song contributions just about as much. I was pleasantly surprised by just how good this two-CD set really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of the importance of the Christian Tradition in world history","review":"A typically great book by Jaroslav Pelikan.

For anyone who wants to get a sense of the depth of impact that Christ has had on the entire world, this book is a great place to start. This being the illustrated edition, it is also filled with beautiful images of Christ, of His Mother, and of His Saints from a variety of cultures and time periods, showing us the diversity of artistic expression that the Christian Tradition has given birth to even as it explains the cultural concepts that Christianity created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Bar Band Pop","review":"I've owned this CD for 3 years & I still listen to it often. Great harmonies, soulful lyrics, & imaginative arrangements make each song on this CD a miniature pop masterpiece.

It's fragile and so on the second replacement I always kept a loop of hose on the sink to ease the strain on the weak part. Still it broke. You have to buy the whole faucet unit each time so 90% of the good parts are trashed in the end with the essential piece. Currently I am working on making a homemade version from instructions on the net.

Once when I used it on timer and was standing with the family in front of the camera, the movement of the shutter shook the tripod perceptibly and I was really concerned it would topple over, fortunately it did not. That was the last time I used it with my expensive camera.I now use it only to take photos for still items ( like for selling on Craigslist ) where I can put my hand on the tripod to keep it firm and steady. And I use my older, cheaper point & shoot cameras.The price was low, only about $5, but I should have spent a little more money and bought a better one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I only got this because it came free with my new Canon A3300 IS as a promotional deal. Reading the description, I thought that the legs would extend at least a little bit, but it really is only about 6 inches tall once the legs are opened. The camera sits on it just fine, but I doubt I will ever use it. If I have a table or surface tall enough to set it on, I will probably just lean on the surface and shoot rather than go through the hassle of getting the tripod out and screwing the camera onto it.It may prove useful if we decide to take some quick family portraits for Christmas cards or something, but unless you do a lot of that, I wouldn't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Hi,Although the price was right....I was very disappointed in the device.

Good in-depth look at the Nuremberg defendants, judges and prosecutors. You certainly got the feeling of the pressure on the prosecution and defendants. The Aftermath section brought you up-to-date (as of 1994) on the major characters lives which was interesting.A very good historical read. After reading the book, I had mixed feelings about the verdicts. Eisenhower was \\"surprised how easily the tribunal convicted the military men\\", I felt the same way.(Update: February 2, 2013)I just watched the movie \\"Nuremberg\\" the TNT mini-series. I highly recommend it after reading he book. The screen play was very close to the book and all the actors did a very good job.

I did however catch it on YouTube with Portugese subtitles or something and there were two things that really struck me. One, if this is some of the best stuff that came out of TV in the early 2000s then the quality of TV has skyrocketed. And two, they are doing a piss poor job of ripping off a far far far better movie made with far better actors called Judgement at Nuremburg. Whew. You want a legal thriller involving that time and place in the course of human events, go for that one. I like Alec Baldwin fine but half of this script seems forced and it doesn't seem to have any emotional content. It seems more like the Jewish producers in Hollywood tried to fulfill their Nazi movie quota for the year 2000. I know that sounds horrible but it left me with that impression for good or ill.Judgment at Nuremberg"},{"rating":"2","title":"We watch it over and over.","review":"My husband and I were happy that this made for TV movie was available on DVD.

Never let us forget the horrors that occurred!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"We just cannot forget that this is a made-for-cable production, a TV production. With that in mind, the film is very nice, giving a general portrait of Nuremberg. Baldwin fives solid performances, but Goering ( Brian Cox ) steals the show. THe only flaw is: for a film that is 169 minutes long, the \\"moral\\" of the convicteds could have been more explored and analysed. Keitel and Jodl are almost totally forgotten !!! The real scenes from NAzi camps are amazing, really depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap imitation","review":"Apparently, a film about the Nuremburg Trials was on Alec Baldwin's To-Do list. The sets and costumes are all adequate. The script is mechanical and unimpressive. That is the best I can say about this movie. The real problem may be in comparison to the original film with Spencer Tracy. The original was unique and should have been left that way. If you have not seen the original, you may appreciate this version more so than I.

I have been told numerous stories of Iron Maiden's unwaivering devotion to their fans, and in light of the Metallica divorce from their fan base and all the other sellout bands, this kind of loyalty deserves true respect, and after hearing this album in it's entirity and hearing the stories, I say rock on Iron Maiden and Bruce Dickenson and I feel that I missed out on years of not being a fan of this prolific metal band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love it!","review":"I was in a used CD store last night when I found a copy of this in the metal section, and being a fan of Iron Maiden (I'm seeing them on June 6th, can't wait!), and Bruce's voice (he's my hero too), I just had to pick this up, and it was definitely money well spent. If you're looking for another Iron Maiden type CD, then you'd be better off buying something else, as this is darker and 10x heavier than anything they've ever released. I really like \\"Gates of Urizen\\", \\"Chemical Wedding\\", \\"The Alchemist\\", \\"Trumpets of Jericho\\". If not, there's not one bad song on here! Adrian Smith joins Bruce's side in playing guitar, and he does a damn fine job. The lyrics are also darker and Bruce's singing style is very agressive. Overall, if you're a Maiden fan, pick this up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When Bruce met William","review":"This is one of the best metal albums available. Just before getting back into Iron Maiden, Bruce Dickinson put out this amazing album with former Iron Maiden Adrian Smith on guitars alongside Roy Z. The combination is even more powerful than in \\"Accident of Birth\\" and the result is something that all Maiden fans will recognize as \\"close enough\\" Iron Maiden sound.A note to the graphical aspect of the album: the paintings of William Blake put to a great display all across the album cover and booklet give a sense that something dark and heavy is going to come out of your speakers as soon as you start playing the CD. The result is achieved!Conclusion: a must have for all metal fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRUCE'S BEST SOLO","review":"Bruce Dickinson's reputation goes before him and his solo material demonstrates his breadth of skill and his depth of talent.

I was unsure of what to expect, I'd read the reviews and I figured it was worth a shot. I had bought CD's from bands that used to be Heavy and was sooooo disapointed. I was grabbed from the begining with an awsome riff and an extremly sweet bass line. It was just the begining, each song is powerful, chunky, heavy, and mean, yes even the two songs that have a very slow tempo. I was impressed with every song. I can't name a favorite, they are all so good. If you only buy one CD, make sure it's this one. Bruce Dickinson Rocks!!!!! This is not an Iron Maiden album, it's waaaay too heavy. Bruce has proved too all the people that said he was nothing without Maiden that he is an amazing musician. I can't recamend this CD enough, it's AWESOME!!!!!!! What are you waiting for???? Buy this CD and be reintroduced to HEAVY METAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's why !","review":"That's why Steve Harris called Bruce and Adrian back to Maiden.

First-class metal, nothing else!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good and Entombed-like","review":"Excellent album, and much better than I expected. Reminds me a lot of later Entombed albums. Very good guitar work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not get the import with the bonus track?","review":"Chemical Wedding is an excellent album. It is a toss-up whether I like it or Accident of Birth (another of Bruce's albums) better, but one thing is obvious: CW is MUCH harder. The only big complaint I have about CW is that it doesn't have the song \\"Return of the King\\" on it. RotK is an EXCELLENT song, and should have been included on the album. Instead, it was limited to the Japanese release only, so American fans are forced to either pirate the song or buy the import. I recommend the LEGAL way of buying the import (which could be found very easily at the time of this review). It is worth the extra money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It really grows on you.","review":"At first I didn't like this album as much as Accident of Birth, but now I like it better ('cause I finally tired of A.O.B after listening to it a million times).It grows on you as all good music does, and some songs are tuned to different keys creating a cool feel for the album. It is crunchy and heavy and the production is great, and in a comparison of songwriters Roy Z. is almost as good with Dickinson as Steve Harris was,( although bassist Eddie Casillas [however good] is a far cry from Harris (In my ever so humble opinion). Right now I like Chemical Wedding even better than Iron Maiden's latest (even though it's less original than Virtual VI) the heavier the better as long as it stays above and beyond the 'noise' metal that's out there these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this NOW!!!!!","review":"Bruce Dickinson follows last year's excellent \\"Accident of Birth\\" with yet another masterpiece. Very heavy, but melodic too, the themes revolve around the work of poet and artist William Blake. The line up includes former Iron Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith, as well as Roy Z, Eddie Casillias, and David Ingraham. In them, Bruce has truly found a team that does him justice and makes for some outstanding musicianship and songwriting. Bruce's voice has never sounded better. This record should make Iron Maiden really jealous! My fave songs are \\"King In Crimson\\", \\"The Tower\\" and \\"Book of Thel\\". Even the CD art is gorgeous. Turn it up and get ready...this one won't leave your CD player for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album of 98!","review":"Lets face it,this album kicks ass! From the thunderous beginings of King in Crimson, to The Alchemist, this album has it all for those into metal music. Bruce promised a heavy album and we got it. People are quick to compare it to Maiden, but the sound is much more richer and different. Granted the album is themeatic like \\"7th Son of a 7th Son\\", but again the band has a cleaner, tighter sound then Maiden. I listen to all sorts of music, and I tell you that this by far was the best album of 98. No other album was as intelligent, original, and powerful. Due to the lack of non-radio play, and the biased attitude toward heavy metal, this album got snubbed. I hope his next solo effort gets critical appraise and/or recognition. I repeat, the best album of 98!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"To all of you out there who haven't listened to this album yet \\"It rocks\\". Truly. The best solo album of his carreer. I now feel that all of my other CD's are neglected because I don't listen to them as much anymore. Oh well. But to all of you out there who said it was the best album of '98 you are wrong. King Diamond's Voodoo was the best album. Sorry guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure genius","review":"I bought this album as soon as it came out. I had purchased Accident Of birth just to see how the ex-Maiden vocalist was doing and was blown away; is Chemical Wedding better? Hmmm...difficult, it is certainly heavier and I really liked it, no loved it even. Tracks such as 'Chemical Wedding', 'The Alchemist' and the 'Book of Thell' were awesome and the balad Jurusalem was a true gem. Two other songs which stood out for me were: 'Gates of Urizen' and 'Trumpets of Jericho'. In short this was a brilliant album and if you enjoyed Accident of Birth, you should not be dissapointed with this one. Why not five stars? With Bruce and Adrian back in Iron Maiden, I await their new album to see whether it will deserve the full monty. So better? I would say that this was Bruce Dickinsons best solo album, despite the brilliance of Accident of Birth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Re-incarnation of Iron Maiden?","review":"If you are an Iron Maiden fan then you'll feast on Bruce Dickensons latest concept album - \\"The Chemical Wedding\\".This follow up to \\"Accident of Birth\\" is heavier and darker, laden with mystical overtones that will please those metal heads of the 80's like myself.Dickenson is forging the way for the \\"new metal\\" of the new millenium. Solid guitar work from the George Lynch-like Roy Z and Ex-Maiden axeman Adrial Smith combine for a tour-de-force of heavy melodies and tasty solo's. Bruce sounds as powerful as ever, and seems to have a renewed enthusiasm since the release of \\"Accident of Birth\\", a slightly better album in my opinion. My one criticizm of this solid and satisfying new record is the somewhat \\"muddy\\" production. It's not quite as clean and polished as Maiden's older stuff, but overall is a must buy for true metal fans hungering for that lost 80's sound! Finally, look for the Iron Maiden reunion with Bruce and Adrian in the year 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who needs maiden!","review":"What an amazing metal album. from the first listen of this album, I loved it immediately. It is one of the heaviest albums I have heard in quite a long time that has so much melody and sophistication. The dropped d riffs are crunchy and brutal and Bruces voice is in excellent shape. From start to finish, you can't go wrong with this album. Buy it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"savior","review":"Can someone please tell me why Bruce Dickinson botheredto rejoin Iron \\"washed up\\" Maiden? Bruce's solo work onhis last 2 albums has been nothing short of phenominal.Meanwhile, Maiden continues to desecrate their once proudlegacy.That being said, Bruce should leave that group of losersand continue on his solo work. This album is just fantastic.It is heavy, yet very melodic, and has such a great moodto it. This is the stuff Maiden should be putting out.Definitely one of the best albums of the 90's.Bruce still has it, more so than ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satanic Garbage","review":"The music and vocals are amazing. The lyrics sadly are overly Satanic; one song even dedicated to a theme of Satan, even shouting his name. Atheists, agnostics, wiccans, satanists, Bruce worshippers, and others who fool themselves into thinking Satan doesn't exist will likely scoff at this review. So be it. Bruce should use his talent for Christian music."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN IRON MAIDEN!","review":"Outsanding. From the heavy riffs of 'King in Crimson' and 'Killing Floor' to the light riffs of 'Gates Of Urizon' and 'Jerusalem' this album is on a new level of greatness. It's not even a necessity for Bruce Dickinson to yell his voice out the riffs are so great. The best song by far on this album is 'The Book Of Thel' with it's catchy riff and fantastic vocals. Now I order any metal, Iron Maiden or Bruce Dickinson fan to go out and buy this NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce D. at his best","review":"Bruce Dickinsons got some help from Roy Z on the production, songwriting and guitar section of this CD, and let me start with saying that it is an amazing partnership! You can tell that Bruce Dickinson is(was) ex-Iron Maiden, because the \\"sound\\" is somewhat similar to Maidens, although somewhat harder.Similar to Iron Maidens Seventh son of a Seventh Son, it has like a theme to it. The atmosphere of the whole CD is dark and mystical, the lyrics are filled with quotes from William Blake and the much of the cover art is made by Blake too. Alot of the texts are references to mideval chemistry hence the name chemical wedding(in the song used in a somewhat other pretext).The dark atmosphere is kept throughout the album(with the exeption of Machine Men, written by the old Iron Maiden partners Dickinson/Smith). The albums is a fine example of how great Dickinson can do on his own, although we are many that are thankful that he is back as the front man of Maiden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ideas","review":"This book came on time and was in very good condition. I was pleased. It has lots of ideas for how to write a family history and different ways it can be done.If you are looking for how to start your book or what you want your book to include it is a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"same effect as a vallium but not as easy to swallw","review":"Sorry, but this is turgid awful writing. There's nothing new in this book it is just a rehash of yogic teachings plus some Bardonesque stuff. You can learn about pranayama from many other sources and you can learn about Bardon by reading his works directly. Quite a lot of the early part of the book is taken up with warnings to the neophyte, totally unnecessary in my opinion but maybe a warning not to operate heavy machinery is in order. The writer comes across as pompous and some of the terms he uses are strange to say the least!Where does he get the idea to rename the court cards \\"courtesans\\", bizarre indeed, save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4-year old daughter loves this book","review":"It really inspires her imagination and makes her smile.
