Unfortunately, James Cameron has neglected this movie ever since September 11th since True Lies deals with terrorism on US soil. That is why he scrapped the sequel.

It has humor, action, romance, intrigue, and an actual story line. I loved it. The special effects were not as good as the terminator, but they were still great. Tom Arnold plays oppistie Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis, and really makes a person laugh. Jamie Lee Curtis is beautiful as ever, and does a terrific job portraying a career mom who longs for excitment in her life as she has begun to feel her life and family are nothing but ordinary.

This is a very enjoyable film, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Supremely Entertaining Movie","review":"Director/writer brought with True Lies one of the best action films of the 90's.

But nonetheless it is a true adrealine rush of action and sharp humor and a balanced plot that involves nuclear bomb stealing terrorists and the dual part is Arnold's wife getting involved in is spy operation, very humorously.The effects and stunts are eye-popping. Jamie-Lee Curtis' stunt double dangling from a helicopter is one of the many in Lies, and anyone who knows James Cameron knows that these are something to behold. And Arnold of course is always at the top of his game. if you are into James Cameron and/or Arnold, True Lies should satisfy your hunger for action."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"this is a fantastic film one of arnolds best it will look great on blu-ray i cant wait to add it to my collection of classics in good cases:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"More entertaining than James Bond","review":"Great storyline, great acting, great special effects, and lots of comedy.

The overall story is nothing original, but there are a lot of funny, light-hearted moments and it's an entertaining movie to watch. The Arnold is actually likeable in this film, although the other Arnold (Tom Arnold) is quite annoying. Tia Carrere is gorgeous. There's just a lot of action and comedy in this 1994 production.

James Cameron is a good screenplay writer and director for this film. I want this to come out in Blu Ray, but I'll have to settle for DVD now. I had this movie DVR'd for quite some time, but I kept watching it so much, my husband just told me to buy it! The scenes with Arnold and Tom are too funny and Bill Paxton just steals the show in his scenes! The women in this film are awesome as well! My only beef with this movie is the final scene, I wanted to say, couldn't they have been given better nicknames?! Doris and Boris?! Oh well, the movie is still good. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a little action and comic relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexist, racist, and great entertainment","review":"Middle Easterns are portrayed as a bunch fanatics with the Quran in one hand and a machine gun (or nuclear bomb) in the other.

It has a paper thin plot and terrible acting and really does nothing for anyone. Jamie Lee Curtis was annoying and the only time she was cool was when she was dancing and when she smashed the one way mirror with a stool.

Only worth a look if you haven't seen it.There are some good sequences and FX (a bridge blowing up, excellent missile effects) but overall the drama feels stilted, plodding. In particular there is a really slow fifteen to twenty minutes when the main character chooses to interrogate his wife. In the theater it was painful. At least on DVD you can just hit skip.The humor is decidedly lowbrow. The Bill Paxton subplot did not work as well as intended. To misquote Paul Thomas Anderson, \\"Little dick jokes.

The movie itself is in a wide-screen format but it sized into a 4:3 picture format. If you watch this DVD on a wide-screen TV or full screen on a computer you will have black bars not only on the top and bottom of the picture but also on the sides. For me this makes the movie unwatchable and is quite annoying considering the box says the format is 2:35:1 when it actually is 4:3.

I love this movie so much, It's place is cherished in my home video collection. Not being much of an Action/Adventure lover, seeing a movie of this genre that also had a lot of comedy AND romance was very refreshing. I don't really like Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he actually shines in this role that he was born for. Jamie Lee Curtis is Amazing as usual, and Tom Arnold is hilarious.

The Arabs or Persians portrayed in this movie (we're never actually told exactly _what_ they are--the art being smuggled is Persian, but the terrorists are referred to as Arabs) have no identifiable redeeming qualities other than that they're apparently quite adept at theiving massive works of art and waging war on us Americans. This film is yet another exploitation of the transfer of American fear and anger from the Commie Russians to the Insane Muslims in the post-cold war period. They didn't even make a half-hearted attempt to soften the blow to Arab/Persian cultures by casting an actor of Middle-Eastern heritage on the \\"good guy\\" side. Alas, the star power of Arnie will be too much to dissuade anyone from viewing this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"What I really did not like about this movie was how it showed people from the Middle East.

I was bothered that so few reviewers, and even fewer viewers, noticed the inhumanity and cruelty of the main character. Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is authentically abusive toward his wife Helen Tasker (Jamie Lee Curtis), bludgeoning her with fear. The film's central message seems to be that no one swarthy can be trusted. Bear in mind that this film was made long before 9/11/01. I am a pretty easy-going viewer and enjoy a good shoot-em-up action film as much as the next person, but this film was truly offensive to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Not Tell a Lie: The Movie Stinks","review":"I cannot believe the fast majority of Amazon reviewers praised the film for its action and both \\"Arnolds\\" performances.

That's what Helen thinks until she finds out that her ordinary husband is a secret agent. Both lives collide and both Harry and Helen must save the world and themselves.As I have said before, what Arnold does best is action with a hint of comedy. This is exactly that. To add to this is Jamie Lee Curtis. She inherited her father's natural comedy sense and handles the action scenes perfectly. The only negative is Tom Arnold as Arnold's sidekick. He is pure slapstick and not very good at that.The special effects and stunt work is excellent.

From the oft-played \\"Just What I Needed\\", \\"Good Times Roll\\" and \\"Best Friends Girl\\" to the thumping rocker \\"You're All I've Got Tonight\\" to some of the more esoteric, lesser known tracks from later on in the album, the Cars had it down. If I were stuck on a desert island and could bring along only five CDs, this would merit consideration among the usual suspects like \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Blonde on Blonde\\"... It's that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"Good luck finding ANYONE who doesn't like this album...maybe that crotchety old woman down the street who still calls rock music \\"noise\\". Try finding any other album (or band) that both new wavers and classic rockers both love. This album is my favorite, featuring such great numbers as \\"Good Times Roll\\", \\"Just What I Needed\\" and \\"Bye Bye Love\\". If there's something bad to be said, it's the occasionally silly lyric (\\"Let them brush your rock and roll hair\\", \\"I needed someone to bleed\\"), but they sing and play with such conviction you don't notice. Buy it and play it loud enough to annoy that old lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"SERIOUSLY????","review":"cOMEON- AN ALBUMthis GREAT-no one is going to read all the accurate 5 star reviews- would you? me either. list the 8 great Debute albums and this will be listed on most.

It sounds like Heavy Fuel by the all time great, Dire Straits. And other than that, this CD is lame. I was listening to this last nightand man, the other songs suck (with the exception of Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl, & Just What I Needed). Dire Straits are the best, they have the most talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overplayed","review":"i had enough of the cars for the moment, I hear them on everyradio station in the world and the only album they play is songsfrom this. another album they play is their second album whichis really lame. plus they ain't that good. the singer just singslike a baby, this cars isnt music, this is just noise.

All the albums by the Cars suck horribly. They were hugely one of the most overrated bands ever who are just lame, stupid, dumb, pathetic, lousy, awful, and horrendous. They are so trite, I can't stand them. \\"Moving In Stereo\\" has to be one of the most dumb songs I have ever heard in my whole life. I feel that this album is worse than the Back in Black, and Highway to Hell albums of AC/DC. Don't listen to the 5 star reviewers and avoid this boring album at all costs. Get On Every Street from Dire Straits insted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic poppy hard rock","review":"I don't know why so many people claim The Cars invented \\"new-wave\\". They did have that sort of weird keyboard sound, but their music was straight popular hard rock. They are more in the vein of groups like Loverboy then \\"new-wave\\". They had the sound of the early 80's MTV groups, but in a rock style. \\"Just what I needed\\" was an instant classic with me and my hard rock fan friends in the summer of '78. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you walk away from a classic at this price","review":"Front to back, this has to be one of the best debut albums of all time.

The Cars were the first band I really got into in my mid teens. Later I would get into punk and rockabilly, but I still have a place for bands like the Police, the Clash, Cheap Trick, and the Cars in my heart. To me they are pop, not \\"new romantic\\" or even \\"new wave.\\" Every song rocks and this record always seemed to flow the best out of all the Cars records. What is odd is I have always ranked the records in release order, this being the best and \\"Door to Door\\" being the worst. The new version of this CD is cool with the new material, but if you want the original like it was in the day, go for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ALBUMS OF THE 70S'&80S'","review":"I originally had the Cars debut on 8track twenty something years ago--The tape pulled out (remember how 8 tracks did that?) so I bought the record album--after playing it soooo many times I was able to see through it--I went and bought the cassette--needless to say--I wore it out too. I now have the CD and am trying my hardest to wear it out. The format may wear out but great tunes never die--I must have listened to the Cars debut album over a thousand times--it's still great. A classic among classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't overlook this one","review":"The Cars' first album was their best. The first three songs are all bonafide hit single material.

The cushion is very thick and comfortable and I love the color of the metal. It's kind of a dark brown with copper showing through some destressed areas.

It's all very very interesting and opens up a world I knew existed but knew nothing of particulars and details.It describes the international and cooperative nature of modern organized crime and government's frantic attempt to keep up with some very clever and very ruthless people who take what they want and make their own rules. Wherever the government says \\"Thou shalt not\\", they see an opportunity for profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Bad, Not So Good","review":"well, this book certainly is well researched, but the author needs to decide- is it a solid work of unbiased fact, or is it a liberally laced opinion piece? He seems to come down somewhere between the two, which leads the reader (well, that's me in this case) wondering how much is true, and how much is speculation and wish.Lots of names being dropped and used, and if I truly wanted to take the time and learn what EXACTLY was going on in these crime organizations, I would need to keep a small notepad next to me so I could swiftly recollect each character everytime he was named.An OK overall summary of the past 30 years in organized crime, but if you want to truly understand the inner machinations of these globe-spanning organizations, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"plagiarized","review":"Boy, this book was upsetting. Nearly everything is plagiarized and cherry picked from other books. The bulk of the book is from Friedman's The Red Mafia.One concludes, reading this book, that Robinson is intimately familiar with the criminal mindset, since he didn't hesitate to copy and paste entire passages from Friedman, without so much as a credit!You're better off downloading a few pdfs off the internet, and getting the Friedman book, than this sorry imitation of non-fiction.Actually, then again if you are too lazy to browse the net, and need a racy intro to the subject, maybe this is a good bet.

We only have so much time in this life, don't use a second of it to ingest this garbage.

This edition is a true embarrassment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Will Take Your Breath Away!","review":"For those of you who have not read this book, then I implore you to do so as soon as possible. This is Tolstoy's classical tragedy about a woman and her ill-fated love with a count. Anna Karenina goes to Moscow in an attempt to patch up a quarrel between her sister and her husband, and there enounters the infamous Count Vronsky. The two fall in love and are soon seen together at various spots throughout the city. Of course this is a real problem since Anna is married. This story is about their love for each other and the way this love leads to an inevitable conclusion. This is a beautiful book, and Leo Tolstoy is one of the great authors, not only of the nineteenth century, but every century since! His books are masterworks, and I have read each of them. Anna Karenina is my favourite though of his wonderful works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Modern Library translation!","review":"I won't repeat all the praise people have given this book, aside from agreeing that it is an incredible, complex, rich work of art. My advice would be to read the paperback Modern Library Classics translation, introduction by Mona Simpson, translated by Constance Garnett, translation revised by Leonard J. Kent and Nina Berberova. This is an excellent, excellent translation complete with explanatory footnotes (where approprite -- by no means do they distract from the reading), and final commentaries by Tolstoy, Dostoevksy, Mann, Nabakov, and others. There are also 8 questions at the end for a \\"Reading Group Guide.\\" This translation is absolutely incomparable -- attempt to read no other!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth paying for the translation, prologue","review":"I've downloaded both the free version and this version of Anna Karenina and recommend paying the nominal fee for this version.

I have read Tolstoy before (in book form) and reading this kindle version, I knew something wasn't quite right. Compared word for word with the penguin classic edition, the poor quality to this kindle version is obvious. The diction is very weak and unimaginative and there are many blatant grammatical errors. Its feels like the original Russian version was put through Google-translate. Some sentences' are cut in half and many idiomatic phrases have lost all meaning, often resulting in an entire passage failing to impress upon the reader its full weight within the context of the story. This edition of the book was appalling, does a great disservice to one of the best novels ever written and would be a ruinous way to begin reading Tolstoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anna Karenina","review":"This book was our Book Club choice for September and one that I had to read.The story content about Anna Karenina could have been condensed into two chapters.This may be one of the all time great Classics but the pages and pages on mowing meadows,Political meetings of the landowners, lack of women's rights ,unfaithful husbands who get away with it etc.It's all about Tolstoy's philosophies (it's almost his autobiography)As for Karenina's infidelity, nowadays it wouldn't raise an eyebrow. I believe that when it waspublished girls were not allowed to read it . It was too shocking for the young mind.I'm sorry if I offend anyone but I found it profoundly boring, but that is just my personal opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont judge the book by its cover!","review":"I dont know why the cover is in Russian, the book itself is still in English.

However a very enjoyable read. Tolstoy weaves his magic with beautifully written paragraphs that transport you back to 18th century good old, antedeluvian Russia. His expressive and uncomplicated descriptions of the luminous country side were so poignant it was as if I were standing in Levin's shoes seeing everything through my favorite character's eyes.The only perplex I had with this book was the numerous names for just one character. You are emphatically required to be on the ball reading through Tolstoy's world, else you may become a wee bit confused as to who he's refering to at that moment in the story lol.It was insightful, enlightening, inviting and an all round pleasure to read. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the free kindle fire edition","review":"Great book - Bad translation---I started reading this free version on my Kindle Fire and noticed that the writing felt a bit clunky.

You won't have to read far to realize the translation is quite awkward in parts. If you've read AK before, you'll likely find this very unsatisfying.

Yes. Is the agrarian/socialist subplot seemingly out of left field and boring? After a while. Is this book worth reading? Absolutely. Anna Karenina as a love story/saga is on par with Gone With the Wind or Cather's The Song of the Lark. It drags in some places and there are too many characters to count (though Tolstoy does a wonderful job of introducing each character as one might be introduced to new acquintances-you meet person A who introduces you to persons B & C, B introduces you to D & E, etc.-it's not that difficult to keep them straight), but the romance and richness of plot are enough to keep going.

My biggest complaint was that the story moved way too slow and that it was constantly being interrupted by Tolstoy's philosophical preaching and political discourse. Barely half the story is even devoted to the character whose name is the title of the novel. There were long and unneccessary pasages that had nothing to do with the rest of the story, like the hunting chapters. Anna's irrational and crazy jealousy was irritating.

On one hand there are the extensive novel-specific dining room chats that literally pad the pages. But, there are also frequent moments of deep insight where Tolstoy, like most masters, touches on something very poignant about the human experience. When you read Anna Karenina, look for these moments. They are there if you do.Also, as a note based on hind-sight, I often found myself going to the bookstore to compare this translation to the Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky one (Oprah's Book Club). From the little that I read of it I found it a little livelier, but not enough so to warrant a separate purchase.

In the glamorous society of mid 19th century Russia is where Tolstoy lays his scene. Anna Karenina, a beautiful, spirirted woman meets a handsome and distuinguished soldier, Alexis Vronksy, who falls head over heels in love with Anna. Meanwhile Constantine Levin, an awkward and shy farmer comes to propose to his beloved Kitty Scherbatsky who is in love or believes she is in love with the elegant Alexis Vronksy. What occurs afterwards is a suspenseful and beautifully written piece of literature about these four main character. The work was to orginally have been titled, \\"Two Marriages\\" but the intriging character of Anna Karenina pushed and shoved her way on top. This novel has the same intricate plot as \\"War and Peace\\" but it is not as burdensome with long essays about the art of war. \\"Anna Karenina\\" is an awesome piece of work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, but get the Maude Translation","review":"Anna Karenina is a five star book, but do not spend your time with this free version.

I laughed out loud. He is a fine hunter! He is charming! He is also a scoundrel but never the less an amusing character and a source of comic relief in this heavy scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read his short stories instead","review":"Anna Karenina meanders through the class-concious Russian society of the 1800s, at times dreary with detail and others amazingly clear and ingeniously perceptive of human behavior.

There are so many interesting ideas and concepts, and so many different types of people that the books jumps around and moves forward in a way that makes you care what happens to each person.

It is fun, interesting, even just. Professor Steven Pinker brings up interesting questions, provides convincing examples for why should we care, and gives excellent answers. Did I buy everything he suggests? No, though surprisingly a good part of it. But a book on scientific matters is not expected to provide the final and only word. And yes, some parts of this book can be demanding. You may choose to just scan them and hope you've got the basic idea right. The bottom line: those who are interested with language and the possibility of effective communication between people are likely to be enriched tremendously by this book, and enjoy while at it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good kernels in an awful lot of chaff","review":"This book has some good things to think about. The problem is Pinker has presented some very debatable opinions as absolute proven fact. So, to find the good stuff, you've got to sort through a lot of not-so-good. This was the first thing of Pinker's I've read, and to be honest, I was surprised to find that a man with such a high reputation could be so bombastic in stating his pet theories. I was really underimpressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I wanted to know about language...","review":"Everything I wanted to know about language seems to be in this book. Pinker's book is so fascinating and entertaining that I, an ambitious amateur in liguistics, wish to dig deeper into the topics mentioned. This book is the most interesting non-fiction title I have ever encountered; thus the 10 rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lengthy but worth persevering with","review":"Whether you agree with Pinker's theories (some being extensions of concepts he presents in the earlier 'How the Mind Works') or not, the value of popular science writing is that it simplifies the complicated, and ignites the reader's interest in the subject matter. I feel this book does both. It has elicited the usual responses to his work: generous acclaim from the public and bitter invective from academics and pseudo-intellectuals. I would suggest you distinguish the qualities of the book from that of its pro-Chomsky arguments. Pinker's writing is engaging, well reasoned and funny. There is a lot of it though, and the varying quality of the chapters adds weight to the argument his books could be cut down in size, allowing them to be read before the printed material itself perishes naturally."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accessible approach to a difficult topic","review":"I've had a long running interest in language acquisition and the study of linguistics, and have read many of the original works by authors like Chomsky. What Pinker does, whether you agree with his conclusions or not, is to provide an excellent general overview of linguistic theories. Many linguistic texts are DULL or tortuously difficult to read. Pinker is very clear and writes quite well. He sometimes goes a bit overboard on his theory, but most of the time he's very convincing. I have not yet read the other book referred to below, but look forward to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Kool-Aid stored?","review":"I waded through a book on modern linguistic theory, scratched my head over the author's apparent misplaced certainty over what seemed awfully flimsy conjecture, and then started on Pinker's book. Is it just me, or has the entire linguistic profession drunk massive amounts of special Kool-Aid? Maybe Chomsky stirred up the first batch, but there's more.One example: after a few paragraphs exhaustively getting to the point about homophones and puns, Pinker says, \\"if there can be two thoughts corresponding to one word, thoughts can't be words,\\" and he seems satisfied that the case is closed. Huh? Who says words are supposed to behave like memory registers in a computer? Context adds meaning; ain't that the point? and by \\"point\\", ain't it obvious that I didn't mean a sharpened pencil? even if it's stored (as it is right now) in my brain?This book is very well written, which is why I gave it two stars. But it's fanciful and unscientific. Yes, I know he's at M.I.T. It happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pinker has got it all wrong","review":"Pinker is on an evolutionary bend when it comes to the human brain and after reading him and other linguists I must disagree with him.

I gained from it a greater appreciation of both the complexity and beauty of language."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is wit?","review":"Perhaps it's a brilliant overview pushing speculation as fact, but I stopped reading after the introduction and skimming the first chapter. I found it confusing, dull, and hardly fun. I also suspect that more people own than read this book - and that a majority of readers are simply fulfilling classroom assignments. How many people want to exchange their precious free time to struggle with this difficult text?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Mentalese\\" does not a perspective make!","review":"How'd you like that grammar, Mr. Pinker? Perhaps you'd like to analyze it for me. If you did, I still don't think you'd understand what I meant. That's the problem - the brain doesn't create language, it processes language. You don't understand the sun by studying the things it shines its light on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful (although English literature people might like it)","review":"I take it I'm allowed to comment without having read more than a quarter of it. I found it utterly boring. I couldn't read it. The author works at a \\"Center for Cognitive Neuroscience\\", but this is in no way neuroscience, nor any science. It's a load of dusty old linguistics. It chats into other material at times, but that's the core. It has some cursory reports on psychological experiments, but it doesn't argue systematically with them. Looks like the chapters I didn't read are riddled with speculations about evolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"B.F. Skinner","review":"Verbal Behavior by B.F.

The but exposition is clear and compelling, many examples are funny, and the ideas are verrrry interesting. I especially recommend his last chapter on \\"Mind Design.\\" Lots of stuff to think about there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating, but somewhat thickly written story","review":"We all talk. (Some of us more than others). But all humans -- barring a problem such as deafness -- talk. Even our deaf friends talk by means of a complicated language of visual signs.And Steven Pinker tells this story, the story of human language, and why it's so essential a part of our humanity, well. Following Chomsky, he posits a universal language structure, an innate part of our being who we are, and how small children grow quickly into complex grammatical and syntactical structures.And for the most part, this is a good read. My only complaint is that on occasions, Dr. Pinker waxes a bit too eloquent, telling more information than is needed for the argument, giving pages and pages of examples when one or 2 would do. But this is a good introduction to the whole question of why and how we talk, and by inference how we think."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"i liked this book better than pinker's \\"how the mind works.\\" it was a little more focused, obviously, and i feel that pinker had better explanations for his ideas re language and linguistics than for the mind as a whole (tho he did use examples from the \\"mind\\" book here, and vice versa). it got a little thick thru the parts discussing grammar rules, but on the whole a good read that kept my interest. less dense than \\"how the mind works\\" and on the whole more intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brief Review of The Language Instinct","review":"Pinker's The Blank Slate is one of my all time favorite books. The Language Instinct is good enough for me to buy a copy after reading one from the Library, but it is a tougher read, especially the first third or so. The difficulty stems from it being more technical than The Blank Slate. A book that deals in large part with linguistics has to use some of the conventions of the discipline. In addition to establishing the basic premise, that language learning has a large genetic component, I liked Pinker's concept that words per se do not control our thoughts. Thinking and the expression of thinking are not the same thing. Another thing I found helpful is the degree of complexity and difficulty for computers to understand both the words used in speech and the comprehension of the indtended thoughts.As usual, Pinker's writing style is marvelous, and frequently funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least he was right about mentalese!","review":"It's a good high level overview, especially of the Chomskyan revolution (and who wants to read Chomsky?) Pinker does a disservice in presenting speculation as fact, but in this he is just being faithful to the dominant scientific-philosophical paradigm. I bought the hardback in 1995, but couldn't bear to read it until recently. His explanation of how the brain is a Turing information processor, without invoking the homunculus, is particularly egregious. BUT: He is right about mentalese. The operations of consciousness are rule-governed, like a grammar. It has nothing to do with biology but everything to do with the structure of consciousness. Since Fodor is unreadable, Pinker is a good entry point to the discussion of mentalese, which everyone should understand. Pinker would be a good writer for the Economist or similar serious magazine, but must be taken with a large grain of salt otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promotes the idea of a human nature without proving it","review":"People who read this book have to have good education in philosophy (Kierkegaard and Wittgenstein) to see through it. Pinker starts with \\"proving\\" that mental grammar is innate and ends up with saying that there should be a common human nature that will make us all brothers. Why weren't we brothers long ago then? This book is filled with similar silly thinking. I am so astonished that I almost fell off the chair that this man can be considered an intellectual. It can only happen in the US!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't teach you how to learn languages.","review":"I thought this was going to be a book about HOW to learn a language. I'm giving this four stars, b/c it's not really the author's fault that I picked the wrong book for my purpose. It's written well and explained well, but I really don't need someone to spend a whole lot of pages explaining to me that we instinctively learn. BUT I understand that there are people who do want to read a whole lot of pages explaining this theory, so...four stars it is. In case you didn't get that, it's NOT a book that teaches you how to learn a language."},{"rating":"1","title":"No depth","review":"I do not see Steven does more than states the obvious in a slow, condescending manner. Linguists have developed rigorous logic to analyze languages that is used in computer science. Steven should focus on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for anyone interested in how we learn language.","review":"I have always been interested in how we learn a languageand why it is so much easier when we are very young. Pinkeruses many detailed examples to explain just how this happens.I found it particularly fascinating to read of many exampleswhere very young children learned a language on their own -one that they perhaps did not even hear in their environment.I found it equally fascinating to discover that AmericanSign Language (ASL), the primary language of the deaf inAmerica, has a grammar that is equally as rich as those ofspoken languages - and that the signing that psychologiststaught to Chimpanzees was extremely crude and without suchgrammar. It was amazing to find that deaf children will evenlearn some sort of a sign language on their own.Although I skimmed much of the technical diagramming ofphrase structures and sentence structures, I found this bookextremely interesting and very thought provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGER swich your class!","review":"This book, was obviously written by brilliant people. Unfortunately knowing mathematics does not mean you qualify for writing a book or being a teacher. Swokowski and Cole and the entire aid staff obviously have no real world teaching experience whatsoever. This book is written in pure mathematical theory, not english. I heave heard of leaning by immersion, but drowning the student in pure theory-talk without introducing it, extreme application problems, and a lack of clear cut ..anything, does not force the students to learn through struggle, it basically just overwhelms them into despair. The solution manual is a must, if you want a basic grasp of any of the presented concepts.Look, if you can avoid using this book, please do so, at any cost.

I spend over an hour trying to decipher the lessons in the book, only to have to give up and run problems until I can figure out what they are trying to teach me how to do. This is not due to me being bad at math either, as math is my best subject.To further make my point, at the beginning of the book, around the first ten lessons, I already knew how to do the problems they where trying to teach, able to solve the problems easily and show others how to do the same, yet I still could not make heads or tales of their lessons.Please, if you are a professor, do not force this horrible math book on your students.-Samantha Rogers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for improvement.","review":"I have a BS in mathematics and I found this book---both as a student and as a tutor---to be less-than helpful for calculus preparation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-Calculus For the Calculus Student","review":"Swokowski's problems are many. The most prevelant I have encountered in using this book is the fact that he often leaves much up to the reader. Often he will give an example of some property and then leave it up to the reader to figure out how he obtained his solution. Other times he will give an abstract explanation of a solution, and leave it up to the reader to develop a practical method.This is simply unacceptable. While, for real science majors, it is of utmost importance to develop inductive reasoning it's rediculous to do so this overtly.I am an exceptional mathematical student, with a major focusing on mathematics, and I often have to spend hours deciphering Swokowski's explanations. Truly, this book is a great exercise for any lover of riddles, but I did not pay to be puzzled, I paid to be taught."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book.","review":"Since the last reviewer felt it necessary to single out those of us who dislike this book as \\"unable\\", I'll make it known that I have been an exemplary math student throughout my academic career and I have a well earned 93% average in my precalculus class.The discussion in this book is anything but \\"lucid.\\" The authors will spend whole pages covering basic topics (that any third grade student should understand) and then brush through the new material in one unintelligible paragraph, an incomprehensible definition or proof and a maximum of two examples. Even the calculator instructions given are a chore to read (I stopped doing so several weeks ago, preferring the manual included with my calculator, which says more than enough).If you know in advance that your professor uses this book, take a different class (unless your professor is one of the 2% of them who will actually cover the material in class).

Nevertheless, I highly recommend these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HIGH TEMP SAFE","review":"These cups are for serving or prep, they are not oven or microwave safe glass.

I've made puddings, desserts or whatever and then you have to use saran to cover them and it's not easy trying to put a small piece of saran wrap on it without covering the whole dish, as they are small dishes. Not a total bad thing but covers would make these a 5 stars for me. They are perfect for small leftovers, using for prep food meals, or for little kids to put snacks in. They are not heavy as I agree with the previous reviewer. They are good quality but again....needs covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"We use these for everything","review":"Pyrex is a great company. I have been using their products for decades. They have not let me down yet. These are durable little cups that are great to use when you want just a little something, anything.

Strong. Pyrex. I use these for all of the dipping sauces I make for the kids. Microwave in 'em, cook in 'em, or just put 'em on the plate with some homemade cheese sauce & some chicken tenderloins.

An excellent book for learning about Reiki, and even better once you've been attuned. You just have to ignore the excessive \\"incest\\" examples. Plus, I just totally skipped the chapter on the Ki opening. A bit sexual for my taste! It is important to keep in mind that this is her way to do Reiki, and there are lots of ways, you have to find your own. Also, things have progressed even since she has written, so you have to take some of what she says to be in the past. I really recommend reading this book as a starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reiki at its best","review":"I recommend this book to ANY Reiki Practicioner -either just starting or quite advanced. After reading the book, Diane Stein held a Reiki Master Class close to my home, where she taught for a full weekend.

Every reader is intitle to his opinions.This book is one of the most candidly and unselfishly written books I have ever read. Reading it gave me the knowledge I needed in order to become more acquianted with the true meaning of Reiki. After reading the first chapter, immediatly I started to perform Reiki on myself. I was also convinced that we all possess the power of healing.That is why, I would like to make contact with Ms. Stein because her frankness convinced me of her generosity. Our world is so full of selfish people that when someone like Ms. Stein comes along people will try to discredit and backmouth them. Our society lives in constant psychic illness.Jesus healed the sick freely and he gave the power to heal without charging anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought it.","review":"I thought I would be getting a good read to learn more about Reiki.

I wish I could return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"search the google. you will get much better information","review":"I wish she stopped using Goddess and she all over the place. Diane definitely is a feminist and a wiccan. Since this is a Reiki book, she should have converged her writing to Reiki, instead of jumping all over her wicca, mantak chia, and tibetan buddhist background. If you want to learn about Reiki, search the google with \\"Reiki Symbol\\" and you will get much more straight forward answers. Nothing new is in this book, and if anything, she is confusing the heck out of the traditional and progressive Reiki practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have not received this book yet","review":"I have not received this book yet, although it has been a month since I ordered it, and other books I ordered from you at that same time arrived very promptly.Is it lost or do I need to wait longer for it to arrive. Thanks for your help with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-Essential information","review":"An excellent and educational book, if only the author had stayed to the real essentials. Approximately two thirds of the information is unrelated to actual Reiki, but the author seems to find this necessary to enhance her admittedly feminine-chauvinistic style of Reiki."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opinionated, much of it wrong, poorly written","review":"Diane Stein was not properly attuned to Reiki and was self taught. Therefore much of her defensive,repititious, rambling book is misleading. She randomly combines unrelated techniques that are not even Reiki. For want of publicity she resorts to exposing something previously kept secret and thrives on the sensationalism. This book is not authentic material, rather guesswork and opinions from an unsecure woman with a not-so-hidden agenda. Be careful with using her information."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book offers some inaccurate information...","review":"I am a Level II Reiki practioner. During Level I, our class was specifically cautioned about this book because it contains some inaccurate information regarding the symbols and their use. Out of curosity, I sought out this book, and indeed it does contain some information that is completely the opposite of what we were taught. I confirmed the inaccuracy of the information with a different Reiki Master. Additionally, I too sensed the anger of the author when I handled the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this awfull book.","review":"This book was not at all like I expected.

No other book will be as complete in revealing to you the complete inside and hitherto secret information regarding its initiation, its action and its symbols. This wonderful healing ability is simple to acquire and simpler to perform, and will someday be a standard ability for everyone. This book will tell you and show you how to add the amazing Reiki power to your life, and how to use it. Diane Stein's book is, indeed, The Essential Reiki book to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasted my time.","review":"I found the book to be weak and useless in assisting in any way with the application of Reiki (I am a Reiki Master). Diane Stein seems to be a sexist. Who really cares? What I resent most is the waste of time that is irretreivable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-Essential New Age Reiki","review":"This book is a good example of what happens when you take an overtly angry Wiccan Feminist - mix in chakras, crystals, and 'higher vibrations' with a good healthy dose of New Age 'Reiki'.There is nothing between the front and back covers that is based on factual information. What this book talks about is not Japanese, is not Usui's teachings, and is definitely not Traditional Reiki.It is interesting, for such an angry feminist, that she tries to link Reiki to both Buddha and Jesus - even with a time line - when they are both patriarch systems.Her knowledge of the history of Reiki and Japan is nil. Her history of Buddhism is amply as bad. She freely mixes cultures, beliefs, religions, and fiction into one big soupy mess.This is the epitome of Western Reiki and the antithesis of Traditional Japanese Reiki.Buy any other book on Reiki and save your money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reiki Master in TX","review":"I have been a Usui Reiki Master since 1996 and have enjoyed reading through a lot of books on Reiki. I often share these books with my students as many of them contain gold nuggets of information that can be very helpful.Unfortunately, Diane Stein's book is NOT one of them. I find her teaching styles appalling. There is a lot of information in her books that is just flat out wrong. Can you imagine being one of fifty students in her day-long workshop and feeling confident leaving there in their new-found skills as a Reiki practioner? Let alone having time to know and learn a lot of valuable information? I site this book as one NOT to get or pay much attention to in your Reiki journey. This is a sad example of a Reiki manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clouded and misguided","review":"Having read widely on the topic of Reiki, its application and history, I have to say that this book is hard to recommend. Most of the details you need to know are present, but you have to wade through a ton of feminist and new age 'concepts' to get to it. Reiki is not feminist nor new age, so those ideas do not belong in any 'essential' reiki text.Harder to ignore is the clouded thinking masquerading as fact that leads her to assert, for example, that Jesus was running around India using Reiki for years after the crucifixion. But dig deep, and you will find good information within."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proceed with caution!","review":"If you can get past the egotism, the unprofessionalism, and the nonsense, you may glean some useful information in this book.Most Reiki people I know have a copy of this book, my own RMT included, but anyone with an ounce of sense doesn't use it as the be-all and end-all of Reiki books.As my RMT has always taught me, trust your instincts, and trust your hands. My instincts from the first told me this was not the book for me, and this was before I was even attuned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all Reiki Channels","review":"I was introduced to this book at about the same time as I did my Rieki 1, and found it to be exactly what I needed at that time to help clarify the amazing things that were happening to me. I went on to do my Reiki 2 and am now an apprentice master. I have lent my copy of this book to several Reiki friends who in 9 out of 10 cases have gone on to buy their own copies. The information is clear, easy to understand and of great benefit to not only those considering Reiki, or those new to Reiki, but also those who are starting to teach Reiki, it covers the whole range, and does it very well. The reason I have not given this book the full five points, is due to the overly heavy emphasis on incest, wicca & feminism, these subjects are out of place in this Essential Reiki book, there are other arenas for discussing and dealing with these subjects."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was very woman orienated.","review":"The book was from a clear woman\\"s view. This should have been stated befor the sail. The content was good but the slant was not open to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource for current/potential Reiki practitioners.","review":"Essential Reiki rarely gets a neutral response. One Reiki master I know called it \\"spiritual pornography.\\" Another called it her Bible. I believe it is an incredibly rich and important book for current or would-be Reiki practitioners. I have found important information that helped me through the six turbulent months following my second degree. I got an honest understanding of the issues that sometimes divide the Reiki community. I learned an alternate way to draw one of my symbols for more effective results. This is a book I highly recommend, but with one important caveat -- some potential clients, friends or family of Reiki practitioners might find it too far out there. To present Reiki to a more mainstream audience, I would recommend Reiki Energy Medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very complete approach","review":"Reiki and its symbols.

The laying of hands yieldsconsiderable healing powers which lead to anemotional release in patients and even practitioners.There are self healing hand positions which involvemassaging the throat gently with each hand on eitherside of the neck. Similarly, laying of hands over theribs is designed to gain relief for the abdomen.Other classic Reiki positions include the laying ofhands over the mid back and other high tension spots.The holding capacity of the Hara line may be enhancedby opening and expanding Ki to clear channels of highenergy blockage. Reiki is well established in thealternative medicine/complementary medicine community.Diane Stein helps readers understand the art withaccurate descriptions of the physical manipulations andpictures to depict the techniques visually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diane gives Reiki students/Masters a complete \\"overview\\"","review":"Thank you Diane, for believing as I feel that Ki is a part of all of us and the high prices have kept many from the field of healing. I was Reiki Level 2 and having difficulty getting any info on how to go further, much less a good overview of the entire Reiki system. You book brought the fragments together for me, and after reading it cover to cover (still doing so) I found a wonderful Master/Teacher who attuned me to Master/Teacher level. Thank you for creating the ONE book I have seen so far that actually gives outlines and stops the confusion one is left with when normally doing Reiki (like, what does this mean, what do I do now?). By telling my students to buy your book first, they will have a better understanding of the entire concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adequate information","review":"I received my Reiki (Pronounced Ray Key) Master/Teacher certificate last year, and am a member of the GRMA (Global Reiki Masters Association). I started reading Reiki related books in hopes of finding one or more Reiki Related books that I could recommend to students that come my way. This is the only Reiki book I recommend as of January 10, 1999 However; I do have problems with some of the material in this book. This book does have the following things going for it. 1. The history of Reiki 2. adequate hand positions. 3. Included the symbols used with Reiki 4. Directions for passing all levels of Reiki attunements. Ms. Stein has done a good job at demystifying Reiki, and bringing it out of the shadows. If you have questions about Reiki feel free to contact me by E-Mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be called Misinformation 101","review":"If you know nothing about Reiki, this book will spark your interest, however, there is way to much misinformation. Some of her practices are not only degrading to serious Reiki practicioners but they are also highly unethical. I believe that the Reiki attunements are a gift that is given, when you are giving attunements to rows of people at a time, you aren't giving a gift you are working in a factory. Reiki is about the one-on-one connection between teacher and student or care giver and recipient, it is something special to be shared. Reiki is fine dining but she turns it into a drive up fast food order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be more clear on what is reiki and what is not","review":"Diane does both a great service and disservice all at once with this book. One the plus side, she brings reiki out in the open so it is accessible to all. My problem with the book, is that she presents alot of material that is not reiki and is not always clear on what is and what is not reiki. Her Chi Kung exercises, are not reiki. Chi Kung is a seperate discipline that needs to be taught by a trained instructor, and can be potentially harmful without a competant instructor. Her history of reiki with a lineage back to christ, while amusing, is historical fiction and should be labelled as such or a the bare minimum labelled as her opinion only. There is also a decided Wiccan feel to the book, and while wicca is a wonderful time honored tradition, it is also not reiki. Her feminist writing style was amusing, and i actually enjoyed that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace To An Amazing Healing Art","review":"I have been a Reiki Master/Teacher for 8 yrs. I am sickened by the utter lack of respect Diane Stein has for this ancient tradition. She's taken something held sacred by many and turned it into a way for her to make money. I have been told by many who have read this book and never received an attunement or attended a single class that they believe they are doing Reiki. I've experienced the energy coming from these people, and it is not the amazing healing art form known as Reiki. Putting the ancient traditions, even though a lot of what she cites as tradition is VERY incorrect, into print only allows more unskilled and unqualified people to harm those who come to them for assistance. Not only do I NOT recommend this book, I make sure in the \\"ethics\\" part of all my classes Diane Stein, and those like her, are shown as a classic example of why people MUST look for credentials when selecting an alternative practitioner."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspirational Book - For Reiki Level 2 or Higher","review":"Diane Stein's Essential Reiki is a perfect manual for any Reiki Master/Teacher - it teaches a complete system of Reiki - as She Teaches it.However, this is not a manual i would suggest as an introduction to Reiki. Something more like William Rand's Reiki Manual would be better for beginners, and then after Reiki 2 or Reiki 3 is learned, then this manual comes into play.It's a wonderful manual that makes the Reiki-Reader think... and that's a very good thing!!!I highly suggest this manual to Every Reiki Master/Teacher and to any Reiki Level 2 or Higher that is wanting to go further in their practice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Service and condition of book","review":"My copy of \\"Essential Reiki\\" came within the promised time frame and was in great condition. The price was perfect for my pocketbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting investigation","review":"This is an interesting look at Reiki.For the die-hards there may be a little too much information for your sensitivities. This book reveals the sacred symbols,(sacred does not mean secret) tells how to use them and allows anyone insight into this ancient healing art. For those of you with an attunement this is not a threat unless you are only interested in making money from it and so do not want too much competition. Diane has covered most aspects of Reiki healing, but it is important to remember that attunement and lineage are the most important factors in being introduced to Reiki."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reiki! Excellent book!","review":"I have found this book to be so helpful that this is the second copy I have bought! I bought the first copy several years ago, and loaned it or lost it I am not sure what happened to it but I missed the book and needed it for reference so often it was necessary to acquire another copy.My first Reiki Teacher used this book as the manual for her class and it is still THE book of choice in my local area.I find it easy to read with an uncomplicated writing style that thoroughly explains all the concepts easily and clearly.I have been practicing Reiki for about 10 years and find it the best Reiki book in my library,Essential Reiki: A Complete Guide to an Ancient Healing Art"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial and confusing, attending specially newcomers","review":"When I discoverd her book, I got shocked by seeing the sacret simbols published for everybody. For me, it is not a sign of maturity to \\"break a seal of milenear tradition\\" but of not understanding of the reason. \\"Reiki is an oral tradition\\", Grandmaster Hawayo Takata states during her life. I believe Mrs. Stein never really understood the real meaning of it. People doing distant attunement maybe because having fear to enter into and to accept there personal responsibility in the relationship with the student. A \\"long distance master\\" does have still a personal relationship with his student? I believe not. Is Reiki just a mechanical treatment, switch on an energy so that it flows and nothing more? I believe not.It is my experience that Reiki can be much more in one's life than Mrs. Stein was able to express in her book.Upanishad K. Kessler"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better Reiki books out there!","review":"I am a Usui Reiki Master. Although informative in some areas, I found this book to stray too far from the traditional Reiki ideals and traditions. I also felt that the author interjected her opinion too often to make this a useful handbook for a Reiki student. I strongly disagree with Ms. Stein's mass attunements; giving attunments without instruction or information seems irresponsible to me. As I read that particular passage, I felt she was diminishing Reiki to some sort of \\"hippie fad\\" or something equal to face-painting at a carnival. I read it and tossed it aside, and have not recommended it to any of my students or others interested in Reiki."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turkey Shoot Malcolm Bell","review":"Malcolm Bell's book is a must-read for anyone who wants to gain an in-depth understanding into the 1971 uprising at Attica State Prison. While the story of the riot itself is intense, dramatic and ultimately a tragedy of epic proportions, the history of \\"what happened next\\" is a real eye opener. I am not at all surprised that this book provokes a defensive response from other reviewers -- these are things that we don't want to believe, and truths that are difficult for many to confront. I highly recommend this book. It is a well-written and wholly credible account of how politics can triumph over the interests justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality All over","review":"I must admit that when i heard they were going to release Marilyn Mansons earlier stuff i was expecting much more. It is great that they have son of man on there but chances are if your a marilyn manson collector then you already have a much better quality of this song wich is sad i found out this only after buying the cd. Strange Same Dogma and White Knuckles are two really great songs but i dont like paying 16 dollars for just two studio quality songs especially if its surrounded by poor quality.

So, as a HD time-shifter---USELESS!2. The record quality is terrible, except at the XP (1 hour speed)3.

A message popped up saying the content was protected and couldn't be recorded. It was an ordinary prime-time network show tuned through an antenna - don't have cable.

Finally after 9 months of ownership, the unit locked up in DVD mode and was not recoverable.My first recorder analog VCR \\"Panasonic\\" lasted 7 years until the drive system stopped.I feel that programming bugs caused this failure.

Hence, this unit, which (as advertised) should be able to accomplish either.This thing is more finicky than Morris the Cat.Expect major headaches, and a set-up time of >30 minutes EVERY time you make an additional attempt to record something with this thing. (The success of the project I'm working on at this moment: not yet determined.)Sometimes you can't even open the dvd drawer. Sometimes it pops closed again before you've inserted the dvd. It seems to respond to its own remote with very random success. You may be lucky, you may not. Tomorrow expect different results. Right now, I'm rescanning cable channels as it seems to have lost its willingness to recognize anything above 20.I am not really THAT dumb. I should be able to use a basic electronic device.

I wish there were more videos that included baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arguing about war","review":"In my opinion;It is unfortunate that Mr Walzer is at an advanced age as he is unlikely to actually learn about war so as to enable him to argue about it with credibility and understanding.Credit goes to the other (2) reviewers of this book as they did a very good job of writing to describe nearly all of the intelligible passages. The difficulty reading was not in the theory or concept, but the diarrhea of the pen that made too little sense too often. In addition, if Mr Walzer had an extensive, sorry wrong word, any historical understanding of the conflicts he was referencing, it was not apparent and appeared his depth of knowledge was incomplete or at best only tabloid headline deep.If you are looking for substance and coherence, do no not waste your time or money.

Through sharing his own experiences in Africa and North and South America David Cumes guides us towards our own passage of self-discovery. He reveals two basic ways of being in nature and gives insightful suggestions on how to use the transformational power of nature to access our inner landscape and Higher Self. Inner Passages, Outer Journey's shows how seeking healing through nature is not just another approach to health and fulfillment but reminds us that reconnecting with the body of the earth is our birthright and salvation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sor Juana: a sparking biography","review":"It's not easy to write a biography keeping ideological distance from the Biographed. But Octavio Paz, one of the most sparking writer and thinker of the 20th century, surpassed that classic absence of impartiality with this classic Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, whose life and work raises the weight curtain that helps the reader to understand the entanglements of the closed aristocracy of the Nueva España of the end of the 17th century. The life of Sor Inés is a hypnotical succession of enigmas, intrigues and ambiguities. Besides, she was a forerunner of the feminist conquests who started in the 19th century. Paz worked for four decades until the conclusion of this astonishing book. If he had nothing wrote, scarcely this work would be enough for him to be considered a truly literary and superb genius.J.C.Ismael"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked worn","review":"I ordered this book for an award for a student.

The book is THE authoritative text on the early history of Scituate, part of Plymouth Colony in the mid 1600's. Unfortunately, the combination of scanning and OCR has made the book almost useless for research. For example, the chapter titles are \\"1 Section 1\\", \\"2 Section 2\\", etc. The index is woefully incomplete: omitting (as far as I can tell) ALL references to the genealogy information which comprises 2/3 of the book (although, to be fair, the original text had an incomplete index.)

It's made of canvas and rubber, like a pair of tennis sneakers, so it appears to be a very sturdy case. The casing also has good screen protection. But the stiff constructions makes it extremely difficult to remove the iPod from the case. I dock my iPod in speakers almost daily, so it's important to me to have easy access to the iPod. To remove the iPod from the case, I am forced to push the iPod out of the case, through the back opening using the spinwheel access window - something tells me that pushing on the spin wheel repeatedly and forcebly is not a good thing to do to the ipod.Most important reason I'm dissapointed in this purchase - the thick rubber casing around the lock switch makes it impossible to access the switch with your fingers. How would you feel about using a pen to lock and unlock your iPod?"},{"rating":"1","title":"looks nostalgic... but...","review":"I had to do some creative cutting on this case with a pair of scissors to make it functional. The plastic around the hold button was to narrow and to thick to get a finger into to flip the switch, and the earphone jack on some of my earphones wouldn't fit through the opening in the case enough to make a good connection. After cutting it a bit... works, but looked bad. then had to apply a bit of white model paint to make it look like it is supposed to. If you let it sit in the sun or in your closed car the glued seams begin to separate which leaves sticky glue exposed on the canvas. If you don't mind tinkering with it a bit it's an OK case.

It sets up that straw dog and then demolishes it -- in an attempt to demolish America. America is based on the innate rights of man that no majority has the right to negate. Slavery was an evil, a violation of the Declaration of Independance that destoyed countless lives and was finally resolved by Abe Lincoln in the Civil War. \\"A new birth of freedom,\\" he said. The greatest president America ever had was able to correct that original evil.This director would have you believe that, because of slavery, nothing can be done, that Afro-Americans are better off enslaved rather than acting on their freedom to better themselves. That such a quality actor as Danny Glover would let himself be used by this director to spew his own hatred of American is extremely sad. Overall, an abomination of a movie and a distortion of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATTN: Those of you who value life more than art...","review":"If you value life more than art, please don't bother with this film. Lars von Trier, operating under Swedish law by which animals may be killed for cinema, had a donkey butchered for a scene in this film. He later cut the scene from the movie because he was afraid of the controversy.I need not say any more. If you disagree with the slaughter of animals for the sake of art, you will know to avoid MANDERLAY.

Othe standouts are \\"Until It's Time For You To Go\\", \\"We Can make The Morning\\", and \\"Sylvia\\". We also get to hear the full \\"Born 10,000 Years Ago\\" from Elvis Country fame.

Their collective musicianship is excellent, and their songwriting skills give this album a fresh and exciting sound. From top to bottom, Superior Machines is loaded with addictive melodies that never seem to get old. I had this CD in my car's player for a least three months. Eric Lewis's made-for-rock voice gives weight to the heavier tunes like \\"Sister, Sister\\" and \\"Ante Up.\\" The dark, dreamlike quality of Greg Riordan's songs provides an unusual but fascinating counterbalance. The first time I listened to \\"Big Orange World,\\" I was driving to work -- I was certain that a police car was coming up behind me, but it never materialized!

Tito Puente won a Grammy for this effort, which was recorded in 1985. But I still say his stuff from the 1950's and 60's is better (which had much more emphasis on Mambo, Cha-Cha, and dance music in general). The best cut is definitely \\"Lullaby of Birdland\\", which features some wonderful piano playing by George Shearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant but under rated album.","review":"Anyone who has heard Hugh Harris sing has probably done so unawares. This outstanding soulful work's best showpiece is undoubtedly 'the Rhythm Of Live'. This track accompanies John Candy's exit in the final scene of 'Uncle Buck', a film which if you haven't seen already, I would thoroughly recommend you do so. Hugh Harris sings evocatively with a voice that has an incredible range. Why this man hasn't produced any additional work (to my knowledge) is beyond me. His unique vocalization of lyrics that quite honestly don't always make sense, will nevertheless enthrall you and ensure that this cd doesn't just gather dust on the shelf. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GOOD REFERENCE VIDEO","review":"The video series, that this is the first volume of, has been floating around since the 1980s.

Nakayama was perhaps the most dynamic of the Chief Instructors of the Japan Karate Association (JKA). My bias shows, my SHODAN (1st Degree, Black Belt) certificate is from the JKA and bears Nakayama's signature. This is about SHOTOKAN kata as it was done by THE MAN, Nakayama Masatoshi Sensei.

Another problem is that it does not stay in place. The base is very heavy, and difficult to secure to the side of the crib. The base twists, causing the arm to fall to the side, which could potentially hurt a child. It is very cute, but I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Gains","review":"I have been lifting for about 3 years now (benching about 95lbs when I started) and about a year ago I hit a wall where I could not seem to increase my max anymore.

When Before I started this regimen I was maxing out on the bench at about 185 and just last week I did 245 for the first time and I have increased in pretty much every other area as well.

It uses all of the modern words that are still used today, rather than focusing too heavily on Sanskrit loan words. It has an awkward transliteration system, but once you are used to it its no problem. All it really does is double the vowels so instead of writing \\"e\\" it is \\"ee\\" in this book \\"oo\\" instead of \\"o\\" etc. This book is over 400 pages and has many many good things in it.

The music is more Caribbean or South American than Andalusian but is still a wonderful program of Spanish melodies and fusion flamenco in the style of Paco de Lucia. The second guitar and the percussion effects add spice to Serrano's master's touch, and the rumbas are a delight to listen to. A great CD for flamenco aficionados."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera, great price!","review":"This is my second digital camera. I bought it because it has a lot of manual controls that my first camera, Agfa CL50, doesn't have. Fuji introduced this canera near the end of 1999 so its price has dropped quite a bit since then. I really like its design. The hand grid and the solid metal feel make it so comfortable in my hand. Built in hot shoe is a big plus that I can attach an external flash light. It has a 2.4 mega pixels CCD which is more than enough for my use. Image quality is good and nicely exposed. It has a full control of all shutter speeds but only two settings for aperture (4 and 8) which is the only thing I disappointed. And that's why I give it a four instead of five stars. Anyway it is a very nicely built camera in a very attractive price. All control buttons are in good positions. Oh, lastly the rechargeable battery last for quite a while after a full charge.

There isn't enough good I can say about this camera.

The zoom works easily and the optical viewfinder means I never have the battery run down during a day of shooting. But...Fuji uses an odd TIFF file system when taking umcompressed photos and regular software won't read the file. You have to use the Fuji software and convert the file to JPEG. Their software is not user-friendly. Fortunately, I rarely take TIFF images. The JPEG images at the 1 megabyte level are fine for anything but portrait work. Excellent construciton and excellent color rendition. I've used the camera for a year and will soon upgrade to a 5 megapixel unit, keeping this as a second camera. One really irritating thing: The \\"close-up\\" setting does not go back to default when the camera is turned off, which can ruin a lot of pictures if you're not careful to turn the \\"close-up\\" off when done taking close-ups.With that exception, the controls are easy to operate and the camera has served me well."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This item is very bulky.

I've been to CR 3 times before as an independent traveler and wanted an updated book, so I went right to DK. Way too generic this time. Feels like they are coasting on past glory.Two tips for others buying travel guides - read a few sample sections in a book, then read the same sample sections in a couple of other books. It will help decide which writer's style you prefer, who gives the depth or type of info you're interested in, etc. ( I should have followed this advice!)

It isn't the best guide to tell you exactly where to eat or stay, so you might want to purchase another guide for those details. They do provide a section on restaurants and hotels but it is not as comprehensive as other guides I considered.We used it to gain further information about the areas we were visiting.

The author, Brittney Ryan, has done that, without preaching, but with the wonderful voice of Holly Claus.

The best analogy I can offer here is that Illbleed is a lot like a backstage party with Ru Paul; all of the elements appear to be in place, but it's just not adding up to a good time. As bad as Blue Stinger was (also developed Illbleed is ten times worse My god, how do I escape this horrible nightmare?\\" will be a question asked by Illbleed players everywhere.

There are typographical and syntactical errors on almost every page. I can't comment on technical accuracy, as I am a beginner at astronomy. But I do know when I've seen the same photograph twice with different, and inconsistent, captions.

There are so many terrifically awful errors in this book, it would take another book to document them. Pictures of microscopes where telescopes should be, refractor telescopes described as Dobsonians, etc, etc. The illustration/pictures are also slipshod, out of focus and poorly rendered. I cannot believe a suposedly reputable publishing house could release this \\"joke\\" of a text on amateur astronomy. It should be withdrawn from the market NOW and burned. -Richard Anderson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive table","review":"This table is quite attractive and substantial. It sits a little lower than a standard patio table however one can still sit comforatbly near the table. I suspect this is to prevent one from getting their legs under the table and too close to the fire pit bowl. One negative:two of the screws where the legs attach to the ring assembly did not fit well and were exteremly difficult to tighten all the way. I almost was forced to cut the screws shorter. I added some machine oil to the threads and gently worked the screws deeper into screw holes. Overall satisfied with the table...and it is quite attractive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and attractive","review":"This table was almost exactly what I was expecting.

The chapters are all written from the point of view of different characters including Batman himself and Nightwing and Robin and even the original Batgirl, Barbara Gordon. While they're participating in the main plotline, they also reflect on their histories (I think this is Animated Series continuity) with Gotham and with each other, and some of the in-character insights are really powerful and moving (and funny!) I don't know why they decided to make a book out of a video game, but I can't imagine one being much better than this! There are some hidden treasures in here that it would be a shame to miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick a Point of View and stick with it!","review":"I like Sun-Tzu, and I like the ultimate detective Batman is occasionally written as. This book superficially appeared as a battle of titanic deduction against titanic military cunning. That book, I wanted to read it.Instead I got one chapter, near the end. One single chapter from Batman's perspective, more a physical battle than a mental one. What a disappointment. Each chapter is from a different character's perspective, including Sin-Tzu (boo at revealing the villain's plans), henchmen, Batgirl, Alfred, Robin, and mid-boss villains like Clayface.The is genre pulp fiction, not the clash of great minds. If you are really into Batman, you'll like it.

Having lived several years past in the Far East, I enjoy many of the movies that take place in that part of the world. The movie's summary intriqued me, so I watched it and was pleasantly surprised! It's not a great movie, but it is a good movie and a beautiful movie to watch. Although they opted to go with Jessica Alba rather than to use an Asian actress, Jessica does a great job in her role as \\"The Sleeping Dictionary\\". In fact, I didn't realize it was she until I checked the credits at the end. It's a good look at British Colonialism during the 1930s in Sarawak and the double standards many of the Colonialists possessed. If you enjoy exotic locales, beautiful scenery, and a good tale, give this movie a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensual experience!","review":"The love story between an English colonial & an Iban girl set in the beautiful jungle was unlike any other love story I've seen. The movie was not only rich in romance & passion, but also very artistic in settings & different. Beautiful scenery, you'll love it. \\"Sleeping Dictionary\\" Jessica Alba was terrific! Also, it helped me understand much more about another tradition - the Iban, set in around 1930, which was so interesting.Again, faith can lead you to a destiny you've never thought you would come to.

Alba shakes off her tough, DARK ANGEL persona and plays a young, sweet, soft, native girl (Selima) in Borneo hired to teach the local language to a young British Officer John Truscott (Hugh Dancy). She's placed in his residence as the hired teacher and naturally they fall in(and make)love etc. Once the film establishes this relationship, there's not much to the story as to watch people get uptight about the situation. Some good scenery and cinematography with Alba in the foreground, but there is nothing new plotwise or characterwise in this film even with the presecnce of Bob Hoskins (WHO FRAMED ROGER RABITT?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful.","review":"This movie was really quite bad.

Until now, I had never seen her in a movie and had no opinion of her (good or bad). But now that I have, I'm not impressed. Hugh Dancy was good all things considered. This film had a lot of potential, and I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. Big thumbs down from me. I feel generous giving it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall Asleep with this 'Dictionary'","review":"Calm down, that was a body double, ignorant goofs. An English colonial was sent to a British post in Sarawak (where in the world is that?), during the 1930's era. There \\"The Sleeping Dictionary\\" was assigned to him and he received the best tutoring session he ever had! Hugh Dancy played the noisy man who thought he had his morals straight, but he didn't. Good thing Jessica Alba was in this movie. She really needed to pull a \\"Dark Angel\\" on everyone. Even the guy from \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\" was insanely miscast as her father! Can you believe it? I really had high hopes for this movie, but it proved to be a huge disappointment. How shamey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowning Without a Tsunami","review":"When a movie is this blatantly and irredeemably simpleminded, one has to wonder for what audience it might have been intended. The fact that Jessica Alba is adorable doesn't make up for the fact that she can't act. Any native of Sarawak who had the misfortune to see her portrayal of one of them would be offended. We know that Emily Mortimer, she's adorable too, can act from her three or four minutes on screen in \\"Notting Hill\\"; she stole that one from a couple of much bigger stars, but you'd never know she can act from watching this. Bob Hoskins chews the scenery here to very little effect. Hugh Dancy plays a barely post-adolescent version of his character in \\"The Jane Austin Book Club\\"; at least he's gotten much better at it. Brenda Blethyn appears disengaged thoughout; maybe it was the heat and the humidity. Once again the colonizing Brits are portrayed as arrogant racist oafs - old news.I admit that we watched it to the end - don't know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Movie..I recommend.","review":"I watched this movie because the premise seemed promising, and also quite credible <though the Englishman falls in love with native girl has been almost ad nauseum> I'm actually writing the review because what I was most struck by was the touching performances of Jessica Alba. Alba, while absolutely STUNNING in this movie, and I mean slam you in the face stunningly beautiful, is also suprisingly believable as Selima -the \\"Sleeping Dictionary\\" of the title- herself the illegitimate daughter of a sleeping dictionary and Englishman- her accent wavers ocassionally, but she actually brings this character to life quite deftly. And High Dancy as her English lover is perfect as well.I read that this went straight to DVD and that's a shame, it's much more lyrical and beautiful than some of the crap that HAS made it to the big screen \\"Four Feathers\\" anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Story","review":"If you like a romance that involves two absolutely different cultures and includes some true to life twist, try this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived schlock","review":"This pitiful excuse for vhs tape was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. Except for Bob Hoskins, I couldn't believe a word anyone mumbled in this incoherent waste of film. There's a good reason why this never made it to the theaters. Save your money. Life is too short to spend 2 hours on a concept that might have been done in 80 minutes, and even that's pushing it. I should agree that Jessica Alba is a lovely young actress, and she's nice to look at.

My mother was born in Malaysia, and there's a lot more to the accent than just broken English. Not to mention she looks nothing like the part. Did the casting director say, \\"Jessica's part-Mexican, ethnic enough -- she can play a Southeast Asian!\\" JA may be beautiful, but the interchanging is downright insulting, like lumping all the brown people together. Of all the \\"Asian\\" women in the trailer, it's so plain to see she's not! Were Asian women not attractive enough for the lead role? Are there not enough of them for a casting call, the most populous race? Actors can only \\"become\\" someone different to a degree.

His friend heard he was going there and got him a job in Brazil teaching students at The Center for Physical Reasearch. When he got to Rio he did a television spot with Cesar Lattes - the the director of the Center for Physical Reasearch. They filmed without sound, and they asked the two of them just to look as is they were talking. So Lattes asked Feynman \\"Have you found a sleeping dictionary yet?\\" He was of course asking if he had found a girl to sleep with.I wonder if the writer of this movie or book got the idea from Feynmans story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for me.","review":"When it is working, the picture quality is good for being an RF device. It isn't amazing clear or anything, just acceptable for RF. HOWEVER (and it is a very big however), this device only works when it senses a video signal. Not uncommon in these types of devices, but this one cannot tell the difference between black video and no signal. So, whenever the video signal fades to black, it cuts out. And it is pretty sensitive to it as well, so in the middle of a video that fades to black between scenes there is a loud pop and the video turns to snow.

I've read several books of this genre, and this is certainly one of the best. The book is at times very well written.

I mean even American SWAT teams at this time had better armor, weapons and tactics.Maybe because this was a low budget film they couldn't afford newer weapons and options that are standard equipment on even the poorest US SWAT teams. Their assault tactics looked elementary; such as maneuvering in bright lights instead of dim; bunching up in alleys, running into a situation without enough ammo, etc. Plus, no reflex sights, no night scopes, Kevlar helmets, comm VOX headsets.In one scene one of heir \\"Elites\\" is racking and dry-firing his Glock, and then pointing it at his buddy, which was really stupid and psychotic.

On Sep. 15, 2008 the United Nation reported that police was linked to 1 in 5 Rio murders. The brutality of both the police and the drug dealers can only be imagined unless you've seen some actual photos.

Because of Matty being part of a known crime family, he can't get honest employment. He seeks to earn the trust of his father and do important tasks.When the opportunity arises to please his father, Matty employs his coke snorting paranoid friend Marbles (Seth Green) to make a run out to Spokane to pick up a bag...which gets lost in a small town in Montana.

To gainsay his non-review tirade, this reviewer wishes to commend to other readers an opportunity to learn of the enormous complexity that occurs when contrasting and competing cultures meet and far too often clash, such as we are witnessing in our own day. The relationships that develop rarely serve either culture as long as Santanyana's warning goes unheeded. That modern day Mohegans even exist is itself a miracle: that the colonial European mentality of greed and resentment still abides in at least one North Stonington heart is dismaying, to say the least.\\"Uncas\\" deserves a proper reading unsullied by prejudice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the Original, and That's It.","review":"Viewed: 1/13Rate: 31/13: Slightly better than the original, Addams Family Values still retains characters that I cannot stand. And this time, they've decided to add another actress that I've hated for years: Joan Cusack. Since Addams Family Values is meant to be a film for kids, Joan Cusack's cleavage is at a full-front assault in every scene she appears in. Admittedly, Addams Family Values has many clever ideas and is a way better film than whatever the crap Tim Burton could come up with. All in all, only if I could stand the characters, Addams Family Values might have worked out better for me, but it has racist undertones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen.

It's an ok movie, pretty silly and stupid but funny and entertaining enough to keep. I wouldn't recommend it as the best movie ever, but it's good to watch as a sequel. Still, all in all, glad I have it now. And the price was pretty decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun.....","review":"While I did see the first Addams family feature, this one was far funnier as Fester becomes a love-sick suitor to a murderous Nanny who marries and murders her husband for money.The kids are wonderful and Christina Ricci steals the show as Wednesday with her dead pan style delivery. She takes delight in including the new Baby in some rather nefarious games but as it turns out, little Pubert can handle himself well and indeed saves his entire family from electrocution by playing with the cables just as murderous Debbie throws the switch. The scene at summer camp is also a blast, as Wednesday leads the other outcasts of the camp into an Indian style take over of the Camp Director's play. It's a crazy madcap movie that makes the Addams family a delight to visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"Got this movie for the grandkids for Halloween.

If it were not for the cooly creepy performance of \\"Wednesday\\" this would have gotten zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"Yeah it was pretty terrible. However I found myself going back to it in the library video section just to see how bad it was again. So it can't be all THAT horrible. Entertaining because of the Addams draw that pulls everyone to it, comical and still somewhat dark, but not like the first.OH and what is that classical piece that Debbie is playing on the radio in her hand before she throws it into the tub with fester?

Amanda Buckman (the girl scout cookie seller from the previous movie) and the two hyper counselors deserved what Wednesday and her \\"outcast\\" group did (threatening to burn Amanda on stake, and roasting two counselors on open fire); What if these two things were switched?

Phrases included are pretty useful, though with all travel phrase books there will be phrases missing and phrases you don't use. It's very thorough, and includes pronunciation. Some of the bonus facts are a bit off, and at least one is definitely wrong (it states that US cell phones cannot ever be used in Europe, which is incorrect as many new cell phones are dual or tri band these days, and those most definitely can be used overseas). I'd still recommend buying this book, just take facts with a grain of salt and do your travel homework elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT get Kindle version","review":"This book would have been better in hard copy.

However, I was very disappointed for the following reasons: 1) the story was too simplistic (and full of tired cliches), 2) the characters were one-dimensional stereotypes and 3) the main characters (and their family) were claustrophobic in their smug superiority. I have seen too many families that present just this outward image while hiding a truth that would be more beneficial for all to see the light of day. Isn't it ironic now that the theme of the distorted family image of the O'Sulivan family is in fact duplicated by the depiction of the Coyne/McGrail clan.Surely I won't be coming back for a second helping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original","review":"Rarely would I say that a remake is better than the original, but this one is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Original!","review":"I would say that in most cases remakes are not as good as the original but in this case I have seen them both and must say that Julia and Harrison make a great pair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing remake. I prefer the original with Hepburn","review":"A disappointing remake. I prefer the original with Hepburn.Story was not much to begin with, but Hepburn's charm made it enjoyable if predictable tale.The remake uses a homely looking woman, so there is no charm to save the thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Storyline","review":"Julia Ormond and Harrison Ford struggles to keep this sub-par remake alive. They--especially Julia--succeeds in bringing forth this great story. A great love story, the movie captures the evolution of savior: \\"Sabrina Fair\\" whose warmth and compassion changes the lives of everyone around her.On the other hand, the romantic chemistry between Ormond and Ford leaves much to be desired, especially for a romantic film and the nouveau riche ambience is a tad over-done and detracts from the main plot.However, this remains one of my favorite films and doesn't fail to be moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hate me, but this is better than the Hepburn version","review":"Most crtics would disagree with me, but I liked this movie far better than the Bogart/Hepburn version. I love Harrison Ford--he's very sexy and I never thought Bogie was even attractive, much less sexy and I'm 58 years old. Julia Ormond is also far prettier than Audrey Hepburn. I liked Hepburn, she was just way too fragile looking. It was always hard for me to see her as an adult. In this remake, Linus'(Harrison Ford) transformation from total workaholic to a man who understood the need to LIVE was gradual and believable. I saw little, if any, difference in the character as played by Bogart. And Julia Ormond's Sabrina went convincingly from awkward teen with a major crush on the younger brother (SPOILER ALERT) to sophisticated adult who discovers real love with the older brother, Linus. I absolutely loved the ending. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie.","review":"Love this movie. Have been searching for it forever. Good mixture of Drama and comedy. Fell in love with it years ago"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good remake","review":"Other than the fact that it seemed like Linus and Sabrina fell in love quickly (two-three days?) I found this to be a charming remaking. The first act seemed or felt rather long-watching her in Paris while she slowly tried to forget about David. I did wonder whatever happened to her photographer boyfriend-but I guess he was just meant to be a fling. Plus, I would have liked this modernized version to give her father more of a backbone other than just letting whatever happen-happen. Plus, Sabrina was supposed to be like this innocent breath of fresh air-chick who was steadily pursuing an engaged man. I questioned her intelligence to willing line up to be one of those love him and dump chicks David ran through. If she knew him as well as she said she did, why follow his blueprint to a broken heart? Still it's a charming film-a good remake-not great-but good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sabrina- The best movie I have ever seen!","review":"This new remake is of Sabrina is great! I loved it ! The cast was great and I thought it was great how it was both comedy and a romantic movie. This new 1995 remake is fresh in the 90's although 1954 sabrina was excellent too. The newer one was more upbeat. I would recommend this movie to anyone, it is a movie that everyone should have in their own home. I have watching so many times and can't even count!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a clever piece of work out of Hollywood","review":"I do admit I haven't seen the original. But does it matter? This film is clever, enjoyable. Although out of touch of modern life realities just a little bit, it provides a delightful view of many beautiful things in life. Please don't compare it with the original version. Let it stand alone and value it as it truly deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO COMPARISON TO THE OLD VERSION!!!","review":"If you ever liked the old version with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, don't even look at this one! The comparison to Bogart to Ford is zip, nada, nothing!!! The wonderful music from the old Sabrina didn't appear in this one... they barely put in \\"La Vie en Rose\\" one of the most romatic songs from the old version! I guess I'm too much of a Bogart fan to allow any man to take his place. Harrison Ford, I think, was much past his prime in this movie... And nobody can say the wonderful lines Boggy did... \\"It's all in the family\\"... Whenever Ford said all the lines, they just fell flat. Anyway... If you liked the old one, don't watch this one! I guess if you are a great fan of Ford you might enjoy it, but other than that, I don't think anyone can compare to Bogart, Hepburn, and Holden! Watch the OLD one! NOT the new!!! I promise you'll enjoy the old one much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Come I'm the Only Person who Hated this Movie?","review":"I like most movies, and don't tend to be picky, but...why did they even bother to remake the original? Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart certainly don't need updated versions. Julia Ormond is lovely, but she cannot act. Perhaps the director knew this; there are about a million close-ups of her face, with no dialogue. But a lot of people seemed to love this movie, so maybe I missed something. I can't imagine what."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"How anyone could rate this movie higher than a 2 is beyond me...and a 2 is being generous! I guess it would be okay if you had never seen the original Bogart/Hepburn version, but once you've seen the original this one pales sorely in comparison!! There is no spark between Ormond and Harrison, and you can barely even understand some of her lines! Be smart...get the original and you'll be hooked...get this version and get ready for a nap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond horrible","review":"I must ask what the crew was thinking when they decided to remake a classic. Honestly, how can you ever try to redo a film as great as the original Sabrina? It is nearly impossible. This version has such a horrible actess portraying Sabrina. It is an insult to Audrey Hepburn! To have someone that can't act and isn't at all attractive play a role you once played? The horror! I just can't believe they actually remade such a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This movie is a terrible remake of a wonderful movie (the original, with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite movies). The acting was wooden and the updated situations and dialogues NO improvement on the original. I had been excited to see this, actually, since I've always liked Harrison Ford and the original movie. What a disappointment. PLEASE skip this one and go right to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching!","review":"We own and enjoy both the 1954 original and this remake. I have to tell you in many ways we like this film better--the original cast had the powerhouses--Bogart and Hepburn. But this film has more talent when considering both the leading and supporting roles. Julia Ormand makes a delicious transformation from latent teen to vivacious young woman. Nancy Marchand is the perfect matriarch, and Dana Ivey delivers wonderfully as the dry-humored secretary for Linus. You won't regret buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I love this movie! dont listen to any other newspaper critic because i think this is the sweetest movie of all time. harrison ford is a fantastic actor and this movie makes him even more great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done remake!","review":"They stayed true enough to the story with just enough modern updates.

Harison Ford showed how one can become stuck in their ways but with a little help there is hope and romance. That is all any of us can hope for. He gives great emotion to his caractor but yet a human quality EXISTS."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, clean fun!","review":"This movie suffered disasterous reviews upon release, but it's worth a second look. It is truly a romantic movie, that plays on all your notions of what love is supposed to be. Greg Kinnear as \\"David\\" is especially charming, and I almost felt like rooting for him, instead of Harrison Ford. The scenes of Paris are great, and you really, really wish, you had a contact that would set you up with and apartment in Paris with a job at Vogue magazine.Alas, that is not in the cards.. but I can still pop in the video and pretend i was there.."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the original!","review":"I don't know how this skunk got 4 and 1/2 stars on Amazon let alone one! I could hear Hepburn, Bogart and Holden rolling over with a resounding boom. I think this is mainly because of Ford's Linus. He is a very unsympathetic character in this remake. The film critics said that, while the original Sabrina was about her transformation, this version was about Linus' transformation. But here Linus shows no transformation that you can really see. His explanation to Sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end- \\"There was a merger, and you were in the way. No hard feelings\\" is very cold compared with Bogart's \\"Would you believe I enjoyed every minute of it?\\" In the original, you get the feeling that Sabrina gets the right man; you don't get that here at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"No chemistry","review":"I was very disappointed with this movie. I felt that Ormond and Ford had no chemistry at all. I get so tired of the older man/much younger woman syndrome. Ormond's transformation from mousy young girl to sophisticated woman was completely unbelievable. Harrison Ford gives her little reason to switch alliances, but she does anyway making her appear very shallow. I usually like most romantic comedies but his one was definitely a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light entertainment","review":"This movie isn't the best, I'll be completely up front. Julia Ormond is just completely lacking of charm, and if you've seen the original, it comes across even more plainly. However - it really is a fun film with witty dialogue that I find watching over and over despite its problems.The banter and camaraderie of the house servants, as well as the sharp wit of Linus and Mrs. Larabee, provide a humorous and entertaining aspect that makes this film worth owning for a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF SABRINA.","review":"I Am an avid Audrey Hepburn fan, but I have to admit that the remake of Sabrina is much better than the originial version. Not because of Julia Ormond, but because of Harrison Ford. He brought the character of Linus to life. He made me believe that Linus was the crude businessman, yet somehow humanized him into a character that could fall in love and have a life. I must admit that as much as I love Bogey, I liked Ford better as Linus. The chemistry between Ormond and Ford was definitely there. I would love to see these two play opposite on another project. This is certainly a movie to have in your private collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done remake of a classic","review":"I loved the original with Bogart and this one was well made and sticking to the original beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleasantg","review":"I just loved the movie, also I would like to see Julia Ormand in other romantic movies.

I have watched this movie no less than 25 times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as nearly as good as the original","review":"The problem with this movie is that the actors could not decide whether they were trying to be themselves or the old actors. Julia Ormond, especially, kept sort of, but not quite, acting like Audrey Hepburn. It didn't seem to be a case of her not being able to pull off the character; it just seemed like either she or the director could not decide whether they were doing something new or directly remaking the old version. It would have been better if they had completely cut ties with the past.The movie also seemed to move quite slowly, and there was very little chemistry between Julia Ormond or either of her suitors. I love Harrison Ford, but Linus here just came off as a jerk, and Sabrina came off as too stupid to see how mean he was. The crucial love scene between them was rushed, and far too much time was spent showing how scheming he was.If you liked the 1954 version of this movie, I would skip this one. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent","review":"It came more scratched and the back of the disc was foggy.

He is incapable of giving a bad performance and the part was perfect for him. No William Holden by any means but he did a good job. Julia Ormond was so miscast that it was pathetic. In her one scene when she has just arrived from Paris and is supposed to be so stunning, she simply ISN'T. What was so bad was that they show her all the time she is in Paris looking terrible then we are supposed to believe that the day before she left Paris she got a makeover. Ridiculous. I guess nobody could have stood the comparison with Audrey Hepburn but she wasn't even in the ballpark. Harrison Ford did the best he could but he was just terribly miscast. Sometimes I've wondered - does he really think that heavy breathing through his nose is acting? Trust me, if you want to see \\"Sabrina\\", get a copy of the original B&W."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to see this on DVD","review":"Does anyone know if this will be out on DVD my VHS tape is wore out and I would like to see i f there was more to this dare i say better version of the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SAbrina 1995","review":"I am in love with this movie and have been since I was 4 when it came out.

By helping several of the other animals when they were having difficulties, Leo was able to prove to the other animals that he had genuinely changed and become a better \\"person.\\" In the end the other animals invited Leo back to be their king again. This teaches such a wonderful lesson to children and I have bought at least a dozen copies of it to give to my children's schools and for birthday gifts for their friends.

For that matter, unlike \\"The Capeman\\" it had a point and a plot and witty lyrics and charming music--and it was originally produced on Broadway forty years before \\"The Capeman\\" was.So why re-invent \\"West Side Story\\"? To make it grittier and more realistic? Sorry, but compared to \\"West Side Story\\" (judging by \\"Songs from the Capeman\\"), \\"The Capeman\\" is a cartoon.

But in coping with this misbuy, I found that the music is very good for a relaxed evening, or during dinner, it has nice tunes, a stong latin touch and a reminiscence of Westside story. So not a total waste after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cd in 20 years","review":"I join others who really admire Paul Simon. The guy is right up there with Gershwin, Lennon/McCartney, Jimmy Webb - incredible stable of certifiable neo-classics. How did he come up with THIS? I actually couldn't take it. I kept thinking this was a latest mockumentary by the Spinal Tap folks. I don't want to say much more. I saw Simon & Garfunkel in the late 60's at a smaller venue. It was like magic! Their catalog is stunning. His earlier solo albums are also great although Hearts and Bones should have had Garfunkel singing ... It would have equalled their best work. This album, Capeman, is absurd in every respect. That's what happens I suppose when you lay low in the Brill Building too long. I see that Simon's work has gotten better but I'm still shaken after this bomb. The S&G albums just sound better and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one, get another","review":"I like Paul Simon and have been getting all his stuff from the 80s and 90s, but this one is, without a doubt, the biggest disappointment...it is in several areas..I only like one song, the last one \\"trailways bus,\\" but I am very troubled by the theme of this record, which is the story of a young puertorican who killed two people in 1950s. Unless you really want to analyze it, he almost seems to glorify the killings as most of the songs are from his point of view, or the point of view of his family. I don't know - I like the latin music theme (that's why I got it), but the story and lyrics intermixed don't work. This could have been so much better, if Paul Simon avoided this particular theme and concentrated more one creating better songs...Sometimes not everything thing, even if it is from someone as talented as Simon, and this album is evidence of my theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Capeman Is Far From Super, Man","review":"I give simon two stars instead of one because i respect the undertaking. artists should be allowed by their fans to explore new territory and try new things. a musical would seem natural for simon, who has always excelled at narratives and finding the point of dramatic tension in his lyrics. but i have to say, this cd is pretty horrible. a decent song here and there maybe, but that's generous. the songs are disjointed and insipid. i'm not sure how people could give this cd four or five stars, the same ratings that they would give graceland or his eponymous first album. it's not that good. it's not even close. if you can't resist the urge to buy this album, do yourself the favor of buying it used. the last time i checked, it was selling used for ten cents. that should tell you something in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeez lighten up!","review":"The album is great, the style is new for Paul Simon but he performs it well. I was headed somewhere with my father as he was playing this one day, not knowing waht it was but liking it. (I was 15 at the time, 16 now) The Vampires came on and the voice sounded familiar but the frequent profanity (lighten up people! yeesh. If it is used as the lines of a person, it's not something to avoid. The attempt was for realism not wholesomeness) blocked Paul Simon's name from my mind, although I was familiar with his work. I asked and was told, I was a bit shocked that it was him, but still liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are you people talking about?","review":"I can't believe the one star reviews on here! Each to his own and all that, but I don't see how any Paul Simon fan could not like this. I got it cheap this week, having not really tried to track it down before, partly because of the mixed reputation it has, but from half-way through the first track I was hooked. The harmonies are amazing, and every song has so much texture to it. Some people have moaned about the swearing, but this is the world we live in today, and I found it quite refreshing to hear Paul let go like that. Do you think he doesn't talk like this in real life? Anyway, the music is always the most important part, and every song here is captivating, I would honestly say (and this includes S&G) that this is the most consistently interesting album Paul Simon has released."},{"rating":"2","title":"bemused and confused......","review":"...by some of the reviews above - this is an important piece of work by one of the few great songwriters working today; a concept work, a musical, based on a true life tragedy from late 50's n.y. gang life; some stunningly beautiful songs - \\"sunday afternoon\\", \\"born in puerto rico\\", \\"time is an ocean\\" - but more importantly a beautifully evocative story in music and lyrics; all credit to paul simon for taking the bold step of turning his talent to the musical form, and succeeding. bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Culturally Shallow Music","review":"I'm a big Paul Simon fan, but I was extremely disappointed in this album. Simon presents a very stereotyped view of Latino people in this music, and the music itself is relatively predictable and stale.

Simon is a talented lyricist; unfortunately he tries here to be a journalist instead--and fails miserably. \\"The Capeman\\"'s lyrics are banal, awkward, and puerile. Instead of immersing himself in old newspaper clippings and flying off to South America, Simon ought to have prepared by investigating real musicals and reading what their authors have had to say about them.

I find nothing \\"sweet\\" about murder, profanity, and gang violence, especially when it is depicted sentimentally as it is here.What was Paul Simon thinking of when he wrote this?

I was terribly disappointed in this album. This is not Paul Simon, it's Paul Simon in an \\"Off Broadway Musical\\", and that was definitely NOT what I was expecting. Yes, its new, and different... but not in a good way. Fortunately for me, the store allowed me to return the album...which I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone dry","review":"There's no surprise that Capeman failed as a stage show. It was, after all, supposed to be a musical-- and there is nothing on SONGS FROM THE CAPEMAN that qualifies as melodic. Name ONE tune here that you can (or want to) whistle, for that is a litmus test of a successful Broadway show-- the audience leaves the theater contentedly humming or whistling parts of the score.This music is so very forgettable and tuneless-- it's the absolute worst Paul Simon has ever written and IMO the lowest point of his musical career.Listen to the 30-second samples before you buy this one. It may not even be worth owning for Simon completists."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible tunes","review":"I only wish that the musical had stayed on Broadway long enough for me to see it. If there are other songs besides these then Paul Simon needs to release another Capeman CD. It is easy to listen to and sing along.

The shear simplicity of their music stands in stark contrast to the music of that time. Metheny's guitar work seems to open the doorway to something refreshingly innocent. The guitar, piano and bass stand apart and yet play and bounce off each other, like light off the water. The sum is truly greater than it's parts.\\"Lakes\\" and \\"Watercolors\\" are two of the best frolics in this primer of jazz fusion. With chords and riffs running down in rivelets, the listener is buoyed along for the ride downstream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Album!","review":"Everything about this album is great!

On the outside, they are similar to the sort of cotton work gloves one might use in the garden. There is nothing fancy about them, but they keep the hands warm.

There is nothing fancy about them, but they are great for daily use, football games, etc. The gloves listed here would likely be too large for someone with small hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I have to admit this was more than I expected. Not that I doubt Charlie Byrd's abilities; Only lately I have been listening to so much Mingus, Ellington and Ellis, trio jazz without horns seems ribs sans biscuits.But this should change that: the comping here is so good and the bass so full, working as heavy as any front instrument, the music here is as lush as lush gets.What interests me about Charlie Byrd--an artist I discover on listening to Sugerloaf Suite I know all too little--is his complete lack of flash, but an ability to spin amazing webs with a simple hollow body. By giving up solos for groove, this live album will carry you more miles than you'll ever need."},{"rating":"2","title":"original is better","review":"Was glad to find this after a lot of searching.

Unfortunately, his book contains so many factual errors that it detracts from his noble purpose. Breuer claims to have drawn his information from FBI files and \\"authors of integrity, ability, and objectivity.\\" So many erroneous dates, places and events are portrayed here that it bears little resemblance to the many thousands of pages I have examined in the FBI's FOIPA Reading Room, and one of the few published works Breuer cites is Jay Robert Nash's Bloodletters and Badmen, which makes a nice doorstop but is hardly a tool for serious researchers.

On the arcade machines (the ones with the heavy metal pads), I was able to easily hit the ones on the Medium levels.The only grouse that I have is that it keeps slipping a bit on the carpeted floor of my apartment.

In this book, Katie and her parents have to rent out rooms to afford to stay in the wonderful old house they inherited from Katie's great-aunt Emily. Katie soon feels like a slave.

One of the best songs I've ever heard, it may be predictable, but still near perfect. If only the guitars were audible! 'Somebody do something' seems like they're trying to hard to sound odd.

There are now several other books on essentially the same topic. I found this book to be rather too academic for the lay reader (me), dwelling as it does in considerable details on Army organisation and reorganisation and other statistical details. There is also a heavy reliance on Austrian sources for the text. The author is aware of this and tries to correct the imbalance in treatment by selective use of material from other sources.

You will find it quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond copy","review":"This is one of several movies that cashed in on the Bond craze. This particular one is the worst of the copies. The low budget limits the exotic location shots and make the story very slow and dragging. There are none of the artistic photographic angles and effects common in the Bond films. It is about an insurance investigator who is looking into organized crime. The plot is totally devoid of any imagination or surprises. The one unusual feature is that some of the gratuitous violence is done by women who appear to be bored with their violent work. The women and their clothes were very flashy by standards of 40 years ago, but will have no romantic effects on healthy men of today.

I hoped to find a book that my daughter could read to give her a glimpse of the life I used to know. However, I would not recommend this to any teen. The book is disturbing, because with the exception of a young, divorced, athiest, all of the adults are portrayed as either naive, frumpy, foolish, or hypocritical. The author is especially harsh on the Christian characters, both adults and teens, but also portrays others with religious beliefs negatively. Only the atheist comes out shining.

Unfortunately, I was not in the mood for her boohooing all over again.All I could think of while I was reading that book was \\"What is this?\\". Like the author, I am Japanese and have spent most of my life in Japan and am getting read to move back to Japan. Again, she stresses the discipline of the Japanese public school system. From reading her memoirs, I know that she personally never attended one. She simply listened to all the bad about them, and portrays them in a negative way.Basically speaking?

I have only referenced the book approximately 5 times in the last month, and I'm really disappointed that after paying $26 for the book, it is already falling apart.

I am sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Series!","review":"What was amazing about this book was the number of great ideas compiled into one place. With over 600 activities, let alone the learning centers, you are introduced to a whole new way of looking at teaching and sharing the world with your children. Another great thing about the book is the fact that these activities have been submitted and selected by a wide array of diverse authors, so you are not getting one person's thoughts on how to teach, but you are getting the best of all and these authors share their experiences and knowledge with you as you move forward! This is an amazing resource for any early childhood teacher and one that I would highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"small 1\\"x3\\" fit my kid's bike","review":"Buyers beware, these pegs are very small the dimension is 1\\" diameter and 3\\" length.

This is a somewhat more low-key Tanya than we saw before, but there is still that electric guitar, rock sound going on. And as expected, the real magic is in the lyrics. My personal favorite is \\"Mysteries of the Unexplained,\\" a breathtaking vision which addresses the question, \\"what is beauty?\\" and gives a very satisfying answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong effort, and well worth your time.","review":"Belly is one of my favorite bands, so naturally, this album intruiged me. What puzzles me about most of the reviews I've read is their failure to mention the dual coup d'etat of the album; manna and swoon. These form a kinetic structure akin to what we saw on Star with Untogether and Star, and what we saw on King with Red & Silverfish. With the added spiking of the thoughtful Mysteries of the unexplained, you have a strong, enjoyable album. It's not an album to have on as you wash the dishes or vacuum the floors, but rather one to pay attention to, to take the time to appreciate its subtle nuance and style. Curiously, I found Lantern to be one of the weaker moments on the track, with the exception of the smooth, slow break part in the middle. If you're a Belly fan, you'll probably enjoy this album; just don't expect \\"Stay\\" like ephiphanies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lantern, Manna, and Breathe Around You make it worthwhile","review":"Not having known a LOT of Throwing Muses or Belly in the past, I bought this Tanya Donelly album because I had listened to her music doing my DJ shift at school (specifically I had heard \\"Lantern\\"). The creativity of \\"Lantern\\" alone (especially the way the song pulls you in) makes this album worth it, but if you want the softer side of Tanya, you'll find it in the almost Sinead O'Connor/Juliana Hatfield-like song \\"Manna\\" and if you're looking for Tanya's anger, \\"Breathe Around You\\" is pretty brutal. This album is a strong collection of personal growth and strength. Only now am I beginning to look at her older stuff (involvement with Belly, Throwing Muses, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the \\"magic\\"?","review":"Yo, I am just about the biggest advocate of Belly....I STILL tell everyone I meet that if they don't have \\"Star\\" or \\"King\\" that they missed out.

Belly's music is awesome, particularly the vocals, so I wanted more. After doing some research, I realized that the lead singer was Tanya and Belly is not producing music anymore.So, I had to find out who the singer from Belly was, and it was Tanya. She has a wonderful voice and I took a chance on this disc after reading other favorable reviews on Amazon.Many time when I listen to a disc, I have to listen to it many times before I can get in to in. That was not the case with this disc. From the first listen, it is a great disc. I am not a music critic, so I can't tell you what is better or worse between this and the music from Belly. It does not seem the same to me, but since I liked Tanya's voice so much in Belly, this music was just as fantastic.She is a great singer and writer and this disc is worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"No album has ever moved me emotionally like this.","review":"I have followed Tanya Donelly's work ever since she was in Throwing Muses. I was there for her work with The Breeders, and best of all, Belly. Now, as a solo artist, she's developed even further. Thanks to Tanya for releasing the best album I have ever heard in my life. No album has ever moved me emotionally like this. From the pop highlights of tracks such as \\"Pretty Deep\\" and \\"The Bright Light\\", to the dark realms of \\"Acrobat\\" and \\"Manna\\", Lovesongs For Underdogs will take you on the emotional roller coaster of your life. This album is most enjoyable when driving on a road trip, however, the music itself is a journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bar... but a straight barbell is better","review":"Great Bar... but a straight barbell is betterThe reason why these bars are so popular, and are found in so many gyms, is because it is easier to handle than a straight barbell that requires you to have your wrists turned 180 degrees, palms up, compared to the EZ Curl Bar's 135 degree, palms at a 45 degree angle, making it easier to life weights and certainly more comfortable.Sadly comfort does not translate to better workout for bigger muscles. Science has proven that a straight barbell is better for bicep training than the EZ. In short, it is a better workout to have those wrists locked at 180 degree turns. Also you can do more types of workout with a straight bar than you can with an EZ curl bar. See bodybuilder.com or exrx.net, or get a good weights/bodybuilding book for information on exercises with a straight barbell versus the EZ. You will find that the straight bar offers lots of variations in the workout.

How shocked Heaven must have been! To not have a relationship with him!

She was raised in the urban New York City and you get the feeling about the city while you read her poetry and lyrics for the songs, Luka, and Tom's Diner as well as so many others like Book of Dreams. Suzanne Vega's Luka was about child abuse and Tom's Diner represented an urban experience of hers. I think the book does a fine service in explaining Vega's inspiration and creativity.

Hackett has such a feel for all styles of guitar and is successful in this effort in communicating his love for music and his instrument. Simple production ... just the guitar and a few complementary instruments ... only a master musician could pull it off. Hackett does.I really like Hackett's progressive/electric side, but I am appreciating more his versatility of late.

I bought this for Christmas thinking that it would be the same quality as all the other seasons. Boy was I wrong. I've seen VHS tapes taken from old television reruns that look and sound better than these dvd's. This whole season reeks of being thrown together overnight, and they want $37.00 for this garbage!

The video quality of season 10 is so poor that you would expect to find it in the $5 bargain bin at Wal-Mart. This is a slap in the face to all of the faithful that have purchased the first 9 seasons. At first I thought I was having a problem with my equipment. After testing the collection on two different systems as well as a PC I realized that CBS & Paramount had ripped me off. It's too bad this wasn't produced by a reputable company like Disney. When they release old films they have truly remastered them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Audio","review":"Paramount/CBS has really screwed up on Season 10 of Hawaii 5-0.The audio is terrible.

The previous 9 seasons were well done, but they really messed up on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality leaves MUCH to be desired","review":"I must agree with other posts that this release is far sub-par. I own all previous seasons, enjoy them and applaud CBS/Paramount for their release. Viewing season 10 makes me appreciate the other seasons even more. Picture quality varies, but never reaches what I expect from a remastered dvd. The sound is terrible. Audio levels vary within scenes. Interference/hiss are distracting at times; certainly more noticeable than on any other season in this series. One can only speculate as to the reason for this quality dive. Perhaps a new remaster team (or none at all). Perhaps a rush job to cash in on the new television hit. Whatever the case, there can be reasons but no excuses.The episodes themselves are enjoyable, but not as good as earlier seasons. You can read other reviews for highlights and missteps. That's subjective. There does seem to be consensus that the video and audio quality leave much to be desired. CBS/Paramount should recall/redo/refund/exchange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy video and audio with Season 10","review":"What the hell happened with season 10 of Hawaii Five-O?

It is a fast, lyrical read that had me engrossed. i HAD to know what happened throughout the whole story. It is a ghost story but not a scary one, it has you connected to the dead girl and living boy centered in the book. I loved how the author wrote from the ghost's perspective, almost like poetry. There is mystery shrouded in the girls death that is slowly opened up as the boy comes to self discovery and a bit of maturity. I love how there is realization and closure weaved together by Cora and Evan. In the end things are resolved and tied up nicely, it made me smile.

As the trio begins to make themselves felt, a presence starts to awaken, taking notice of Evan in particular. Once upon a time, Cora lived in this house, but died very young. She begins to believe that Evan is her long lost love, and her feelings begin to intrude on his life, changing his perceptions to a degree, and confusing the boy. Both ghost and youth have something to learn from each other in this odd little book. Cora's thoughts are rambling as she observes Evan's teen angst. This is not a Ghost and Mrs. Muir in reverse. There is no actual conversation between the ghost and human, the novel simply records how their awareness of each other changes the two. The ending is uplifting, but it takes a while to get there.Amanda Killgore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Largest Pan","review":"2 of the 3 pans were fine. Largest pan has a flat, bad spot.

Nothing J Mascis (who, for all practical purposes IS Dinosuar Jr.) has done before or since is even remotely as interesting. Fans of Neil Young and Crazy Horse will recognize the grooves; alternating between heavy and mellow in just the right amounts.

I'm sure some fans of the early stuff don't dig this album as much, but now that DJ is active again, this could really be considered the mid-years. Another all-time fave of mine is \\"Goin' Home\\".

Not to say it overshadows his earlier or later work. This album is the best album of the 90's because it's brillently written, produced, emotionally moving, and far more orginial than anything Kurt Cobain could have done. It saddens me that during our now \\"Best Of-ing\\" of the 90's J Mascis is always overlooked. Mascis is the one of the greatest songwriters of all time. He is in Tom Waits league. The song Get Me is one the of the greatest songs ever. Period. Where you been should be in everyone's collection. Mascis's music personifies what deep self-closure is all about.

Mr. Stracher has captured the fascination, tedium, excitement and exploitation of the law business in a well-written, crisply-paced narrative of life at a large New York City legal firm/factory. As a lawyer, I found the book an interesting insight into a high-powered world and also an anxious reminder of my own past experiences. A must-read for anyone contemplating a career in law."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stracher's Complaints - All the Whining Without the Raw Liver","review":"Stracher's book is a fairly boring whine-fest. He comes across as a silly young man, who went from college to law school without stopping to take the time to determine if law school was right for him. Then, after law school, off he immediately went to take a job as an associate at an enormous law firm, and was ultimately surprised to find himself miserable. Stracher's insights into the world of law are mundane and simple. It takes him three years to figure out he took the wrong job. He (and the reader) would have been much better served if he had engaged in some introspection prior to applying to law school, and again prior to taking a job, instead of thoughtlessly following a path, and then whining that he doesn't like where he has found himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing account of the mythical \\"big-firm lawyer\\".","review":"As a staff employee at a major Philadelphia law firm, I found that Double Billing provides an insightful and accurate account of what big-firm lawyers do, why they do it, and who ultimately benefits from their long hours. Stracher writes a non-fiction work that reads like a novel, presents complex legal issues in a easily understandable manner, and allows the reader to pass her own judgement on the subject he writes on. Is it all worth it? Stracher's book allows the reader to make that decision with a solid grounding in the reality of the modern corporate law firm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stracher is an overpaid whiner, but he writes well.","review":"As a first year law student at NYU considering a career in a large firm, I put Double Billing on my Christmas list. I received it and started reading right away.At first I was impressed, but after a while I got disgusted with the whiny quality that pervades it. Big firm life may be hellish, but that's what the big paychecks are for. Listening to Stracher whine and snivel about his long hours and lack of positive reinforcement gets old fast, especially when you think of the many overworked and UNDERpaid workers in this country, many of whom labor in jobs that actually put their health or lives at risk.The book's only redeeming quality is Stracher's ability to write well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for those thinking of a legal career.","review":"As a senior associate at a large corporate law firm in Los Angeles who began his career at a large firm in New York, I can vouch for the unerring accuracy of the detail of the life of a junior associate at a large firm (right down to the smell of the Chinese food delivered late at night). Notwithstanding that every recent law school graduate appears to be an aspiring writer, Mr. Stracher is the first to actually write knowingly about the life of the junior associate. His book deserves to be read by every person considering law school and a legal career. My only criticism is that Mr. Stracher's pervasively pessimistic account, while not unwarranted, fails to give an inkling of the intellectual (and physical) rush of complex transactions and litigations that attracts a certain type of individual who is \\"addicted to the deal.\\" But that is a minor criticism.

The cover of the book bills it as an expose of \\"double billing\\" and loaded with \\"sex\\" and \\"lies.\\" The only \\"sex\\" in the book was the implied relationship between an associate and a paralegal (not even enough for a PG-13 rating). While \\"double billing\\" is implied, the author never explains who is double billing or how it is done. The fact that the main character is never able to explain why his office mate consistently bills massive amounts of hours is a good indication that the author never learned the tricks of billing during his years of practice or simply did not want to explain how.

Well Developed plots and characters?Troy Denning says Who needs 'em.This trilogy is so horrible that I have a permanent cognitive dissonance about it's existence in the EU."},{"rating":"1","title":"joiner king trilogy","review":"how can ANYONE say that the joiner king trilogy is anything other than disappointing?? obviously, most readers of these books have never read most or all of the previous novels, like i have. i've read them all. these books were gross, and the bugs were gross, and the authors have made jaina out to be an idiot. i gave this final book one star because i had to put in something. the whole set of three are not really any good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hookin' High School Kids","review":"Teaching high school poetry is tough--Emily, Walt--the classic poets scarcely inform the world of the average stoner/slacker/skater high school kid. This book will help break through and open the world of poetry to those who really need it. During five years of teaching at an alternate public high school, I bought half a dozen of these, for other teachers, for especially promising students, to replace copies boosted from the classroom.

There's a reason why it's hard to find, it hasn't been made for at least 4 years according to what I've read on the RL website. If you're a fan of this scent also, join me in writing to Ralph Lauren and ask them to bring this scent back. It's happened with other scents, maybe we can do it with this one, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather dull","review":"Of the 3 SACDs available from Cal this is the least desirable. No where near the vibrancy of the Cal/Stan Getz Sextet disc. If you like the \\"smooth jazz\\" format of contemporary Muzak you may like this. This album was recorded in 1979 vs. 1958 for the Sextet album. Latin + Jazz is the second best disc, this a weak third."},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy is okay","review":"The deal is, you have this neopet you have to take care of. You need to feed it about three times a day and they like to play with their toys. You also have to make sure your neopet doesn't get sick (this will hardly ever happen if you feed it enough). You play games to earn neopoints and you use the points to buy things for your neopet.This game has a few flaws. It gets boring pretty easily and there isn't much you can do with your neopet. All you do is feed it a few times a day and earn neopoints. I would say that if you want to buyit, you should. If you're not sure whether to buy it or not, don't. A game that is better than this is: Tamagotchi which you can get for Gameboy. I would reccomend that one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I bought this toy for my little brother, as he is a big fan of Neopets. At first I was pleased, because it arrived only a few days after I ordered it, but I was very angry and disappointed when I opened the box. All the pieces were missing, rendering the toy unplayable (the batteries were also dead, not that it matters without the figures in the first place). Honestly. From the other reviews, it seems that most other people got working toys, but I'm not sure if I'd take the chance again, as this was a major waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun Fun!","review":"This game is so much fun!

It gives a vivid picture of what this trade is all about, giving you things to think about, and a variety of perspectives from many of the best pastry chefs. I can see where one reviewer is coming from in terms of saying that the book isn't well written and that the title headers don't always match the content below. The text does sometimes steer away from the topic at hand, and there are a lot of quotes right after the other without great transitions. But that doesn't take away from the benefit of this book - it was all info I was interested in reading, and for something like this it doesn't need to be a great work of prose.

They are basically illegible. The Text printing isn't much better and the Black and White drawings are also badly reprinted .

The DVD overall is a pretty decent buy (although I purchased it cheaper at Target than on Amazon). It has 2 episodes with Joe and 2 episodes with Steve. The only problems are that there are two \\"bonus episodes\\" that you have to access separately from another menu. The DVD should just play them straight through without having to stop. Also, lots of people have some sort of odd adverse reaction to Joe for some reason, so it should be more clear that the two main episodes feature Joe, not Steve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Educational and Palatable for adults","review":"These Blue's Clues videos are very educational. They are very fun and very gentle for young children. They are appropriate for ages about 18 months to about 3.My young girl who is 5 sometimes will watch them with her little brother age 3, but it is not her favorite video any more and she knows all the answers now.This one talks about shapes and colors and teaches a variety of shapes and colors in a pleasing, fun way. It encourages children to shout out answers, look for clues and use their thinking skills to solve problems all while teaching them about colors and shapes. This video also teaches colors not normally taught and how to mix other colors to get new colors. It also teaches different shapes than ones you might expect (polygon).Well worth the money.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Bad First Experience","review":"Having moved overseas when my son was 8 months old, I have been pretty oblivious to what Blue's Clues was. Now that he's 18 months, I ordered this DVD to help him learn about shapes and colors. It's not a bad introduction to the world of Blue's Clues. I remember baby sitting children during the hey-days of Barney and I found Blue's Clues much more palatable. As for my son, he loves it and bops around to the songs and watches the guy as he names the shapes. It does keep his interest so definitely a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for learning shapes and colors!","review":"This is my 24-month old daughter's first Blue video, and she loves it! The focus on shapes and colors is very appropriate for her age, and she has become quite good at naming them since she began watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love Joe!","review":"My two-year-old loves Blue's Clues. She has seen episodes with both Joe and Steve on the show and she honestly can't tell the difference. She definitely likes Joe better because she even calls Steve \\"Joe\\"!My daughter really enjoys this DVD about Shapes and Colors. It has really helped her to recognize more shapes and get her colors down right. She loves to watch these episodes over and over again!If your child loves Blue's Clues with the colorful images and cute songs, then he/she will definitely love this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New host \\"Joe\\" is TERRIBLE!","review":"My son refused to watch this! He cried through 15 minutes of it until I put on an older Blue's Clues that had the regular host, \\"Steve\\". I had to return it.Be careful! The new \\"Joe\\" dvds say \\"Steve Burns\\" on them, but read the whole description, and look for any mention of \\"Joe\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come back, Steve!","review":"My younger sons (ages 3 yrs and 19 months at this writing) live for Blue's Clues. My older son (now 10) and two nephews (now 8 and 5) grew up with Steve and Blue). But the \\"Joe\\" videos make my kids run away - the youngest screams whenever he so much as hears \\"Joe\\"'s voice. He's just plain creepy, albeit in a wholesome yet moronic way.Of course, this is just a caveat against the \\"Joe\\" factor - if your kids can get past the creepiness of this pale shadow of Steve Burns, the episodes themselves are pretty good - pretty much the standard BC fare. But if this pretender to the Blue throne makes your children cry and your teeth grind and intestines clench and such, then stick to the USDA Certified Steve episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's helping my child to talk","review":"These shows are designed to be repeated once a day for a week before showing another episode. That repetition is what helps the children learn the topics covered. I have a two-year-old boy whose speech is a little behind.

The setting & characters are interesting but the storyline is weak (could be sharper, crisp) & gradually loses the reader's interest. I read this one off & on for months."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good first attempt","review":"Gotham Diaries was a slow and painful read. They told a story, drawing the outline, but never really painting the picture. It was neither descriptive nor imaginative.The main character, Lauren, was a total bore. They wrote her up in this pathetic victim role, but not once did I feel for her, empathize with her. She was beyond naive; she was plain stupid. The small glimmering hope was that in the end she would evolve and learn something, but they dashed and mutilated that one opportunity to redeem the book.Manny was the one character with which I sympathized and they totally scapegoated and reemed him. He is the only character that popped amongst the one-dimensional cast. He made great observations and had the only deep introspective moments, but they shafted his growth in a failed attempt to make Lauren, Ms. Victim, look better.The ending was as bad as the rest of the book. The characters were in the exact same place they started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Entertaining...Extremely Disappointing","review":"This is a quick \\"beach\\" read and nothing more. It appears as though a few choice words were selected as the \\"Vocabulary\\" and utilized throughout the book in hopes of making it appear an \\"intelligent\\" read. The scenes are thin because the authors failed to maximize on the \\"Gotham\\" backdrop. They also offered little insight into the true inner workings of the black bourgeois except for the usual stereotypes. The plot is weak, the characters lack depth and the book overall is deficient of substance. I purchased the book at a B&N and expected a better editing job for the money I spent. My rating of two out of five stars is generous. I expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I gave this book one star only because there's no option to give zero stars. This book was so poorly written it wasn't even interesting. Thank goodness for libraries! One has to assume that it got published only because one of the authors is the wife of Spike Lee. If you want to read a truly excellent novel about the black upper crust, try \\"Emperor of Ocean Park\\". It's a fluid, beautifully written, compelling story, with a final chapter that takes your breath away."},{"rating":"1","title":"In need of serious editing","review":"this book has a lot going for it, but it's in need of some cutting and pasting, in my opinion. Did it have an editor? It reads to me like someone rushed it into print and didn't take the time to read it through and smooth it out.I did like the tone of the book, and the dialogue, and there is something unique about it. But there is something missing, something that makes it feels as if it just falls short of being really good.I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book....sorry","review":"I bought this book discounted, and am still upset with the amount of money I spent on it. Simply put, This book was not good. The characters were not realistic or developed at all. The story line was contrite, and juvenile. You would think with two authors, the twist and turns in the book would be more interesting, but it seemed to make the book more confusing and unreal. If these ladies wanted to set a standard in the literary world, they sadly missed their mark. I don't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about a SLOW starter...","review":"I'm sorry but I could only give this book 1 star...and even that was giving it too much. This book was not only a slow starter, but the story was staid and never really pulled me in. I only read it to the end so as to not waste my money - even though it had already been wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Moved, its OK","review":"This novel is soooo \\"dishy\\" and midway thru the plot became predictable. No disrespect but I was not moved by the characters or the plot. In fact I thought all the characters except 2 of them...Trenton and the \\"dl\\" rapper interesting and worthy of a book of their own. I am glad that the authors cashed on their \\"celebrity\\" to hype this book cause I would not encourage anyone to buy this one. This is definitely a summer-vacation book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic Duo","review":"This is an exciting first novel. With colorful characters such as Lauren and Ed Thomas also Manny Marks.

Tandy, Manny, Trenton and all other characters you deserved better authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!","review":"Gotham Diaries is absolutely a waste of time and money. I won't waste any more of my time writing a full review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edith Wharton????","review":"I was excited to read Tanya Lewis Lee's new book, the Gotham Diaries. I was sure it would be intelligent and eye-opening, the ladies were even compared to Edith Wharton on the jacket cover. All I can say is, I was very dissapointed. This book is loaded with cliches and sterotypes. Every white person in the book is stupid and annoying. The men are cheaters, the gay guys are superficial, the women care only about their looks and how they appear socially. The characters are all one-dimensional. Lauren the beautiful second wife of Ed the philandering billionaire, Tandy the aging socialite and Manny the gay guy trying to rise up in the world. These characters are unlikable, except for Lauren. You feel like you don't care what happens to them. Books like these can be a lot of fun, unfortunately the story is boring, the characters are lame, and the writing is extremely poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost interesting","review":"Ralph Lauren, Chanel, Gucci. Oh my! If I wanted designers I'd go to the mall. I don't need to know who made the office furniture and I don't need to know how Tandy's private parts were held while she was being waxed. I think one big flaw of the book was that the authors assumed that the reader wants extreme details of mundane events. Lee also included gross details that were just TMI- \\" his thick black spit\\" \\"her lip print on the window.\\" The book just didn't come together visually. Details are great, but save them for when it adds something to the story. I also felt that a lot of the side characters were under developed and were left overexaggerated to make up for their lack. This book is an easy, shallow, and mildly vapid read. Only read it if you're in to that. Otherwise, you can do like me and return it to the sale bin. Honestly, I expected better- as should you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got to page 25..............","review":"I'm sorry, but this book was just plain boring. I had high expectations, maybe too high. It became a chore to continue to the next page, beginning as early as Chapter Three. Nothing about the writing, characters, pacing, or dialogue grabbed me.

The plot was tight, thecharacters interesting and the book gave details only insiders would know.Even though you knew the good girl was going to win in the end, the journeyto the end was still a lot of fun.Lewis Lee and McCrary Anthony are a great writing team and I am lookingforward to their next installment.

Boy was I disappointed, I don't even know what to say about this book. Except I gave 2 stars 1 for each author."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Atmosphere","review":"The word \\"Gotham\\" suggests atmosphere which the book could have used more of in my opinion. Consistently in the book lines like \\"the restaurant was fabulous\\" or \\"the hotel was opulent\\" were used. Little attempt was made to transport you, to put you in the room, to truly paint the picture as it were. Atmosphere could have made it more understandable, at a visceral level, why the life is so attractive. Instead, a rational approach was used (i.e. name dropping of expensive cars, clothing, etc) which I found to be sterile, reading almost like a brochure or catalog at times. And one pet peeve: did girlfriend (Lauren) actually order a Green Apple Martini? That's just tacky. Would a billionaire's wife with her background, who has been exposed to so much, order such a thing? Stick with the classics: Cosmopolitans, Gin or Vodka Martinis, Manhattans (and of course Bloody Marys during Sunday brunch)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If at first you don't succeed.....","review":"I found this book very difficult to finnish. It started out pretty interesting however by the second/third chapter it became very hard to finnish. The characters were given great introductions however they were not fully developed until the very end. I would say the beginning and the ending of the book was great.If you can get to the ending you will be quite pleased. I am sure readers would like to know what Manny and Tandy are doing since their betrayal to Lauren. I understand that this book could be made into a series somewhat like Soul Food. If so it would be a mega hit!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didnt Get It???","review":"I didnt completely understand this movie.

It begins with a gripping descrition of sabateur hero Ian Macomber narrowly cheating almost certain death, and keeps up the pace in this unabridged story of four men's struggle against huge odds.

But my order was for a set of 4 and only one piece was sent...no explanation. When I went back to Amazon to see if I ordered the correct item, the item description said that it was out of stock and availability not known.

The one star isn't for the item, the one I got was solid, zesty and well able to handle the corn within. There was no problem with it at all. The problem (and subsequent uno star accordance) is because I ordered and paid for four (I guess I could say fore, for four but that would be silly). Amazon credited me of course, but the supplier did not have the other three so I couldn't reorder. Next time I'll order 7 and pay for 3 in hopes they'll ship the other four to a landing zone close to my place or further out. But then again I am very happy with the plastic ones I now have because the look like crystal from a distance, so I keep them on top of my television (next to my stainless-steel salad waggers) to impress my guests, which are few and far between."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiration!","review":"Finally, a Silk Painting book that inspires you to create your own pieces! Too many how-to books are very short on the nitty-gritty and just show case the author's designs.

This is coming from three college educated people who have put many a pain in the neck item together in their time! Be advised that this item is not worth the inexpensive price by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I can safely say that this was the single most worthless item that I have ever purchased on the internet. This includes Amazon, Ebay, Etsy, Walmart, K-Mart, Home Depot, Sears, Macy's, JC Penney's, and the list goes on and on!!!!!PLEASE don't be tempted to purchase this item based on a few positive reviews.

The metal is light weight & this would prevent any shifting from wind & weather.

When I was assembling it, some of the screws stripped the holes and couldn't be tightened. Also the screws and nuts of the top piece won't tighten enough to keep the parts from twisting. I had my boyfriend who is very knowledgeable of assembling furniture and lawn items help me. Even with very expensive Snap On tools, and buying new quality screws and nuts it just isn't worth it. I will probably have him weld all the joints together, but even then that won't solve the akwardness of the three legs. There needs to be a brace or bottom part to connect the three legs. Without any bracing, the whole unit is very flimsy, even when the legs are planted in the ground. I suppose he can weld some sort of support for the bottom legs but for crying out loud, I expected more for my money than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this price correct","review":"Is this oil really 52 dollars for enough oil to make a one gallon mix.

It has no heart or soul, just a dull, dry list of reminders. There's also little in the way of staying organized, unless you go back to each list on a daily basis.

It even explains the subtle difference between Pelican, Puffin and Toucan crossings. This has nothing to do with birds and even the British have trouble keeping them straight.HOWEVER.... Don't pay big bucks for this 1999 edition. The new 2005 edition sells in Britain for 1.99 pounds (less than $4.00.)

There were fat jokes in \\"Tommy Boy,\\" but here, they're in every scene, and I felt bad for Chris Farley being the butt of the joke again and again. Perhaps a few weight jokes are tolerable, but after the 38th time, it just becomes boring and kind of depressing. Skip this film and watch \\"Tommy Boy\\" again.

However, some apparitions/seers have been given approval by their local Bishops, such as Betania and Akita, and I would say that they have been de facto approved, if not yet fully promulgated, by the Church.I now realize--more so than I did when I wrote the book--that miracles, seers, mystics etc. are a sometimes, nay, ofttimes dicey subject. \\"Signs and wonders\\" aren't always from God.

I have a Homedics scale right next to the the Tanita and the Homedics is always consistent. The Tanita body fat % varies by 20% depending on how warm my feet are, whether I took a shower prior or used the hot tub. Somehow the Homedics is consistent regardless of these factors. Of course I don't have the box and I can't return this useless scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expected...","review":"I am a little disappointed, because I read so many positive reviews about accuracy n'stuff. The only accurate measure I found was the body weight. The Body Fat and metabolic age varies 10-15% from morning to afternoon check. The Visceral Fat varies 1 to 2 points and the Physique Rating varies 1 to 3 points. It a little hard for some one to digest that in the morning you are 50 years and in the afternoon 42.For a regular weighing kitchen scale is ok, the other measurements are only for fun not accuracy.Therefore, a little overpriced for a kitchen scale.P.

It just says \\"error\\" on the LCD screen when we attempt to use it.If that wasn't bad enough, when I called Tanita to inquire about a return or repair, they told me that I have to pay for shipping an 10lb scale from California to Illinois. Again, this is AFTER paying over a hundred dollars for one of their products.When I tried contacting The Competitive Edge-the vendor that actually sold the scale, they shrugged and said it's Tanita's problem.

I purchased this and compared the results vs my Body Fat Test at the Dr Office - and this device was off considerably ! I also purchased a Taylor Branded Body Fat Analyzer that apparently offers the same technology to measure body fat - and it was extremely close to the results that I received from my Dr.I also question the additional \\"Innerscan\\" body percentages. When I called Tanita Customer Service, they could not justify Bone, Muscle Mass, and Metabolic Age readings and were extremely vague in the interpretation of the features.Even though Tanita was the first to offer Body Fat Monitors...I would say first is not best !"},{"rating":"2","title":"An above average monitor","review":"I have found this to be a very good monitor. I replaced a Sony 17\\" with this Compaq and find that it displays a good crisp picture across the entire viewing area. Corners are in focus and there are ample adjustments on the front of the CRT. I have made adjustments that stay the course. My display has not changed since I made the original setup. I run it at 1024X768, vertical at 85Hz and Horizontal at 68.6k. I don't use the speakers because I have my own sound system. It is not the top of the line but close to it. Four (4) stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed potential","review":"I must echo the comments of others about the shortcomings of this book. While not every author can be Alice Walker, there were just too many flaws--underdeveloped characters; more descriptions of clothing than about the characters; awkward and misguided metaphors; little or no character motivation; and some of the most grossly detailed, unromantic, and all-too frequent descriptions of sex I have ever read...and I'm no prude. It was sad that the author could describe a pair of pumps in more sensual detail than a sexual interlude. Worst of all, a tragic incident on the ship gets waved away and then lost in the turgid, tangent-filled dialogue. There were even misspellings. The book read like a sixth-rate imitation of Waiting to Exhale. There are just too many good African American writers in this genre--take Connie Briscoe, for instance--to accept substandard fare such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun In The Sun","review":"I don't care what anyone says about this book, it was an excellent read. The way the author describes the ship is wonderful especially for those who have never been on a cruise ship before. Miles was immature, but came around towards the end. Why Mia puts up with his nonsense was a question I had in the back of my mind. But when you love someone, that love can make you do some real stupid things. I truly believe there should be a sequel. I want to know more about the captian and the cruise director. Also, do Mia and Miles last?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much","review":"I like to applaud those that take a step out on faith to do something that they really enjoy, but this book is a bit much. I feel as if I wasted the 13.95 that I spent on it. There was just entirely too much detail for my taste. No connecting storyline between the characters and not enough interesting dialogue. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Character Development","review":"The premise of this book sounded great but because there was a lack of character development it was hard to understand what motiviated some of the characters. The author went overboard in her description of every single detail of the cruise and the settings instead of focusing more on the characters. There was also an overabundance of primary characters making it hard to keep track of who was who. I thought the book was okay, but would have a hard time recommending it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"...less storytelling...","review":"If you've never been on a cruise before, you're definitely in for an awakening when you read The Chocolate Ship. Ms. Monteilh describes everything on this cruise, right down to the crests that were monogrammed on the plates and glasses. In fact, this book was way too descriptive for me - the book itself was over 300 pages with 47 chapters - and maybe only five to six chapters of actual storytelling. The two main characters, Mia and Miles, had a relationship that seemed very strained because of her insecurities, something that continues through the end of the book.You see other relationships in this book formed, broken and reassembled; however, the storyline could have been better had there not been so much description and explanation of everyone and of everything. -JN"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true writer","review":"A book about love on the high seas. I enjoyed the book from cover to cover, it is a great book. A writer with great vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay read","review":"This book sounded very interesting with the whole first black cruise ship idea. There were too many characters and too much sex that had nothing to do with the plot.

The style the book was written in was quite confusing and I would not recommend this book for a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $5.99!","review":"This article categorically is not worth the $6 it cost to view it.

I was amazed by the depth of these characters and the actors skill in portraying them. Frankly I was inspired and wanted to learn more. The very next day I went to the library and began to research information about Byron, Percy and Mary. After learning more about these poeple I felt that the director did a excellent job in capturing their true essence. Exposure to their lives and work has helped to improve my own.

It is large and has a large opening. Good for adults and kids. It's cute too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil!","review":"Considering the date I think it's only fitting I review a Mercyful Fate album. I'd always held King Diamond's solo stuff above Mercyful Fate being that I'm a horror fan and love the idea of using heavy metal music to tell spooky stories. I've never been too crazy about Fate lyrically. Musically it's fantastic. The thing is, singing about the devil repeatedly just loses it's punch after awhile. When Diamond ressurected Mercyful Fate and recorded In The Shadows, he must have still had a little of his solo self lingering coz there isn't much satanism to be found. Instead we have some dark occult themes and a few little spooktales as well. The satanic angle would resurface with the next few albums, but the music has never suffered. Excellent stuff, but you already knew that, didn't you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What do YOUR shadows hold?","review":"Shadows has a few stories on it, all of them dark.There is the Headless Horseman theme with a graphic twist missing from the Legend of Sleepy Hollow, and you feel as if you were the one caught this year. The Bell Witch is another of those sad-but-true things, a legend of a evil spirit that kills in a certain family. As ever, King has great vocals, convincing voices, and knows his stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent musicianship and song structure; same KD vocals!","review":"This along with King Diamond's \\"Abigail\\" are two of the finest examples of modern heavy metal music. Unfortunately, with the demise of heavy metal from mainstream popularity, there are not very many good bands left in the genre. This CD also represents Mercyful Fate's much needed departure from overwrought satanic imagery. The only downside of this CD, like every other Mercyful Fate/King Diamond CD is KD's voice. It has a tendency to really irritate you. If you have a listen to the Mercyful Fate covers on Metallica's Garage Days, you realize how much better the songs are with a James Hetfield type performing the vocal duties. If not for KD's voice, this CD would warrant 5-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Some Okay Moments.","review":"This album starts off pretty well with the opener \\"Egypt,\\" but pretty much loses momentum after that song for the most part. The songs aren't that magnetic or attractive. I do admit that the lyrics are quite interesting, especially the ones to \\"The Bell Witch.\\" The different version of \\"The Return of the Vampire\\" is also okay. Most of In the Shadows is quite forgettable though. As always, the musicianship is better-than-good, it's just that the songwriting doesn't quite hit the mark. King Diamond does well with his vocals as always. I actually rate this album two-and-a-half stars. \\"Egypt\\" is the best track; it sounds like it could have been on a King Diamond album sound-wise. Mercyful Fate on the whole sounds a little different than the King Diamond material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this music serious","review":"I feel that I need to have all my predispositions of heavy music temporarily suspended to listen to this seriously. Without being in this state, this CD is just there, a monotone of metal cliche. -enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"IN THE SHADOWS rocks, bigtime!","review":"Forget about the wussy commercial metal that was just going out of vogue at the time, IN THE SHADOWS is the real heavy metal deal, with Fates Warning-like precision and grandeur and dark, supernatural (not really Satanic anymore) lyrics that are imbued with a wicked sense of humor. Fans of the early work will not be disappointed; newcomers may wish to collect MF's earlier work before picking this one up to get a feel for King Diamond's vocal style. Standouts include \\"Egypt,\\" a continuation of sorts to \\"Curse of the Pharoahs,\\" \\"The Bell Witch\\" (based on a true story), \\"The Old Oak,\\" and \\"Is That You, Melissa?\\", a continuation of \\"Melissa,\\" from MELISSA. All in all, this is a very good heavy metal record, and also a very good progressive metal record with a huge sense of grandeur and explosive time changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shuts off after 10-15 minutes","review":"Same as everyone else- the tv shuts itself off after a few minutes now.

Teddy Roosevelt's son kept a great record of his adventures through the middle east, France and Germany as he fought in WWI. His writing style is very matter of fact, and his descriptions of the surroundings are sometimes very clear and other times very vague. It really reads more like a personal journal than a war story, and he leaves out a great deal about the fighting itself. He tends to sum it up very matter of factly by stating how bad the fighting was on a particular day and nothing else. He goes into great detail about the people he meets (including Colonel Lawrence of Lawrence of Arabia fame, for example) It's not terribly well written but it's certainly not boring. It's very interesting, and a great buy for anyone who wonders what it was like to be on the ground during the Great War."},{"rating":"1","title":"False premises","review":"The main problem with this book is that it rests on the author's quirky insistence that Atlantis sank in 1200 BC. This does not agree with Edgar Cayce or Plato, or any of the scholars that have devoted years of study to uncovering historical information about Atlantis.Joseph follows Plato's guidance and places Atlantis in the vicinity of the Atlantic Ridge, but there is no evidence that a large portion of the Atlantic Ridge was above the surface after 10,000 B.C. and a great deal of proof that some of it was above the surface before that time.He ignores the Cayce Readings that distinctly name dates and changes some of the Readings to reflect his ideas.

Kirk will return!!!!!!!","review":"This is by far my least favorite of the Star trek movies. The plot is stupid, a man is trying to get back to la la land and dosen't care how many people he kills in the process. Also they bring back Captain Kirk to kill him so he was just kind of thrown in there, he is not relevant to the story. Kirk's death is not at all worthy, he falls and is buried by some rocks. His supposed death on the Enterprise B was much better than his actual one. I wouldn't hate this movie so much if William Shatner's book The Return had been made into a movie right after (if you have not read it I highly recomend that you do). But if you must kill Kirk do it RIGHT or better yet don't kill him at all!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SPACE JUNK","review":"How many times do we have to watch the Enterprise D crash, or listen to Data's babble and endure the silly plot. The interaction between Kirk and Picard is limited, and the bad guy gets little time to develop his character.This one set the tone for awful TNG films that followed: third-rate scripts devoid of any central idea. Contrast this space junk to Wrath of Khan, Voyage Home and the Undiscovered Country, which embodied the spirit of the original series (an idea per episode) that were translated on to the big-screen with decent scripts, some drama, mixed with a bit of humor.Indeed, the last episode of the TNG \\"all good things\\" should have been saved for the big screen.One would think someone could have thought of a better use of Stewart's acting talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy big screen debut for the Next Generation crew","review":"With Star Trek VI sending off the entire classic Trek crew, Star Trek Generations is the big screen debut of the Next Generation crew and also gives fans something most have always wanted to see: the crossover between both eras. Although the storyline is hokey, it has elements of the original series, and seeing Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) in the same frame together is more than worth watching this film for alone. The special effects are great as well, including the sequence where the Next Generation-era Enterprise crash lands on a planet's surface, and the presence of Whoppi Goldberg and Malcolm McDowell in pivotal roles add to the film. All in all, Star Trek Generations is a nice big screen debut for the Next Gen crew, and would pave the way for the best film to feature the crew with Star Trek: First Contact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Dreck","review":"Timewarp, if you will, back to December, 1994. \\"Windows 95\\" was merely an ugly rumor, \\"Hammer\\" still had a career, and Paramount studios, in a blatant attempt to add another cash car to the Star Trek money train, unleashed the movie: \\"Star Trek: Generations\\". A film bereft of any original ideas at all, it suffered from the same problem so many \\"Next Generation\\" episodes had; that is, the ending was pre-determined (Kirk must die in order to neuter the original cast out of any more motion pictures), so all events leading up to the ending seem especially forced and uninspired. We watched both Data and Picard break down and cry. Troi steered the Enterprise-D into the side of a planet. Kirk died in the worst death scene of all time. This movie completely sucked the momentum out of Star Trek and left the motion picture portion of the franchise in limbo.

It's weak plot (Madman wants to kill millions so that he can jump into heaven) yeah I'm sure there was a point to that, but it's lost on me.

Just a small thought of mine and I hope in the future that they will release a version with the trailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Least Favorite Star Trek Movie","review":"First, let me give the pluses. This movie was a bridge between the Star Trek casts. It also hit science fiction at its best with the Nexus utopia, shown to be pleasant but not the best. Malcolm McDowell was a good villain, though not at Alex DeLarge (A Clockwork Orange) proportions.The strength of each of the Star Trek incarnations is a great ensemble. There is some heirarchy, but you still have a team feeling. This movie does not develop either the original or the Next Generation ensembles. The focus is only on three characters: Captain Kirk (William Shatner), Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart), and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), who took the mentor role in this story. There are only short appearances from the original cast, and only enough interaction of the Next Generation cast to show they're there.There were other ways one could have bridged the gap that could have been better and more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame & Pointless","review":"Basically a re-make of The Final Frontier (#5;1989) but with the NG crew rather than the original series crew. Should any reader of this review come across this movie again, notice the likenesses: The Nexus versus the Great Barrier, and Soran the Madman versus Sybok the Madman. As for \\"uniting\\" the two ENTERPRISE crews, it of course failed because Spock and some others declined to take part. Moreover, the first crew gave its farewell in The Undiscovered Country and the Enterprise-D crew would fare just fine on its own in First Contact (with the sleeker if smaller Enterprise-E). Also, McCoy, Spock, and Scott (who for some reason did not sit out that token cameo role) already made appearances in one television series episode (Encounter at Farpoint I, Unification II, Relics). Therefore, why bother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why'd it get pulled?","review":"I was looking forward to adding this to my collection of other Special Edition Trek films, but suddenly it was pulled.The only reason to purchase this is for the extras, the film itself is horrid.

The death of Cap.Kirk was something to be told. The 7th Star Trek Motion Picture was the best opportunity to make all that happen, but they ( directors and producers ) spoiled it. The two captains met in a very silly situation, without sufficient acction to keep the attention of the audience,the great Cap.Kirk's death falling down the stairs was an insult to the character; when you see the example of Cap.Sheridan's death on the last episode of Babylon5 you will see what should have been done with Kirk.

With Malcolm McDowell as the lead villain, I expected much more. But instead he is depicted as a crazed scientist with an addiction to return to a portal which only reaches availability on rare occassions.Speaking of that portal, what a joke. The whole movie is set up around it but it really isn't even something that looks to belong in the film. And trying to merge former Star Trek cast members with current ones sounds good on paper, but I believe Shatner's ego tried to steal the show on this one .... and it didn't look good.Perhaps the most unforgiving detail here is the explosion of the Klingon ship, it's the EXACT SAME SCENE from the previous Star Trek movie!

I remember seeing the original series, the parts my parents would let me, as a child. I grew up with Star Trek after school (on TV). My favorite of the movies is Star Trek 2, the Wrath of Kahn. Generations is my second favorite. It melds the original with next gen, but also does an awesome job of seeing inside the characters. I think the most poignant concept is the idea of time changing things. This is personalized by Picard, but is also a reflection of how the original Trek and the Next Gen evolve. Is time the predator that stalks us, the fire in which we burn? Is it something that makes every moment special, even though it changes everything? As an older Trekkie I found this concept important both in the series and in my own life. This is a very thoughtful movie that can be appreciated on multiple levels.

Like, most people wouldn't know who Picards brother is, or how close a friendship Picard and Guinan had. The real messed-up part was that in ST:5, Kirk says \\"I've always known I'll die alone\\" but they couldn't even live up to that in the movie, he died next to Picard.

I've seen every episode of all the series, and own the movie collection on DVD, and I have to say this is the worst thing I've seen. First off, the biggest problem is Kirk. After everything he's survived, after saving earth so many times, he dies by falling forty feet. Not too mention the storyline has pathetically cheesy, and everything was exactly like the tv show. The Enterprise D did need to be gotten rid of, due to it didn't translate well onto the big screen. But the way they destroyed her was sad.They also screwed around too much with data's emotion chip.

Don't watch this movie, just skip it and go straight to First Contact."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I might be being generous","review":"This is the first Star Trek movie where the people of the Next Generation are featured. Also a few of the original characters are involved. That is where it starts going downhill. We are introduced to the substance tri-lithium, which can kill suns. Data at last gets human emotions, and the two Captains get to work side by side.However, they turn the 1701-D into a weakling of a ship, by having it taken out by a single strike(not even a salvo, really) from an obsolete, delapidated klingon bird-of-prey/scout-class wessel (as Mr. Chekov would have called it)that was flawed while it was in service. I realize they wanted a knew set, but she should have died harder. And Admiral Kirk's death was not enough to do him justice.

I have this film on VHS as well. The compression artifacts jump out, especially in the scenes on the planet between Patrick Stewart and Malcom McDowell. The image breaks down very badly and is very distracting. It's a shame, and a bit of a mystery since the First Contact DVD is exceptionally sharp and well done. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!","review":"The plot was decent but poorly implemented. Data really got on my nerves and it distracted from the picture. Kirk was great (as usual); Pickard was also good. Gene Roddenberry would've been extremely disappointed in the drawn-out development of the story. I was falling asleep after the first 1/2 hour. I've seen all the Trek movies and this one is definitely THE PITS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Dreck","review":"Timewarp, if you will, back to December, 1994. \\"Windows 95\\" was merely an ugly rumor, \\"Hammer\\" still had a career, and Paramount studios, in a blatant attempt to add another cash car to the Star Trek money train, unleashed the movie: \\"Star Trek: Generations\\". A film bereft of any original ideas at all, it suffered from the same problem so many \\"Next Generation\\" episodes had; that is, the ending was pre-determined (Kirk must die in order to neuter the original cast out of any more motion pictures), so all events leading up to the ending seem especially forced and uninspired. We watched both Data and Picard break down and cry. Troi steered the Enterprise-D into the side of a planet. Kirk died in the worst death scene of all time. This movie completely sucked the momentum out of Star Trek and left the motion picture portion of the franchise in limbo.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best Star Trek movies yet","review":"This Movie is great,but it would be better if it were more like the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The Best Trek film. The scene with Picard and Kirk was touching. The holodeck scene makes me wish I was in the 24th centery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and maybe even a bit pretentious","review":"This \\"passing of the torch\\" from the Kirk generation to the Picard generation simply falls flat as a movie experience.It's full of plot contrivances and an insane amount of technobabble (which even the commentary admits), while holding very little dramatic punch. And (again, as the commentary admits) the scenes where Picard and Kirk are together are simply not what they should have been.Although this is not the worst Star Trek film, it's still a pretty boring movie. There are plenty of examples in this film of the kind of material that gives Star Trek a bad name. I would give an anti-recommendation to non-Trek fans (lest they think Star Trek is always like this). In fact, I can't imagine anyone but the most hardcore Trekkies even enjoying this one, despite the one or two good scenes or lines in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAR TREK at its worst","review":"This movie makes absolutely no sense within the rest of the Star Trek universe.Time after time this script forgets the history of 300+ shows and movies. The big meeting of Kirk and Picard is meaningless (after all the hype) because both have spent the whole movie completely out of character. Before making the movie I would have asked these questions:1. Why does Picard do nothing but have a pity party and feel sorry for himself?2. What does smashing the Enterprise-D add to the movie?3. If Kirk gets to spend eternity with any women he wants why did the writers pick who they did?4. Is Kirk's help (when he meets with Picard) REALLY needed? Is what he does what this legendary Captain is all about?Buy \\"First Contact\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive JKA Shotokan Karate Series","review":"For anyone seriously interested in Japanese Shotokan Karate this series is a must. The kata are superbly demonstrated, with explanations and applications clear and unequivocal. It is easy to see from the video why the JKA enjoys its formidable reputation. As an invaluable source of reference, this should be a part of every Martial Artist's library. There is now no longer any excuse for misunderstandings or variations in kata, brought about by misinterpretation. The wealth of knowledge and expertise of Japan's finest, is now available for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Informational Read","review":"In my quest to gain biographical information on the six wives of Henry VIII for historical novel purposes, Ms. Bruce's book on Henry VIII's second wife was one of the first to which I turned. Though it is difficult to prove a great many facts about Anne Boleyn, what Ms. Bruce has written is well supported by gripping evidence. Her extensive travel and study has rewarded her readers with a deep sense of knowledge concerning the knight's daughter-made-Queen and a good understanding of the rise and fall of Queen Anne. However, Ms. Bruce's biography has been succeeded by more recent works on Anne Boleyn, and the date of the studies conducted may point a reader in search of the hard facts in a different direction. Still, Bruce's \\"Anne Boleyn\\" is a wonderful and well-written source."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can create your own 40- to 50-minute workout.","review":"This is an excellent addition to the collection. I sometimes will do one of these after a longer workout, or, I will do 3-5 of them as is to create my own workout. The abs workout is great. Not too intense to scare you, yet certainly an abs builder. The kicking one covers about everything. The arms workout is good. Combo is a good warmup. The power is insane. It will push you. But by far the best part is the punch and knee. It's 10 minutes that's both fun, challenging, and rewarding. I don't think you'll be sorry about getting this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I gave this four stars because there is nothing in stretching, but if you want to mix it and really sweat this is a great DVD.

You can't even select let's say 4 of the eight workouts then take them. You have to do them one on one. This is a cheap video. The people look tired in the video and the even Shelly doesn't seem to be as energized. No one knew what Billy was doing even the people in the video. It is so no taebo like for part of the videos. It was like he ran out of money, made this video with people who half heartedly were doing the moves. The people looked tired is all I can say. This was a waste of money. For a real taebo video check out the ultimate taebo. Billy has got to do better in the future if he wants to keep his following.What a disappointment. I will think twice about the next video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I have been a avid follower of Billy Blanks since his first DVD and this one was not worth the time or money since there is no warm up and breaking up to 10 minute segments doesn't work!

Eight different and challenging work outs that you can mix however you want. Billy Blanks is a really motivating and inspiring person, and I like the fact that the people on this dvd are normal looking and some even make mistakes too, which in most other workout dvds the people are annoyingly perfect and too \\"smiley.\\" This dvd is perfect because it is hard to become bored with since you can mix up the routines.

In he social living class, we were all allowed to be honest, and open, that was truly a safe place. One of my fondest memories is recieving a letters from myself which I wrote in her class and in turn Miss Rubin would mail them to her student at the date the student requested.

Each person should have their own. of thick glass and brushed magnetic stainless steel. Its not really a screw top lid. There are two notches in the lid that goes into a grove and you turn it about a quarter of a circle to hold it on. There is no seal in the lid. Coupled with the fit of the lid, its not really going to keep everything in (good enough for me). two inches high, about 1-7/8 inch tall column of salt, pepper or whatever.

If you are a fan of horror movies, then you have to see this movie. Sure, there is a lot of gore, but it is not in the \\"Friday the 13th\\"/\\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" gore for gore's sake, but rather simply to illustrate the absurdity of the movie itself. The movie pokes fun at the entire genre, and it spares not even itself. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching a movie and knew that I had to see the movie again, so I pre-ordered this as soon as I saw it available on Amazon and watched it the night it arrived, and it did not disappoint the second time around (nor the third!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOL, oh my GAWD!","review":"I don't like showing people the trailers for this movie because I feel it gives away too much.

The scene where Dale asks the kids if they're going camping, my husband almost wet himself describing it, he was laughing so hard. I am a personal fan of Alan Tudyk (Tucker). He was Wash in Firefly.

Not for the squeamish, though. Lots and lots of blood flying everywhere. We all flinched several times - but the heroes are so sweet that they make an interesting counterpoint to the grossness.

Or maybe it wasn't a surprise. I don't really know. I was paying too much attention to that actress, Katrina Bowden, wow!It gets gory, bloody, and really stupid in places, which was a lot of fun, and hilarious, although I might have caught more of the jokes if I hadn't been paying so much attention to that actress, Katrina Bowden, wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait five minutes, then it starts to sink in...","review":"Short and sweet: if you dig physical comedy, cult-show actors, movies that not only defy convention but pill-pop jokes on genres, this movie's for you. It doesn't start that way, though -- for the first five minutes, you might consider pressing STOP 'cause, yeah, this kinda looks cheap, unaffecting like the buzz-'n-deluge of pain appearance most bouncers are expected to sport these days, but it quickly achieves its tones and shtick. Yes, it's our two protagonists against an as-yet unknown antagonist. Yes, the good guys win in the end.

Good laughs and gory deaths equals a movie well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY GRADE: B.","review":"Unlike other horror films this one spins it another direction with the question: what if the hillbillies were the victims of misunderstandings and prejudiced perceptions? What follows is a comedy horror taking potshots at all the typical horror hillbilly spoof stereotypes. Everything that goes comically wrong does go comically wrong and the hillbillies (Tucker and Dale, of course) are blamed. I'm tempted to list some funny examples but I try to avoid spoilers typically.Notable people include Alan Tudyk, Tyler Labine, Katrina Bowden.[5] and Brandon Jay McLaren (before I first saw him in \\"The Killing\\" TV series).On a scale I'd say this is funny but probably a couple of notches down from my all time favorite \\"Shaun of the Dead\\". The Box Office for this picture was a bit over $4M but I've yet to see an official budget report.HUMOR WITH HORROR: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; WHEN WATCHED: end of May 2012 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad title, good movie","review":"The title and cover are bad, but the movie is great!

All the actors did a fine job, especially Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk (he could play a terrifying bad guy in a horror flick), but seeing a man jammed into a wood chipper, another impaled on a fallen tree, and Alan Tudyk tortured isn't funny. The attempt at humor alongside these scenes were crass rather than funny. The violence in this movie was simply too extreme to think that this movie could be considered a comedy. And all the attempts at comedy kept the movie from being a decent horror movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Army of Darkness meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a Happy Ending","review":"Great movie for a Halloween party! This movie is a refreshing break from the same old story lines. It reverses the usual plot of horror films. It's equal parts slasher film, comedy of errors, feel-good buddy movie, and unexpected romance. It never gets too complicated or takes itself too seriously but keeps you entertained. The gore is not over done. In the beginning it's done as a comedy of errors and misunderstandings. Later in the movie it's a complete role reversal from the standard horror film plot. Overall it's a light, entertaining, and funny movie. Most of the violence is pratfalls with gory results. This movie is definitely not for kids and it does have it's gory/scary moments but it's almost a stretch to call it a horror film. You'll probably laugh and feel good as much as you cringe."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is GREAT!!","review":"Tucker and Dale is AMAZING! I'm very hard to please when it comes to movies.

This was a seamlessly combined creepy-funny movie, where the bad guy just keeps giving you the willies, and the two main guys (in their new vacation home!) were just... trying to be helpful.I liked the point of view taken for this movie, it was new and refreshing, and when it was finished I came away with a ridiculous fondness for it, even if I won't be watching it all the time.

I guess i could say that the mates of state make you do things you don't want to but that might make them sound like cult leaders...maybe they are. anyway i dont care because they rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must defend this record","review":"This only gets a five becuase everyone is saying it's so bad. Well it isn't, though it isn't genious rock operas like you lame asses probably like to listen to, it's just simple pop songs at their greatest. They don't try to be something they're not, this probably the most sincere thing I've ever heard. Two instruments, yet the sound is so full, how is this possible? Listen guys, don't listen to those nay-sayers for they only like complex \\"deep\\" music. I am a man who finds delight in simple things and this is a gem. This is such a catchy and simple record, how could it not be great? You people just don't get it, you expect dull songs that are epic I'm guessing. Don't listen to those \\"deal\\" kids they don't know good music, they think they do. Though this might admitably not be for everyone, it is still darn good and I will defend this record. Amen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm with deal","review":"This may be why amateur reviewers have some credibility problems, at least if they don't go into specifics. Here's a couple: repeating a fairly lame percussion riff from the first cut all thru the rest of the album doesn't cut it. And since this isn't an aggro type release, perhaps the voices should blend rather than collide. I want my $8 back."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band is so annoying!","review":"All of their songs sound the same and they are all extremely irritating, angst-ridden drivel.

I prefer stories by Stephen King, Dean Koontz, and Shirley Jackson. I have no idea how this book got my attention but outside of \\"It\\" by Stephen King...i have never read a book that came anywhere close to being as exceptional as \\"Primal Fear\\" it is intelligent, very suspenseful, mastefully crafted, completely distubing. What makes this book perfect is it's ending...i have never seen one like it.

I knew the murderer before the end of the first cassette. (unabridged edition) I hated Martin Vail. There was not a sixties stereotype left unused.

If you put it on any type of chair, particularly a plastic chair like they often have at schools- the case will slip off, and likely damage your horn.If you put it flat on the ground, fully open it, it's rock solid. Also, handle just broke, but looks like a defect in the case, not a regular design. I'm really picky--if I felt I was being jerked around, I'd say so. I would buy this again without hesitation- and it has a lifetime warrantee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits well","review":"The SKB case arrived promptly. My open wrap f valve Getzen dual bore with bullet brace fits in there very snuggly. The outside pocket seems best suited as a place for slide oil. I thought the original picture showed an orange interior, but what arrived (and what I see now ) is a very deep black. In fact, when the horn is not there, the inside is like looking into space.I am very satisfied with the fit and sturdiness of the case body, hinges, and latches. Tha handle is nicely padded."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"P4P\\".","review":"Even after all these years, it's still hard not to compare this debut to \\"Jane's Addiction\\". I mean, half the band is the same, and the music is alike in many ways. It's like comparing \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" to \\"Zwan\\". \\"Porno For Pyros\\" might not be as mindblowing, but they're still a great, creative, rockin' group. I still play this often. It includes the hit \\"Pets\\", plus \\"Cursed Male\\", \\"Cursed Female\\", and \\"Black Girlfriend\\". \\"Orgasm\\" is a nice closer too. It's hard to say if this is better than their other album \\"God's Good Urge\\", but it's at least as good. There's also the album \\"Rev\\", which is the best of \\"Jane's Addiction\\" AND \\"Porno For Pyros\\" if you want that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sh!t","review":"I bought the CD used this past year. I was not entirely dissappointed but not thrilled.

As for this CD? I expect a lot more from this group."},{"rating":"1","title":"One awesome song...","review":"I can't believe that none of these reviews mention the song \\"Cursed Female\\".

These are the stupidest lyrics ever and really take away any enjoyment you might gain from some of the percussion work (which is why I'm giving this one two stars instead of one). I've tried to listen to this album several times over the years and cringe each time Perry sings. He screeches rather than sings. His worst work ever in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"I wanted to kill myself and everyone else around me when i heard this CD. It is the absolute worst CD that I have ever heard. It is not catchy, it has no sense of time, the lyrics absolutley suck, and so does the band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martians will do better than we've done...","review":"It pisses me off when people sit back and whine about bands breaking up and going on to do other things. It's obvious Perry didn't want to make another Jane's Addiciton and step away from it. Like when the Beatles broke up and went on to do other projects everyone complains that they never did anything as good as when they were togethor. Apparently they don't get what each member has been able to pull of on their own. This album has great lyrics. \\"Pets\\",\\"Packin .25\\",and \\"Sadness\\". Obviously people don't get it. This isn't for the whiny Goths and the bratty Punks that loved Jane when they rocked out or became a utopia of dream-like music. This is more for the people who can understand where Perry is coming from and know how right he is when he says \\"we'll make great pets\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such an amazing record!","review":"Of COURSE Jane's Addiction was the best, but this 1st P4P album is beautiful. I like it so much because of several elements:1) Of course Stephen Perkins' drumming is SO wicked and has more exotic percussion than when he played with JA (ie- more finesse, less rock), 2) Peter DiStefano's electric guitar style is so ethereal, he creates amazing soundscapes, BUT also has amazing funk appeal.3)Martyn LeNoble on bass is such a perfect fit because he drops a Spanish, majestic groove to the rhythm section.. and of course4) Perry's voice sounds great, his lyrics are very poetic/beautiful, his harmonica playing is actually a good thing and sparse, and his whistling is in perfect spots!To sum up, this is an awesome album of ethereal funk infused rock, with Spanish majestic feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"jammin","review":"yup- we all know this album and what a score for $5!

In addition, Halford launches into unheraleded classics such As \\"Light Comes out of Black\\" and \\"Silent Screams\\" Rob also mixes in the best of his fight days with \\"Nailed To The Gun\\" and \\"Into the Pit\\"......through in a few never heard studio tracks including a ripper titled \\"Scream IN the Dark\\" and you have everything a Priest/Halford fan could ask for.....This release is definetly aimed at Priest/Halford conasuers...so if you remember drving in your Mustang,With The Hair Long, a Cigerette in Mouth, a Girl in Zip Around Jeans in the Passenger seat, and blasting Screaming For Vengence on The Casette Player...buy this album and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big deal......","review":"Halford forms a new outfit, release a studio album and then a live album.....

There are no transitions between songs that places you at the concert. It is simply a set of recordings from several concerts put on two CDs. That's the best news. Most of the CD sounds overdubbed and [unoriginal]. Listen to the crowd - clearly there are additional dubbs of crowd noise that goes from very loud to almost silent in a fraction of a second. Listen to Robs voice - sounds like, at many times, layers of vocals were added.The net result is an average collection of greatest hits almost live. I much prefer the Live Meltdown CD because it sounds live with lots of crowd excitement. This is how a live CD should sound.One last note - where are \\"The Ripper\\" or \\"Green Manalishi\\" or \\"Diamonds and Rust\\"?

There isn't a single Two song on here, so I don't know why the editorial review says that he covers his career with Two b/c he doesn't. If anyone thinks I'm wrong, look up Two:Voyeurs, and look at the track list and try to find one song from that CD which is Two's only CD on this CD. Read that carefully and it'll make sense.

The author's language and style really jump in your face and nearly knock you out (yeah, bad pun, I know). I don't know if it was intentional, but each story made me want just a little bit more. I don't need happy endings as a reader, as a matter of fact I don't always need an ending, but I got lost between a few of the stories. Would really love to see how Lavalle use his abilities to make words move in a complete novel -- he has great talent and I'm guessing I'll read much of his work in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barebones Writer Too Lean for My Taste","review":"I looked forward to this collection because of the comparisons the publishers (read: marketing department) made to Sherman Alexie and Junot Diaz--two quite accomplished young writers. I breezed through the collection rather quickly (it is that short and uncomplicated) and realized that this pseudo-minimalism relies heavily on \\"voice\\" or \\"attitude\\" rather and not much on the textures (such as landscape and history) that have made Alexie and Diaz favorites among the critics. The voices in these stories suffer from lack of bodies, ungrounded to the rich soil that is New York. At first I thought this was done deliberately, perhaps a commentary on the disenfranchised or the displaced persons. But by the end I knew that this writer needed one more year of graduate school to polish this project.

I never expected such a frustration with this book.Perhaps the trader did try to make this book as a day trader's manual by including everything he deemed fit into a 322 page book: trading psychology, rules drawn from his own experience, chaos theory and in particular many TA tools like Market Profile, Elliot Wave, Gann Fan, RSI, Stochastics and so on. He then used nearly 40% of the book in 14 cases to elaborate those tools. The problem is, though I believe it's the intent of the author to make the book as concise as possible, it's simply impossible for most, even some professionals, to grasp the usage of the aforesaid TA tools. Even worse, the cases just did not help at all.In a word, a big disappointment for this one and I suggest those who would like to give the author a try to bet on his first book \\"Trading Rules: Strategies for success\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is soooo technical, it turns you off...","review":"This book looks good, had one or two good reviews.

I am a fairly active trader and have an earned doctorate in physics; Mr. Eng's discussions of Chaos, Entropy and Randomness left me with the suspicion that scientific buzzwords are employed to justify the empirical ideas of chart analysis. Friedfertig and West's 1998 book, The Electronic Day Trader, is a far more useful and current title."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointing book","review":"With all due respect to Mr. Eng, the book really skimped on detail. It mentioned myriads of techniques and styles, but failed to provide adequate information to fully understand them or actually use them.

And the guide also lacks of \\"real\\" travelers information: which are the museums that haf discouns with the \\"copenhagen card\\", etc.The guide doesn't seem to transmit if the author has a \\"hands on\\" experience.

Just as Chandler takes us to 1930's L.A., Seeley returns us to mid-century, small-town Minnesota. All the characters that made up that world are here: the rich, the poor and the working stiffs; at a time when cool people still smoked and radio was all there was at home on the sultry, mosquito-filled evenings of summer.

When Sylvia is murdered, suspicion immediately falls upon Cathy, and to prove her innocence she must find the real killer!

Even though I watch on a wide-screen monitor, it evidentally isn't wide enough; the frame view (along the horizontal, even with a 1920 x 1080 resolution) is all crammed together, making the film (along the verticle) appear stretched and drawn.I'm angry that I spent the money on this download, and if it were possible for me to rate it anywhere below one-star, I certainly would.

By no means was this film set out for technical merit or oscar consideration. This is a great date film, buddy film, or just looking for laughs. Farley and Spade are wonderful, best friends in real life, and it definetley pours over into the film. This film cracks me up, it is a shame that Farley is no longer with us. Belushi, Candy, Farley, the best are gone, but they live forever on dvd, pick this film up and relax, guaranteed to make the dimples hurt. \\"Dude.....That was....Awesome, sorry about you car.\\" Chris, we miss you. Watch for Spade unable to hold his laughter back as Farley demonstrates a car wreck for a potentional customer on his desk. Caught on film, forever great.

He plays bumbling fratboy Tommy Callahan whose world is turned upside down when his father remarries and suddenly dies. Hilarity ensues when it is up to Tommy to save the company (which makes auto parts) and therefore the town. There are some classic one-liners and Farley was pretty agile for a big guy (the scene in the airplane bathroom is hilarious). Julie Warner is very likable as the small-town girl and Rob Lowe plays a weasel. Totally a hilarious movie without resorting to a lot of bathroom humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie is sooooo Great","review":"this is on my top 5 list of comedys, i forgot how GREAT it was im glad i bought it, I have 5 Farley Movies and counting i have watched this show 100+ times, i watched it yesterday and i still laugh, slapstick plus verbal comedy never loses this movie is great, my grandparents loved it"},{"rating":"2","title":"The FUNNIEST movie I've ever seen","review":"Chris Farley and David Spade work so well with each other they are a great team.

David Spade is another story, I thought he was hysterical. That said, this is the ideal vehicle for Farley. \\"Tommy Boy\\" captures the dumb sweetness of Farley's comic persona. Pairing him with the caustically sarcastic Spade was comic dynamite. End result is a road trip to comic heaven. The film is aided with a good cast that includes the always terrific Brian Dennehy as Tommy's father, Bo Derek, one of my teen idols, as Tommy's stepmom, and a nearly unrecognizable Rob Lowe as Derek's sleazy accomplice. This film made me laugh on two fronts. I went to school with a Tommy Callahan(and he was fat) and Lowe in this film was a dead ringer for a friend of mine, let's just call him Bill. I don't know if I would give this film the classic status but I have yet to meet anyone who has seen it who has not succumbed to it's charms."},{"rating":"2","title":"ticks all the boxes","review":"Shari has written an easy to understand guide for what is often a daunting subject for lay-people like me.

The scene in question is Dr. Loveless's speech at the end of \\"The Night of the Murderous Spring\\" where he explains to Jim in detail why he despises him.The crazy perversity of this show is the main reason I still find it watchable. I am totally willing to hand wave away any race or feminist sensibilities I may have if you give me my Loveless/West love/hate obsessive dynamic. I love them.

I have both seasons 1 and 2; both are excellently restored. For both, video and audio quality is excellent. I had forgotten what a great job the 60s tv shows did with music, which really adds to the atmosphere of the show. I prefer Season One. To me, the black and white presentation has a classic look that holds up much better than the coloredition . It seems that a lot of the early color tv shows overdid the color in costumes and set designs. Some of the color episodes have a Batman and Robin look to them. Season one also has some of the best story lines. The stories that I remembered when I first saw the show as kid seemed to come from Season One."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its about time","review":"This is one of my favorite shows when I was growing up. What kid wouldn't want to be Jim West? As I grew older, I appreciated Ross Martin more and more. It is a little over the top sometimes, but the actors and the viewers were having fun. The scripts are somewhat formulaic. Each week a new super villian comes along with a plot to take over the country or world. Our two heroes would be placed in impossible situations and with the help of gadgets James Bond would envy, they would save the day. How can you not like this? The only question now is where's the Mission Impossible sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Iranian Kid Who Loved Wild Wild West in 60's","review":"I was [...] when I used to watch Wild-Wild West in Iran in Persian Language.

Jim West was my number one hero and I used to day-dream about each episode. In Iran, they used to show one episode each week on Friday night. As a kid, I used to take my time, sit down and write each episode in my notebook right after I watched it on TV so that I keep its memory alive. I still remember details of some of the stories.

I wish we had some actual footage of Robert Conrad as he is today rather than his (non-visual) verbal introductions...But that's just being nitpicky. This is a wonderful series, one of the more imaginative creations of a very creative 60's. Though some episodes here and there show their age, the WWW remains very much worth pursuing. I'm looking forward to the release of the subsequent seasons. And a final note: While this season was filmed in Black and White (the only season done in this format), the WWW, in my opinion, benefitted from its subsequent conversion to color (unlike, say, Perry Mason!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corrupt DVD's TRASH!","review":"I got all 4 seasons from Amazon in late November...Season 1 was okay, Season 2, Season 3, and Season 4 all have corrupted DVD's and They are TRASH!Would give a ZERO stars if I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"About Time (Really, about time!)","review":"I saw this was coming out from AARP magazine, man how time flies!

I can hardly wait for seasons 2, 3 and 4 to come out in this same format.The interviews, commentary, and all the other wonderful extras are why so many of us that have it in other forms have pounced on this set. Robert Conrad does audio commentary for every episode, and its so wonderful.Recommended buy. Incredible show, incredible packaging of same."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time!!!!!!!! The Extras are GREAT!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Finally, the Wild Wild West is getting it's due and being released on DVD. What took so long? This is without a doubt one of the best series ever on television. True escapism with great acting by Conrad and Martin. I just got an advance copy and it is worth it for the extras. Robert Conrad introduces each episode, the original lost pilot, the scoring of the theme song, interviews with key executives, the only TV appearance (on a talk show) by Conrad and Martin, original story boards, and Martin character caricatures done by him. Unfortunately, Conrad doesn't appear on camera and it is audio only. It must be due to his recent accident. He also sounds weak and frail in the intros. But.....they all add up to a great package we've waited 40 years for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"James West kissed many women!","review":"Sadly, my children had never seen a single episode of this wonderful series!

Instead of kindly letting me know that he had sent the email and it was probably in my spam folder, he sent me a series of nasty emails. His excuse: \\"our reply may have been rude, but we do take our customer service seriously.\\" In my opinion, good customer service NEVER involves being rude.

The pink net seems to have enough fabric to reach completely around my daughter's 4-post twin bed, with enough left over for the netting to cascade the floor, but the white net for my son's room seems to have much less fabric and does not touch the floor at all (they have the same type of bed). Don't understand why, but it is too late for a refund/exchange. We purchased it in March in anticipation of the mosquito-season, and just recently set it up with the oncoming warmer weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great netting for price","review":"Bed netting was just what we expected.

The Devil's Laughter is a sweeping epic set during the French Revolution chronicling the odyssey of Jean Paul Martin. The perfect auxiliary tale told in a similar fashion toRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, it is the unknown story of a forgotten hero of the French Revolution. Yerby is clearly influenced by Victor Hugo in the best possible way; a tribute any author would approve of. He takes the essence of Hugo and melts it into Voltaire, laid over the ecstatic sanguine frenzy of French Revolution told as noir fiction. Martin is a compelling protagonist; you are with him the entire way. And when Martin realizes that the Revolution has lost its way you suffer the same despair. A fantastic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get infected with this Measle!","review":"This is a thoroughly entertaining children's book. For children there is just enough \\"scary\\" tension to have them worried about what could happen to Measle. The book demonstrates that even at a young age one is capable of facing fear and rising to confront adversity. It also shows that teamwork is important. It's a fun story despite the horrible situation Measle finds himself in. It's a great adventure for the age group it was written for.If you have no objections to magic and wizardry, and you think that Harry Potter is not appropriate for your child, this could fill the bill. In fact, I think I enjoyed this as much as Harry Potter, if not more. (But I really hate comparing it to Harry Potter because the targeted age group is different, and I think this book stands on its own merits.)I can't wait for the next \\"outbreak\\" of Measle\`s predicaments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I really really like this book and have read it several times.

If you don't believe me, read it yourself. =)))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun with positive message","review":"I reluctantly started reading this book to my not-quite-eight-year-old son at the suggestion of a friend. I worried it might be too dark for him, but rather, he loves it. And I do, too.The story is riveting and the writing, superb. We read two or three chapters at a time, because we just can't put it down.The best part is the positive spin on the lead character, Measle, who, though just a boy, comes up with a plan that saves the day. It's a great message for my son, and great fun for me to watch him so engaged in a story without pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great read!","review":"Kids will love this book.

Simply stated, it is poorly written. As a part of how bad it is written is the fact that it does a terrible job of really explaining the process--exactly why I bought it.

The book also contains a section on weaving thread, with some patterns and information on how to develop your own designs. A word of warning, however. This is not a step by step beginner book.

If you are a novice in the field of rod wrapping this book will be a long way over your head, I know it was over mine. Mr. Clements and his buddies have worked out a list of the patterns and all of the names and sequence of each different wrap, then he assumes that you should already know all the terms he applies to the instructions. Also there are NO COLOR pictures in this book, the only color is used on the front and back covers and of course a color photo of Mr. Clements.

The vocals on \\"Frisco Bay\\" aren't meant to convey anything meaningful, other than contribute some texture... though the banjo does plenty of that. But the electronic throb that seemingly infects every track grows tiresome very quickly. Even the acid line or the wah-wah guitar on \\"Experience\\" can quite eliminate it. The throb tends to flatten out the album as whole, making it sound oh-so-repetitive. Finally, when he slows down on \\"Whenever You Want\\" does some differentiation show. But \\"Till I Die\\" and \\"Baby You\\" kick it back in. Oh well, at least \\"Giterkatze\\" has some catchiness to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 2 songs.","review":"Why does this product exist?

So I will be getting this one.Theadore Guisel (Dr. Sussus), was one of the more colorfulchildren's authors of the 20th century.To sum him up, He truly was the Salvador Dali of children's literature.He created a surreal world in his stories just for kids. Whereeverything and everyone was absurd to the enth degree!Only other childrens author that came close to what Dr. Sussus had accomplished, was the late Maurice Sendak.This was my favorite Dr. Sussus story.

This film gave me a headache. The direction and pacing of the film is flat, the musical numbers were unmemorable and boring(inexplicably nominated for an Oscar!), the acting was wooden, the sets were garish and ugly. At least this film is not the cynical merchandising vehicle that the two most recent screen adaptations of Dr. Seuss works were. I think Dr. Seuss works best in small doses like the short animated TV shows that were made some thirty-odd years ago. Do check out the \\"Gerald McBoing-Boing\\" cartoon thats included on the disc.

(the violins just tear me apart everytime i listen). Drive just blew me away being the first song i heard from this album. The first song from the album before this one was pop song '89.. two completely different types of songs entirely. Micheal Stipe is in very good voice (strength and emotionially) to give every song on the album a life of their own (from the sublime and anxiety filled \\"Drive\\", to the achingly painful \\"everbody hurts\\", to the extroardinary genius salute to Andy kaufman \\"Man on the Moon\\", to the emotionially sweet \\"Nightswiiming\\".

Stunning and unique this possibly represents R.E.M at their very best and is one of their more challenging efforts. Michael Stripes' powerful, heartfelt delivery is best complemented on the classic and unforgetable EVERYBODY HURTS which is one of their greatest recordings to date. Some of the lyrics on the album cuts are just charming in there simplicity. Every track is very good but the very best of the selection include the all time classic, EVERYBODY HURTS as well as DRIVE, TRY NOT TO BREATHE, the uplifting THE SIDEWINDER SLEEPS TONITE, the highly emotional SWEETNESS FOLLOWS as well as IGNORELAND, NIGHTSWIMMING and FIND THE RIVER. Excellent, thoroughly enjoyable and uplifting rock music at its best. An all time classic that comes highly recommended!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Trashed by the critics when it first came out, Automatic became the best selling REM album. A little depressing, but musically superb. Sweetness follows is the best song on this or any other REM album - amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"What to say?","review":"I can't find the words to describe this miracle but I'll try. With this record REM reached their peak in music, art, lyrics, melodies, harmonies and moods. It's been said so many times before but this album is so great every fan and all the critics say it is. It's a miracle in musicmaking. One rewiewer here wrote \\"Grace and dignity\\" and that sums it up wonderfully. Everybody knows that Rem never can deliver something like this again. It's not possible, but Revael is the closest in the time after.There's no meaning to get into any specific songs here because they are all masterpieces. There are not many records (of all time) that can be said about. The step from \\"Out of time\\" is enormous. The peak of creativity and brilliance.No other Rem album is near this.Brave and beutiful filled with heart and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely, moving album by true artists","review":"This album is full of great songs and proves yet again that REM is never afraid to take a new path and create the music they need to make. Any fan of REM's unique brand of soulful, alternative rock is sure to love this album and \\"Nightswimming\\", in particular, will rip your heart out. Of course, Peter Buck was nice enough to pose for a picture with my baby daughter once and I'm a little prejudiced, I guess. What a guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing artistry","review":"Simply amazing music... the violins, keyboards and cello add a very soothing texture to Stipe's thoughtful lyrics. The band plays well together, especially on \\"Try Not To Breathe\\" and \\"Drive\\". \\"Ignoreland\\" is a good song here, but its political ranting makes it seem a better candidate for Document. This was the first R.E.M CD I bought and it got me hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folksy.","review":"Now if we're lucky, maybe the kid below took will take Cobain's lead. It's a shame that young adults nowadays need a dead junkie's seal of approval before they can explore beautiful music like REM's Automatic for the People. Anyway... Onto me... \\"Nightswimming\\" is my favorite song. I've always loved it. \\"Sidewinder\\" and \\"Drive\\" have a nice folksy flavor to them. \\"Man on the Moon\\" is instantly memorable. Too bad REM's best songs are sprinkled across each of their albums. I guess great things can't all be found in the same place. Two other excellent songs from REM not found on this album or their wholly excellent Document are \\"Driver 8\\" and \\"What's the Frequency\\". Check our those songs, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"An automatic own for all the people.","review":"I honestly think every REM album through \\"Hi-Fi\\" is really good, but I admit there's something extra special about \\"Automatic For The People\\". It's one of those albums where everything came together, and there's an above-average amount of quality tracks. So it seems the major-label debut \\"Green\\", and the major-success of \\"Out Of Time\\" were simply leading up to this. The big hits here were indeed big, as \\"Man On The Moon\\" was called the ultimate REM song by Peter Buck, and \\"Everybody Hurts\\" has probably saved more lives than FEMA. However, it's the lesser-knowns that really make this the album it is. \\"Drive\\" was a minor hit, but I like it more than the other two. \\"Sweetness Follows\\" is sweet, \\"Star Me Kitten\\" is almost hypnotic, and \\"Find The River\\" is one of my favorites off any album. Not every track is 5-star, but I think I can safely call this their best album of the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"When I first heard this CD, I was a bit disappointed that there was only one \\"rocker\\", Ignoreland.My thoughts today are that this CD, more than any before or since, demonstrates REM's outstanding songwriting skills. A collection of low-key, organic (meaning heavy on the acoustic) songs show a tremendous amount of proficiency in writing melody and lyrics.In the CD's standout track, \\"Everybody Hurts\\", the arrangement meshes perfectly with the lyrical content of the song: confessional, open, and vunerable.Musically, the songs aren't extremely complicated, using simple/standard melodies and chord progressions. This doesn't in any way diminish the power of this music. \\"Automatic for the People\\" is the perfect example of developing the simplest musical ideas for great impact.This disc is essential to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly Beautiful!!!","review":"I actually feel REM are over-rated,but the sweet & moody songs of AFTP are \\"therapeutical\\".So quiet!

Each successive release from R.E.M. has been worse than the previous one. Then \\"Automatic For The People\\" comes along, and it's one of their best ever. It's also one of the best albums of the 1990s. \\"Try Not To Breathe\\" is absolutely devastating to listen to. \\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight,\\" \\"Monty Got A Raw Deal,\\" and \\"Man On The Moon\\" are brilliantly composed, arranged, and produced. The only reason I give this CD 4 stars instead of 5 is the odious \\"Everybody Hurts,\\" an obvious, pedestrian effort that seriously mars what is otherwise an almost perfect pop record. I don't know if Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones, who did the strings on this album, should get all the credit, but he deserves a shout-out. I hope he gets more work on other peoples' records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad pressing....Boo!","review":"The poor review is for the bad pressing of this album, not the music itself.

There is so much depth, emotion, and passion here that merely listening to it is an amazingly enjoyable experience. Like all REM records, I opened the store the day it came out in '92, broke land speed records driving home, cranked up the stereo, and was completely awed. And it's not like this is any break through for REM - the best American band of the century (the brits take the first few spots; beatles, stones, who).The legacy of this record stands tall 7 years later. Much has come and gone since. None of it (w/ possible exception of OK Computer) matches up.It's the end of the millenium and time to declare the best we've witnessed and listened to.

When i first listened to this album, i thought it was miles ahead of Out of Time, but after a while it sounds too REM-ish. However i have found that if i listen to it less often i like it more. This is a fantastic album, but they've made it so good, that you get sick of how good it is. Personally i like some very good songs in between good songs. If you don't mind an album which is very good for 50 mins then buy this album. Otherwise buy it with Out of Time, to make it a bit easier to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"More mellowness from R.E.M.","review":"\\"Automatic for the People,\\" has quite a few good songs, though one might ask what happened to the rock energy that fueled R.E.M.'s earlier albums. By this time, most of the band's old hardcore fans had labelled them \\"sellouts\\" and deserted them. What they missed was some of the prettiest songs the band ever wrote. \\"Everybody Hurts,\\" the Andy Kaufman tribute \\"Man on the Moon\\" and \\"Sweetness Follows\\" are absolutely gorgeous. Interestingly, when the only time the album really falters is when they crank up the guitars as on \\"Ignoreland.\\" Overall, this was another fine album from a great rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album from a good band","review":"This, along with a few other albums, are some of R.E.M's best work.

The music is so well written. The first time I heard this record I was in amazement. They went with the lower tempo on these songs unlike their usual mid-high tempo, and it comes off as the best R.E.M. album of the 90's.My favorite song on the album is the opener 'Drive' which uses all kinds of instruments. 'Everybody Hurts' is also an instant classic along with 'Nightswimming' and 'Ignoreland' which are supreme in scale.This is a wonderful album that you just need to listen to, to believe how beautiful it is. I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"if there is one album that sums up r.e.m.'s career, this is it. poetic, moody, and profound, there is not a bad song on it. although some consider \\"ignoreland\\" the rotten apple that spoils the bunch.. it is more tongue-in-cheek. this was the album that really won people over into seeing r.e.m. as a band with pop power (\\"shiny happy people\\") and true songwriting capability. this album is classic r.e.m., in the truest sense, particularly \\"find the river\\" and \\"everybody hurts.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best they've got.","review":"Automatic for the People is without a doubt R.E.M.'s best record, and it may well be the best record ever made. It, like all other R.E.M. records, is a concept album, this time about mortality, life and love. Michael Stipe is at his most fragile on tracks like \\"Drive\\" and \\"Sweetness Follows,\\" while \\"Ignoreland,\\" while possibly a little out of place amongst the rest of the songs, shows that he hasn't lost his Document-era political vitriol.The band's at top form here, too, again preferring to use acoustic instruments over electric ones. The soundscapes they create are haunting, immediate and gorgeous. This album above all others makes me want to make albums. I hear that's the highest compliment you can give a musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is good enough for Kurt Cobain","review":"This is one of my favorite albums.

To me, it seems that every song sounds the same, and the sound is kind of depressing. However, REM is a great band, and this is still a good CD. If you're trying to assemble a great CD collection, this is certainly one of the essentials. Perhaps when it came out its sound was more fresh, but now it has inspired many pop-rock songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest","review":"R.E.M.'s \\"Automatic for the people\\", is the greatest album ever. With songs like Everybody Hurts and Man on the Moon - dedicated to Andy Kaufman, there can be nothing better. I have the song in all of my favorite places. I have 5 of these albums, so I know that I will never lose one and that I will always have at least one or two lying around just in case on a weird happening, that I lost one. Man on the Moon is definitly my favorite and it should be up there with Losing my Religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be cautious buying the vinyl version","review":"This review applies to the LP (vinyl) album:$10 seemed like a decent deal for this classic on vinyl. When I opened the record up it looked like it had some scuff marks on it, as if it wasn't handled right when it was stored. I started playing it and it sounded fine. I'm no audiophile but it had a nice lush sound. When I flipped it over and got to Nightswimming, it had a weird echoey distortion, more in the piano than the vocals.Had to return it based on that. Great album, but buyer beware on the vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Finest Hour","review":"I'm a huge REM fan and have all their cd's but this is my favorite. \\"Try Not Breathe\\" reminds me a Great Lakes song in it's musical arrangement in which the speaker is choosing to die. \\"Everybody Hurts\\" is probably a classic by now. It's the ultimate anti-suicide, it's okay to cry song. \\"Sweetness Follows\\" is one of REM's most haunting compositions. It's a tale of death and family and we lose track of each other. \\"Nightswimming\\" is a beautiful song about youth and what is what like to be out with friends on summer nights. Lastly, there is the song \\"Find the River\\" which is about growing up and finding your way in the world. This is REM's most beautiful and haunting masterpiece. It's amazing musical and lyrical achievement. Also, Michael Stipe actully laughs on the song \\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite\\" and does an impression of Elvis on \\"Man on the Moon\\". This is REM at their quirky best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"REM Classic","review":"AFTP is REM at their very best. A great introduction to anyone who is considering purchasing an REM album for the first time. I bought this back in 1992, and it still receives a regular play today on my stereo. Listen to gems such as 'Drive', 'Try Not to Breath' and 'Everybody Hurts' and you will see what an amazing voice Michael has. The track from Jim Carrey's latest movie 'Man on the Moon' is recorded by REM and can be found on this album too. I bought 'Out of Time' the other week, and it pales in comparison to AFTP."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rock albums this decade...","review":"From the Best rock band of this decade comes one of the best rock albums ever. From the ever-so-mournful 'Everybody Hurts' to the ingenious guitar of 'Man on the Moon' this album needs not go to any length to proove just how fantastic REM really are. Juice magazine placed this album as one of the top ten of the decade, among the likes of Beck, Nirvana, Radiohead and Bjork and they definatly deserved it.Just buy this album to find out why."},{"rating":"2","title":"We deserve a quiet night","review":"Let's face it: all these Amazon reviews are written by those that either love or hate the product. Even the worst (stuff) will get 5 stars if the owner likes it.I must admit I never liked REM until I heard Nightswimming. It is, as some have written, a peon to the road not taken. And perhaps that is why it connects with my nostalgic soul so deeply. It paints a picture (diffferent for each listener, to be sure) of some moment in time when a decision was put into action, or a love was lost, or a cosmic mistake was made and all that's left is memory. It is nostalia, regret and heartbreak writen in song and framed by the sad, sweet melody of a lonesome piano.You can find your own connection, to be sure. But I guarantee, you will find it in this song, if not this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!!","review":"I've been reading the reviews and in my opinion this album seems to have been elevated to god-like status from some reason.This album is full of filler and I would place it well behind Reckoning, Fables, and Document. Hell, even 'Chronic Town'is better, and that was only an EP.REM were a great band in the early 80's, but sadly since 'Green' they have went drastically downhill. Instead of being Leaders they are now just followers. There drive to make exciting new music and the pattern starting with Out Of Time has sadly continued.It's a shame realley!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious drivel. Untalented group makes a boo-boo.","review":"How anyone can listen to such pretentious, imaginative drivel is beyond me. REM continues in this vein in every album, exhibiting talent in producing trite records which appeals to sad saps. The type of music REM typifies displays little imagination and invention. Extreme boredom to say the least.Probably forgotten in the next decade or so unless the major labels re-package and re-manufacture them yet again. Please spare us from such trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"some wonderful songs but a boring album...","review":"I'm a huge u2 fan but maybe I'm the only one on this world who doesn't like r.e.m. very much.I find songs like drive,everybody hurts and man on the moon(one of my favourite)very beautiful.But the other songs are boring and ripetitive.I don't know why people say that this is one of the best album in music.I hope one day I'll understand this band..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, but this c.d. deserves one star.","review":"I rarely and hate to give c.d.'s one star, but I have to give this one only one star.

You'll thank me for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Subtle Classic.","review":"It is difficult to say which R.E.M. cd is their best, but I feel that AFTP is the one. Murmur, Up and Green would be close behind though. AFTP is a nice, consistent, cohesive cd. 12 tracks and none of them are bad. Those who don't like R.E.M. should start here and then try the aforementioned discs. This album is a must have for any music fan's collection, and it's worth the money. It contains the hits \\"Drive\\", \\"Man on the Moon\\" and \\"Everybody Hurts.\\" The other 9 tracks are just as brilliant. This cd doesn't suffer from repetitiveness or blandness which can accompany some of R.E.M.'s other discs. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.E.M.'s best one!","review":"This is simply a classic! I have never ever met a person who has not fallen for this album. This is where R.E.M. shows its full strength, the climax of the band's musically genius development.Almost every single song is a hymn, an accomplished individual piece of music. One song more beautiful than the other. With peaks such as Find The River, Man On The Moon, Nightswimming and the great, great starter Drive.It is beautiful, it is multi-harmonic, it is music on a very, very high level!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of all time.","review":"This is by far the best album out of R.E.M.

Maya Angelou obviously had many interesting experiences, but the manner in which she tells is, well, perverted. Sure she was raped and had a promiscuous sexual encounter.

What is the deal with that? She is supposed to be some great humanitarian and she is still to this day perpetuating a racist message. I understand she had a hard time growing up, but come on now.

Fortunately, around 11th grade we started getting some works of substance and literary merit and I went on to a Ph.D in Comparative Literature.

I get the feeling that the angelou just wants some self pity by gripping about it in her books--the same scene plays over and over: racism , racism, we grew up poor, racism, we grew up poor. I don't doubt that racism was/is a big part of society--but it gets old when people starts yammering and whining about the ethics of racism cuz no one really cares about it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HUMAN story","review":"Marguerite Angelou's story is in some ways a typical autobiography. The thing that sets it apart is the vivid imagery she weaves in telling the story. The one disappointment I had is how quickly the latter half of the book went. Anyone empathetic will appreciate the book for what it is - a unique story which strives to explain the events which shaped one woman's life. Anyone intelligent enough will be able to use it as part of the vast library of experiences which help us understand our own very human existence.

Maya Angelou did an amazing job of telling the early years of her life story. This is just the first book that depicts her autobigraphy.The language in this book is so nicely detailed and the words just mesh together so well, it's hard not to enjoy reading this book. Maya Angelou describes her early life and the troubles she had as an African American woman growing up in the 1940s.She had an amazing life and her stories can teach us all a thing or two. I almost cheered out loud when she stood up for herself to get her first job. She describes her personal stories with such compassion and mixes in some humor to allow the book's flow to be smooth.Maya Angelou is a remarkable woman with an incredible story to tell, no matter how shocking some of it really is. I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a great starting point. This book is an excellent, pleasurable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naming","review":"This novel has many major themes. A major theme that i felt intreeved by was naming. Maya felt strong about that. There were many occasions in which the whites, who represented the rich and prosperous, felt they had the right to change the names of the \\"blacks\\". Maya felt that was stealing her identity and it is.I would recommend this novel to anyone, but one special group that i feel this novel would do really good for are the young adults. Maya suffers through many experiences we can actually learn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read!","review":"Maya Angelou's words and poetic prose will lift your spirits and charm your soul.

What I'm saying is this book is a required reading for my daughter. I saw the movie made from this book when I was young, and I told my daughter that the books that movies are made form are far more better and fill in blanks. So, she is preparing to read it and I'm sure that after she does, I will need to but her the other books in this series.But, this is the autobiography of Maya Angelou, one should know that this is a must read. The movie was very good, and I am glad it is a required reading for my daughter, for when she is done, I will read it and I know that we will purchase the follow-up books as well, for I would like to know what drove Maya to be Maya, what hills and valley's she came through.

C. Heath and Company). Unfortunately, buying abridged works in any form is risky business. My low rating is not by any means a reflection of Maya Angelou's work, but a reflection of the material choosen by Random House to include in the audiobook on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, But Nothing Special","review":"My high-school English teacher had this on her list of required reading for her senior class, and as a result, I didn't read it until after I had graduated from college. On the whole, I found it a rather dull book. Angelou goes into detail about what it was like for a young black girl to grow up in the United States in the 40's. As you can imagine, it wasn't really very pretty. She mentions about how she very eagerly lost her virginity, was molested by her mother's boyfriend, he relationship with her brother and so on. The most impressive part of the book was when she stood up for herself in order to get her first job -- the book is almost worth reading just for those few pages.

I found it rather dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not Singing","review":"It would have been a meager attempt even if the blatant narrative was substantial, even though this story of Maya's convoluted life may be a desperate plea of painful expression.

Why is having the baby a happy ending to this book. In my point of views it just made her life go downhill. And how is ruuning away to the junkyard a good idea. If I were to do that I would be dead. Maya does a good job writing this book but there is no point. She tries to get acroos themes but it fails. She grew up in tough times with much racism. She only sees whie hating blacks. She fails to see that she has a racist point of view of whites. Some details in the scene from St. Louis did not needed to be added. I don't think this is an appropriate book for kids to be forced to read. Kids can't watch some P.G. 13 movies in school. I consider this writing to be rated P.G. 16. My main problem is the book has no ending or point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Boring","review":"I'm sorry, but I found this book to be boring and hard to believe.

But this book does not do her justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"I hate how Maya Angelou thinks she's such a victim and tries to steal everyone's sympathy in a verbose piece of garbage. There are about a million lives right now that are much worse than hers but she acts like she has persevered the most racism and injustice in the world.

This book was easy to understand, but is overshadowed by the boring plot. As horrible as this sounds, the most interesting part of the book was the rape and molestation, but even that contained bland descriptions and was NOT even that good.

It's a very inviting book, with a large text and an endearing child narrator whose strange quirks and expressions give it a very personal and all the more emotional touch. It certainly highlights the racial division prevalent in the South (USA) as recently as 50-60 years ago. This coming of age story though falls (not through any fault of Angelou's) into another cliche story about 'black' people and the struggle and oppression they endured. I do not mean to trivialize their struggle merely to highlight the fact that after one reads hundreds of books on the same little black girl who got raped by her white stepdaddy or whatever, the stories blur into one and the only difference is their name.Would I recommend it? Only if you haven't been exposed with 'To kill a mockingbird'-esque stories beforehand."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings","review":"I thought this book was a good representation of the trials and tribulations of a young black girl growing up in the mid 20th century.

Ms. Angelou writes well and thought-provokingly, but this book makes hardship and questioning your place in the world seem like experiences specific to African Americans. I agree that this book is slightly racist, though not in the blatant, harsh way that the author seems to have endured. The feelings, thoughts, and questions in the book are NOT specific to a certain race, because nothing that counts for anything is specific to a certain race.

She acts like everything is horrible, but her grandmother owns a successful store that has no trouble with the Great Depression. At the end she acts like everything is all right, but she has a bastard child on her hands; she leaves the reader's spirit feeling crushed. Its success can be attributed to the fact that high schools require students to read this God-foresaken novel. Whatever happened to Plato and Thucydidies? Why does Maya Angelou pass for literature?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly perfunctory","review":"An infantile, vindictive, and pretentiously polysyllabic account of unrealistically recalled formative years. One must combat the impression that Ms. Angelou presumes to speak for every African-American in her portrayal of \\"whitefolks\\" who are, without exception, either [prostitutes], greedy crooks, imbecilic, or just inherently mean-spirited. A 280 page exercise of almost vaudevillian absurdity in which the reader's boredom is only exceeded by the author's self-absorption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was THE hardest book for me to read simply because it is a terrible book. I would never recommend this book to ANYONE. It would be a cruel torture that I wouldn't wish on even my worst enemy. Her life was so screwed up and she doesn't have good views on things such as white people, sex, or family. And even with the views she has and the things that have happened to her, she goes to the whole world to hear her sick, sad story. keep those things to yourself where they belong and not spread it like a disease to the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure crap","review":"This book is just horrible.

I had to read this for a school project and I would never ever read it again, or even touch the book again. Everyone in our class hated it and wanted to stop reading it. If you have to read this book or want to, think again, I IT HORRIBLE. It's a disgrace to literature. HORRIBLE. DON'T READ IT. The book on top of being just horrible, It had to point. I cou;dn't even finish reading it it was so bad. My advice, and probually everyone's from my literature class is simply don't read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre and oversensationalized story","review":"I had to read this book in ninth grade honors English. I thought the book was one more the more profound wastes of time I had ever expended when I was done. Now that I'm in college however, I do not despise the book as much. I still feel that it is of very little value. Had the author been white and not helped along by Ophra, this work would be largely unnoticed. It's just another story about how someone had a rough life... with nothing to differentiate it from all of the other books like it. The reason I have rated it so low is because it seemed to be an agenda setting work. Maya Angelou is black and has used this book to help push her liberal agenda. Again - if Maya Angelou was white and was not well liked by Ophra, the book would have flopped. I would not recommend this at all... especially if you are a conservative."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings","review":"I just knew I had to purchase this book after reading an excerpt from a book of short stories at my school library awhile back.It seems entertaining and very inspiring.I havent finished reading it yet because I've been very busy lately but I should finish by the end of this month.Any story by Maya Angelou is well written and worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most tragic story of success","review":"i myself s a young woman wacoul imefditely put myself in her shoes. such n empoering story. verytragic. but ao very lovely"},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Classic","review":"I read this book as a little girl and had to re-read it again.

I WAS VERY INSPIRED BY THIS BOOK. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMNED IT TO ANYONE. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE READ BY PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE GO THROUGH AND ENJOY A GOOD BOOK AND REALIZE ONE WHEN THEY COME ACROSS IT. IT IS NOT FOR IMMATURE, YOUNG MINDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but too narcissistic","review":"Ok, we all know Ms. Angelou is a good poet, but why do we have to read those self-flattering adjectives and phrases every two pages? We all admire the way she made from the far black south to the middle of the white-American consensus, but why do we have to read this shallow, one-sided and pointless description of white people and \\"stupid\\" people who didn't realize her brilliance ? Sometimes poeple tend to cover their amazing achievements by being too radical (in the bad sence of the word, namely, a total lack of balanced point of view) and thus turn their interesting stories into a bad science-fictional novella. It's such a shame Ms. Angelou, who is a sensitive poet, failed to reach this simple insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say?","review":"What can you say about a book such as this. Powerful and extrodinary. Yet simple and eloquent. The author allows us to see deep into her life. The good,bad and ugly. She keeps us wanting to read more of her, no matter how sad.

It is a story of child abuse-molestation and the courage it took for this child to survive on into adulthood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impression","review":"Marti, A reviewer,This is an amazing autobiography. Ms. Angelou is a beautiful story teller. She leads you in with beautiful words, but don't get the impression that it is simply a sweet book because its not.

Her courage in coming forth with her story of sexual abuse has empowered and inspired generations of young women. Should be on the list of required reading for young women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"I loved this book. Written very simply and straightfoward, yet poetic. It drew me in almost immediately. Only complaint is that it left me wanting more information. For example, Maya and her brother had been incredibly close and were the only constant in each other's lives, but at one point they live apart and there is no mention of how this separation impacted either one of them. At several points in the memoir, I had questions like this that were never resolved. But overall I would definitely recommend. Maya has a unique and beautiful voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gives you a real look into Maya Angelou's troubling life.","review":"This book gives you a real understanding of how hard Maya Angelou's life really was and all the troubles she had to face.

It is a must read for young white generations for living in peace with their black counterparts"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great poetic Flare","review":"I thougt Maya's autobiography was great, because of the poetic flare she added.

But they were always interesting because it was poetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too wordy, but an overall good book","review":"I never normally would have picked this book to read, but in my school there is the dreaded summer reading. The first three or four chapters go by very s-l-o-w-l-y and are very wordy. But to my surprise, the middle and end of the book end up actually very interesting. If you like books about real people and true stories, I'd definitley reccomend it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maya Angelou's novel was very entertaining.","review":"We did a collaborative review for our 9th grade Honors English class on I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, by Maya Angelou. We all had slightly different opinions about the book, but overall we all enjoyed reading it. The adventures in her life not only amazed us, but entertained us as well. We liked reading about her struggles, strifes, and accomplishments. Angelou did a great job of displaying the racism of America and the \\"difference\\" between blacks and whites. The struggles of understanding herself and her family were portrayed in the interesting novel. We recommed it to anyone interested in African-American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic !!!","review":"This book was amazing! It makes you feel great inside and her emotional stories warm your heart up. In the book Ms. Angelou tells us about some of the most horriffying and emotional times in her life.

Maya Angelou definitely led an interesting life, but the way it was written makes her seem self- conscious and doubtful of hew own recollections, i personally did not like or understand it. i had to rely on sparknotes to guide me to the end of this most unique... book. i would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't finish it!","review":"This is one book I cannot even finish. I do not like Maya's writing style at all. She seems to repeat herself, at least in the first part of the book. I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"sexual molesting episodes are disgusting","review":"As a parent of a young teenager who was assigned this book as a summer reading slection I am very disappointed. I think Maya Angelou is much too vivid in her descriptions of sexual encounter. I was disgusted at the thought of a brown ear of corn as she described the male parts. Although the book may have a wonderful story and great lessons for young people to learn about times in the 40's they do not need to have so vividly described sexual encounters. Times may have been hard for people in the 40's who were black...but the man who molested her was also black. Maya Angelou could have published a beautiful book without all the sexual trash. If she was trying to appeal to young readers she should have shown more respect for youth and eliminated that garbage. I do not recommend this book for high school students. The book is loaded with sexual trash. Our children get enough exposure to that in real life...I would much prefer classic novels than this trash.l"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make students required to read it!","review":"This book is very boring to read.

I am reading thisfor english right now and I can't read two pages without fallingasleep. She goes on and on about things that don't pretain to the topic. I remember toward the begining of the book she spent half of a page on how she didn't steal a can of pinapples when she had the chance. So what!

Maya grew up quick when she moved to live with her mother in a rape situation with her mothers boyfreind. She also had the incident with her father in which she had to drive the car home after her father had had a drinking binge. The book was really enjoyable and shows how female characters can just be as strong as any males!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"Shame on those in Maryland who wanted to ban this amazing work for being 'racist'. Anything dealing with the experience of a black child in the South in the 30's and 40's is necessarily going to be 'racial'. The message of this book is not one of racism, but one of personal strength, integrity, inspiration and fortitude. Everyone should be required to read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOTTOM LINE","review":"This review comes to you from a 15 year old male. If you are assigned this book, I suggest you read it to pass tests, etc., since it isn't too long. Don't read it if you don't have to. The story has absolutely no plot and when I reached the end I was asking myself \\"Where's the story?\\". No wonder, it comes from one of Oprah's close friends. Email me your comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it, but perhaps it's just me.","review":"Now, before you accuse me of being some idiot teenager who hates English, let me assure you that it is not true. I love to read, my favorite writer is Charles Dickens (I like the Victorian English writers). I usually like books that I'm made to read, but not this one. Maya Angelou is an excellent writer of prose, and I'd like to read some of her poetry. But I agree with what one of the reviewers said below me. This book is pointless. It's just a mishmash of experiences from her life which have no meaning and ignited no feelings of comedy, tragedy, or anything for me. Perhaps others liked it because they felt that they could relate to Maya's experiences, but I felt I couldn't. I think it's because I'm a white, Northern, Jew and she's a black, Southern, Christian. I don't really know. I felt this book was pointless, and I don't feel that her life really had anything that worth shouting about. Well, some things she did, but, for the most part, no."},{"rating":"1","title":"my rating","review":"in fact, it is a good book but as for myself, i find it too common to compare between maya angelou and other black authors. to be honest, richard wright and richard ellison and maya are in the same category: nothing different.on the other hand, it is a good book anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undersatndings of the book \\" I Know Why The Caged Bird Sing","review":"My understandings of the book are that she was a little girl when her parents send her to her grandmother's house at Stamps Arkansas at the age fo four where shegrew up being molested because of raciscm, and all the things that she went throughout with out a desire , were so terrible like for example her unlove from her father what i mean is that her father made a difference between her brother Bailey and her, when they first met again.Then her pregnancy an undesire pregnancy, she just decided to bed with a guy just to find out if she realy was a lesbian or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"INAPPROPRIATE FOR YOUTH.","review":"I read with my daughter who is in the 7th grade.

But, as we read together, the words were very graphic beginning around ( i believe chapter going forward ) describing the rape by Maya mother's boyfriend, Mr. Freeman. The book stated that his private part \\" stood up like a piece of corn \\". This is not a \\" youth friendly book \\". PARENTS : Take time to read with your children. I gave two stars because there were funny, interesting points in the book at teh beginning. Other than that, INAPPROPRIATE !"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Student Use","review":"I am high school student. I had a very hard time reading this book. I know many people say that it is great, but I would not suggest reading this for student use. Some of the book was great but most of the time it lost me. This is a book I would read when I am an adult but not now. It is too complicated for me and not something I would read everyday. However I did learn a few things about what Maya Angelou life is about and I think she is a most interesting person to read about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Book","review":"I have just recently read this book and I was amazed to know about the graphic negative things that Maya Angelou went through in her childhood but also inspired to learn how she embraced various poets and their literature to helped her emerege triumphant in the end.

Overall, this was a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Migration","review":"Maya Angelo's story is about how people live in the different parts of North America. As a child in the Deep South, she lives in an all-Black enclave, where her grandmother, a storekeeper, is the neighborhood matriarch. There may be no money, but they do have a loving community.Then the story turns dark. Her mother takes her and her brother to St. Louis, and there's no love in the city. Life is fast and cheap, and you'd better move fast or be stepped on. She's molested by her mother's live-in boyfriend, who later turns up dead.Back to the South, onward to San Diego, California. North to San Francisco, down to Los Angeles. \\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\\" is alll about travel and survival. Each part of the USA is different.

Maya deals with issues like racism, naming, sexual abuse, and acceptance. Maya learns a great deal about herself and finds herself in this novel. She learns to accept herself as an individual and as an African-American woman. I would recommend this novel to any person who wants to find themselves and needs help accepting themselves. People can learn from Maya's experiences in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking deep within the meaning","review":"I know why the caged bird sings is a remarkable peice of a literary work. It displays many themes and meanings behind the title. Some themes are displacement, Identification, and Abandonment. This book shows the struggles of segregation and the reactions of the people of many generations and how they differ in their thoughts and actions. Maya's silence is the key theme that puts the book's true purpose and the Title together. I recommend this book because it was really heartwarming and gave the most interest to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"WMF salt and pepper shakers","review":"The salt and pepper shakers are very contemporary.

Especially now that Mann has released 2 great albums since, in \\"Bachelor #2\\" & \\"Lost In Space\\". She is obviously getting better with age and has become the premiere singer-songwriter of today.

Indeed, all the 13 tracks of the album are impecable - showing the maturity of Ms Mann's talent and her absolute control of her work - and 5 of them are, in my humble opinion, true gems of rock 'n roll (count with me: \\"Long Shot\\", \\"You could make a killing\\", \\"Par for the Course\\", \\"You are with Stupid now\\" and \\"It's not safe\\").This album is not for kids, folks.

Contains 13 solid songs without a single misstep; outstanding work from an unsung artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this. NOW!!","review":"I bought this album on the strength of the first single 'Longshot', and was stunned by every song. Mann's lyrics are not just beautifully written, but shot through with sharp humour and heart-breaking melancholy that combine with brilliant music to create a remarkable album of rare skill and undisguisable charm. A triumph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of your mouth comes a string of cliches...","review":"This is my favorite Aimee Mann album. By far. There isn't a bad song on the album; absolutely no filler such as you might find on other albums. The two songs in which the incomparable Juliana Hatfield guest (\\"You Could Make A Killing\\" and \\"Amateur\\") are brilliant. Particularly exceptional tracks are \\"Par For The Course\\" -- a breathtaking ballad of sorts (think Aimee's \\"Wise Up\\" from the Magnolia soundtrack) and \\"Frankenstein\\", a pitch-perfect song about the way a seemingly perfect relationship can be transformed into a monstrosity. Aimee Mann never fails to impress, and on her sophomore solo effort, she proves once again that she's the real deal. This album has it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD","review":"I love this CD and find myself putting it on when so many other CDs have worn out their welcome.

The novel also describes the Battle of Saratoga which took place one year after the above naval battle. Amid the great fictional character development, one sees in vivid detail just how important a man Benedict Arnold was in the founding of our nation...and just how heartbreaking his later betrayal had to have been to everyone involved.

Videos, that were released later are very good. I was fully dissapointet by that DVD. I have the Videotape with this compilation also and I think that picture quality is much better their.

Their album Violator is one of my top ten favorite albums of all time (in a list, believe it or not, containing Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Eagles etc). While putting together a nice package such as this is a commendable task for a band that has always treated its fans well (consider the many cd singles, various versions of their songs), I was appalled by the poor quality of the picture. The picture was grainy all the way through the DVD. It appeared to be recorded from a television signal on a Fisher VCR. Im surprised no one else mentioned this in their review. As for the sound, its quite mediocre too. Had it not been for the interviews and the number of vidoes included, I would have given it a much lower rating. Too bad, and a shame.

But if you haven't seen this amazing flick, you owe it to yourself to."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRANK NITTI'S FAMILY SHOULD SUE","review":"among all the five star reviews, it's funny nobody mentioned the blatantmisrepresentation of frank nitti in this movie.he was not a rat-faced psychopath who was thrown off a building by elliot ness as portrayed in this movie. mr. nitti was second in command, and after capone was incarcerated, nitti ran the mob for 13 years.his life ended when he allegedly committed suicide in 1943.i don't mind movies blurring the facts in the name of dramatic license,but in this case being completely blind to actual events will earn this film only one star from me.btw, de palma also ruined \\"the black dahlia.\\"please mr. de palma, don't make anymore movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untouchable? Unbelievable. Unbelievably bad, that is.","review":"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. What good is extravagant set design when you have hack directing, hackneyed writing/storytelling, and poor editing? Virtually every scene is leaden, overly-long, and devoid of suspense or drama. Here's just one example: The baby carriage scene (the Battleship Potemkin \\"homage\\") is drawn out far too long to add anything to the plot. (And why bother cutting to the clock if you don't show the minute hand move?) I could list a dozen more examples, but the film doesn't deserve another minute of my time.

The story is set in Chicago during the Prohibition Era and focuses on the rise and fall of Al Capone (played by Robert Deneiro), one of the greatest mob bosses in American history. Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, and Andy Garcia play the role of the \\"untouchable\\" policemen that are continuously trying to nab Al Capone for unspeakable crimes. Overall, the movie is entertaining and worth seeing.

This is an exciting film in it's entirety, the mark of a great film. Connery is suprisingly good, but de Niro steals the show as usual, with a great cameo as Al Capone. The dialogue is good, with most of it given to Connery, most notably his speech to Costner's Eliot Ness, as to how Capone can be caught. The Untouchables is visually stunning, never more on show than the legendary train station scene, a homage to The Battleship Potemkin. Unlike other de Palma films, this does not need analysis; it is pure fun. A film you can watch over again. It is recommended to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Untouchables.","review":"The Untouchables A Classic!

Instead, the Untouchables is more along the lines of Dirty Harry, serving up a similar attitude of doling out justice even if it be against the law.That doesn't automatically make it a bad movie, of course, but even this point is only briefly developed toward the end. The rest is filled with uninspired direction, very vivid settings, well-done cinematography (the shoot-outs especially), and plenty of pulp. This movie really deserves a 3.5, as I always favor substance over style, and it is hard to find any great weight to this thriller (which Goodfellas managed to acquire quite aptly).It does well as a movie watched on a random evening with some friends, but shouldn't be burdened with undue expectations. Perhaps Once Upon A Time In America will manage to scratch that itch."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Untouchable' is Right!","review":"This is pure genius. You have four lone rangers \\"The Untouchables\\" fighting off crime and going up against Chicago's big boy Al Capone (Robert DeNiro) and you have ingredients to tasty meal! Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is the newest federal agent who found umbrellas instead of illegal alcohol during the Prohibtion-era. Stinking baby carriage! Old man Malone (Sean Connery) did his best after James Bond and still took out the garbage and then some. The rookie had the best aim on the force (Andy Garcia) saved the baby carriage from doom and the accountant (Charles Martin Smith), well was just an accountant.

My brother told me it sucked and he didn't even finish watching it, that's how bad it was, and neither did I! (SO don't buy!)The movie was just way too old-fashioned and foolish, and the music was corny, kiddy, happy-go-lucky music that belonged is some cartoon shows that my little sister watches. A more serious type of music would have been better suited for the material of the movie since it consisted of murder, mayhem, and violence. Even the acting was corny and just plain lame-what were these four suppose to be?! The fearless foursome?! The dynamic duo or something?! Trust me, this is garbage. The only real reason people even would pay any attention to it is because it involves the mob, which is something everyone swears to heaven would make a good, five-star film.

I have never had a disc that won't play on any of my four players without freezing up. Strangely enough if you look at old HD-DVD discs, they can be purchased for next to nothing, except this title which sells for more than the blu-ray version. I can only assume it actually plays.

He is absolutely horrid and emotionless in this movie. That isnt even the main problem with it. It disgusts me how innacurate this movie is. I am a Mafia buff and this movie continued to annoy me as it progressed. Here is the truth behind this event: The Untouchables were a nine man team who busted many of Capone's attempts. Did they bring him down? No. They were merely a thorn in his side while other federal agents did that. The way this movie made The Untouchables appear as the sole reason he was sent to prison annoyed me. Also, having Frank Nitti die at Ness' hands at the end was ridiculous. Nitti succeeded Capone as the Outfit leader and ended up killing himself in 1947 after a quarrel with the REAL boss Paul Ricca. If you are into reality, this movie is terrible.

This radio is one of the easiest to assemble. The most difficult part of building a crystal radio is making the antennae. Make certain that you have a good ground and a long antennae. I would recommend at least at 50 foot long wire for the antennae. If your antennae and ground is good, your reception will equal any car radio. In fact, your primary problem will be that many of the stations are so loud that your ears will hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good experience","review":"I bought this to share with my grandson.

Take a small amount of teenage angst mixed with schoolyard humor, testosterone and a couple of irreverent senses of humor and you can paint the picture of what the conversations were like. Half the time they had me laughing so much I couldn't eat, and the rest of the time I was holding my head in my hands in frustration. I didn't want to be overbearing, and I do enjoy their senses of humor, but it was getting where we never had a decent conversation and I was desperate to find something to change the situation.I bought this product as an experiment and was amazed at the results. Even the most reluctant of the two teenagers came around and was engaged in the conversation. We talked about things that would never have come up in our normal conversations and I learned some things about my kids I never knew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great conversation starter","review":"My wife and I have used this with our boys, ages 9 and 5, at the dinner table.

Flute is just the right instrument for endeavours in complexist music, as it savours a spectral flavour that aptly soothes the at-times aggressive language and gestures of this music. Chislett rendition of Dillon's Sgothan (which is for me an absolute masterpiece in the literature for solo flute) is a very voluptuous one, breathy, full of inspiration. I'm a little undecided about the fourth track (Jennifer Fowler's piece), though it certainly makes for a nice reprieve in between the very involving, angular pieces. Whiticker's 'Kiah' (track 7) is a another rather subdued number before Ferneyhough's epic Unity Capsule - gosh, look at the score!

Mindfulness practice (shamatha) is introduced here in a way that, while acknowledging the Buddhist roots of the practice, can appeal to anyone open-minded enough to engage it. I would recommend mindfulness to anyone regardless of their faith or philosophy, and this is a great place to take that first step. Also, the book is written in very clear, plain language that makes it a quick read the first time through, and a joyful reminder when you come back to it again...and again...and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marooned on a desert island? This is the book.","review":"I've only read half of Turning the Mind into an Ally so far, but have nothing but great great great to report thus far. If you've read Pema Chodron or Sharon Salzberg, Chogyam Trungpa or the Dalai Lama, pick it up. It's an easy read, accessible--and best of all connects with my experience of how to live a good life, and how not to. Mipham, the author, is the head of the Shambhala Buddhist school of Buddhism. He's the son of Trungpa, who was one of the pioneers of Buddhism and meditation in America. If you send one book to that nutty grandma of yours, this is the one. It's understandable, but profound.Of course, the second half could be wildly different. I'll let you know in two hours, when I've finished it..!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminently Practical","review":"I have always liked Chogyam Trungpa's works for their relaxed and good humoured, very Tibetan approach. Sakyong Mipham is more Western in style, but still captures some of that informality that makes the message feel personal. This book will help many to understand the subtleties of meditation, and the practical effects it has in ones life. Always reminding us that this is not something we can learn from a book, but only through practice and guidance. This book will take us a long way toward a happier and more efficient life if we are prepared to put some effort in, and take some advice.SweynAuthor of\\"The Rune Primer\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing book","review":"This is an amazing book.

The mini-biographies of many of the poets provide an excellent source of further exploration into the individual lives of the poets.The way the poems are separated also provide a means for additional conversation with children. The sections are diverse (from Poems about Nature, Poems about Family, Poems that Tell Stories, and Poems to Ponder) again will appeal to children of different age groups and for different reasons.Excellent for home school parents and as a bridge from Mother Goose to more advanced poetry for the older pre-school aged child. The illustrations, like many of the poems, are classics - familiar color plates as well as simple line drawings in an old fashioned style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for theose wanting a workout","review":"I bought this DVD because I read all the reviews here and thought that it sounded like the only prenatal yoga video that would give you a good workout (as opposed to mostly breathing and stretching). They were right! This workout really gets my heart rate up and leaves me sweating so I feel like I actually exercised for the day. It is long, but you can cut out some of the last sections if you want to to make it shorter. The only real negative about this video, to me, is that late in your third trimester, when your belly is pretty big, all the sun salutations (so the part where you bend over while standing) get annoying. Not because they are hard, but because you have to spread your legs pretty far apart in order to make room for the belly, which makes transitioning to the next pose more challenging. Another tip, if you like your instructor to be pregnant, then be forewarned that Dr. Christine is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long and to hard for me","review":"i am sure it is a great DVD...but for women who are expecting a baby and not really working..... 90 minutes it is a lot...i thought it would be 90 min , but with different parts... to be able to do whatever you have time to do ... choose a part... and come back without starting from the beginning... i couldn't do the all thing.... and i feel i always have to start from the beginning again.... i don't think it is good to skip the beginning and start from where i stopped the last time.All the women on DVD are VERY pregnant , and all really comfortable with each exercises... it is amazing!!!Also i am a beginner, and it is ok to follow the exercises... pretty much...but better to know about yoga ...i also bought the DVD, The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1 from Karyne Steben for workout and loved it... short , different levels... i could almost do it everyday... better for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I didn't like this because I thought it was too difficult for a pregnant woman and it didn't have different levels of difficulty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but long workout, disconcerting imagery","review":"If you have 1.5 hours to get through the entire dvd it is helpful, but the background folk Christian and punk art-deco style (?) imagery (e.g., headless naked blue mannequin wrapped in outdoor lights standing behind the instructor) is out-of-place, as is the image of the instructor herself. I also found it hard to relax looking at the harsh contrasting lime green, black, and blue colors in the instructor's studio/living room. Finally, Dr. Anderson is a chiropractor not a medical doctor so don't let the title fool you into thinking she brings medical knowledge to this -- in fact, she advises everyone use a chiropractor during pregnancy -- something I've never heard or read anywhere else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent strength focus with meditative feel","review":"This video is wonderful. I teach yoga myself but wanted to find a video for my home practice to help me stay focused and to \\"treat myself\\" to a class. This one totally delivers. I am used to a vigorous vinyasa practice with a very quick pace. Since I am pregnant I know I need to ease up, but this video has really helped me to do so. I still feel challenged, and I know I am getting an excellent strength work-out. I also feel calm and centered when I am done, which can be a challenge with a video - to transmit that peaceful, meditative vibe! It is 90 minutes, so it can be tough to make the time, but when you consider how important pregnancy is I think it's definitely worth it. As an instructor and a student I give this video very high marks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this DVD","review":"I've tried Shiva Reas's Prenatal Yoga DVD and thought it was way too slow and easy (even though I'm not even that advanced or fit) so when I did Dr. Christine's Dynamic Prenatal Yoga DVD I was extremely pleased and relieved to find something both enjoyable and that made me feel like I got some decent exercise. I'm in the middle of my second trimester and will definately keep using this DVD for the next 4 months and probably even after the birth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, wish it had better music and instruction","review":"I am not a beginner at yoga, so I was looking for something more challenging in a prenatal yoga workout.

It definitely holds a place in the highlights from the first half of the 90's (after which music seems to have taken a tumble). One of these days I'll have to go back to my parents house and see if I can find this gem in the attic. I would include both \\"Thunderdome\\" and \\"Temple of Dreams\\" in a list of the 1000 best modern rock tunes of all time.

In a bizarre Catch 22, the company no longer provides the software that is needed to program it. Apparently only professional retailers are allowed to use the software.

To get the software, you have to register your remote and then wait...and wait some more until they accept your registration.The apparent strategy of the company is to make this remote installer friendly. A regular joe is helpless with this. Therefore they gain the allegiance of installers to recommend and sell this product for them.

I did as I am not a professional and wouldn't dare venture down this path. For the people who trash the remote because they don't know how to program, stop blaming the product for your ineptitude. It is specifically designed to have a pro A/V person do this. Once you figure out what you want and where you want it, this remote is probably one of the finest products on the market. It is totally customizable to do whatever you want it to do. Any of the other remotes that you can program yourself, doesn't have the options like this.

Yes, temporary because the link will soon expire. I got the software once then I lost it because of problem in my PC. I contacted the company and waiting for the download link. Right now no response. Imagine if you spent $238 for the remote and $160 for the mrf-350 and you cannot use them because of the software.

He needs to go back to songs with great lyrics such as the ones in his previous albums.My recommendation, don't buy this album.

Anthems of Rust and Decay, however, is as bad as they can actually get. Except for Luxt's interesting Rock Is Dead cover, there's not one song that does Manson's original justice. Just the opposite, the songs are either boring replicas or plain awful. The versions by Alex Xenophone and Robert Pierce are an insult to any Manson fan and the artist himself. American Head Charge, Broke Box & Co. deliver songs that are not really bad, but still are nothing but uninspired imitations of the original. Besides the already mentioned Luxt, Bile (who can do much better than that!) and Nocturne contributed the better entries, but even those are not nearly as good as the originals.

I have read some reviews on other sites of the cd who state the album starts to become boring after many listen's...well I never seemed to have this problem as i cruise through the hit songs starstruck,sure shot,rockstar land, october nights,for petes sake;yearning to to hear them again.And once those beats got your heart pumping, there are the slow and melodic charmers something of value and cigarette to tune you back down. These guys put on one the best live shows ive ever seen and you can recapture the experience you have just by listening to this cd...which that in itself, is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"good ... but ENHANCED is better","review":"Before you read anything else, I should warn you: buy the ENHANCED version of this CD so that you can get extra tracks!!! It's well worth it!!! Now that I've said that, as a devoted fan of Yellowcard, this HAS to be my favorite album. Although \`Ocean Avenue' proves the boys' talent to have matured over the years, \`One for the Kids' gives the most eclectic mix. I love the entire album through - from the sugar-high feel of \`Star Struck' to the heart-tugging emo-ness of \`Cigarette.' The lyrics, riffs, melodies - EVERYTHING about this album is amazing. I'm not going to even get into discussing how unique this band is because I'm sure that you've heard it all before. All I'm going to say is that they are truly talented and the best thing to EVER have come out of Jacksonville - dare I say even better than Skynyrd! And as a dirty south baby - born and raised - I like to think I know what I'm talking about!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me appreciate the sweetest instruments of all time!","review":"Yellowcard popped into the scene with so much force and bursted into the Rock scene that it shook the world! Sean Mackin's very artistic and melodic blend of his violins (with some songs he arranged with other string intruments enhanced the emotion of Ryan Key's written lyrics). No doubt that Ryan is one of the best sounding male voices in the rock business. But, kudos to Sean's talent in the string that every song he plays in makes me shake with emotion. Whether it's a happy one or a sad one, it has that striking effect.I love classical music as well as rock. Sean's violin brings back the appreciation of classical music sound.My favorites are Cigarette and the hidden track Rough Draft. I find myself singing these songs with so much energy.Here's to Yellowcard! Can't wait to see you guys on Vans Warped Tour 2004 Washington, DC!!!! YEAHHH!!!!! Awesome stuff, guys!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this CD rocks","review":"First off, let me say this CD is great. I love it. I just bought it because a friend told me it was good. I didn't really know what to expect, but I bought it anyway. And what I found out was that this CD rocks! It's one of those CDs that you can listen to 100 times and it'll never get old. In fact, I think I like this CD more every time I hear it. The violin is wonderful and really makes Yellowcard stand out from other bands. If you like punk rock, I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch to natural products","review":"We have since switched our house to natural products and no longer use products like these that contain sulfates, fragrances, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"From heaven (or near it)","review":"The acoustic is rather distant and hollow. In other ways this DVD is close to opera heaven. The sets and costumes are very pretty. The orchestra plays and chorus sings with vivacious sweetness. Some may find Villazon overly hammy. For me, his loveable klutz Nemorino is a delight. Netrebko plays the smitten Adina, who hides her feelings under a flirtatious veneer, adorably. These two lovebirds sing with full-throated ease. D'Archangelo is perfect as Dulcamara: cynical, knowing, confidently seductive, and sonorous. The only slight disappointment is Leo Nucci. Not because his singing is less than polished. But in this company his blustery Belcore registers as a bit of a stage cliche."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"No complaints... everything as expected... The opera is one of my all time favorites... Lovely performance by two awesome singers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, except for...","review":"I agree with all the good comments here. But am I the only one who finds that there's something wrong with the miking? The recording mikes seem to be too far from the singers, so that the orchestra and soloists are sometimes out of balance. I keep having to adjust the volume level. Other than that, it's gorgeous...netrebko and villazon are wonderful..."},{"rating":"2","title":"be prepared","review":"Wonderful singers. Specially Rolando Villazon you cry of joy after listening to his interpretation of Una Furtiva Lagrima, he had a standing ovation..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Amore","review":"I'm not sure of the quality, this was a gift. The label on it said it was for sale in South America only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding performance","review":"Elisir was Donizetti's most successful opera, and with a performance like this I can see why. Netrebko and Villazon were both outstanding in singing and acting and fit their roles perfectly. Although the remainder of the cast was not of their high standard, they were more than adequate.The performers made it appear that they were thoroughly enjoying themselves.The staging was traditional and appropriate (although one set was used for all the scenes).I don't understand Erik Moe's comment that he thought Netrebko was unprofessional in applauding Belcore and Nemorino, Her applause, which was for their actions as characters in the opera (not for their singing) was appropriate for the character of Adina. (Nemorino juggled fruit, not balls as Eric Moe said in his review.)This is a performance I think even non opera lovers would enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"This DVd was laugh out loud funny. I really can't take it when I hear people comment that Rolando Villazon is overacting. He is not wooden or stiff -thank god. He lets his emotion show through and he would have made a wonderful dramatic actor if God had not given him such a beautiful voice. He is absolutely the greatest thing to come along in opera for a long,long time. He has me listening to things I thought I never would have condeidered. Anna Netrebko is very good too although she has a way to come with her voice and control of it. Leo Nucci was very good although maube a little too old for this part but the scenes with him and Rolando alone are classic schtick. I had a wonderful time and this DVD puts you in a good mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"A coloratura-challenged Adina","review":"L'elisir d'amore is a light and funny opera, so a recording of it would make a good gift for somebody who is relatively new to opera. This particular recording won't make a great gift though. I think Anna's timbre is too dark and Slavic for this light role. The main problem is that her coloratura is so weak that she fails to be a vocally credible Adina. I grant that she has good chemistry with Villazon and that her acting is decent. But opera is music first and acting second. Musically and technically, Anna is only a mediocre Adina, and no amount of acting can make one overlook this basic problem. Villazon delivers a good Una furtiva lacrima, but there's no sufficient reason for buying this recording, when there are many others of better quality out there (for a great Adina, see Angela Gheorghiu in the Lyon Opera recording; for a great Rodolfo, Pavarotti remains unmatched)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD-L'Elisir d' Amore-Donizetti","review":"After trying 2 copies of this DVD by Virgin Records, I concluded that the recording itself (not the individual disk) was defective. The audio recording was uneven in volume. So the item shouldn't even have been released in my opinion. Amazon was very prompt and cooperative in sending a replacement for the first disk and for accepting returns twice and agreeing promptly to a refend. Five stars to Amazon; One star to Virgin Records for releasing such a poor quality product.It's a great piece of work, and I would love to have the DVD, if Virgin can correct the audio problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intended for kids","review":"I bought this book thinking it was a fun-trivia book for adults. Oops! It seems to be targeted at kids. Much of the information is common knowledge among adults, and the explanations are not terribly surprising or engaging. Furthermore, the language is rather simplified, and the whole approach smacks of a children's book (maybe ages 10-15 or so). Maybe the author went overboard in \\"keeping it simple, stupid\\"--so there's not much profound information here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - has done much better!","review":"After Sloughing through the most dull first chapters I have ever read in any true crime novel, I hoped it would catch on. It never did. I don't advise reading this story - you won't miss anything. 2 stars just because it is Ann Rule, who usually is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring","review":"I devoured \\"The I-5 Killer\\" and \\"Small Sacrifices\\" over the course of three days and couldn't wait to read another Ann Rule book... but this one was the worst, and I've read almost all of her books. I could hardly get through it and if I hadn't been stuck in the hospital, I probably wouldn't have. I agree with the reader who said it could have been condensed into one of her true crime collections. I only give it two stars because Rule wrote it, and she can make almost anything interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just okay!","review":"The way it was written the story read like a dark comedy. For instance, when Pat Radcliffe accuses Walter Allanson of exposing himself he denies it by stating the he hasn't had sex in years because he can't get an erection...his lengthy explanation is so quirky it becomes comical. Then there's the chapter where Tom Allanson hides in a hole in the basement of his parents home, and Walter pokes him and yells to his wife \\"I got him trapped in the hole.\\" All of the characters are very eccentric and quirky, and it's so hard to take them seriously because the way their actions and mannerisms are presented the story reads both bazaar and farcical. Nevertheless, Pat does indeed come off as manipulative, sinister, and evil in a very real way. I think much of the book was padded, and the story could have been told using far less space than it did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious at best","review":"I have read many of Ann Rule's books and found them all compelling, informative and fascinating, except for this one. The story seemed to drag on and on, and could've easily been condensed into 20 pages and included in one of her Crime File Volumes instead. I carried this book around for over a month and only got 1/2 way through it before I skipped through the last of it and then gave it to my sister. Without having said anything to her, she said she found it incredibly boring, not a typical Ann Rule book, almost as if she hadn't written it. She gave it to a friend, another fan, who in turn was also very disappointed, and never finished it so... Sorry to say I would NOT recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This book was completely shocking. I can't believe that so many people stood by and let Pat Taylor ruin their lives.She is the perfect example of a wacko. Ann Rule does a great job of showing what a fake this woman is. Her oldest daughter should be thankful she has nothing more to do with her family that has so obviously lost touch with reality. Too bad her son doesn't support her and instead chooses to side with his pathetic excuse for a grandmother. The worst thing about this crime is that Pat Taylor isn't in jail for the rest of her sad life. Not Ann's best book, but still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat's Still At It -- Arrested at age 70 for doctor-shopping pills","review":"After serving 2 jail sentences for poisoning people, Pat Taylor was arrested in February 2008 for doctor-shopping...that is, getting prescription meds from a variety of doctors. Police found her with 3700 pills and claim she is just using them to self-medicate. Yeah, right. Maybe they should read this book.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bar none...","review":"Rule's best work in my opinion. I love her books, they are some of the best written in the true crime genre. They have the grip of a great novel, but it's real life, real sorrow, real mistakes and real pathology. And that makes it even more fascinating.This is a book to stay up late and read, you just can't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Generations of dysfuncional familes","review":"This is a great book which keeps a person interest right to the end. It is an good example of how dysfunctional families pass down the trait from one generation to another. It is sad how the sanest person of all is ostracized by the rest of her family."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good book","review":"This was my first ann rule book and i could not put it down. It was more fascinating with every page. But it could be because the more i read, the more i realized my sister was just like Pat.

I could not put it down. I was enthralled by how a human, Pat Taylor, could act so deviantly and so selfishly (and these are understatements!). She is absolutely UNRELENTING in her self-gratification and manipulation. She has no conscience and this is what makes the story so enticing. Her sociopathic manipulations are in a league of their own; and the repercussions of her actions are catastrophic and far reaching and totally destroy two families. Unless you read this book, you can't imagine how bad a human can be. There is also an element of a murder mystery. I couldn't wait till the end to find out the real details of the double murder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canned actually does taste better","review":"It's not terrible, but it's not very good.

This CD actually changed my mind about artists who record other artists songs. Annies cover song of Train in Vain is even better than the Clash who originally recorded it. Other favorites are Don't Let it Bring You Down, Downtown Lights and Take Me to the River. Annie not only has one of the greatest singing voices of all time, she also is an artist who knows great songwriting when she sees or hears it, and a singer who knows great songwriting in my opinion is a great singer even if the songs are not her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Home Has Made A Failure of Success","review":"This album is dispassionate, over-produced rubbish. All the songs have a sugary, syrupy, chirpy glaze of adult contemporary pop goo that I can't seem to scrape off. I don't hear the Annie Lennox I know and love - the one who broke my heart with the song \\"Cold\\" and then mended it with \\"Precious\\" - I don't hear the emotion of \\"I Need You\\" or \\"Shame.\\" What I hear instead is someone who's fed up with the music biz having fun at a karaoke party. But then, with a husband and kids, what does Annie have to moan about anymore?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't anyone else remember the original?","review":"I own the CD of the original \\"No More I Love You's\\" on a self-titled album called \\"The Lover Speaks.\\" It was written and performed by David Freeman.

Gee...never heard of that plot before. How original. Where did the braintrust of Memorial Day ever think of such a fantastic plot. These guys are geniuses! Seriously now...that is the plot...and unabashedly, and pretty much shameful ripoff of Friday the 13th, and the producers don't seem to care one bit. This is one of those films where it was the first...and only acting credit of the cast involved and one can certainly see why. It's absolutely atrocious. Beyond bad. Have these people ever had a single drama class? Did they rehearse? It's shot poorly...the special effects suck...just bad all around and if you rent this you'll lose 80 minutes of your life that you will never get back.

All in all, it was a bad movie and no one should subject themselves to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work of amateurs","review":"Not only does this movie have a less than weak plot, it is also made in such an amateur manner, I was astonished such nonsense can make it to a DVD. The performance by the actors is unauthentic and weak. When watching it, I had the feeling of being in a bad, vastly unrehearsed, amateur theater. It is a total waste of time and money. Just forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"worthy of much more attention","review":"This is a very odd mix of different musical styles all having a dark cast or hue about them. The album (the most personal thing Hackett's ever done) exudes something unique and almost indescribable. Much like the man who created it.I believe Steve Hackett once said (referring to IN MEMORIUM) \\"I might be saying too much here\\" and I don't agree. I get the impression he has a lot to say and I'd love to hear more... a lot more. There comes a time when an artist has to decide if he wants to make the truth known or be content to know he at least touched on it.This is without question the most intense and thought provoking work to come from any ex Genesis member which is really saying something. Definitely worthy of much more attention than it's received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve's best so far","review":"Twenty-nine years of growth in his composition, technique and arrangements have produced this, Steve Hackett's best work to date. This artist is much more than a musician yet his musicianship is unmatched. Over the years, he has written some of the most captivating music of any genre. Steve's work carries the listener away, as music is meant to do. It is impossible to say \\"Darktown\\" is his best work, because his work is all good. But it is his newest, and certainly his most mature. It is his best. Thank you, Steve.

If you have never heard Hackett, or merely interested in his stuff, get \\"There are many sides to the night\\" and \\"Midsummernight's Dream.\\" Both are classically based, The later with full orchestra, and are absolutely brilliant.

From the opening monologue you are taken through a psychidelic ride of rock and blues. Hendrix lays down dynamic riffs in Spanish Castle Magic that would hold true even today. Three songs later in his ballad Little Wing Hendrix could bring a tear to your eye with a simple love story. And concluding is the title track which is a trip in itself. Hendrix works through the color of the rainbow gives a powerful yet memorable chorus and concludes it with a spectrum of sound that will leave you wanting to run the album one more time. Granted there is no Fire or Purple has on this album but don't miss out, it is every bit as good as its Hendrix brethren."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remember going to the record store for months...","review":"...to see if the follow-up to Are You Experienced had been released. Then one day, there it was. Like a sacrament I brought it over to my friend Kenny's house. He had a great stereo and his parents were out of town. We put it on...needless to say, Jimi took us through other worlds that day. Now fast forward over 30 years...my kids are grown, I'm sort of an executive, I even play golf, and yet...putting this CD on brings me back to the greatest time for music in this century. Hendrix was a true innovator, the most passionate rock guitarist ever. You owe it to yourself to let this music be a part of you, and for just a few minutes, every now and then, \\"let your freak flag fly\\". Peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Creative Masterpiece","review":"This album shows why Jimi hendrix was more than just a guitar player. \\"Axis Bold As Love\\" is a unique-one-of-a-kind-musical-fairy tale. It is full of stunningly beautiful lyrics, melodies and guitar work. As artists we should all aspire to this level. If you can for keep from listening to Jimi, check out the performances of Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell. It is my favorite of Jimi's studio albums.

By all means buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"I can't really comment on the packaging or sound quality of this particular run, but hopefully no one is reading this review to decide if this is a good album. If so: give me a break, you can't be serious; of course this is an amazing album! Why would you doubt it? I have the original vinyl version and it's pure magic. I don't know which Hendrix album is best; are there any bad ones? I don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!!!","review":"I love this album!! I just started getting into Jimi Hendrix last year and this was the first album I heard from him.

Really the WHOLE album is good, definetly worth the money. I have Electric Ladyland as well, but I prefer Axis:Bold as Love over it. A lot of the lyrics I dont understand, but this doesnt take away from the musical experience that Jimi, Noel, and Mitch provide for the listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated classic","review":"While it is hard to say that any of Jimi's works are underrated, as he was one of music's greatest contributers in the twentieth century, this one certainly does not recieve as nearly as much attention as his debut or his magnum opus,\\"Electric Ladyland\\", but it is one of the most excellent, consistent albums of all time. Every single song, with the exception of the first track, would have been a career peak for most other bands. It contains many of Jimi's trademark songs, such as the title track,\\"Spanish Castle Magic\\",\\"If Six Was Nine\\", and my personal favorite song of all time,\\"Little Wing\\", which is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Don't miss Stevie Ray Vaughan's version as well. All in all, this is an absolutely beautiful album.

Axis Bold as Love is his best record in my opinion. Also get Electric Ladyland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hendrix's most introspective album","review":"After the fury of Are You Experienced and before the glory of Electric Ladyland, Hendrix put to tape his most soul-searching and beautiful album. Anyone who sees Hendrix as a guitar-burning, drug-taking, rock god must listen to this album. Axis shows what a beautiful songwriter Hendrix was and how his guitar playing could be quiet and beautiful as well as loud and powerful. It also shows what an innovator Hendrix was in the studio. My favorite tracks on Axis are Little Wing, If 6 Was 9, Bold as Love, You Got Me Floatin, and One Rainy Wish, but every track is a gem. If you are a fan of Hendrix and only own Are You Experienced, Electric Ladyland, and/or Band of Gypsies, you are missing out on something truly special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely without a doubt buy this cd!","review":"Jimi at his best: great songs, great sound quality, great cd.

Most bands cant compare to a second follow up album after their first big hit, Hendrix could. This album is very good that contains more work musically wise. On Are You Experienced everything was more rawer..... the guitar is beautiful on this one, expesically on Little Wing a highlight from this album. Another great song is Spanish Castle Magic. This is a great hit for the press, and for the fans. Highly Recomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shut Up and Put Yer Headphones On","review":"I first heard this when it was first released on vinyl in 1967 and it was at a friend's apt. We were all musicians and we took turns listening to the opening with headphones. Today we have 5.1/7.1 surround etc; it's impossible to overstate what the creative use/mix of the stereo field did. To hear instruments sounding like voices swirling to fro left to right with Jimi's voice coming out of the top of your head was a mind altering Experience;pun intended. So let the Experience of this second effort take over and run through you through some great headphones and while defocusing use the album art as the Mandela, even with the mistakes and warts, it was intended to be. That was 40 years ago and it's as stunning a work today as it was then and it'll light your chakras up like a pinball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song writing genius","review":"Axis: Bold as Love is one to buy by the Experience. Jimi is at his song writing best with songs like Little Wing and Castles Made of Sand. Though not as hard hitting as Are You Experienced? but some of the more blues-ish songs make this a must. The problem with the album is that it leaves you wanting a lot more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a special release!","review":"All of the other reviews before this one were for the CD version. Let's be clear: This LP release is the MONO version of Axis: Bold As Love. It is pressed on 180 grams of virgin vinyl by Classic Records, an audiophile specialist label.This release is nothing short of fantastic! The LP was mastered from the original MONO master tapes. If you wanted to buy an original mono LP of this, it would set you back around $1,500! No kidding! The mono edition was never again released until now. The mixes are completely different from the stereo release.Jimi's original engineer, Eddie Kramer, oversaw this release and cut the record from the original full track Mono tapes played back on a special full-track Mono head specifically made for this reissue.I just bought my copy from Amazon and you should, too, to support vinyl!

Three achingly beautiful masterpieces, \\"Little Wing,\\" \\"One Rainy Wish\\" and \\"Bold as Love\\" are the highlights of Axis. Hendrix's gently strummed electric guitar crown these tracks with an unsurpassed feeling of splendor. The rest of this album is slightly uneven. Some funky hard rockers stand up to those of Are You Experienced (\\"You Got Me Floating,\\" \\"Little Miss Lover\\") while some merely flicker (\\"Wait Until Tomorrow,\\" \\"Ain't No Telling\\"). Perhaps the most distinctive song is \\"If 6 was 9,\\" an undulating, grimy rocker that became Hendrix's mantra. Although, the electric warrior scarcely lets down his sword, Axis: Bold as Love shows new, tenderer dimensions to the deeply talented artist named Jimi Hendrix."},{"rating":"1","title":"just bought a brand new LP","review":"I wanted the original Jimi Hendirix LP, so it arrived, brand new to openI played on my brand new player, and it keep jumping and loosing parts of several tracks.I am really disappointed,and definitely wouldn't reccomend this item, even if it looks like new, the audio is really bad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get any better!","review":"Well packaged, shipped quickly, good quality product arrived working and undamaged, reasonable price.

This album, which was a rushed job, Jimi said he hated that of this album the most, stands out as his most personal and poetic collection of songs to be released on a album in his lifetime. The pre-rap style vocals on \\"Castles made of sand\\" along with the picturesque lyrics imprints scenes in your mind as you follow the dialogue in song. The infamous \\"If 6 was 9\\" lamentation still runs poignant and proper today as it did yesterday in Jimi's world, calling out the hatred and greed of those who seek to oppress those who conjure the simplistic lifestyle of universal freedom, Jimi says \\"I'm the one thats gonna die when it's my time to die, so let me live my life the way I want too!

My only real complaint is about Noel Redding's \\"She's So Fine\\", it's simply dated psychedelic pop (but it is saved by Hendrix's playing). Other than that it is an incredible record!

It is Hendrix's true genius starting to be realised. This is because he was less constrained in the length of the songs by manager/producer Chas Chandler on this album. The longer songs have more time to shine, with more variety than on 'Are You Experienced?'. There are still some instant classics on here, such as 'If 6 was 9', 'Wait Until Tomorrow', and the Noel Redding song 'She's So Fine'. Noel's songwriting just can't match the originality of Hendrix's, however. There are so many influential styles on this album, from funk to blues to guitar rock. My favourite tracks are the vocal-led groove of 'Little Miss Lover' and the epic and soaring guitar of the title track, 'Bold As Love'. Another amazing album by the guy who for many comes as close to god status as a musician can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing but Perfect!","review":"If 6 was 9; Spanish Castle Magic; Castles Made of Sand.

The VERY basics are covered, but that's about it, and at 25 pages, you can imagine how much these basic map making skills are discussed in depth.I can't recommend \\"How to Draw Maps\\" because of its length, lack of content, and the fact that I spent that much money for a 24-page leaflet that didn't even come close to teaching me how to draw maps."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF??????","review":"I ordered this video from the seller and I never even got it or a message saying I woudnt get it.

I own them all and look forward to owning the followiing seasons (though for me, they dropped the ball with the Isabel character in the 3rd series which 'seriously' compromised the show in the \\"being taken seriously\\" department)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product.!!!

I can't recommend this one at all, especially as others have said- you can get it for 4 or 5$ at the feed store as equine bedding.I really wish that other product (Feline Pine Scoop) was offered in a much larger size and/or as a subscription item, as it's (almost) perfect for our older cat: it covers the smell, is easily scoopable, and is a small sand-like texture.

We slowly weaned her off of the clay litter and onto this and we've never looked back. There is *no* odor to speak of and it is so clean and sanitary compared to that awful clay litter. My cat doesn't have it all over her paws and ingesting it and she seems to have taken to it well also.

The cats got used to it in a few days. Now their litter boxes don't smell bad. This litter is the only one I've ever found that really reduces odor. From reading other reviews it sounds like some people don't know how to use this. the used litter needs to be sifted out, which is why the special box with the screen works well. Then you can clean up the litter box every day or two. You can also use a regular scoop to sift out the sawdust part (throw away) from the granules (keep) if you want.

It's the litter my cat's breeder used, so as to not cause confusion I bought the same. It does keep the urine odor under control and there's no dust. But of course, it does nothing for fresh feces. It breaks down to sawdust fairly quickly; I scoop 2-3 times a day and change the litter every Monday and usually by Friday it is 80% sawdust. When it becomes more powdery, fresh feces is nearly undetectable, plus I use copious amounts of baking soda. I try to imagine whether clumping litter would be better to use, but I'm not sure yet.

Also, the saw dust is used is so light that, while it doesn't create the same dust as many clay litters do, it is easily kicked out of the litter pan when Willow is covering her waste. In fact, the first night, she kicked literally half of the pan contents onto the floor. I decided to get a covered litter pan-- that helped, but did not stop the problem. Also, this litter tracks all over the apartment-- it appears in every room, on every surface that Willow has visited. Not long after vacuuming the floors and furniture, we still need to brush off saw dust that has transferred to our clothes from the couch.

There is a nice pine smell in my bathroom, and my house doesn't reek of cat urine. No dust irritating me when I clean the litter box, a huge plus. And there isn't clay on the bathroom floor! (Who enjoys stepping out of the shower into nasty cat litter tracked onto the floor?!) And my cat took to it right away, no problems. Hopefully that will be the case for your cat.

I don't know what kind of litter the Humane Society uses, but our adopted kitten (aprox 6 mos old) used it from the first day we brought her home. I have a strong aversion to cat box smell in any house and don't like keeping a litter box, but with a new kitten who's not allowed outside, it is necessary. This litter is not only non-toxic for cats and humans, it neutralizes odor and can be composted under trees and shrubs when it is used up. We use the litter according to directions - covering the bottom of the box with one inch of litter, scoop poop as soon as we discover it (usually 2x/day), and only need to change the box once every 7-10 days when all of the pine pellets have turned to pee-soaked sawdust. With the Amazon subscription to have a 20lb bag delivered every 2 months, it is perfect litter solution for our home.

You can flush, put in yard or throw away and not feel guilty. I hate all the fake scented cat litter. Feline Pine just smells like pine. After you scoop, you can mix up the litter in the box and it will dry. You just add a little more into the box and it's good to go. Very rare that the cats drag the pine pellets out of the box. If some get out, you can just pick them up off the floor and put right back into the box. The pellets are large enough to handle. I have three cats using one large box and it works out fine. I think it's a great product and the only litter I will use for my cats. In the summer months I scoop out the box and dump the litter in the yard near the pine trees. That's a great feeling!

We do not flush a tremendously large amount. Just the portion that may spill into the toilet while the cat is using the Litter Kwitter insert. Not more than a cup of litter is flushed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hidden costs","review":"This litter does work pretty well. It doesn't track, controls odor well, and my cats liked it. However, when cleaning you will have to scoop a ton of the litter out to get the cats pooh and the remnants of pellets when they break down to saw dust after being peed on. This makes you go through a ton of this stuff and you have to make sure you clean it every day if not twice. This, plus the fact it is expensive to begin with, makes it extremely expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"this stuff sucks. let me explain it does clump nice and is easy to keep the litter box clean, but this stuff gets everywhere.

She wouldn't even go in the litter box and stood on top of her litter box staring at me like I was crazy. I woke up this morning, walked to the bathroom to find to my surprise a huge turd on top of the toilet seat... Needless to say we won't be using this stuff anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Word","review":"Nice product (yes, good(, although a friend wondered what I was doing, using hamster stuff for kitty litter.

XD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Picked up a bag of this on recommendation from the lady at our neighborhood pet store.This litter consists of large sawdust pellets that are too big to fall through the scooper, and as soon as they get wet, they disintegrate into damp sawdust that smells rather piny and neutral, but is impossible to scoop because it doesn't clump whatsoever. This is the opposite of how I want my litter to act. The dirty stuff falls through the scoop, while the clean stuff gets stuck in it?I don't think my cats like the damp sawdust either. They ended up peeing on their bed even though this litter was \\"clean\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love everything about it but the pine dust","review":"Have been using feline pine with our three cats for nearly five years. The only thing I don't like about it is the pine dust that your left with once the pellets get wet and break down. We have found that every other day we--meaning me--have to clean the litter box to remove the poo as well as the dissolved pine. A small colander works great to separate the still usable pine from the dust. I would give my first born to the person who designs a self cleaning litter box for this litter :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Allergic reaction","review":"My kitten's eyes got mucous, so much so that I had to clean her whole face with a warm wash cloth each morning. After calling about the rest of the litter she came from and finding out none of her siblings had eye problems, I realized the one thing different was the new pine litter. After going back to regular litter her eyes cleared up.Too bad, it really cuts the odor down a lot, plus the litter has a nice pine smell. Apparently it is too strong for my kitten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on the cat","review":"I love this litter, in theory-- it is dust free, keeps the smell to a minimum, and is natural. And, this litter was EXCELLENT for my old girl who urinated a lot. The litter is fantastic at trapping the ammonia smell that I hate so much, and it slowly broke down as she continued to use it.. But, my younger kitty wanted NOTHING to do with this litter, no matter how slowly I tried to transition her over. I'm not sure if she doesn't like the texture on her feet (I probably wouldn't either) or the fact that it's harder to dig in because the pellets are a different shape/heavier, or what. But, I'd recommend giving it a try to see if you have any luck with your cats. The health benefits, and how cost effective it is, are worth giving it a shot.

Not only is it not flushable, it's about the least flushable cat litter I've ever seen. My cats hate it, and refuse to use it. One of my cat is running around frantically crying because he doesn't know whats going on with his litter. Worst litter product I have ever seen. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy again","review":"Initially, I was so pleased to find this litter. Finally - a lightweight box to carry up the stairs. I'm recovering from back surgery so thought this litter would solve the carrying problem. I changed out litter yesterday and my two cats used it last night with no problem. I came home from work today and more than half of the contents of the box was on the floor. What a mess! I know this litter is lightweight, but this is ridiculous. I'm going back to Arm & Hammer Essentials Natural Clumping Cat Litter (not found on Amazon). I wasn't crazy about the fragrance, but it too is lightweight and sure worked better than this Feline Pine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I use the feline pine kitty litter, and I thought it was the same. The kind I buy looks like chips. This looked like little pellets that you would feed to a rabbit or something. I do not see how it could be used as litter. I wasted my money. It is non-returnable so I guess it just goes in the trash and I'm out 16.00 bucks. I thought I was saving money, but actually I wasted money. Not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Litter EVER.","review":"I bought this for my 10 year old cat because it was listed on all of the consumer reports as the best and most natural litter you could buy. Yeah. Well apparently a great deal of cats are allergic to the oils in pine. So what happens? They stop eating, stop drinking water and stop pooping. I am very worried my cat will now suffer lifelong kidney issues due to this. It isn't just me either. Since this happened I have talked to several other people, including my Vet who say this is a common occurrence and that Feline Pine is the worst thing you can do for your cat. If you are anything like me you love your cat and you try to do right by her.

Never in my life have I seen such a thing. Also cool, the album was recorded in his garage. Uncool: The songs seem sort of simple and lack any humor.

Perhaps. Perhaps this not Liars Poker 2, but it is an excellent and involving book which offers insights into the $55 trillion (that's right trillion) world of illiquid OTC derivatives trading. The author does not write as well as Lewis, but he also, blessedly, lacks Lewis cynical egoism and conceit. Think that 401k and pension money you have squared away is conservatively invested in US Treasuries and investment-grade bonds? Think again. The author makes the convincing case that part of all our money now resides in esoteric derivative instruments which look like bonds and have innocuous named like PERLS and CERLS, but if things go mildly wrong could be valueless. This book is a facsinating glimpse into a world most of us know nothing about.

This is a case of mistaken identity. Frank Partnoy wrote an unflattering portrait of an Iranian woman with whom he worked at Morgan Stanley in his book F.I.A.S.C.O., and called her the Queen of RAVs. Personally, I believe that Partnoy painted an inaccurate picture of her, but to be clear she and I are not the same person. My last name is my ex-husband's Iranian name; I'm USA born and bred and of northern European heritage, and I never worked at Morgan Stanley. Frank Partnoy will be happy to confirm that I am not the woman in his book.I know two other women that have Iranian last names, worked at major Wall Street firms, and have expertise in derivatives.

The author is no exception. However, the book exposes the ugly side of merchant banking: packaging rubbish products and selling them to innocent clients. The mission of a merchant banker is just as the author put in his preface: \\"There's blood in the water. Let's go kill someone.\\" Also, it seems that what the traders in mind are sex and money. This may be disrespectful to them. Anyway, the book illustrates the evil and power of derivatives plus difficult technical terms in an humorous way. It is still a great fun to read this book - although Morgan Stanley would not appreciate this amusement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different Sharon Stone!","review":"Sharon Stone has proven that she is capable of handling any acting role!

The element of sweet unique drama is there and the satisfaction shall be there too if you can accept Stone in this new mold..PS The point that we are not used to see Sharon Stone in such a role... doesn't mean we can't accept her out of the sexy manipulative character as in Basic Instinct or Diabolique!I advise you to rent at least!

Also as much as I love Gena Rowlands I did not like the original Gloria so I dont see everyones fascination with it. On its own I thought this show was great. I saw it on tv very early in the morning so my expectations were low. And I am not a very big fan of Sharon Stone at all but I was very presently surprised by this show. Personally I think this is one of her best roles and I thought she did it wonderfully. I think you should give this show a shot based on its own merits alone. Its not the best movie ever but its definitely not the worst either.

She is one of the finest actresses today and although this role is probably not the usual stone character, she played it beautifully.

If you enjoy sharon stone's acting and want to see a good story about a tough but tender woman with a heart of gold, watch Gloria!

The design is beautiful and modern, with full color throughout and photographs on almost every page. In spite of being as many pages as most other books on the subject, it felt like an effortless read.All the basics are covered--choosing and positioning a cage, nutrition, selecting a bird, taming, daily care, looking out for illness, safe and dangerous foods, and so on. This isn't the book for a serious budgerigar breeder, but if you think you might want a pet parakeet, buy this and read on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, especially for beginners","review":"I was thinking about getting a parakeet so I bought this book and it taught me everything I ever wanted to know about what having a parakeet would entail. I did notice there was nothing about breeding parakeets, but as a new parakeet owner that is far from my top concern at this point. Everything in the book was pertinent to what I needed to know. There was a great chapter on setting up your home for the parakeet and everything you would need to get and how to make your home safe, as well as a chapter about all the different things you can feed your parakeet (including several easy recipes that your parakeet is guaranteed to enjoy!) There are too many parakeet owners out there who neglect their birds, and this book teaches you how to be a great owner instead. I know that when my hand-fed baby parakeet comes home with me in a few weeks the knowledge I gained from this book will make me a great budgie owner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated!","review":"My Mom bought this book for me and my sister.

She has an amazing voice in her stories. I enjoy her writing in general, and I did like Story of an Hour, but there are a few criticisms I would like to share. For one, she did not have a lot of detail into it. Her plot was weak and didn't have really any falling action and the conclusion was the death of the Mrs. Mallard. That was kind of disappointing because I would've liked to know what happened afterwards. But I suppose that the ending was a \\"twist\\". But I must say that I didn't enjoy the ending.

One lonely day with out Mr. Mallard, Mrs. Mallard's sister came to the door and told her that Mr. Mallard was dead. She started to cry. But then, later on, she got happy.

So when her husband was dead she thought that she would get her freedom back.I thought that this was an okay story because I didn't really like how it went but if maybe I knew what was going on in her life of why she felt like she didn't have any freedom and then I might understand why she wanted her husband dead.

This one doesn't come close. I've had one for a few months. I've tried grinding coarse for french press and medium for drip. Regardless of the setting, for each half cup of beans I grind, I get 1-2 teaspoons of powder mixed in with my grounds, as well as 1-2 teaspoons of powder clinging to the sides and top of the grounds catcher or stuck in the chute. The powder in the grounds results in exensive sediment in my french press coffee, and clogs the nylon filter of my drip coffee maker. The clinging powder just goes in the trash as waste. I got better results from a chopper, and the chopper was cheaper.The price is attractive for a burr grinder, but you get what you pay for.

Eventually, I was using level 1, and it was STILL not fine enough.So, I called the company to see if there is something I am doing wrong. The company technical representative told me that THIS grinder is not designed for espresso.

This spillage is a problem with a lot of burr grinders but was particuarly bad with this one. The B & D I replaced whose motor died was better and cheaper. It appears to me the problem was related around the ground coffee holder as it does not fit very snug.

One major reason to buy a burr grinder is to get a consistent grind. This grinder produces a very inconsistent grind. Even on the finest grind setting (1), this machine yields many large chunks of coffee, mixed in with fine coffee powder. Also, the machine spews coffee grinds all over the counter, even when holding the hopper shut. I will return my machine; I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking.","review":"This is one \\"dirty\\" machine. Grinds end up all over the front of the unit. Somewhat noisy, and the timer (sliding tab) that controls the thickness of the grinds is poorly designed. I will use it until it fails, but given the price, this is a very disappointing product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but loud","review":"We haven't experienced the problems that others have mentioned in other reviews. We have had the grinder for 3 years or so. One caveat: this grinder is LOUD! A bit jarring first thing in the morning... you get an adrenaline burst along with your caffeine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, a very good grinder","review":"The Capresso coffee grinder is very good. It just needs to be clean once in a while. If you want the best suggest Barista Burr Grinder. It cost 3 times more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fine enough for Espresso","review":"Total false advertising on this one. It does not grind fine enough for espresso. Barely grinds fine enough for regular coffee. Total disappointment. I threw away my blade grinder too! Why say that it does something when it doesn't. Obviously many people have had the same experience. Customer service was a joke when I asked them about it. I will never buy a Capresso product again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jams up","review":"This grinder worked well for about a month, grinding enough beans for one pot of coffee per day. After that, it started jamming up with every grind. It smokes and burns the coffee. Now I have to stop and clean it out several times per grind. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Does What It Promises","review":"The 551.1 is simple to use and performes as advertised...if you follow the directions. A very good value for the money. The only negative is that sometime the beans will get caught in the throat of the grinder and you need to tap the grinder to get them moving again.Capresso 551.01 Burr Coffee Grinder, Black"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for a grinder, turn and run","review":"I purchased this grinder and had it for only a month and it died. I called the Capresso hotline and got extremely rude customer service. I tried everything they suggested and the grinder was just plain dead. If I'm going to pay a larger sum of money for a product, it had better be good quality and I had better get good customer service. I sent the product back and got a full refund. I guess that is the best customer service Capresso could have ever given me. It is unfortunate that it is so difficult to find another grinder on the market that is in an affordable range like the Capresso. Its affordability is all it has going for it. I'm still searching for a quality grinder that won't put a big dent in my wallet. Oh, FYI the grinder was extremely noisy and it spit grounds all over the place. Keep searching......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, low quality","review":"I returned my grinder after a few tries. Two major problems: (1) poor quality seal on the container spreads coffee grinds all over the counter; (2) the bean container at the top is poorly shaped, so a good portion of beans will not slide down into the grinding mechanism unless you shake the grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, overpriced","review":"Upfront I want to say that this grinder does a nice job of grinding coffee beans evenly - all the coffee comes out about the same \\"fineness\\" or \\"coarseness\\" depending on how you set it. This is a good thing, and if you have ever used the really basic coffee grinders, you know they can't do this.However, its a pain to use this grinder. The receptical for the ground coffee doesn't seal well and coffee grounds get spilled, making a mess. Its also possible to start the grinder without seating the receptical, so that none of the coffee goes in the receptical and ALL of it goes spewing into your kitchen. To make things even worse, my receptical cracked - the plastic is just not very sturdy. And I can find out how to get a replacement. I would suggest either going cheaper and getting a basic Krups grinder, or spending a lot more and getting something more on the industrial strength variety. As another reviewer wrote, its a pity that a good grinder can't be had in this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear","review":"As others have said, the quality is just not here. Our receptacle also broke after a few months and the entire machine completely died before we had it one year.

If you are intending to make espresso though, save up for another model as it does not really grind it fine enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"capresso coffee grinder","review":"Does not grind the coffee as finely as needed. Confusing to operate, also. Would not buy another Capresso product."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A BIG MESS!!","review":"I bought my grinder many years ago (at a premium, too) because I thought it would do a great job for coffee and espresso. But, mine has some sort of static problem, and creates a huge disaster every time I use it!! I hate it!! Coffee grounds go everywhere - the floor, the countertop, etc.I am really disappointed! It was too expensive for this to happen! I need to go and buy a basic grinder to replace it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"needs a lot of experiments, a little messy","review":"I just got one of these burr grinders. I was a little concerned because of all those negative reviews. First, if you think you are using it for espresso, just forget. It is not that fine. The grind setting does work but not much difference. And the grind is not consistent enough. My favorite setting, if preliminary, for drip maker is '2', a little surprising. It also generates a lot of static electricity and the ground particles tend to stick to the walls, requiring much cleanliness. The grinder sometimes gets stuck with finer settings. I don't know how it gets stuck, but it does anyway. I haven't tried others grinders but I don't think there are much better ones within this price range. So if you can afford, go for the ones above $100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to early reviews","review":"I bought this item on the strength of the reviews on Amazon up to that time. I'm considering going back to a simple blade grinder, for two important reasons: the machine jams far too frequently, requiring shaking, jarring, or actually dumping out the beans to clear it. It is also surprisingly messy. (I keep finding coffee grounds all over our dark countertop.)The few pluses include convenient bean storage, compact size, and visual appeal (my wife says it is \\"so cute\\".)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice job grinding, but not durable at all","review":"I loved this grinder while it worked, however that didn't last very long because it \\"locked up\\" after the first three months and approximately 15 actual uses. What a shame because the product is nice looking, has enough grinding settings to please any user and is fairly priced. Unfortunately, it just doesn't have the staying power required for even a minimalist coffee drinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Everywhere","review":"The first day I used this grinder it sprayed coffee all over my kitchen counter. I was too lazy to pack it up and return it, so now, many months later, I am living with coffee grinds all over the place. Also, the plastic container for the ground coffee has become cracked all over for no apparent reason. I would give it 2 stars, because it does grind the coffee better than the 19.99 handheld model, and if you have time to play around with the settings, you can adjust the coarseness of the grind pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Grinder","review":"I like to brew my coffee in a French Press, so I typically used the coarse setting with my grinder. Every time, a build-up of very fine dust collected around the upper edge of the chamber. Plenty of this dust also ends up in my coarsly ground coffee resulting in the inevitable mouthfull of grit when I take the last sip of coffee. The machine also produced a lot of static, so this dust that never should have been there in the first place, sticks to lid and edges. When removing the lid, the loose grounds end up on my counter-top or floor. On top of all this, it died only months after purchasing. Do not waste your money on a cheap machine. Make an investment and buy one that will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crummy Design!","review":"I have a Capresso coffeemaker that is terrific. So I assumed the Capresso coffee grinder would please me just as much. Wrong! The difference in grinds on the various settings is negligible. And when I take the grind receptacle out of the grinder, the grounds fly everywhere. Not only do I waste a lot of great coffee, but I have to clean up the whole countertop. My coffee tastes great, but the irritation of this coffee grinder just isn't worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fine enough for espresso!","review":"I would agree with all the others complaining about the grind setting for espresso. I tried going all the way down to 1, the finest setting, and the grains are still too coarse. Even if I tamp the grinds as tightly as I can, the espresso still runs through too quickly, with very little crema. I'm not using a capresso espresso machine. I have a Krups Novo 2300 and it makes great espresso with beans ground in the store on \\"fine\\", so I'm sure it's the grinder.I would avoid this model if your intention is to grind beans for espresso."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a rotten product!","review":"I bought this, it broke exactly one month past the warrenty date (one year) and the wonderful folks at Capresso were stunningly arrogant (even before they knew it was out of warrenty!). On top of that the very expensive Capresso coffee maker I also bought at the same time now leaks...let me put it directly: the products I purchased from Capresso stink! Period.Try Zabar's -- they have much better coffee bean grinders..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hubby loves it - I hate the mess","review":"I bought this grinder for my husband for Christmas, to replace the old blade grinder he'd been using for years. The burr grinder does a much better job of grinding for a wide variety of brews.The mess is a definite drawback. Once the beans are ground, the grind goes through a small opening and into the clear holder. Remove the holder and grinds spill out of the opening, all over the counter - this happens no matter what grind setting we use. Hubby now empties the grinder over the sink for less mess.Still, for the price, this was only a slight inconvenience. He's definitely happier with the quality of burr-ground coffee as opposed to blade-ground.Edited to add: a few months after the purchase, the \\"bowl\\" part of the grinder broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good choice","review":"This product is not well built or long lasting. Mine stopped working after 60 days. My Krups mill has lasted 15 years but is not right for a uniform espresso grind so I purchased the Capresso. I agree the ground coffee recepticle is poorly designed & makes a mess but my primary objection is the poor quality of materials & construction."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fine grind","review":"My grinder won't grind fine enough for cone drip coffee. I'm frustrated because I haven't had a good cup of coffee from this grinder after a week of trying.After reading other reviews here I conclude there is great inconsistency from one grinder to the next. When I choose the finest setting I still get small chunks of bean. I can't get anything close to the powder-like consistency of commercial grinders (such as the #5 setting that Peet's uses for cone drip). Another reviewer stated they could grind for Turkish coffee. My grinder doesn't come close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have a vacumn cleaner nearby","review":"The messiest grinder I've ever encountered. The electrostatic charge placed on the beans as they come out of the hopper causes coffee dust all over the counter. I'll be replacing this as soon as I find something a little neater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, broke after 1 yr--Inadequate product","review":"The Capresso Burr Grinder has two main problems, minor and major.The minor problem is the mess it creates everytime you remove the container with the ground coffee. This was mentioned by other reviewers and I concur--bad design leads to constant mopping up.The major problem: I'm also sorry to add that IT BROKE AFTER ONE YEAR AND CAPRESSO DID NOTHING TO ADDRESS THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grinder...while it lasts","review":"I bought this grinder last summer and loved it. Then one day, after about 6 months of less than average use, it stopped working. I just turned it on one day and it didn't work. I tried calling the Capresso Customer Service number, but it's impossible to get through to. I'm still waiting to hear what they are going to about replacing or fixing my grinder (it's still under the 1 year warranty). My advice - pick something else or plan on replacing it every six months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice","review":"Not only did Amazon disappoint me with unusually slow shipping (it took more than a week and I popped for two-day shipping!!), but I spend more time cleaning up after this thing than I do drinking the coffee. It's just a pig. It grinds the coffee well enough, but the grounds end up EVERYWHERE. I've had it for a month and I'm about ready to switch back to my $15.00 cheapie grinder. It's just too messy to give more than two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and messy","review":"This machine is not worth the price.... It's flimsy and lightweight.

First the grind is NOT consistent, just very slightly better than a $... blade grinder. Second the grinding steps don't quite work. It does have 17 settings but 1, which is supposed for espresso fine-grind, is just suitable for drip method. Third it IS messy. It does not spray the grinds as described in some of the reviews but actually there is no way to keep it clean but to be cleanly yourself.

This is not trance, this is early 90's house music (the whole song is made of 3 beats, with absolutly no rythem, none what so ever, and dont be fooled by the famous names on the disc, like moby - natural blues you cant recognize it, it is a totaly different song with a 3 second sample of the original).

In short, it's bad. Everything has been squashed to death through overuse of compression and limiting; the result is a midrange-heavy brick of sound that is just fine if your volume is set really, really low, but that seems overly bright and will quickly induce ear fatigue if listened to at more normal volume levels. When will mastering engineers wake up and realize that the purpose of re-mastering older recordings is to get the best possible sound out of the original masters, not necessarily to apply current production techniques without regard to the type of music or source material?Find one of the earlier issues of this album and buy it used. Your ears will one day thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good tunes, the rest is forgettable","review":"Most of the work Lennon did here is classic and quite enjoyable. Yoko Ono seems to have been a great wife and influence on his life, but she makes Linda McCartney look like a singing star.

The tunes are just uninteresting. It's not unlike a musical variation of looking at someone's photos/slides of domestic life. They are only of interest and of value to the family in question. Only Watching The Wheels hints at John's talents. To make matters worse you have to put up with Yoko's songs which equal John's in number.

Probably, all they know are the hits 'Imagine' and 'Give Peace A Chance'. And that's quite enough, people, as 'Double Fantasy' again proves. 'Starting Over', 'Losing You', 'Cleanup Time' are songs that lack all energy and enthusiasm, something that has marred all Lennon's 70's output. The less said about Yoko Ono the better. Like Lennon once sang, covering Elvis: 'a woman should know her place is right back there with her husband at home'.

He was a talented guy who used to make good music with the Beatles, and on several of his solo albums.

The video \\"Yummy Yoga\\" demonstrates the individual exercises clearly, when necessary shows nice graphics clarifying which muscles to use, and provides just the right pacing for me to exercise with the presentation.Now, after some weeks of working with the video, I have found new ease in breathing, moving, and relaxing.I have found subtlety and lightness and a pleasure in being. . . obviously so in the physical world of my passion sculling . . . rowing is now waves of relaxation, breath and work. Oh how my whole body loves to move that boat! thank you, yummy yoga.and more, less obvious . . . my relationships are transformed, softer, more subtle, more informed by awareness.The joy and fluidity in breathing and moving which i have experienced as a result of actually working with this presentation is most definitely, 'yummy'."},{"rating":"2","title":"effective, but not really yoga","review":"... unless you cound the emphasis on the use of the breathe, that is. I found it helped my tight shoulder muscles, and relaxed me enourmously. can't really say the same about my back yet, I find more relief doing a regular yoga workout to stretch out my tight back. Just to clarify and so noone will feel ripped off, this is not yoga. It's a series of gentle contraction/extension movements that teach one how to relax tight muscles. And it does work, my trapezius is more relaxed right now after doing some simple movements at my desk. So it was worth it just for that. There's also a great relaxation session at the end.The other good thing about this video - from a purely pragmatic p.o.v. - is that you can probably do it soon after eating (unless you've really pigged out, that is) unlike yoga where you have to wait a couple of hours at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind","review":"Viewer: Thalia del Fuego, belly dance teacherThis DVD is indispensible for anyone who wants to attain good body alignment and release from chronic tension.

Last year I got Electric Ladyland. To be honest, I hated most of it the first time I heard it, but then I had to put it on again and again. And I grew to love most of the songs. Hendrix took experimentation to the extreme on this record and h managed to create some excellent songs, while others (Gypsy Eyes, House Burning Down) left me very cold. I still think that no Hendrix album can hold a candle to Are You Experienced, and this album is very overrated, but essential to any rock fan's collection.Voodoo Chile (both the jam session and the song itself), Burning of the Midnight Lamp, 1983/Moon, and All Along The Watchtower are worth the album alone. God bless Hendrix"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of Filler, Lots of Great Stuff","review":"This is Jimi Henrix's last record released while he was alive, and the first he produced. Like so many artists that take the helm on production, many tracks are left on a recording that should be left in storage. A 15 minute Voodoo Chile is enough to scare away the novice listener.Jimi's first two records (Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love)were jam packed with short rocking tunes and soulful ballads, but Ladyland is very much the opposite.That's not to say there aren't amazing songs here -- there are plenty -- but this release could have easily been distilled down to a single LP, and would have benefited from the results.I would guess Hendrix understood the failings of Ladyland, as First Rays of the Rising Sun (Cry of Love for us oldtimers) saw Jimi working in his more traditional format."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ELECTRIC LADYLAND EXPERIENCE","review":"EVERYTHING YOU WOULD EXPECT AND MORE FROM THE MAN JIMI HENDRIX CUT 4 VOODOO CHILE,CUT 16 VOODOO CHILE SLIGHT RETURN AAHH MAN THIS CD IS AWSOME-LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL, GYPSY EYES ALL THE SONGS ROCK IN THIS COLLECTION GET IT NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"probably Jimi's best!","review":"I think out of the 3 \\"Experience\\", albums, this one's the best.

After listening to EL for the first time, I had no doubt in my mind that we were listening to a modern legend. If you want blues, soul and hard rock, this album fits each bill to a tee.

However, Electic Ladyland is almost embarrassingly awful in certain songs. Voodoo Chile and Watchtower are among the classics of rock, but a good deal of the balance of the album sounds off-key, is badly sung (especially the backing vocals) and has some weak attempts to be pyschedelic. It comes off as sophomoric at best. It now sounds cheesy and dated. Hendrix is best when he exploits his strengths--straight-forward bluesy rock, augmented by fantastically creative and skillful guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electric Ladyland","review":"An exelent album, however the CD manufacturer messed up the track running order. i.e side one and four on disc one followed by side two and three on disc two.

On top of those hits there is some deep experimentation songs on this album as well with songs like \\"1983...(A Mermaid I should Turn To Be), \\"Rainy Day, Dream Away\\", and \\"Still Raining, Still Dreaming\\" and of course as some blues on the album with \\"Voodoo Chile.\\". All that is on this album what's there to hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"Jimi Hendrix is the king of rock, but this cd just doesn't cut it. It's to soft and mellow.

Thirty years have done nothing to dim this mixture of musicianship, creativity, and raw energy. From laid back jazzy funk in \\"Rainy Day\\" and pure power in \\"Come On\\" through spaced-out dream visions in \\"1983.\\" And try listening to \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\" with a Dolby Pro Logic system - the guitar swoops AROUND your head in full circles.

Just about everyone was stunned when this album was released. There was a lot of criticism of the album. It just wasn't what the radio stations, or Rolling Stone Magazine, wanted from Jimi. It took a little time before they came to realize how amazing, and how Great, this double-LP album was. When the greatest guitar player in the world, leading one of the most popular bands of the time, makes a double album of mainly experimental music, he was bound to be criticized. Thankfully, the idea of such criticisms did not stop the band from creating this truly great album and, thankfully, Jimi had become such a big star that the record company allowed him to make the album. A Masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A venture into Electric Ladyland.","review":"Elctric ladyland by Jimi hendrix is perhaps his greatest triumph. The incendiary guitar sounds, melodic bass, and poly-rhythmed drums provide an incredible backround music for the mind. Though this may not have as many catchy tunes as \\" Are you Experienced\\", or as many ballads as : \\"Axis : Bold as Love\\", this album celebrated love, equality, and music as an art form. Rather than trying to achieve critical acclaim, Hendrix, Mitchell, and Rhedding seem to be tring to define what and how an instrument is to played, and what classifies an album as rock n' roll. If you are a fan of the pop songs \\" Fire\\" and \\"Foxy Lady\\", hit the road! However, if you enjoy Hendrix's more poetic and musical side this album is a must have !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimi doesn't smoke, he burns","review":"Sprawling set of Jimi's most diverse sounds, and one of the best albums of the 1960's. Electric Ladyland was the third installment from the maestro's, doing whatever he damn well felt like, including 2 songs over 10 minutes, both of which (Voodoo Chile and 1983) are the album's highlights. Like Jimi's first two albums, Electric Ladyland has short songs that sound great on the radio (Crosstown Traffic and All Along the Watchtower). But unlike his earlier albums, Jimi spreads his wings here, jamming with guest players on Voodoo Chile in what sounds like a smokey bar in the early morning hours. Hendrix was a master in the studio, had a good pop sense and knew how to experiment without putting the listener to sleep. \\"1983\\" sounds like it was recorded underwater and includes an unforgettable bass line that guides the listener into the depths of the sea, or so it sounds that way. Sadly, Jimi's last studio album."},{"rating":"2","title":"real good","review":"i liked this disc alot but not as much as the first two.Jimi has strong moments such as Little miss strange,crosstown traffic,vodoo chile,&the great remake of Bob Dylan's all along the watchtower which after Jimi did it you forgot about Dylan's version.this is a good solid record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of it is Hendrix at his Absolute best","review":"Jimi Hendrix did manage to create one of the best three rock albums of all time and this is arguably his pinnacle. While definitly not as influential as his debut but difinitly a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grandiose Rock Experience","review":"Electric Ladyland is a much grander experience than Hendrix's other 2 studio albums. This is made evident immediately with the bold electronic number \\"And the Gods made Love\\". Songs like \\"Crosstown Traffic\\" and \\"Littls Miss Strange\\" are compact and more in the mold of the \\"Are you Experienced\\" album. The rest of the album is a sweeping, dreamy trip. Hendrix's guitar winds its way throughout driving rock like \\"Gypsy Eyes\\" and \\"Come on (let the good times roll)\\", then switching to the more psychedelic \\"1983\\". Finishing the album is the impeccable duo of \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" and \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\". Both are rock classics, particularly Watchtower, which makes Bob Dylan's original sound like a nursery rhyme by comparison. This is the most experimental of Hendrix's 3 albums and it is the one that will ultimately reward the guitar fan the most. Having said that, Ladyland remains very accessable. This is a Rock Classic. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful album. A MUST-HAVE!","review":"After I heard this album, I was blown away. Musically, this surpasses Are You Experienced. There is not one bad track on this entire album. \\"...And the Gods made love\\", \\"Moon turn the tides...\\" and \\"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\\" are short, experimental tunes, while \\"Voodoo Chile\\" and \\"1983\\" are beautiful flawless epics. Other standout tracks are \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\", \\"All Along The Watchtower\\", \\"Crosstown Traffic\\" and the Noel Redding penned \\"Little Miss Strange\\". This should be on everybody's top 10 list of greatest albums. If you do not have this classic album already then waste no more time reading this and go buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing can prepare you for electric ladyland ...","review":"its amazing how each track on this album weeves together to create a continual flow, where the album never hangs or becomes boring because there's something new assaulting your ears.hendrix's voice is mellow and slides over the song almost as well as his fingers slide over the frets.one of, if not the, best of the hendrix albums released during his lifetime. 1983 is a true epic like stairway to heaven or freebird (not because its over 10 min. long, but because of the sincerity of the lyrics and of the guitar playing).hendrix was always good at throwing together a song that would sound terrible if done by anyone below his caliber.the two most notable tracks are of course voodoo chile and voodoo chile (slight return), probably hendrix's most popular songs ever. but actually pretty much every, if not every, track is worth listening to and none of them lack the amount of musical genius that was jimi hendrix."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Hendrix albums of all-time!","review":"Electric Ladyland Jimi's third album and the last with his Experienced band. Has all the greatest rock song classics that pushes to the element of psychedelic music like \\"Gypsy Eyes\\", \\"Crosstown Traffic\\" and \\"All Along The Watchtower\\".

It has some of the best songs jimi ever wrote: voodoo child, voodoo chile, all along the watch tower, come on let the good times role etc but every song is perfect. He uses many tricks with his guitar to create sounds you can only dream of, breaking boundaries and reaching deep into your sole.There is AMAZING use of wah and slide in all along the watch tower and the absolute bluesy power of voodoo child is second to none - inspirational.Being a guitar player you may think i am biased but if you tear your poisoned minds away from the simplistic dance music of today you will be amazed at what you can find. the songs seem to flow directly from jimi's mind, he uses the guitar only as an instrument to express himself - it is art. This is the most listened to album in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"this is a great album, although I have 2 questions:how long was \\"Moon, turn the tides...gently gently away\\" on the origninal LP? was it still part of 1983, has it EVER been part of 1983?

It is far more adventerous than his other albums, and has a great cohension and feel to it.The songs connect together well, the playing is first rate throught, and there are great guest apperances by artists like Buddy Miles (later to join the Band of Gypsys) from Electric Flag, Steve Winwood, Dave Mason, and Jim Capalidi from Traffic, plus Jack Cassidy of Jefferson Airplane, possibly the best bassist out there.The album artwork is cool, but the vinyl version that is just now being pressed is really out of sight! I reccomend this disc, but if you have a record player, buy the vinyl, if not the CD is just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has to be","review":"I don't like this whole CD which was once a double album. But that doesn't matter. The parts I do like make up for the ones I don't. 1983 , A Merman I Should Be and Moon Turn the Tides are a journey into strange rock and roll depths. This is heavy guitar, the kind only Hendrix can play. I don't have to mention songs like, \\"All Along the Watchtower\\", \\"Crosstown Traffic\\" and \\"Voodoo Child\\", you're probably familiar with them. I wish this album had the only Hendrix song that I'd like to find on CD and can't; \\"Trash Man\\", from \\"Midnight Lightning\\". But this album has a life of its own.

Also comparing them side by side to the Past Masters versions you can hear the inferior recording. They don't sound bad exactly just not as clear & not in stereo. The packaging is another issue. Its' a cardboard sleeve (JUst like the LP). It is a beautifuly produced package with a high gloss cover , but for some reason they decided to make it bigger than the Jewell box.

If you ask me, I think that Hendrix made the best albums in the last 50 years, and it's probably best illustrated on Are You Experienced.The songs on this album are so brilliantly coloured, just like a blast from a firework or something.

His playing was sloppy and he only created sounds, his solos were boring and easy to play. My friend does play guitar very well and he can play every solo on this CD easiely. Jimi Hendrix was never the master of guitar solos, he basically created crazy and wierd sounds out of guitar and made people wonder how he got those sounds.If you're looking for great guitar-based albums buy Led Zeppelin II, Back in Black, or Sticky Fingers and skip Jimi hendrix.

This is pure greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"a brilliant first album by mr hendrix","review":"when i first heard this album about six months ago i was impressed but not blown away. being a fan of grunge, thrash rock and a little punk, among other things, i had gotten my fill of the electric guitar, played by skilled musicians and otherwise. if anyone shares this initial impression of hendrix, you need to listen a little closer, nobody plays guitar like he does and nobody ever will, its just that simple. the skill, passion and brilliance shown on this cd by hendrix and the experiece has never been displayed in this way, buy this album you will experience somthing unique"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless.","review":"This is the CD version of \\"Are You Experienced\\". It has everything that was featured on both the US and UK LPs. Yes, you heard right, there were 2 different LPs. All songs have been remastered, or at least they were supposed to be. Some songs sound amazing and some aren't all that special. Anyway...this is a great CD and the only major flaw I found, is that the lyrics for about 4 of the songs are different from how they are listed in the paper slip. But, that doesn't matter now, if you're a fan you know the right lyrics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hendrix Debuts With A Bang","review":"With ARE YOU EXPERIENCED, Jimi Hendrix's blend of blues, funk, R&B, and hard rock debuts spectacularly. This album came out in different versions here and abroad, so this version contains everything from both versions. Hendrix's guitar is positively inciendary, and the rhythm section is white hot. Truly a must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is for Mr. MTV","review":"Listen kid, what they play on MTV probably is MUZIK. But JimiHendrix played MUSIC, REAL MUSIC.

Jimi isn't as recognized as a lyric writer as he should be.This album is a great place to start for any budding Hendrix fan. From here you should head to Axis: Bold as Love(my personal favorite) Then Head for Electric LadylandI'd recomend \\"Voodoo chile: the best of jimi hendrix\\" instead of this,because it has live tracks, and because it has all of the best songs from Are you experienced, besides Foxey Lady. Which is why you should stick with Are You Experienced. Foxey Lady is one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best ever !","review":"without a doubt this is one of the greatest rock albums ever. everyone should have a copy of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Six String","review":"Some of these reviews are ridiculous, including you Axl. This album is one of the most important and influential albums ever released. Jimi Hendrix was the greatest guitar player who ever lived. I've studied his moves, watched him in slow motion, and still can't pull off some of the stuff he did. The man was the Zen Master of Guitar.This album is one of the finest works ever. Purple Haze, Hey Joe, and Foxy Lady may have been the most popular, but Third Stone from the Sun has always been a favorite of mine. No one could do a songh like that.I was born the year Hendrix died, but I've been a life-long fan. Jimi is the inspiration for almost every guitar player, from sold-out stadiums to garages. Ask any guitar player who 'The Greatest' is and 99% will say Hendrix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound and Imaging","review":"I only had to listen to one song and it just sounded wrong! The digital influence is screamingly blatant or else someone just didnt know what they were doing in the analog realm. At each wave of music you can hear some type of filter squeezing the sound inward almost like some type of weird dolby, but worse. This is the opposite of what you are looking for if you are buying vinyl. Some background noise would be more welcome than sepnding $25 for a degradable digital version of this classic. I mean someone might not \\"get it\\" if they hear an off version the first time. I think I may be done with these reissues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!! My favorite Hendrix album!!","review":"Are You Experienced is one of the all-time great rock albums. Jimi Hendrix shows us that he is not only a genius on guitar but a skilled songwriter as well. My favorite tunes on this album are Purple Haze, Fire, Foxey Lady, the title cut, and Hey Joe. Great album!! Just buy it!Also, be sure to get the Experience Hendrix re-release of this album. The sound has been wonderfully remastered in stereo surround, and it sounds amazing!! Get yourself a Dolby Pro Logic speaker system and crank this CD. IT ROCKS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ARRIVAL OF THE ALL-POWERFUL MESSIAH","review":"Thanks to Jimi Hendrix we have rock, heavy metal and EVERY sub-genre derived from them. So be it alternative, rap-rock or even death-metal, IT ALL CAME FROM HENDRIX. In the late 60's no one was even close to Jimi in sheer innovation, and NO ONE HAS BEEN SINCE. There are some people that love alternative rock and rap-metal and dare in their ignorance to dis Jimi. You don't show disrespect for the wellspring from whence came that which you love - that is just immature and shows a complete and utter lack of musical history knowledge and therefore a distorted perspective. Approximately 3 and a half decades later, and Jimi's influence is still felt, his music still resonates, alive and vibrant as ever. This record was the birth of the Messiah, the Holy Conception, as it were. The world stood on its ear, and we have not yet fully recovered. Hail the King of Rock Guitar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you experienced?","review":"excellent hendrix. just the right amount of soul-close your eyes you can see them in concert.

It is, however, a very good album, from front to back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound rip off","review":"I love Jimi Hendrix and I was really excited to buy this album on sale. But all of my excitement vanished when I heard the whole album. The quality of the recording is very poor. You cannot hear Jimi's lyrics on The Wind Cries Mary or Foxey Lady. Maybe the master recording of this CD is in better condition but I don't suggest you run out and buy this CD. It's a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As Ya Might Think","review":"Everybody goes \\"Ooh, Jimi Hendrix\\" just because he died. I don't think his music is particularly good. In fact, some of it stinks!!! And, I'm sick and tired of people calling hard rock or metal. HE IS NOT!!! Why can't people get used to that fact. He's just really soul with some rock influnces. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but I'm tired of seeing heavy metal lists with him in them. Some of the songs on this album are okay, like 'Purple Haze' and 'Fire', but a lot of them are not really rock at all. Psychedelic trash, some of it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and So Dated","review":"Time Waits for no one, and this album is the proof why.

Jimmy Page could play one of this guy's solos with his eyes closed. Hey Joe is the only decent song on this album. This guy is way overatted just because he died young.

Listen to Led Zeppelin or something if you want to hear good classic rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this NOW","review":"I am a HUGE Jimi Hendrix fan and have many jimi cds, but this has got to be one of the greatest! This is jimi at his finest and it deserves a listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could give this 100 stars.....","review":"This CD is the best CD ever. I could go through this whole CD at least 10,000 times without skipping one song and without getting tired of it. Jimi Hendrix is, if not the best, definatley one of the best guitarists ever. I recommend this CD to newcomers to Jimi Hendrix and hardcore fans, except if you are a hardcore fan you should definatley already have this CD. This CD is by far Jimi Hendrix's best work. It is even at least 10 times better than Jimi Hendrix: Experience Hendrix (Greatest Hits). If you like great guitar songs that have amazing vocals and lyrics then get this CD! The sound quality is also unbelievable, I thought I was in the studio, absolutely great. If you get this CD, you will not be disappointed one bit!

The guitar god! What a sham. Yes,Jimi Hendrix was one of the greatest guitarest that ever lived, but he wasn't a guitar revolutionary he was an effects revolutionary. He made the guitar sound weird with a wah-wah and fuzz, what's the big deal. To me this whole album is a jam using new \\"techniques\\" to ad an edge and that's it an edge. I'll admit many numbers get me going, but this album is no different from any other Moby Grape or Stepenwolf (not to say these bands are bad). By far though, the worst thing on this album are the lyrics, they're senseless readings of psychelic words and discriptions of drug trips. In fact I think the most revolutionary thing about this album is Mitch Mitchel's druming. I'm not saying the album is bad it's actually very good it's just one of the most over-rated albums ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy for money","review":"Classic Americana that money can't define.

This is my favorite Hendrix album, it's great from the first song to the last.In my younger days of learning the guitar, I wore out this album listening and learning every song. The sound quality is good and the songs are even better.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Rock n Roll Ever","review":"This has got to be on of the greatest rock n roll CDs of time. I have been reading all the reviews for this album and all his others, and people have only been mentioning a few of the songs. Obviously his incredibly famous (and rightfully so) Purple Haze, Fire and Foxey Lady. And his other well known masterpieces Hey Joe, Are You Experienced, and Red House- all pretty damn good too. But not a single reviewer mentioned what is my favorite song- THIRD STONE FROM THE SUN. This is basically an instrumental with a few little mumblings, but the guitaring is just ineffable. He is truly the greastest guitarist of all time, and everybody should own this CD, no matter what your musical preference is. I listen mostly to underground and old school hip hop (the stuff that's not about guns) and only own a handful of rock CDs and I am about buy all his other recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This CD is a perfect mix of rock and blues, and Jimi's soloing is some of the best I've ever heard.

Just kidding! This album (CD) should be in everyone's collection of rock music. Not only does it contain an inspiring collection of guitar, vocal (who said Jimi can't sing?), and lyrical offerings, but it even contains \\"hits\\" from the pop charts. In this CD, Jimi was able to sell his genius to the masses, something that few have achieved."},{"rating":"2","title":"explosive debut","review":"Jimi Hendrix was without category.you can't define his genius any one style of music he was all kinds of music all at once.this debut is very explosive.lets be real most first albums aren't that great less more classics.but as usual with Jimi he breaks the norm.starting out with Purple Haze,Hey Joe,Foxey Lady,The wind cries mary.what a diverse mix of music? Jimi was always ahead of the curve and this disc shows why.this disc showcases why he is one of the greatest musical forces the world has ever known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimi's debut","review":"Jimi Hendrix is without question the greatest instrumentalist in rock history. On this album he transcends effortlessly through the boundaries of rock, funk, psychedelia, blues and jazz all with remarkable ease. Every song is thoughtful, every solo is meticulous in its construction. Are You Experienced is the hungry debut of a music icon. To not own and respect the influence of this album, is to glorify any other rock music you listen to at a cost to Jimi's creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good cable","review":"For me, this cable did not work at all.

Though I have always wanted a Biesemeyer, I cannot complain about the perfect performance this rail has given me. The tubular steel construction is immensely strong. The fence glides easily along its length and locks down solidly with zero deflection. The only thing about this fence rail system that I would change is the fence itself, not the rail (I do still wish for the Biesemeyer's easy ability to accept jigs onto its square shape).

And then...The thing melted after using it for a few months. Shorted out my whole lighting system, and caused me to lose all indicator lights until I removed it.Lest you think I just screwed up installing it, I did it twice. And this is not my first trailer wiring harness. It's pretty idiot proof, the plugs only line up one way.

Okay, I can hear the influence of Heroic Doses and 5style, but it seems that they take the best elements of those bands and combine it with their previous somber and moody style. Jacobsen's tube-saturated, imaginative guitar lines, Rapsys's aggresive, uninhibited drumming and Macri's melodic, in-the-pocket basslines combine for a cool cocktail that goes down like a Mint Julep on a hot day.

They used to be mostly mellow, and somewhat Tortoise-y (yes I know, every reviewer of them makes note of this, but -- that's because it's true!). This album sounds erratic, and not in a really good way. It seems that they have taken the haywire guitar sounds of 5ive style and Heroic Doses and tried to mix it in with their sound.

Plus it might work better with other strollers. We were kind of stuck for somthing and 2 day shipping worked great while we weere on vacation, so that is kind of a positive that we were able to get it that fast.I think we are going to be stuck with ordering the Bugaboo umberella, I just hope it works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We'd bought this for our stroller that the car seat attaches to as it has no additional shade provided.

I can't really compare \\"Shorter Faster Louder\\" with the first release because they are both so good, and similar. A lot of the songs are short and fast (no suprise) and are over in less than a minute. There's one cover (try to figure the words out; impossible) and a few guest singers. I was suprised at the political content of a few songs from such a fun band. I mean nothing too deep, but they touch on a few issues like police brutality. If you like the frist album and the split with 88FL then you should definately pick this up. If it took reading this review to convince you of that, something's wrong. Late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Kid Dynamite is probably one of the best bands to come out of the Hardcore Punk scene in the nineties. As the title suggests, their songs are short, loud and fast. With the guitar and bass compliment each other well, and Jason Shevchuk's vocals are honestly my favorite of the Punk Genre. If you're into \\"punk\\" bands like Green Day I bet you wouldn't like these guys but if you enjoyed Rise Against's Early albums (Revolutions Per Minute/The Unraveling) or you're into the Melodic Hardcore scene this band is definitely one to check out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Avail would sound like if they didn't suck.","review":"Very cool stuff.

This bag is perfect. My dog loved the bag, and found it very relaxing in the carrier. On the plane and even at the airport she made little noise and enjoyed sleeping in her bag, with the cozy little mat in there. The carrier fits well under the seat in front of you, and most people won't even suspect you have a dog in what appears to be a duffle bag. The bag has a comfortable shoulder strap, and is easy to carry. Additionally, there are separate pockets to store a passport, or wallet in, so it makes a nice carry on when traveling with a pet. This is a very good quality product which both you and your pet will enjoy. I have traveled a fair bit with mine over the last year and it is still in great shape! Overall, the best value out there for a pet carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly underrated","review":"This is a dressier style chrono that is an exceptional value considering the fact that it uses the same movement (Valjoux 7750) found in a Tag Heuer Carrera ($2695).

A man is accused of killing two wives. The bodies haven't been found. Still, a trial is held and the defendant is found guilty.This could have been written in 50-75 pages, instead of rehashing the same events to the point of boredom.The book does have one redeeming line on page 270, \\"There really are monsters out there.\\" Monsters is the key word.

In addition to these CDs, I'm using a text book to learn grammar and writing. If you are using a different approach, this review might not be very useful.Working on the Pimsleur CDs definitely has improved my speech and listening skills quite a bit. They also have some useful vocabulary on them, although that wasn't a primary goal. I would give this product 5 stars, but I think they should add more indexing to the CDs. There are two tracks per CD, and fast-forwarding and moving backwards are a lot more annoying than they should be.I haven't used any competing products, so I can't do any comparisons. I don't think that these CDs would work well as a substitute for a text book, but that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst, not good, either","review":"If you want to learn \\"Do you speak Russian\\", No, I do not speak Russian\\" for six CD's, this is the product for you.

Anyway, I'm excited about learning Russian and I owe it to the Pimsleur method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely elementary","review":"The CDs in this package are very easy to follow, but the knowledge you gain is very elementary.

But that's all I've really learned, and one of the most intimidating features of Russian is the alphabet.The pronunciation is easy to follow, and the repetitiveness will ensure that these phrases are etched into your memory forever.

I am only on the 4th lesson of Pimsleurs conversational and I can already understand more and respond in Russian. You have to be patient and you cant just do each lesson once, you may have to listen to each lesson two, three or four times.

The Pimsleur set is far and away the worst. As another reviewer has already commented, the conversation never advances beyond the first converstaion, about whether you are American and whether you speak Russian. Other CDs cover this in the first dialogue. Also unacceptable that there is no written book or pamphlet accompanying, since you have a new alphabet to learn.I was surprised by the bad quality, because I was quite satisfied with the Pimsleur-Albanian, which I used previously.I think the best Russian set I bought was the book and 2-CD set called \\"Teach Yourself Russian.\\" The book is so helpful that I am now using it in class with my Russian teacher. Also good is \\"Learn Russian in Your Car,\\" although it spends more time on vocabulary, and less on dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, bad, bad, bad, BORING! Stay Away!","review":"Well, only watched about 25 minutes of this, and I'd say that was being generous.The movie starts out with a retarded battle sequence which lasts WAY WAY too long in every way possible. The best part is when a guy throws a grenade, the camera zooms in on the grenade as it lands, where you can clearly see that it still has the handle on it, then the explosion. And then the shooting, and running away, and shooting, and running away, and yet somehow in all that shooting they manage to get in some of the corniest B-movie dialogue ever.The beginning part of this movie was so bad I was not about to take the chance that it would get better. What a bad movie. I can't imagine anybody having enough time in their life that they can afford to sit down, waste their time, and watch this poop.Run away. Run far away from this movie.

The way this film examines the strength of the friendship between Chow, Man and Yip is excellent and the tension created by the impending danger of the Japanese is well realised. This would have to rank as one of Chow Yun-Fat's strongest performances and Alex Man has never been better. With Ceilia Yip also putting in a quality performance, this is an all-round classic. It reminded me of some of Chang Cheh's best films and for anyone who appreciates Hong Kong cinema, that should be praise enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Chow Yun-fat's best movie","review":"One of Chow's best movie in his earlier career.

All of the \\"miracles\\" of Sai Baba are uncritically described as the result of demonic power. Yet each and every one of Sai Baba's miracles are reproducable by any number of professional stage magicians. While I am pleased Mr. Brooke left the cult, I fear he exhibits an entirely too naive view of alleged occult power. Baba is nothing more than a con artist, plain and simple. That alone should warn people off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great breath, fair depth","review":"The 3rd edition is much improved providing great breath of topic coverage. On the downside the coverage of extended stored procedures is one page so this is not a programmers book. It is one of those books that has something to say about everything SQL Server could possibly be employed to do, and that makes it unique. IMHO the publisher should break this book into a 3-4 book series and work on adding depth in future editions. Buy other books for depth at this time such as Soukup's for insights and background, SQL Server Programming for programming and England's book on Performance and Optimization and Tuning if interested. I'm a 25+ year programmer in 15 or so languages (prefering C & C++) and believe SQL is pretty easy to pick up if you are willing to read 5-6 good books.

This book was a wonderful influence on me and really did help me to grow in my understanding of the world of theatre, dance, and literature. I still think of this book when I read or see A Midsummer Night's Dream and the philosophy about acting that you should say exactly what is written because the author wrote it the way they wanted it has influence me both as a playwright and actor.This book presents a wonderfully bright world for a child, especially one that is interested in the arts.

I had left the book here, so I decided to read it. I ended up wishing I'd read it earlier! This book not only has a good plotline, i.e. the main characters becoming sisters by accident and vowing to make their name important, and such, but it also adresses real issues like death and financial difficulty and shows how the main characters manage to cope throughout it all.

I kept waiting for the story to chose a direction and stick with it, but it never does. Rather, it goes in four or five different directions. The language is overly course, even for someone like myself who has uttered a few choice phrases in his life. It reminded me of several books that I read as an undergraduate in college, the likes of which that a professor or TA would go crazy over-analyizing, pointing out every possible metaphor, analogy, etc. This is not to say that the book is horrible.

I'm all for character development and relationships between characters. It's not really the romance that bothers me. I just don't think Romance authors write as well as TRUE mystery writers.

This backpack does the job. It's well-constructed and tough, even after washing. The fabric is durable and the pockets are well-designed for a few simple items - for example, you can keep your phone and plastic cards separate from your bigger items. I've used the Jansport full-size bags and liked them, this one is a half-size version. It turned out to be a great hiking bag for short day hikes - I like to pack the absolute minimum I can get away with, so I appreciate its small size when I'm only going to be out on the trail for a few hours. My toddler grandson saw it and wanted one, and it's been a super school bag for him too. As a pre-schooler, he's got stuff he carries around, and this fits him to a T, and is tough and washable. There are tougher bags out there, but not at this price. For normal family use, I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Backpack","review":"This is the 2nd Half Pint I have owned.

I was worried that the straps would be \\"child sized\\" but they are plenty long enough to be easily adjustable to fit a short or tall person.

I use this phone as a replacement for a landline. The VOIP service call quality is superior to the QWEST landline that I used to have. The setup for the base station was simply to plug it into the router. I had no issues with the handsets, including the extra one. The documentation was poor for registering the additional handset. It came up as unregistered, and then would not complete the registration with the base. After visiting the netgear website, I had to hold down the power button on the base for 15 seconds, and the registration was successful. I chose this phone over the phillips 841 because of the availability of additional handsets. I would recommend reading the user guide prior to purchase. I got a great deal at Frys for the base unit and handset.

If you are trying to add an extension to your existing Netgear SPH200D phone system you will need the base unit to keep the phone functional. I don't know why they send you a \\"power adapter\\" since the phone does not have this type of connection. The power adapter only plugs in to the base charger, which they don't send.I bought this phone to replace an existing phone whose display screen got cloudy, so it will work for me, since I already have the charger base.The phone itself is great, but is useless with the base charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better ways to do it...","review":"I purchased this several years ago so I could use Skype for my home phone service.

I didn't have unrealistic expectations going into the movie. I thought it would be good but nothing more. I was pleasantly surprised that it was so amazing. I don't personally identify with the characters or the plot, yet I empathize. The acting was extremely organic, yet not directed and produced in a cheap, film-student-esque way. This film is so low budget yet it packs the punch of a billion dollar film. My hat is off to the cast and the producer and editor. The music is on point as well. Everything is just about perfect in this movie. I would give it 10 stars if I could. It reminded me of when I saw Aronofsky's first films' \\"Pi\\" and \\"Requiem for a dream\\". I just instantly connected and was immersed. Same thing happened here, but I liked Bellflower even more than Aranofsky's films (forgive me Darren I still love your work)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very worthy Spirit Award nominee","review":"I likely would not have seen this movie had it not been nominated for two 2012 Spirit Awards (the John Cassavetes' Award and Best Cinematography). The storyline was not wildly original but then it was not as damningly prosaic as some reviewers paint it. What struck me was the brutal honesty of the piece. The dialogue and acting are true to the characters, and the strong buddy element between Woodrow and Aiden was a strong hook that emotionally dealt me into the story.I'm also a huge fan of David Lynch, and which I wouldn't characterize this film as Lynchian, it definitely had the disorienting flavor of a Lynch movie. The cinematography was especially tasty. This could have been shot on some outrageously expensive Genesis (or a Grass Valley Viper) but no, and that's why it should win the Best Cinematography award. Look for more and even better stuff from this director and DP Joel Hodge."},{"rating":"2","title":"SP298 Loving It!","review":"Works great.

Regardless of our particular faiths this book can help us all understand the triumph of the human spirit. Ms. Rosenblatt's book is truly a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful spiritual journey","review":"Naomi is a psychotherapist, lecturer, and adult bible class teacher.A unique study of the old testament teachings to help with our personal spiritual journey. How we should live our lives according to God. How we can shape the way we live and teach or children through the Patriarchs. The book starts with the creation; the order. Then moves to the flood and the descendants; from Abraham to Joseph. Beautifully written. Will never be dated.Wish you wellScott"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only of interest because Stratten is in it...","review":"Suppose this is a must-have if one is an avid Stratten fan. I'll agree she demonstrates some potential that might have translated into her becoming a decent actress had she lived. Not an Oscar-caliber actress, but a DECENT actress. Outside of that, I really didn't find this flick all that interesting. Then again, I'm really not into bondage/women-in-chains/sex-slave type films. This type of movie, along with the Playboy stuff, are indicative of the kinds of entertainment Stratten was hoping to leave behind as her career moved forward, and the abuse she portrays in this movie is all the more disconcerting considering the types of real-life relationships she had and the way she died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every frame is a work of art.","review":"There are a lot of whispers and hushed tones from the actors. You will need subtitles. That is a suggestion more than a warning, but I cannot list that as a criticism because, frankly, I'm not qualified to review this film. I loved it, but I love excessively artistic films that use ugly and obscure imagery, if you can't say the same you shouldn't watch this. More importantly, if you don't have a strong background in the visual arts you will end up too overwhelmed to offer any in depth critique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow but beautiful.","review":"I purchased this because the synopsis was interesting to me, and even though I thought the imagery was beautiful and eerie, I felt like this fell a little flat.The plot seemed paper-thin to me. I watched it with my girlfriend and it was very hard to follow. The ending was strange and obscure, and we wound up 'not getting' most of the movie.I know that some reviews have said that there is a lot of symbolism in this film, but I still fail to see it. When I write, I use a lot of symbolism, and if there actually is some of this going on in the film, it was so bizarre that I completely overlooked it.The film left me a little bored overall, but I plan on giving it a second chance anyway. After all, I did purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very young review on The WineCoff Fire","review":"I'm a college student and I was working and I ran across this book. My father is a fireman and I have always been interested in the stories that he tells but he has never mentioned this tragic story. So I read the book and was completely shocked. I couldn't believe that something that aweful had happened and I had never heard about it. I think that it was well written and that the victums of that deadly fire have some justice now because it tells what they were going through. It gives young people like myself the chance to look back at history and see what went wrong. I was deeply moved by this book and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remember this fire as a 5 year old.","review":"I remember this fire as my Mother was very upset, as were most of the residents of Copperhill and nearby Ducktown, Tenn. where a victim, Ms. Lena Harris lived. I remember being a small boy and the grave concern in our household as the radio reports came in from the casualties.I first saw this book while visiting a friend in Ducktown, Tenn. in his home which, ironically, is the house where Ms. Lena Harris lived in an upstairs bedroom rented from my friend's Grandmother.In addition to the tragedy of the fire, this excellent book gives rise to much thought concerning the motives and actions of our elected officials when faced with a choice between the common good of citizens, and politics as usual. Mayor Hartsfield should have been proscuted for inaction and the ignoring of expert opinions form fire experts of the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical event that should be remembered","review":"This book is a great tribute to the victims and firefighters of the Winecoff. The tragedy is factually described without being sensationalized. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the worst hotel fire in U.S. history. I'm so glad we were able to obtain a copy from the author. Thank you for writing this book and preserving the memory of those involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Joni Mitchell","review":"I love Joni Mitchell, and had just gone to a Joni Mitchell tribute, and only had tapes, so it is wonderful to now have some Joni Mitchell cd's.

Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quietly beautiful...","review":"I agree with everyone that Joni has made better albums, and that she was just discovering her greatness. However, I also think that with the exceptions of Blue and Court and Spark, there are no other Joni albums I would rather put in and listen to staight through. All of the songs fit together so beautifully that is is hard not to lie back and have a simple moment of perfect contentness while listening to this album. This is one of my favorite albums for when I just want to feel something powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improving on brilliance","review":"Joni Mitchell/ Clouds: Her first album was brilliant. This (her second) is even better than that. This album includes her great \\"Chelsea Morning\\", \\"Songs to aging Children Come\\" and \\"Both sides now\\" songs. The remaining songs on the album are just as strong. This is a Masterpiece, and her next few would be even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant! Typical Joni Mitchell.","review":"The selection 'That Song about The Midway' is worth the price of the album alone. the rest is great also including 'Chelsea Morning', 'The Gallery', and 'Both Sides Now'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic beauty","review":"With a sole guitar and her voice, Joni Mitchell has achieved perfection. Showing lyrical power reminiscent of Bob Dylan, she has described some incredibly lovely and tragic scenes. Of course her original version of Both Sides Now is THE version, no disrespect meant to Judy Collins. The Gallery still gives me the chills. Listening to this depresses me extremely, though, to think of how Joni's voice is a bare shadow of this incredible work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nine Minutes","review":"I lasted nine minutes before I shut it off and put on a different DVD. There's not much I can add to what everyone else has said in criticism of this DVD. If it were just boring and repetitive, I would still keep it and occasionally do it. But Ms. Rocker's CONSTANT never-shutting-up coupled with her uncomfortable cranky arrogance were too much for me. I was begging her to shut up at four minutes and couldn't take it any more at nine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough","review":"I like this workout because it is tougher than most walking workouts.

Buy that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody turn off the talking","review":"I bought this video hoping for something I could do when it rains and I cannot walk outside. I saw the positive reviews on this one and decided to give it a try. The workout is good - the constant, droning chatter is not. If they had designed this video like the New York Ballet video I would have been very happy (In the NY City Ballet Video you can turn off the talking after you've mastered the exercises, while keeping the music). All in all I gave this a 2 star rating because it may be better than nothing (although I have wondered).

That is, until I got a little older (45) and started to get the dreaded \\"lipstick feathering\\". I began trying all kinds of lip liners, lip conditioners, lip primers....only to find that they didn't really work. Once I tried Superstay, that was it. The color never bleeds and the lip conditioner is great. I won't use anything else now. I have tried other 12 hour type lipsticks and they only dried out my lips and made them feel terrible. I usually only use department store or Mary Kay makeup, but in this case, Maybelline Superstay is the best lipstick for me, summer or winter. I will only use this product now. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drys my lips OUT","review":"I bought the endless ruby color of this product and yes the color is beautiful on my lips. But after 4 hours my lips start to peel.

Usually I get a good bang for my buck with them. But their products have begun to really get mediocre. The eyeliner smears and this stuff is garbage... Here's why..No matter what you do, this lipstick doesn't stay put. It feathers, fades off, rubs off, slides, off, it just plum doesn't stay on your lips. I usually will get any dry skin off my lips with a wet toothbrush and have a \\"clean canvas\\". The applicator makes a mess and the product hardly stays in the lines. It takes forever to dry and when it does, its wanting to come off. Applying the clear coat makes it even worse and that's when the bad feathering begins. I can't even get through an hour of two of work without having to reapply this lipstick. I am so unhappy with this stuff and after buying it for many years, am about to throw my latest tube in the garbage and stop buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Icky-Sticky","review":"Shame on you Maybelline! I tried this product and it lasts alright - STICKS LIKE GLUE - LITERALLY! I applied the color and the followup gloss/conditioner and within 30 seconds wanted to remove it because it made my lips stick together - not just a bit - a lot! Thing is - 24 hours later I was still trying to remove it tried following their removal suggestions; I tried soap and water, cold cream - nothing worked. I returned it and got a refund.

If you go over the edge in which you will because its very runny. it will be hard to fix the stained mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lipstick, but not for 16 hours","review":"Honestly, I really like the lipstick. The color is nice, and it does last longer than traditional lipstick. But I wouldn't say it lasted 16 hours. After eating something, it wears off in the middle. Then your lips look paler in the center and pink around the outer age, which looks a little strange. I have pretty dry lips though, so it might just be me. But it does last longer than other lipsticks and doesn't transfer as easy. If you kiss someone, they'll only get the conditioning balm, not the lipstick. Overall, I recommend it. Just don't expect it to last 16 hours without a few touch ups during that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product..","review":"I ordered the Lilac color.

I thought the price was very reasonable compared to buying it at the drugstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wildly disappointed this is discontinued","review":"This has been a favority color and product for years, and the idea of it being discontinued is one of those cosmetic-world travesties. It has always been a popular shade and other colors that look quite similar don't \\"play\\" the same. SO now they hope I'll waste $50-75 trying out new shades til I find one--weary, lousy business... Anyway, for now, glad I was able to grab a few of these while still available. To be critical: the only downside is that if I very occasionally have some residue of something on my lips, when I apply the color it will \\"clump\\" in tiny flaking-off bits, which is truly unattractive, and then hard to remove (it is meant to be a long-lasting color, after all)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and easy","review":"This was the second time I have ordered lipstick from amazon.

You grow Jon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare example of a stellar band in concert.","review":"Forget the naysayers who complain about the recording quality or a mistake or two by the musicians here. This is an energetic,superb and sadly,rare example of Manfred Mann's Earth Band in concert in the 1970's. There are numerous bootlegs floating around out there that may indeed show the band on better nights, but this is the only show that is available officially. The interplay between the musicians is excellent and the energy is almost visible through the speakers for this show. MMEB were (and still are) a severely underrated and overlooked band. Radio shows like this should have broken them to a much bigger audience, by displaying their extraordinary musical chops far exceeded the public's perception that they \\"just covered other people's songs\\". Buy this if you're interested in a real band, who can play their instruments and improvise in a live setting. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lead Singers should be awake during concerts!","review":"Opinions: I was rather amazed to hear this live set of Manfred Mann's Earth Band. The jams feel uninspired. The instruments tend to just disappear into darkness. The vocal stylings are struggling to sound enthusiastic. Even the audience sounds like they left the arena after the announcement, \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, Manfred Mann's Earth Band.\\"The reason why I bought this was because I thought a band that could create that inventful instrumentation in the middle of their cover, Blinded by the Light, could be a band that may have some good live stuff.I was wrong.I think everyone was wrong here.I have listened to this CD possibly three times in order to give it a decent chance at survival.It's not good.Buy something else with your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the Hook Right From the Start","review":"I am not a fan of action espionage novels. But this one was so off the hook right from the start, I could not believe how much I enjoyed it!! The scenes and characters were so carefully crafted and detailed that I found myself squirming in my seat, helping Jack make his moves. I could close my eyes and actually see the fight scenes, feel the heat and humidity from the jungle. I gave up hours of sleep 'cause I couldn't put it down, even re-reading chapters because they were so powerful.No corny dialogue. No unrealistic love scenes. I dreamed this story long after I finished reading it. Mr. Robinson's vision through this novel is truly remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't store it","review":"Ok, it's my fault for not carefully reading the item description, but this stepladder can't be folded for storage.

His discussion of the tendency to seek easy villains without concern for truth is very useful to draw on when talking to people caught in the middle of a feeding frenzy - or even people just trying to plan for the inevitable day when there will be a crisis. I was reminded of reasons that many of us have left journalism ... That all said, one should quickly note that it's not just the media that create the frenzy - it's also all of us who consume the media. And now, many of the people who were formerly consumers can 'make' news themselves.

I normally buy diapers at BJs Wholesale which sell size 1 huggies for $30, which is the same as 4 packs of the size 1 on Amazon (same price too). But I have to pay for tax and transportation so in a way, I am actually saving by buying at Amazon!

A simply arranged index and organized by the original collection the typography is well laid out and one can easily browse and select a few poems to fit your mood, or find the lyrics for one of his songs.If you are looking for a definitive collection of Leonard Cohen, either for yourself or as a gift - this is it. Recommended.(For another artist who references Leonard Cohen in a humorous way, tryMomnipotent: Songs for Weary Parents. The song \\"Leonard Cohen's Never Gonna Bring My Groceries In\\" is hilarious and it will send you scrambling to find the poem it references. The rest of the album is also very good and is a terrific gift for new mothers.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"That's all I can say about this book -- WOW. I'm sure a poet as brilliant as Leonard Cohen could phrase it better, but that's the most concise review I can give.You're very aware as you read this book that you're discovered something special.

It is not used stateside. Here in the states, we use an NTSC format.What does any of this mean? The DVD I purchased was clearly meant for the European market. Unless you have a DVD and TV player with multisystem capabilities, you won't be able to play this particular film.I was disappointed that at the time I made this purchase, the ad for this film did not mention that it was in PAL format.

All in all it's a fun disc that has been overlooked ,even my 9 year old requests Black'N'Blue over today's radio forced fed junk so that says something for the music and writing itself.

I have owned a Kodak 1 megapixel camera, and have used it for over a year with excellent results. The Nikon, however, took a lot of tweaking to get average pictures. I took the camera in to a local camera shop, and tried it side by side versus some of the other 3 megapixel cameras (Canon, Olympus). The results were pretty shocking. All cameras were set to their highest resolution and set to \\"Auto,\\" and the pictures were taken by camera professionals. They were disappointed in what they were selling. The biggest disappointment I have is that the reviews I found on-line (dpreview.com, et al.) were very favorable towards this camera. If you are looking at a 3 megapixel camera, find a store that will let you try out several cameras FIRST, then buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as a Canon...","review":"I replaced a Canon Powershot S20 with the Coolpix. Even though I've only taken a few pictures (maybe 25) it clearly doesn't produce the same image quality with comparable file sizes.In normal mode (~700K JPGs) the Canon produced very sharp and balanced images. In comparison, the Nikon's pictures are blurry and look like they came from a digital camera. I tried higher quality modes (e.g. fine & high) with mediocre results.Overall I am not satisfied with the purchase and switch. The nicest feature of the Coolpix over the S20 is that you can attach various lenses to customize shooting. Lastly, comparing the two bodies (the Canon is metallic while the Nikon is plastic) leaves me feeling like I have a cheaper solution in my hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Becarefull","review":"I just recently bought a Nikon Cool Pix 880 From Best Buy.

If you use good water, this tea will last for a day or two without refrigeration, which changes it's flavor. I am in South Texas and we take our tea very seriously down here. This strong, brisk, hearty brew is just the thing on a hot summer afteroon. I haven't experienced stained teeth or other ill effects, either. Using a drip coffee maker to brew it keeps it from overheating and getting bitter. It's healthy, too, with plenty of antioxidants in it's orange/black pekoe blend.

Once you get the ratio right, you'll find it is delicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"delicious flavor loose brew tea","review":"Lipton loose tea is great for brewing iced tea or hot tea. Mellow yet intensely flavorful, this tea works very well with iced tea makers or coffee brewers. I wouldn't use a coffee maker that's been used for coffee, though, as the coffee effervescence will overpower the tea's flavor. My only gripe is I would like to see loose tea available in larger packages. Lipton used to sell it in one pound boxes, but now it's only available in 1/2 pound boxes. This six pack helps make up for the problem somewhat. We drink iced tea like some people drink their coffee: all the time! So loose tea works great for us (4 TBSP makes about a gallon) It's much easier than messing with a dozen or more tea bags per gallon.

I was fortunate enough to see the Green-era Mac at the time this album came out. Over a quarter of a century later it retains its power.

And when Buckingham and Nicks came onboard, the name was all that remained.Don't get me wrong. I actually liked some of the Buckingham/Nicks Fleetwood Mac material, especially in the first three albums. Classic tunes in their own right.

But the DVD only gives you a third of the fight card. You get the first round of the welterweight tourney and one alternate bout of the lightweight tournament and then the DVD ends as if that was the end of the PPV.I advise you don't buy this DVD set if you are in any way interested in seeing the FULL Bushido 9 fight card. Instead, buy all the dvds in the set individually. I'm going back now and purchasing Bushido 9 for a second time (to get the full fight card) and I'm not very happy about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing half of Vol. 9","review":"Bushido volume 9 might be the best MMA card ever put on, and this box set comes with it.So what's the issue you ask?

I scoop and have added litter, but no smell, and I have a very sensitive nose. My cat and I are both happy. It is amazing as I can see not having to toss it for at least two or three more weeks. I do want to add that I have another very expensive automated cat box, which if it wasn't so expensive, I'd toss in favor of the simplicity and lack of odor of this product. I do have one cat, but she had problems going in the \\"right\\" place. No more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitty litter wonderbox","review":"The jumbo litter wonderbox is great. This box works well for multiple cats. I like using the wonderbox because it doesn't have the odor like the regular litterboxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitty box review","review":"This is a great product. Depending on your cat, this could last from 1 week to one month. The \\"throw out decision\\" is based upon odor. We had a diabetic cat (urinates all the time) and we'd throw that out in a week.The other ones would last about a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Litter litter everywhere.....","review":"These smaller litter boxes are just too short. The smaller boxes should have a smaller \\"footprint\\" but have sides ashigh as the jumbo ones. I used one jumbo and three smaller ones and each smaller one distributes litter everywhere around it. When you use less litter because of this everything sticks. I guess the folks who designed this size have never owned cats who used a litter box. I hope they redesign, I like being able to toss them when done."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the wonderbox, but you can get it cheaper elsewhere","review":"Love Kitty's WonderBox, but you only get 1 box in this order. At other sites, you can get 2 for about $16 at PetCo or $10 at BigAls."},{"rating":"1","title":"seemed like a good idea...","review":"I've tried every type of litter box liner that's out there and this one just really made a lot of sense to me. My intent was to hopefully only have to change it every 4 weeks or so, but within 2 weeks it already gets pretty saturated with urine even though the amount of litter in it is pretty high, so you still get that great cat urine smell (gag!). Even still, it's the least messy of all that I've used, and I'm on the plan where they automatically send it to me every several weeks, so it's fairly economical doing that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong dimensions","review":"I ordered these after measuring them and finding that they were the same measurements as the litter box I use for my cat. When they arrived.... they were not the same measurements as stated in the description. I will be throwing these away. Can't use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product and truly worth the money","review":"This is a fantastic product! Our elderly cat (now 21) has used these litter boxes for years. Older cats produce a lot of urine, and we were having to replace the disposable plastic litter box liner practically every day to keep the odor down. Using the Kitty's WonderBox means no more expensive plastic liners, NO ODOR, and we can scoop or dump out the litter and still use the same box for a week or more. It's amazing. These boxes also work great for cats who shred the disposable liners by kicking or trying to bury things, etc. The boxes are virtually indestructable. I'd recommend them for any cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted to like this, but . . .","review":"The \\"jumbo\\" size did not match our \\"XLarge\\" litter box, despite the \\"equal\\" dimensions. Also, it seemed to augment rather than abate the urine smell, perhaps because we have 3 cats. But after about a week, it was nasty and had to be changed. Have gone back to just a plastic litter box with far less smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Nothing! And NOT \\"Jumbo\\"","review":"First of all, this is NOT a \\"jumbo\\" box. It stands ONLY 7\\" high, so when the cat buries her waste, much of the litter gets scraped OUT of the box and onto the floor. And let me tell you, the smell of urine drenched kitty litter on a hardwood floor is nauseating. My whole house stinks!Second, the box does NOT mask odors ... as I sit here typing this review, I'm about to suffocate .. because if the cat doesn't pee in the litter, but pees on the box, the ODOR is stifling!Total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these!","review":"I hated doing a thorough clean of the litter box before, but these make it easy! Just scoop daily, toss every couple of weeks, and spray out the box -- Hardly any mess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these for when I need an extra box.","review":"I sometimes go out of town for up to 5 days and I need more than the one box my big boys use since I'm not here to clean it out every other day. These come in handy for those times. They are very thick, sturdy paper/cardboard that nothing soaks through. When I get home, I just throw it out. Excellent product and buying them in the 3 pack saves a little money."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmm","review":"Didn't work so great for me. Clumping litter seemed to just stay wet and would not really \\"clump\\" inside this box and it seemed much harder to scoop as it would stick to the bottom & sides. I've gone back to plastic now and it's working out better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the cat -- great for you and your home.","review":"We use pine pellets for litter. This product makes it easy to clean, refresh and ultimately replace the litter box. The material is sort of like thick, absorbent cardboard. It fits inside most regular, plastic litter boxes, if you choose to use it in that manner. We replace the WonderBox every two weeks. An extremely clean, cost-effective and sensible solution for you and your cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful find!","review":"Heard about the WonderBox from another catlover and decided to give them a try. Cleaning litterboxes in the wintertime is a pain. My 2 cats love the WonderBox and are no longer kicking litter out of the catbox area. The first box easily lasted a month with 2x daily scooping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete rip-off","review":"I ordered this because I have 2 cats and wanted to make litter-box changing easier. I didn't like the first ones I got because they smelled worse than just plain litter with the liner. I re-ordered because I read that the product had been improved with baking soda. I noticed no difference. Plus, if I used clumping litter it just stuck to the bottom of the box. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"thinking inside the box","review":"I like using one of these litter boxes for about a month. I put it inside a larger cardboard box to keep the litter contained. I find that I use less cat litter than with the usual plastic litter box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for winter time, but....","review":"These boxes are okay for winter time use. They really don't eliminate odor very much. They are too small for my cats and I can't afford to purchase six of the super size each month. I find that these boxes hold odors and I clean out all six of them daily. I have to go to the expense of buying both a powdered litter box deodorizer and a spray type one to control the odors. I will try something else I think. During the spring, summer and early autumn months I can empty the regular litter boxes and take them outside to scrub and rinse with the garden hose. I am disappointed that these boxes don't work as well as claimed."},{"rating":"2","title":"these boxes are great","review":"have allergies, so have to \\"manage\\" litter box process well. these are great -- I line the litter box, then put one of these inside (on top of liner) and fill with litter -- usually lasts a couple weeks and then replace the whole thing and it is easy and cleaner process for me. Also great for taking kitty with us for weekend when we visit family -- portable litter box and kitty is familiar with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy","review":"These were easy to have during my travel and trip with my cat.

If you must have these original studio recordings (instead of what I feel are the superior concert recordings with intros and audience reactions) you would be much better off with getting a copy of the authorized reissue on Rhino/WEA \\"Songs and More Songs by Tom Lehrer\\". Only slightly more expensive, it contains BOTH sets of songs (although Rhino didn't use the stereo master tape that exists of the studio recordings of the second set of songs.)

This is kid's stuff, not the work of a sohisticated or intellectually mature architect. If you are the sort of person who is impressionable, this book is aimed at YOU.

Unfortunately I have found several of the CD's are defective. They jam and fail to properly eject, plus some of them will only play part of the story before they start to malfunction. This problem has occurred in multiple vehicle players, so I don't think it is the machines since I have never had a problem like this with anything else before.

The collection contains stories as chronicled by Sherlock Holmes' able bodied assistant James Watson, The mysteries are always intriguing to Holmes and unique in such a way that they pose some form of deductive challenge for the world's best deductive reasoner.

I found that if I held the button down for half a second, I could usually, but not always, get it to single-click. But it was too inconvenient to have to think about every click.

This thing actually works pretty awesome while it lasts. The scroll wheel is also very quiet, which is a bonus. However, there is a reason it costs so little. It stopped working today, only a month or so after the purchase. I found that by applying pressure where it plugs into the USB, the red light at the bottom lights up again and it works. Unfortunately we don't care to hold and apply pressure to a USB port the entire time on the computer.You should especially avoid this mouse if you are someone who uses a mouse for a laptop and have to plug and unplug.

Winger was a great protege for Carter, while Corbett could have qualified as a stunt double. (It was quite amusing to see Winger appear in her Wonder Girl costume on the Letterman show years later!

Furthermore, the series does not stand up to the test of time. The writers tried to blend camp humor with straight action and ended up doing neither very well.

Her costume also changed.They obviously put it out too quickly due to fan response.The prints are also put out from medium quality film prints-check out the lines and hairs that appear from time to time.True Wonder Woman fans will be outraged.If the the second season is like this , I will not buy it!Caveat Emptor!!(Buyer Beware)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"Well finally, they made the first season in DVD, and complete too.

I can't help but smile watching her magnetism on screen. Has an actress ever fit a iconic role more than Ms. Carter? I don't think so. This alone is worth the price of the DVD boxed set...but seeing the fun episodes and how entertaining they really are, makes it a keeper.

Now that I'm watching the second season, I find I miss Diana's innoncence and the close relationship that was developing between Diana and Steve from season 1. It's not the same in season 2 because it's steve's son. Also, in season 2, Diana seems more world weary.Definitely watch season 1 first! It's such a great way to escape from the humdrum of daily life.

Most shockingly of all, apparently ALL fibro sufferers are MARRIED, because the author spends a chapter and a half telling you how to communicate with your spouse and children. NO MENTION AT ALL about what to do if you live alone. I mean seriously: Laundry - me. Cooking - me. Cat's litter box - me. Car oil change - me. I don't get any help with my chores, thanks very much.

Then I tried the phone which took forever to get some outsourced quasi-english speaking person reading an install script from the web. The Web install -bombed, the \\"special\\" reset provided by the American tech bombed so now I have a $99 paper weight or it does work as a wired switch (figure that). So to get my money's worth I have to return it to Linksys and wait for a new one.Since I work with Cisco gear every day and know the company this lousy product support and software is inexcusable.

If you can't then it will lose wireless signal every 15-20 minutes. After a few weeks of using it, I had to call linksys customer support. They tried a few setting changes, but signal strength was poor. Poor is not even the correct word for it. I was sitting within 6 inches of router and signal strength was 11 mbps. When the new settings didn't work, customer support asked me when I purchased it. It was less than a month old so the advice was to return it to amazon. No packing box forced them to replace the router with new one from linksys, not amazon.

Well, the Linksys is not it.I have one desktop computer that has a wired NIC, and two laptops with wireless. My printer is attached to the printer port on the desktop. I use a peer-to-peer network to print from my laptops. Unfortunately, the Linksys does not permit this configuration. It keeps the wired and wireless computers on separate peer-to-peer networks with no way to bridge the networks.Secondly, the documentation you get with the Linksys is extremely poor. It looks like the marketing guy decided to include a PDF brochure on the CD and call it a manual. The manual was obviously not written by someone who understands computer networks.Thirdly, the router tends to lock up. I have only had the router installed for about 18 hours, and I have had to reset it twice. I am definitely returning this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"I have been using this router for a month but it has been nothing but problems. I contacted Linksys and they replaced it with a refurbished unit. The main issue I have is the latency on the device. Tonight I noticed that Linksys had a firmware update and tried it too but still it is worthless to me. When using VOIP or playing BF2 the latency causes interruptions and drops. I started pinging the interface with a directly attached PC and laptop. The response time goes from 1ms to 1000ms and timeouts at times.

Sure they did use more pop and experimentations like \\"Questioningly\\" but they also gave us more classics like \\"I Wanna Be Sedated\\" and \\"I Just Wanna Have Something To Do. All of the songs on here are good and most are great, the only thing that seperates this from other Ramones records prior to Road To Ruin is that Tommy was replaced by Marky.Road To Ruin brings fans down a different but truely great Road and at the same time rocks their socks off."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't like the Ramones...","review":"If you don't like the Ramones, you don't like rock and roll. I don't know how else to say it. If you are tired, sad, or having trouble getting started in the morning, put this cd in and get going to a better, brighter, more blitzkreig-y kind of day. This was my introduction to the band and still my favorite, although the debut is fantastic as well. It's A Long Way Back, I Just Want To Have Something To Do, I Wanna Be Sedated, the list just goes on and on...all killer stuff. Even though some of the hardcore fans decried the 'ballads,' (let's face it, latter day Aerosmith drivel these ballads ain't - thank God), they are just being purists. Every single song on here is great and that's something very few bands can say about any one of their records.The Ramones took the pop formula and crushed it with Johnny's down strokes and the sneering nasal charm of Joey's impassioned vocals. Honestly, if you don't like this band, I don't value your musical opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peak Performance","review":"\\"Road To Ruin\\" is the band at their best and most versatile. You get the groups most commercial hit (\\"I Wanna Be Sedated\\"), old school riffs (\\"I Wanted Everything\\", \\"I'm Against It\\", \\"Go Mental\\"); ballads (\\"Questioningly\\", \\"Don't Come Close); and covers (\\"Needles and Pins\\" -- which continued a trend where the group would feature 1960's-era songs on their releases). The re-release is the first time in the US where \\"Road To Ruin\\" was released as an individual CD. As a sweetener, live tracks from the \\"Rock and Roll High School\\" soundtrack are among the bonus cuts included on the CD. Unfortunately, from this point forward Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky could not sustain the creative peak epitomized by \\"Road To Ruin\\". The foursome would still kick on stage (as anyone who saw them -- myself included -- could attest) for years to come but their studio recordings, aside from a couple of songs here and there, lacked the energy of the early (1976-78) years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grave disappointment","review":"I found Mr. Brown's book to be a serious disappointment. His narrative was vague, rambling, and disconnected. He made allegations against several of the participants in the event, but did not back up his statements with any sort of verifiable historical data. His book was typical of writers who are not trained researchers developing a pet theory and then twisting (or ignoring) data which is contradictory to their conclusions. His work is typical of the \\"it could have happened this way; there's nothing to show it didn't happen this way; therefore it did happen this way\\" school of thought. These writers ignore the \\"there's also nothing to show that it did happen this way\\" factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good overview of the case; shoddy conclusion","review":"This is the first book I have ever read about Lizzie Borden. I was aware of the basic facts when starting this book, and I was pleased to find that it presented a fairly comprehensive overview of the case. However, the accusation of a secret son of Andrew Borden's just doesn't make sense. The entire theory of his guilt is based on the testimony of one or two people and their vague recollections of years long past. It seems that Brown found a new theory that hadn't been played out before, and then manipulated the facts AROUND that theory, instead of letting the facts speak for themselves. There is absolutely NO EVIDENCE that William Borden had anything to do with the crime, and the entire last chapter consists of pages and pages of pure speculation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it started out good...","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. Mr. Brown does have a gift for writing, and the first several chapters were nicely arranged to pique one's interest in the final explanation promised at the end. Having put my nose to the grindstone to get quickly to this explanation of what really happened that day, I was very upset when I reached it. The author fails to wrap up many (even most?) of the loose ends he creates. Worse, his ability to creatively excite the imagination in the eariler chapters becomes a handicap in this flop of a finale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good account of the case, interesting new theory","review":"He's got most of the facts here, well presented, and a theory about whodunnit that I hadn't heard before, based on information from a family member. And best of all -- Lizzie's inquest testimony verbatim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Hot","review":"I knew when I read \\"Odysseus: A Life\\" that Charles Beye is no ordinary or academic academic.

The main character admires his neighbor across the street. This neighbor kid seems to have it all: lots of toys and parents that bow to his every whim. I expected the story to end with a lesson that money and things don't bring happiness. Instead, the main character just decides to imagine they are friends. I wanted to scream with disgust when I read the last page. Also, why is there a nude kid on the cover?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"This book was depressing. As I turned each page, watching the narrator-child covet all of the wonderful things he presumes his neighbor has, I assumed that in the end there would be a moral of sorts. Perhaps he would learn that the older boy did not indeed live as wonderfully as he thought. Nope. Instead, the ending makes the narrator-child look pathetic and sad. The recommended age for this book is 4-8, and I think that's a little too young to teach children that \\"life sucks and the closest you'll ever get to perfection is in your imagination, kid\\".We also own The Daddy Mountain by the same author, and that one is much better.

Following in the footsteps of his previous two \\"Evening With\\" offerings, \\"Sold Out: A Threevening with Kevin Smith\\" offers much of the same - which makes it an essential view for fans of both his work and of the spoken word/stand-up genre as a whole. Smith's stories are captivating throughout because, aside from their interesting subject matter, the viewer never gets the impression that he is selling you any embellishments along the way.Even if Smith never gets the credit he deserves for his body of film work, this DVD release (along with its other two counterparts) should always remain part of the lexicon for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent entry in Kevin Smith's speaking career","review":"Kevin Smith is a natural storyteller and nothing is off limits in his latest speaking tour DVD.

After the initial introductive techniques there is little else for her to really say. In order to extend the film, she sometimes becomes repetitious in her explanations, and then...the director (?), injects still shot frames of distorted photographs along with sounds of running water to help give the production more of a meditative aura.The DVD has no time-information on it, but I would guess the entire running of the DVD was perhaps....20 or 30 minutes at most.Truthfully speaking, I was extremely disappointed in this production and for the price of $14.95; there simply should have been \\"something\\" more to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy title... lacks substance","review":"I would've enjoyed more in-depth discussion about Zen meditation in general, its philosophy, benefits, and so on.

Season 8 gave us one last chance to enjoy a great comedy with great episodes like the Butler, the Actor,the Lawyer, the dual Frasier where he gets turned down by his date infront of everybody.

A friend of mine recently purchased a Rotozip tool kit, so off to his house I went.I selected the 120 grit disk because of the rougher look and feel of the disk. When I started sanding the old, thick, globby, runny paint the Rotozip disk was like a wild animal, devouring the paint down to the bare wood.Fast, controllable and efficient...... Just add a Rotozip kit to my Christmas wishlist Ma.Then I started to look at the spots where the Landlord had done a poor job with the Drywall mud, a little zip here and a zip there, smooth and ready for paint.

If you are still thinking about buying this book, take a look at some of the better reviews. Do they seem like they were written by someone like me or you? I took the time to check them out: one of the reviewers wrote about every single title released by NRP on the subject. I wonder what kind of costumer this is... Some other reviews have tried to lead us into thinking that the book appropriately addresses its target reader: the absolute beginner. This is an obvious attempt at justifying its lack of content.

He touches on pre-planning, staging, lighting, sound, and editing.

You will then need to switch to a REAL pump to finish off, probably losing a lot of air while doing so. TOTAL waste of effort and time, it's best just to use an actual foot pump, etc.Second: Yes, it works *somewhat* as a bellows, but it doesn't blow out air hard enough to be worth bringing. You'd get just as good results waving a book-sized piece of cardboard at your fire.Third: It makes an EXTREMELY loud whirring/grinding sound while you're cranking the handle.

Few series, whether for children or adults are so full of the sense of community, and the character's place in that community than the Freddy books are. I've just reread six of them (two aloud) with my children. I'm amazed to find that you can read this series, end to end, in much the same way that you would read Trollope's Barchester novels, or Anthony Powell's Dance---as life caught in microcosm, studied, and loved and laughed at, and to hell with the fact that these are animals.

Becky, the narrator and main character, is a struggling artist who spends most of the book deftly psychoanalyzing herself, her friends, and especially the mysterious siren Callie, the sweet/strange/needy/demanding/impossible woman who brought Becky and all her friends together because each one had been burned in some way by her. Becky's narrative is frustrated and emotional and a wild joy to read, and the special rivalry between her and Callie and the way it affects their other friends makes for a unique and compelling portrait of friendship unlike anything I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who needs friends!","review":"I came across this debut novel recently and on cracking open the cover I didn't look up until I had finished all 200 plus pages several hours later. McKinnon's style of writing is impressive and her ability to render the novel's characters into flesh and blood is mind-whirling. The examination of the complexity of friendships that form when self-absorbed people (and aren't we surrounded more and more by them) find each other is sobering...and, I hate to admit it (and so will you), familiar. I can't wait to read more of her writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air","review":"Recently, we've been bombarded by the fiction publishing industry with woman characters that are ambivalent about their independence and obsessed with the desire to be all things to everyone (especially to men). The women of Narcissus Ascending cannot be reduced to these banal caricatures. Instead, Karen McKinnon, in her darkly ironical first novel, gives us two rivalrous characters - Becky and Callie - whose complex, obsessive, self-delusional personalities jumps off the page. The seeming authenticity of these characters makes them fascinating to read about.

I especially recommend this book to people who are interested in pursuing a career in the law and to every law student who is trying to find a way to do good and well at the same time. 5 stars for the story within. 5 stars for the author who tried to tell it. 5 stars for everyone who built and sustains Phillips & Cohen.Jim FrenchThe Regulator FundWashington, DC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly biased","review":"This book reads like a \\"puff piece\\" for the qui tam lawyers at Phillips and Cohen, who were apparently among the chief sources of information for this book. Little is mentioned of the exhorbitant fees earned by these lawyers, who themselves lead the privileged life styles of the very \\"fat cats\\" they sue. At the same time, the book attempts to discredit the modestly compensated government employees who actually investigate these cases as indifferent, incompetent, anti-relator, or just plain mean. It is unfortunate that such an important topic as unmasking the fraud perpetrated on the government should be trivialized by this naked attempt at self-promotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Router","review":"I was soo happy with the purchase I later bought severalfor my clients and as spares.. & Great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great easy firewall","review":"I like hardware based firewalls....

It's for me what once was Enigma, or Vangelis, or Secret Garden.I still like and listen to other music (nowadays too much too Jazz and Bossa Nova) but, I can be all day listening to Schiller without even noticing that it's the same CD over and over.So, my final advice is, BUY ALL SCHILLER YOU CAN.

I always respected Danilo Kis' fictional works. Collection of Danilo Kis' essays and interviews made me even more fond of him as a person - and his work.

I've used dozens of brands of strings but never felt so let down with such low quality as these. My advice go with D'Addario or Martin. I've used both for mandolin and had no complaints.

I saw this film for the first time years ago and think that it is one of the worst I've seen. The characters don't develop, the plot runs in circles, and the action sequences are so contrived and cliche they are mostly ridiculous. It felt like I was sitting in the back of a cab in Manhattan rush hour with a driver who doesn't speak English: You just don't know where in the world it's going, or why.If you want to watch good anime sci-fi, save your money for Neon Genesis Evangelion, Wicked City, or Trigun. If you just want good anime period, go for Ninja Scroll or Princess Mononoke, maybe Samurai-X. For those that love Akira, I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Script Ruined The Finest Movie Ever","review":"For this DVD edition, the producers decided to not only redub the film, but also rewrite the script. So any dialog or plotline that is inferred by the original script is actually spelled out for you. And thenew voices make it sound like a Disney movie. I love this movie, but it is unwatchable with the revisions. I hope to return it and find a copy with the old script. So disappointing. (as an added beef, why didn't they put both dubs on the same dvd? there are few added features, so there is sure to be plenty of free space on the disc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO","review":"i heard they changed the voices from the oringal english voice oversbig mistake by the oringal not the specail edition"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful movie that everyone should see.","review":"This movie is spectacular. During the first half I was slightly confused about o couple of thing.But it was all soon answered. There is also ALOT of bloody action this can be both good and bad. The ending is very thought provoking, like when Kanada goes into Tetsuo and sees his childhood memories, and will stay in your mind for a couple of days as you try to realise what exactly happened(i still havent figured it all out which is why im going to watch it again) Trust me you will get up thinking \\"wow,that was sweet!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SPECIAL EDITION AKIRA DVD","review":"THE REASON I GAVE THIS DVD 2 STARS WAS BECAUSE OF THE BOUNUS MATERIAL ON THE SECOND DISC THAT COMES WITH IT. DONT GET ME WRONG I'M A BIG AKIRA FAN BUT THE NEW ENGLISH VOICE OVERS TOTALLY RUINED THE MOVIE. THE ACTING WAS HORRIBLE AND THE NEW VOICES DO NOT MATCH THE CHARACTERS AT ALL. MY SUGGESTION TO YOU IS BUY THE FIRST DVD THAT CAME OUT...I WISH I HAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you are getting","review":"Just to let you Akira fans know, if you have not already figured it out, that this DVD has a new english dub. I do not think they are releasing the old english dub on this disk. Also, they are releasing two DVDs. One is the standard version and the other is the Deluxe version. The regular has the english and japanese with the widescreen version of the film and the deluxe has a behind the scenes on the remastering as well as other goodies. I have heard mixed reviews on the new english dub. I was a little upset at Pioneer for not including that old english track on the DVD as well. Aw well, as they say, life's not perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing...","review":"Have you ever noticed how nobody in anime stories ever wins? Especially not the good guys. Massively depressing with a sound trak that is so ominous that it alone is enough to make you double your Prozac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Extremely good.","review":"Akira is a masterpiece, from its jaw dropping wow-wow animation to its gratifying plot twists and its excellent(if slightly convoluted) storyline, Its a piece of work that should be cherished for years to come (keep it outta reach of peoples below 12 tho)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best anime in the world, but still a good one","review":"This is, bottom line, a good movie. From the highspeed beginning to the nauseating ending, its top-notch moviemaking from creator of the epic. Otomo tells the tale of what happens when you abuse power, as well as when power is placed in the hands of a person not ready for it. Although I don't think some nine-year-old is going to turn into a growing mountain of...something...the size of a stadium because he picked on some kinder- gartener. Also, buy the subtitled, not the dub. Although it adds in a lot of excessive violence, it also adds in dialogue and scences that are important to the movie. Also, the voices are better. From the kiddish to maniacal Tetsuo to the whiny and annoying Takashi (He's like that in the dub,anyway), it adds an overall realism to the movie (Sorry Jimmy Flinders, but not your finest proformance in the dub). There's better anime out there, but this one is still a classic... unless your easily grossed out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manga is better","review":"Unfortunately, I decided to read the manga before watching the movie. Although, the movie does get a lot of the main scenes and events right from the original manga, the story was completely butchered. Akira is a 5 book series spanning 1500 pages. There was absolutely no way to make it into a movie and keep it accurate.A lot of these reviewers complain about the voice-over acting being redone and I have to agree with them although I haven't heard the original. A lot of the time, the voice acting just doesn't set the tone for the insanity that's going on. You find yourself not caring much for the characters because of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The amoeba that devours them all","review":"You'll understand the title after you've seen the movie. Know this: when this anime hit theaters (yes, it was on a limited run), I can't imagine anybody but the underground really knowing what they were getting into. In the States, animation was either Disney/ Looney Tunes or those old, badly dubbed Speed Racer cartoons. \\"Akira\\" changed all of that. Decades later, the film still holds up against your average Adult Swim anime. Its adult themes, gloriously colored animation and haunting soundtrack still inspire awe. Admittedly, the story gets a bit confusing - but pay attention to the amoeba. This one'll leave you screaming \\"Tetsuoooooooo!\\" and wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Gets A Daring","review":"Akira is more than a visual masterpiece, it's a philosophical triumph. Consider this: in order for man to reach his highest state of being he must join with his maker. The method - an atomic bomb. There is a lot more to it, but if the jist interests you, then the movie will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Akira Blasts into Blu-ray","review":"I am an anime freak, own 100s of series - I LOVE this movie, was highly anticipating the blu-ray, but just let me say - Bandai, you suck. I was on preorder for this to get the exclusive first press with the booklet and sleeve. So what do I get 10 weeks LATE? The average-joe version. Definitely NOT worth the $40 I paid.Movie looks and sounds the best it ever has but the total lack of extras - no 20th+ anniversary special extras or anything seems a waste of the blu-ray's capacity and a cheap ca$h grab on Bandai's part.So I am both glad to have it and ticked-off with it at the same time.I would say if you totally love this movie then it is just barely worth it, otherwise just rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end-all be-all of Anime","review":"Akira is a masterpiece any way you look at it, whether it is the great plot, the incredible animation, or even the stunning musical score. I won't spoil things for those who HAVEN'T seen is by writing a review here, but if you haven't seen it then you desperately need to. The only downside to this disk that I have currently found is in the new English dub of the film, which is drab and unemotional throughout. This is countered by the fact that the original Japanese audio tracks are present along with subtitles on the disk. This is by far the most worthwhile addition to my DVD collection. I sugguest Ghost in the Shell as another valuable DVD purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird but good.","review":"'Akira' is a really weird movie but a good one nonetheless. It entertaining and a joy to watch as long as one doesn't try to make too much sense out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Journey trhough Neo-Tokyo","review":"Excellent film that takes you through a post World War Three Neo-Tokyo. Kaneda and Tetsuo are the main characters and their rivalry/friendship drives the movie forward. The story is great and I remember starting this movie and then wanting to read the Manga, which is slightly different but still enthralling and epic. Overall it was a sensory journey through the streets of war ravaged people and government oppression."},{"rating":"2","title":"still a great anime","review":"i got this a while back, and to this day i love to watch it over and over, but there is a wierd plot here. but i recomend it for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its more then a movie, its a life experiance.","review":"This is, and should be the first Anime anyone ever sees. It has a great amount of action, and story. The art is beyond most animations that are out there, better then anything from Walt. The bike fights are worht it alone. Get it, own it, ware it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beat this Anime? I don't think so!","review":"On a basic Saturday morning I slowly shuffled down to the T.V. to turn on my Saturday Anime on the Sci-Fi channel. I expected another re-run of some crappy anime, but it didn't matter to me. Rather, I discovered they were playing a movie I had never heard of, Akira. From the beginning to the end, I was glued to my seat. I even watched the commercials with attentiveness because I was afraid I would miss it when it came back on. Because it was on t.v. it had been shortened and was missing a lot of the graphic detail in this movie, which is very generous. I therefore rented it and watched it three times that day. This is a very graphic movie, involving generous blood and some nudity. There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best Anime I have ever seen. So what are waiting for?! Go rent it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DTS Rocks, But Why On A Separate Disc?","review":"A DTS version of Akira was what SHOULD have been on the special edition in the first place! This is a total marketing gimmick from Pioneer. The Japanese Region 2 DTS edition came with all the extras of the special edition, for a limited time until switching to only 1 disc. The DTS track blows away the original stereo, but is it really worth buying the entire movie again? If only they put together a mail-in rebate it would have been worth the money. Collectors only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a really good Anime and one of my favorites","review":"It came very fast and I'm happy with it. I'm very pleased with the packaging. This is an Anime that I have been looking for a long time and will always keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible and Powerful Film","review":"AKIRA: this is the second best manga ever, falling just short of the incredible ghost in the shell, which is one of my favourite movies of all time, let alone animes. Akira is a definate purchase for anyone who can enjoy manga. The style of drawing on the characters is a little strange in the first 5 minutes, but after that you begin to question all other manga styles, as it looks great. Im not going to even start on the story, which is complex and intelligent, thick with symbolism and thought-provoking concepts.The music is classy, and fits the film perfectly. EG The amazing Tetsuo theme, brings the power and suspense of the films climax to your ears.This DVD is must purchase for any manga fan or anyone who has not seen this film. It also is a perfect starting place for anyone looking to get into anime/manga. (Beware the disturbing ending!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent DVD","review":"I recently purchased Akira because my cousin had put up a lot of hype about the movie. Later that week ,after his first failed attempt, We finally watched it. It was possibly the best anime movie ever. The only dissapointment being the slight lack of extras on the double DVD set (Only 124 minutes, puny by today's standards with that 6, 10 and 20 hours of stuff) but I found that it was not overwhelming like the Episode One, or Planet of the Apes. Who would want to watch 10 hours of extras? anyway, thats the only slight drawback,but the movie itself is exellent, 10 of of 10 stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Akira (4.1 stars)","review":"?Akira? is considered by most to be the masterpiece of Anime films. Made in 1988 it is a landmark film, both by the many great animated sequences and the detailed story. The film is rather graphic, but not many Anime films aren?t. While the film is groundbreaking for both animation and film, it is marred by over length. The animation to me, seems a little more ?cartoonish,? than films such as ?Perfect Blue? or ?Ghost in the Shell.? In a way it really doesn?t hurt it, since the film acts as a very eccentric, exaggerated science fiction film. Also the film was made in 1988, the 80s where a much different time than the 90s. Since then the animation has matured, and things are looking more realistic. But without classic 80s Anime films such as \\"Akira,\\" \\"Vampire Hunter D\\" and \\"Wicked City,\\" the Anime industry may be lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"probably the best anime","review":"Akira is pretty amazing. even as the standards for animation quality in anime has gone way up since this was made, akira still blows away any other anime ive seen...its simply the anime to see"},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring movie","review":"After starting to view anime's (mainly manga) over the years i came across what is hailed to be the most classic anime of all, Akira. I must be the only one in the world that was bored as hell during this movie. The plot was excellent though i didn't really like the characters at all. The bull-headed Tetsuo is a stupid character with no real depth apart from his hatred. The action(yeah right) scenes were boring and dull to the point where i was falling asleep. Overall i must say that there are much better movies out there (ie. Ninja Scrolls which kicks [butt],Ghost in the shell, Samurai X) that people should own before buying the dullest movie EVER"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks","review":"Its animated well. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Too bad the plot isn't worth the paper it was written on. I love Anime, but if the Japanese want to make any money in America, they need to give us poor stupid Americans what we want: A good, well explained plot, and a satisfying ending. That's all we want, besides violence, and sexually explicit nudity (which was not in Akira). Don't get the wrong idea, there was plenty of violence, and nudity is well... that was a joke we don't NEED nudity.... Anyway, if you want some good Anime, (for plot AND animation) check out Vampire Hunter D, Demon City Shinjuku, Record of Lodoss War, of the Venus Wars. Akira made me sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the hype, nothing on the delivery...","review":"Won't go into lengthy description (plenty of other reviews for that), but as someone admittedly new to anime, I was told that I HAD TO see Akira (and read numerous reviews that said the same).

I have chalked it up to one of those films that is a classic because everybody says it is because everybody says it is because everybody says it is..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay.","review":"When I first saw this in the early '90s, I thought, \\"What a load of over-rated technotrash.\\" I thought the underlying plot about a government conspiracy of psychics, a dystopian future, and some kid getting messed up on pills before turning into a giant tentacle machine was retarded.And I was right. I rented the movie again, about a decade later, wondering if perspective would change my mind. Nope. It's still a bad film. Sure, it's pretty and all, what with the awesome motorcycle and... Uh... Damn, that and the giant psychoturd at the end are really the only two visuals to come out of the film, aren't they?Man, this thing's horrible. Just don't even bother with this hot mess. Instead, here are some useful things you could do with your money: go buy some Uniball 207 medium point gel pens and draw your own hentai; pick up the first two volumes of \\"100 Bullets\\" and get hooked; \\"Sea Monsters\\" for the Wii; light some cigars with some Lincolns.One star.

This is probably one for the less sophisticated members of the Inyasha crowd, but others may find the potato peelings in their clogged garbage disposals? more interesting than this colossally lame production."},{"rating":"1","title":"English mockery","review":"I have to agree with all the other reviewers out there that said the english dub is horribly ridiculous. I've seen the old version and it is absolutely incredible! Which is why I reserved my copy of the special edition as soon as I could. But as soon as i started to watch it, it became obvious the second rate job done on the dub. Honestly, I hate it and probably will never watch it again. However, returning it isn't an option because it would cost more to return it then the cost of the movie. So it will probably just sit and collect dust. On the upside though, the extras are fantastic, and the video clean up is also excellent. This would have gotten 0 stars if it weren't for the upside. All in all if you've seen the original, don't bother with this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"The New Dubbing is horrible","review":"I cannot express how disappointed I am with this new release of the Anime classic Akira. The new overdub is exceptionally bad. Even the Japanese overdub has been changed and is equally awful. The original dialogue was edgy and dangerous, whereas this new dialogue is vanilla and overly PC and wordy. I have been a major fan of this film, but I will look for one of the original versions to add to my collection. They also altered the amazing musical score. Cutting it short in some places and fading it out to a background noise in others, terrible. The original was a 5 star all the way, this ranks only 2. I couldn't have told you dubbing would make such a difference, now I know the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Mistake","review":"If you watched the original chances are you will hate this remake. The change in dialogue has ruined the whole flow of the movie by adding exposition and losing the feel for the original, not to mention the monotone reading by the voice over actors.I have seen both the subtitled and original dubbed versions and found that the \\"special Edition\\" falls short of the original. You will find yourself not laughing at scenes you remember laughing at and confused during key dramatic moments. This is a great example of \\"if it an't broke, don't fix it\\".I can't recomend this to anyone. If you can get the original dubbed or subtitled on tape go for it. You will even notice a superior performance by the voice over actors.If they release the original dubbed on DVD I will be the first"},{"rating":"1","title":"Akira: The Not-So-Special Edition","review":"At first, I was anxious to see all the new features and deleted scenes from one of my favorite anime flicks, and I was, until I actually watched the movie. While the graphics have improved greatly over the VHS, the new dubbing of vocals and sound effects are just inexcusable. It just doesn't have the same gritty feel of the original traslation. It seems like the traslators are more interested in fitting new words to the mouths of the characters than they are in staying true to the mood of the original. Furthermore, most of the voices sound like they were done by boys who are just reaching puberty...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome","review":"This is the story of a Biker gang.

Truly a great anime movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Kind of Scared Me","review":"Akira was, although a bit confusing, an altogether amazing film. Though some of the characters could have used a little more depth, I realize that it was trying to focus on Tetsuo and Kaneda, the two main characters. I loved Tetsuo's power corruption, I thought it was very well displayed and brought upon(though the large, walking toys scared the pee out of me). Frighteningly deep, mixed with realism and dark overtones, this movie is excellent for those who love to ponder the meaning of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films ever made","review":"I have to say that this is one of the best movies, animated or not. This film, along with \\"Grave of the Fireflies\\" and \\"Princess Mononoke\\", prove to you that animation can be just as good as any other movie. I was so (angry) to see how the academy treated the genre like ..., giving a new award. it brings shame to animators to see that they can't be in the same standards as others. Oh well, who gives a damn about the academy anyway?On to the film... this special edition DVD is great! I recommend it over the other DVD release. The dub is pretty good, too. It's 5000 times better than the ... DBZ dub, and most of the japanese words are pronounced correctly, too. The production stills, while not providing much to the average viewer, are great for aspiring animators like myself. And it's one of the best sci-fi concepts ever made.The movie's great. Check out the manga, too.

Even the Amazon.com reviewer got mixed up--the motorcycle punk is Tetsuo, and Akira is the child/experiment that grew too strong too fast and was placed in deep-freeze in separate parts.

But be warned, the story can be a bit confusing the first time you see it. It's a lot to take in and if you are just enjoying the animation you might find you've missed a piece of the puzzle. This DVD is packed full of extras and worth having in anyone's collection.

Otherwise I really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"This is one of the best anime films i've ever seen. The animation is good. Even in the original film the animation is great for a 1988 movie. It is violent and has plenty of language. The dubbing was horrible, not the voice acting but how the characters mouths moved with the words (for those of you who really care about that sort of thing.) I actually liked the voices. If you've ever seen the series Trigun or Dual Parallel - Trouble - Adventure you will probably recognize the voice talents of Johnny Yong Bosch (sp?) who was Vash in Trigun and the dude who played Kasuke in Dual. The story is also pretty cool. The only really downside to the movie (for some people only) is that the movie seems to go on for a really long time. I kept thinking it was about to end and then something else would begin and that got kinda annoying. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and would definately reccomend it especially for fans of the Armitage movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animated Tour De Force","review":"This science fiction thriller masterpiece only continues to re-affirm itself as the best Japaneese anime ever created. The story takes place in 2019, the world has re-emerged after the Third World War. Neo-Tokyo, a city that has been beautifully created and drawn into a nightmarish gang ridden metropolis is where the main action is. Focusing first on a group of juveniles in a local biker gang, one named Kanada and the other, Tetsuo, the film sets you up for a wild thrill ride unlike any other. The film divulges into many story lines, exploring a strange government psychic project, in which experiments were performed upon small children. One of them, named Akira, was said to be so powerful that his awakening was the cause of the war which destroyed the world. All in all, an amazing visual and mental treat. Word of advice.. Pay Attention.. if you are not a Japaneese Manga fan you will be lost forever in its incredibly complex plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son Akira","review":"Akira is unquestionably one of the most memorable animes of all time. It was first released in the U.S. about 16 years ago, and has continusly gained sucess among anime fans. This DVD is the ultimate Akira package, featuring the 100% digitally remastered movie Akira. With tons of extras and options such as the bilingual feature in which u can watch Akira in original japanese voices with or without subs, or just watch the original american version of Akira. And in the second DVD (exta DVD) there are several extras like soundtrack, production materials, misc Akira merchendise and comic covers from all around the world.

After a motorcycle accident, a 16-year-old gang member named Tetsuo discovers his hidden powers. As the movie goes on, we find out what happens when the wrong person gets pushed around too much. All hell breaks loose, and the only person who can stop it is Tetsuo's best friend, Kaneda.All in all, this movie is almost too good to be true, however, you might want to keep younger children away from this movie for a while, it is extremely violent and has one scene of brief nudity.

If you like Ghost in the Shell and Perfect Blue you will definately like this, if you like to understand the storyline when you are watching a movie then look elsewere."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pretty good movie...","review":"i have been reading the reviews for this movie, and almost every single one of them has said this was a great movie. So I went to my video store and saw it in the japanimation aisle and I rented it. The version I rented was the japanese version with english subtitles and was presented in the weirdest looking widescreen I've seen since \\"the insider\\". I thought the film was pretty good. Not the best piece of anime, i've seen, but when the limited edition dvd comed out, i'm going to go out and buy it. up until this movie the pokemon movies were my favorite pieces of anime. i hope the dvd looks better than the crummy old 1989 video edition i saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Touted as the greatest anime ever produced my friend and I who are huge anime fans rented this POC (piece of crap)....... Mediocre animation, lousy story.... the best part was close to the beginning when the fat kid gets punched in the mouth and pukes up a bunch of blood..... THAT'S it! Worst Anime I've ever seen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad comic book storyline movie","review":"I didn't like it. Katsuhiro Otomo has gone too far on this movie based on his graphic novels. Sure it has great animation but the only one thing that hurts the movie to me is Kaori(Tetsuo's Girlfreind) gets killed in it. The reason I didn't like that is the characters that get killed in the graphic novels also get killed in the movie including Kaori. I never liked all his works (except Metropolis) and I think he's a real monster when it comes to uncomfortable storyline and plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is GREAT animation!?!?","review":"Sorry, but no, not even for the time in which it was made. The motion is not smooth between poses, and a lot of the film is just that- poses held, mouths agape, and stills panned over. That ain't animation.The story is too condensed and too unrewarding.The English voice acting is the worst- and the script itself is a lot of name's screamed back and forth, yuck. The children's voices are women scrunched up or something- it is bad.The bst scene is at the end when Kaneda's bike is all smashed up but still rolling. The otherwise cliched comic relief, cliched violence, and cliched typical Japanese delivery of puerile entertainment... -sigh-"},{"rating":"1","title":"rent it first!!","review":"Akira is somehow one of the most-hyped anime out there. I saw it a while back, and frankly, I hated it. It was long and boring with a twisting plot that led nowhere. The setting was believable, but the plot was not (this coming from someone who likes anime plots). This movie is also LOOONG. You sit through it for like 2 hours and then you think...\\"what a waste of time! I could've actually seen a good anime instead!\\" My recommendation, rent it first, and if you love it, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I am really stumped why people like this anime. In my personal opinion it was stupid, confusing and a waste of my time and I love anime. Though this just didn't appeal to me at all. The guy getting really big and exploding was disgusting. I mean maybe it's just me, I am not use to this old school anime. My animes are inuyasha, fruits basket, DN angel, and vampire princess miyu. I like more love stories and fantasy so if you're like me I would't even rent this anime though if you love sci-fic and confusing stuff, you'll love this one. Not for me though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the original dub???","review":"This would have been the perfect release except for the horrible voice-acting. What were they thinking when they hired these people. I love the new translation but much of the high charged emotion in the original dub is gone. I remember how much people complained about the original, not because the voice acting was bad but because the translation was poor. Seems Pioneer only got half of it right. Be careful what you wish for.I emailed Pioneer why the original dub wasn't included and they said it was a money issue. Huh? Sounds like a cop out to me.They did say if there was enough demand they would release a version of Akira with the original dub so here's your chance. Email them at peaproducts@pioneer-usa.com and let them know you want the original dub back! Do it!!!I also noticed they did a poor job at removing dirt on the print. Oh well, it's still the best anime movie even with the lousy actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who had a problem with the old English Dubbing?","review":"I am really disappointed in this DVD. The sound effects and music where done great but the \\"New\\" dubbing I found lacking. First of all, this is a classic that has been around for over 10 years. They should have included an option to hear the dubbing we have all grown to know and love. The new dubbing isn't offal but I enjoy the original dubbing far better. If they already had the dubbing available, how hard could it have been to include a choice to hear that too? If you like Akira in original Japanese, then you should like this DVD but if you want to relive the movie you saw as a kid, try the VCD............."},{"rating":"2","title":"AKIRA - The Staple of ANIME movies","review":"I finally found a tin copy of the Akira movie and picked it up when I first laid eyes on it. There are to many things in the special features to mention of but the film itself was worth every penny. Watching Akira I felt like visiting a different world in a different time. The city is so big and the speed of the animation is like nothing I've ever seen before. Otomo who created most of the story explains his process with an hour long interview and an important lesson in doing dynamic storylines and transferring it to a film maker's order. This film in the Anime genre is a must buy or a must steal. Just see it for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GET THE NEW DTS VERSION!","review":"Everyone reading this review who has a DVD player that came with a Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1, 6.1 whatever Receiver built in that came with speakers, get this version and listen to the DTS Version and compare it to the Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation on the other releases. You will definitely like the DTS Version, I did very much. Now I have to go spend 20 more dollars on a new surround soundtrack so I can enjoy the movie more. I wish Pioneer would have done this in the first place and put both DTS and DD on one disc so we could enjoy the movie this way, oh well. Get this version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pioneer dub stinks!","review":"The only way to get the original streamline dub on DVD is by getting the Australian special edition DVD from madman.

This was the very first anime I ever watched, and I have been a fan ever since.I would rate this anime 4.5/5 stars for story, and 5.5/5 stars for visual (considering its vintage). Well worth the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding","review":"This movie is absolutely fantastic. Lush animation, intense story...All the qualaties a good movie needs.

In other words....BUY THIS NOW!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY CHANGE THE ORIGINAL AUDIO!?!?!?!","review":"Akira has been my all time favorite movie for years. I felt like a kid at Christmas when I saw it FINALLY came out on DVD. Then the unfathomable happened. I noticed that this classic movie's entire audio track had been redone with new dialogue and new voice actors. All I can say is that I am heartbroken by this awful decision. While the visuals have been greatly improved on this DVD, I will prefer the old VHS version until the original audio is brought to DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intense!","review":"This is an epic anime classic which will endure for years to come. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it; although some parts can get a little *gratuitously* violent, it really doesn't take away from the engrossing plot. I first saw it about a month ago, and I'm still raving about it. Every anime fan (who isn't turned off by lots and lots of gore and some very icky bodily transformations) should see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simply excellent dvd.","review":"This movie itself deserves 5 stars but the dvd only deserves 4. Only because I didn't really notice how it was digitally re-mastered, and the picture was only a little bit sharper. You should definitely buy this movie nevertheless. The convenient part of the dvd is that it has both the new dub (which really isn't as bad as people make it out to be) and it has the japanese with subtitles (watch it this way) The ending is breathtaking, and every time I watch it I notice even more. Just take notice that this isn't a movie for children. Keep the kids out of the house, and don't think this movie [...] because you don't understand it. Watch it a couple times, ask questions, and then decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great anime... lousy English","review":"I loved Akira when I saw it for the first time. I was amazed at the quality of the artistry, storyline... everything. When it was even remotely available on VHS, I started looking and eventually bought it. When the DVD came out, I was exstatic and bought it as soon as it was available. Unfortunately, I returned it the next day. The \\"new\\" english dub for the movie stinks. It sounds almost as if a group of fans got hold of the film and dubbed over it, using inferior equipment. I'm sorry to say that I can not recommend this version of an awesome, genre-breaking anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it was the original","review":"Some of the voices have been redone and lines changed. I quit watching as soon as I noticed that it wasn't the original. My Blue-ray disc copy will become a Christmas present for family and my VHS copy just became more valuable to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the older version","review":"Although I love the Akira story and everything about it, the special edition changed many things about the original. for one thing, the character's voices are different! am i alone in the group that thinks that is a really stupid maneauver? I'm really pissed that they would do such a thing. I LIKED the way Koneda's voice sounds when he's yelling at Tetsuo. I liked how twisted Tetsuo's voice becomes throughout the film. I liked the sounds of everyone els'es voice in the movie. why in the hell did they change that??! stupid morons. The movie is great, but if you want the real feel of the movie, go back to the original version of the movie. it's much much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Dolby 5.1 Soundtrack sucks!","review":"I just rented the DTS version just to see the difference and I would have to say that the DTS version is much much better soundwise. But if you don't really care about surround sound, then pick up this Special Edition has great features and the movie sounds ALRIGHT on the DD version. But for all home theater folks who like this movie, get the DTS version. It is like the single disc DD version except with Japanese DTS 5.1 audio, English Dolby Digital 5.1 audio and the movie. But seriously I recommend the DTS version if you want to truly enjoy the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sweetest Case Ever","review":"I had never seen it before, but ordered it off legend alone and was not disappointed, the sound was excellent, and the extras were sensational, but the sweetest thing about it is the crispy metal case it comes in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A butchering of a Classic!","review":"These \\"people\\" have destroyed a classic with the new English dub. Several catch lines from the movie have 'vanished, gone...without a trace' Just like that line from the movie. While the picture looks good and the sound is clear, the dialog ruins this movie. Anyone wanting this classic on DVD, unfortunately this is the only choice right now. Perhaps these morons at Pioneer will release the origional english dub on DVD.I am outraged as would any other fan of the origional."},{"rating":"2","title":"must get pre-order or none for u","review":"A must Buy!

See Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, or Cowboy Bebop the movie instead, Akira is a waste of plastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, not good, far from great....","review":"I didn't see this movie until about 3 years or so ago, and I will be the first to tell you, OVERRATED! This movie did not live up to the hype that I was expecting. First off, the plot is good, but from about the middle on just was, for lack of a better word, wierd. I don't think this should be the first thing people think when they hear the word Anime. The ending is soo strange that I made the decision to not see this again. The characters were also odd. To say the least you can do a lot better when it comes to anime, try Cowboy Bebop if you want a great anime (the show or the movie, they're both great!). Yes, 2 stars, and I'm still hesitant to give it even that many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Akira is the greatest anime ever !!!!!!!!!","review":"Recently, I saw Akira at 3 o'clock in the morning on sci-fi channel. When I watched it I was immediatly blown away by this awesome movie.After that, the first chance I got I went out and bought it. The reasons I liked it so much was because the animation was great and the plot was fantastic. It was very deep and confusing, which I like a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Akira- The best animated movie you can find","review":"What can I say. Akira has wonderful very smooth and beautifully done animation, great storyline (probally the best I've ever noticed in an anime), and alot of fun-filled action involved. I reccomend you buy this movie -- you don't have to be a die-hard anime fan to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Anime ever made, but Amazon's review is kind of off...","review":"This is the best Anime that has ever been made - the animation is great, and the deep story will cause you to watch it over and over. But to quote Amazon.com's review: \\"...the hope of mankind lies in a motorcycle punk by the name of Akira, whose own dormant powers arise during the conflict...\\" - I don't quite think that Akira is the motorcycle punk in the movie. It goes to show that not everything on major sites is perfect. Oh, well. Buy the movie anyway! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Anime","review":"One of the more insteresting, confusing, conveluted, awsome, well made Animes. If you've never seen an Anime (Japanese animation, this is the first one you should see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something lost in the translation","review":"I was excited when Akira came out on DVD. However, I was not prepared for what I was about to see. Having watched the \\"ORIGINAL\\" Akira on VHS, I was awaiting the digitally remastered and new English dialogue to be superb. Who's (...) idea was this? The new English dialogue lost EVERYTHING from the original Akira. I watched and listened to three different characters pronounce \\"Akira\\" three different ways, all incorrectly. The only part about the digitally remastering of this classic was that the colors appeared crisp and brighter accenting the fact that it is a well done anime.I was thoroughly disappointed in what Pioneer has done to a classic movie. I wasted money (...) for this awful version. I guess it just goes to show that you shouldn't mess with perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Pioneer","review":"As previously mentioned the video quality is very impressive. My problem with this remake is with the english audio. New voice actors and dialog make this film unwatchable to me. This movie is a classic and has been around for nearly a decade. It is too late to change it now. Come, on how would you like it if the voice of Darth Vadar of Star Wars was changed? I applaud Pioneer to trying to update the film but at least include an audio track with the original voices/dialog. As it stands this movie is going back, I would rather watch my old worn out copy on VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"this version is thoroughly disappointing","review":"The original movie \\"Akira\\" that came out in the 80's is, in my opinion the greatest animated film ever created. It has so many things going for it. The animation is fantastic, along with great music and sound effects including a unique, gripping, action packed story line.My friend lost my tape of the original movie a couple of years ago, and when I saw the \\"Special Edition\\" DVD version of the movie, I was excited to say the least. I got home and watched the movie as soon as I could, and after the first 30 minutes, not only was I extremely disappointed, but I was upset. Whoever decided to re-dub this movie and change the sound is a complete idiot. The movie has lost all of the lines and sound effects that made the original tape so great. If you bought this movie originally on VHS more than 10 years ago, do not buy this version. You will be sorely disappointed, wishing you had the old version on VHS to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE NEW AUDIO IS TERRIBLE","review":"Ok, the quality of the audio is nice, but they re-recorded the entire audio track. I might be an old biased grump but the old audio and voices was 100 times more enjoyable than this. Even with the original japanese audio, which is good, the subtitles have changed to reflect the new translation which manages to ruin even that. I'd wait until a version is released with the old audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Akira Sucks Buy the Old Akira instead.","review":"Although this new dvd may come in a special collectors case and look fancy it is a huge let down. The animation may look great but if you compare the voice acting of this Pioneer release to the good old Streamline Pictures 1988 release, the Streamline Pictures one blows this new one away. I miss the original Voice Actors of the English dub. The only way I could see if some one wants to buy this is for the Japanese Track. But if you buy it for the English track I suggest you find the old version it is 10 Times better. I give 5 Stars to the original version but only 2 to this one.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece? Not really....","review":"To be honest, I think this is seriously over-rated. Perhaps I just expected too much from it, but I didn't really enjoy it that much. Once I got into it I started to enjoy it, but I still wouldn't call it a masterpiece. The animation was good, as was the overall picture quality but I just couldn't see what the fuss was about. I'm just glad I didn't pay the extra for the Limited Edition Tin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Akira, not all it's cracked up to be","review":"Ah yes, Akira. After many years of anime fandom and having watched great movies like Perfect Blue and Vampire Hunter D, I expected this acclaimed anime to be best I had ever seen. I read tons of reviews and decided it was time I watched it as well. I sat in anticipation in front of my computer as the opening credits ran. But when the ended, I wasn't surprised by the 80s animation (I experienced plenty of that with Vampire Hunter D). As the story progressed, I got attached to the characters and thought damn...WHEN DOES THIS END?!?! The movie drug on and on and was FAR too long. In the end, I felt like the writers just dragged out the plot for the animation (that isn't even really that great). In the end, I was left thinking, \\"What the hell just happened?\\" Oh well, I wasted 2 and a half or so of my life. At least now I know what everyone is talking about...I just don't idolize Akira like everyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Translating shouldn't be this hard!!","review":"How is it possible to make two translations of the same darn script nearly unrecognizable? I don't know, but the people at Pioneer have managed to do that. Don't buy this DVD if you're hoping to get the same Akira that you've watched since 1988. It's not the same move AT ALL!!! The images are the same, the sound is WAY BETTER, but the voices, dialog and sentences are completely different with entirely new phrases, whole paragraphs missing, entire explanations dumbed down to Idiot American levels and, all in all, ruined.Yes, I'm outraged.Maybe, if enough people grumble about the massacre of a great classic Pioneer will re-re-release this DVD with the original dialogue, no matter if it's up to par with Dolby Digital standards or not.They've drained the blood from this great story. Buy this DVD and you buy a husk. A shell. A lump of skin with no guts. Welcome to junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcore Akira fans will hate this DVD.","review":"This is my first review. I feel motivated to discourage people from buying this DVD. Akira has long been one of my favorite movies and I consider it a must see. It would be a good addition to any collection. However the voiceovers for this DVD have been changed as well as some of the lines, and it sucks. Akira fans will be very disappointed. Perhaps people who?ve never seen the movie won?t mind since they have no basis for comparison, but long time fans are sure to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"benchmark half baked","review":"Yes it is a benchmark. One of the 1st Anime available in the west. The reaction of a lot of people seeing it for the 1st time was \\"what the hell\\"WHile A fine movie visually it only begins to scrape the surface of the original manga which has artwork just as good yet an infinitly better plot, that actually makes sense. I like the movie as a visual tribute to the original manga. Really I'm wanting 4hrs or maybe 3x2hr series to begin doing justice to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Film that opened the doors for anime to be accepted internationally.","review":"Akira kicked the door down for anime to be accepted by the world.

It is a rare opportunity to see into his thought processes, and it makes one realise just how much music meant to him- that he sought to serve it by understanding it as deeply as he could.In communicating this understanding, Stravinsky makes for an engaging, if somewhat challenging, read. The book is a transcript of six lectures given by the composer to French students, and the translators have seen fit to cast his words into a large quantity of \\"verbal Victoriana.\\" If at times it seems boring, it is all due to that style of language. Apart from that, it is an excellent account on the part of a man who (for all his known self-contradictions) clearly used his heart as well as his hands and his head.For students of Stravinsky, this book is essential. As a record of his personality and thought processes, it takes some beating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dire !","review":"I was unable to finish this though I managed to get most of the way through.I consider Strav. one of the most overrated composers of any century but I was prepared to give him a chance and see what he had to say.

The bar installed quickly, requiring drilling six holes in the brick (I also had the masonry drill bit which I used).

The filmmaker does a good job providing the viewer with a historical backdrop of Psi phenomena and research while also exploring some of the most important work happening in the field today. Although the subject matter is addressed with an appropriately objective and scientific sensibility, the film itself has a very personal feel and the filmmaker finds a good balance between skepticism and open-mindedness, an approach that will feel comfortable for most viewers not already intimately aware of this amazing phenomena.

I also bought and read The ESP Enigma, which offers a much deeper look at some of these topics and explores the non-locality of consciousness much more thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work...at all","review":"We have to rewash all the knives, most of the plates, and all plastic cups.

Its back to Cascade for our family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the standard store products like electrasol or cascade","review":"This works perfectly. Crystal clear glasses and very shiny plates! You do have the follow the directions very precisely and perhaps experiment the first few times to see how it works best in your dishwasher. I do use 1/2 of what I would use for normal dishwashing detergent. I pre-rinse my dishes and I sometimes use vinegar in the rinse-aid tank (but it does not seem to change performance of this product - vinegar was very useful with other products). It can't seem to handle cheese as the directions make clear, so, you need to make sure that is removed. It will overfoam if you try to use it like other detergents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"Coming from using the Electrasol Tabs, this detergent leaves many more bits of food stuck to the dishes and seems to be leaving my dishes looking visibly dirtier as time progresses. I find that to get the dishes to come out of the dishwasher looking anywhere close to clean, I have to pre-rinse them to nearly the point of hand-washing which, of course, defeats the purpose of having a dishwasher. Additionally, the increased hand-washing uses much more water which is not environmentally friendly. On the plus side, the scent is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"To many suds","review":"We have soft water in our area and the dishwasher kept overflowing with suds from the Earth Friendly dishwasher gel, cut way back on the amount we put in and it still overflowed.I read about the different ways to cut back on suds, from using vinegar to cooking oil, but thought it was ridicules to have do this every time I wash dishes in the dishwasher.We have since switched over to Ecover dishwasher tablets and problem solved, and the dishes come out sparkling, clean & spotless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Natural Dish Detergent Ever!","review":"I have used a few different brands of natural dish detergent and had been happy with all of them until I tried this one. It simply does not wash my dishes. There is food stuck on everything, which is funny since I started scrubbing all the food off my dishes when I realized this stuff doesn't work. And no, it's not my dishwasher disbursing food, it's brand new, and awesome. Once I'm done with this stuff I will going back to my favorite brand of natural dish detergent, BioKleen, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ecos dishwasher soap thumbs down","review":"I am all for using green products but this stuff does not do the job, I ran one load of dishes through twice, using hot water, there was food on the dishes and the glass pieces were cloudy. I emailed ECOS, they said I need to run vinegar through the dishwasher to change the PH, and then it will work but frankly that is just a little too much work. We also have hard water so maybe that is the issue The person from ECOS said that it works great for her with fine china, antique glass etc, but I guess I am just not willing to experiment, I just want clean dishes. Note, My appliance repair guy said to put a full glass of distilled vinegar upright in the dishwasher, after 10 or 15 times the deposits will go away and the glasses will not be cloudy. Don't put it in detergent dispenser, it will not work. Kind of off topic but thought I would mention it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to keep buying it...","review":"...but I never will again.

Bummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well if you only use 1/2 as much","review":"I have done about a dozen dishwasher loads over this past Thanksgiving weekend. In the middle of it, I ran out of the Seventh Generation stuff and switched to this. Wow, what an improvement! Since I have softened water, I never use a full dispenser of soap. After reading the directions, I only use 1/3 of a dispenser of this stuff. The dishes and glasses were noticeably cleaner with the Earth Friendly Wave than the Seventh Generation, and right in the same ballpark as the Cascade Complete I used to use. The glasses in particular were film-free. If some are seeing a residue, I suspect this is due to over-filling the dispenser. This is a concentrated cleaner and doesn't need as much. Try 1/2 or even 1/3 full."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope!","review":"The price alone forced me to be diligent in at least giving it a fair shot. I scraped and rinsed every dish, used the \\"pots & pans\\" cycle...even tried running it twice (undoing the environmental benefit, I'm sure), to no avail. Cloudy, grimy dishes at the end. If you don't love finding what looks like bird poop adhered to the bottom of your wine glasses, buy another detergent that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"Works amazingly well, clean and sparkly dishes and glasses every time.

Enormous waste of time and money.Any dish that isn't essentially hand-washed before going in the machine comes out dirty. The tiniest fleck of food will hold on to any surface and must be removed beforehand.The gel also appears to not rinse that cleanly, either. Pretty much everything you eat off of the dishes after using this stuff will taste of lavender. There are certainly worse aromas to have around your food, but I'd rather have none at all.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% Useless as dishwashing detergent","review":"This stuff is utterly useless as dishwashing detergent. I suspect that we would have better results if we used nothing at all than with this brand. It leaves a nasty cloudy film on the dishes...especially the glasses...that can not only be seen, but also felt. The glasses actually come out looking much worse than when they went in! It doesn't even come off easily when washed by hand afterward. We used if for a while and thought something was wrong with the dishwasher until we tried another brand. Tried it again when we ran out of our preferred brand the other day. We live in a part of the world where water is naturally soft, so we don't even have hard water to blame it on. Definitely not using this again. Wish I could find some other use for it...we have 3 bottles of the stuff left and I hate to just throw it out...but we will definitely never use it again for \\"cleaning\\" our dishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst!","review":"Your dishes will probably get cleaner without using any of this soap at all!!Even after pre-rinsing the dishes and not putting anything in dishwasher that was caked on, my dishes still came out very dirty.To me using a environmentally product on dishes that you then have to hand wash completely negates the 'environmental' aspect of using it.What a waste of water (and time! and money!). Shame on an 'environmentally conscious' company for creating such a ineffective product that leads to so much water waste.I got much better results with Ecover which proves you can use natural ingredients and still be effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"I completely renovated my Kitchen less than a year ago and installed a quality integrated dishwasher. I've tried several dishwashing detergents and tried this a few months ago because I try to use environmentally friendly products. As soon as I switched to this product my dishes came out with food stuck on them, residue and feeling dirty. Not all dishes/glasses/silverware were unclean but I had to inspect and then re-wash a lot of dishes.Even after pre-rinsing, not overfilling the dishwasher and running the sink faucet on hot for 15 seconds to get the hot water immediately into the dishwasher this product still did not perform.I have never had a product that performed this poorly. Its not earth friendly because I have to waste more water when I re-wash the dishes this product didn't clean properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful awful awful","review":"I don't think I can even finish the bottle.

(And, I always rinse them before loading the dishwasher.)-Leaves a residue on the glasses.-Creates way too much suds, which do not drain well, and can damage the motor.OTOH...hmmm. there is no other hand. Terrible product. Plain hot water would probably work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"removes coffee and tea stains?","review":"I just can't believe they state on the front label that this product removes coffee and tea stains! I had guests over, all of whom drink filter coffee, so out of 10 cups that I took out of the dishwasher after using this product, two of them went into the cupboard (they were probably the cups that I'd had my very weak tea in). The others I had to scrub because of the heavy coffee stains and put back in the dishwasher. I actually checked all the dishes to see if the dishwasher had actually been turned on they were so stained! Do not recommend this product and will not use it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"I now know why this product was on 'clearance'. Guess what--it doesn't work. It might be better as a bodywash or air freshner. Because it definently does not clean dishes.My first clue should have been that the bottle warns there is some prep-work involved to using the product. Wanting things to come out 'right' I followed this to the letter.Well, the company might as well not have included it at all. It wastes time. And it does not help the product perform any more efficiently. Nothing was clean when the cycle ended. It looked like I never even ran the dishwasher.I've not had problems with other organic/natural products. Ecos really does itself a BIG financial disservice through such low-quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Well, I got it at a local store for $2 after using a $1 coupon, and although I had read the previous reviews, I figured it just couldn't be as bad as so many others had claimed. And it's not ... if you don't mind oily lip smudges and melted on cheese and random streaks. I agree with the other reviewer who suggested it might be better to use no detergent at all than this stuff. How they ever got away with marketing this is beyond my imagination. If you put the dishes in perfectly clean, they will come out that way, but otherwise you will not want to eat off your own dishes. If I were Amazon, I'd take this stuff off the site entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor results","review":"Dishes that would be spot clean prior to trying this product did not clean well.

I say this is probably true, given how safe it is for the bits of the environment that are stuck to my plates. You can also easily overflow your dishwasher with suds if you use too much. I experimented with various amounts and couldn't find an amount that equated to getting my dishes clean, though I did find some amounts that equated to getting suds on my floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for us!","review":"Because of the majority of the reviews published, I have been thru 2 bottles of this product now, which I bought at my local CoOp, and I have to say I like. It works well for me. My dishes are clean, no film (though I do use Ecover rinse aid). I do pre-rinse my dishes, but I don't, by any means, scrub them prior to putting them in the dishwasher. I have never over-flowed the washer with suds. I like the lavender smell that fills my kitchen and lingers, mildly, on my dishes for a brief period of time. I live in the SW part of the Country so maybe the hard water has something to do with the quality of cleanliness different people get from this product. If you can find it locally pick up a bottle and give it a try before buying a whole case. But for me, I really like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"For those who found that the product doesn't work well, my suspicion is that you're using too much. Only a drop is needed, and the effectiveness diminishes if too much is used.Try again, this time use what seems like too little, and I think you'll be pleased with the results!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't clean, leaves film","review":"Unfortunately, this product just doesn't work. We pre-rinse plates, we've tried adding more or less detergent, and nothing seems to help. Our dishes are always streaked with a cloudy white film, and our glasses are all cloudy. Our utensils are rarely clean, and are always spotted. I've thoroughly checked our dishwasher to make sure there are no clogs and to ensure diry water wasn't re-circulating.I don't like the scent of lavender in dish cleaning liquid anyway, I prefer lemon or citrus, but I purchased this hoping it would be an environmentally helpful product.Sadly, it just doesn't do the job. I am now stuck with 5 bottles that I am not quite sure how to use - maybe they'll help cleaning the tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Environmentally safe but ineffective is not a good compromise","review":"Just spent $60 on a repair call to figure out why my dishwasher is not cleaning my dishes anymore. Coffee stains on my cups, food on plates and silverware, film on glasses... Dishwasher is fine. When I asked if it was at all possible that the problem was the new dishwashing gel, the repairman mentioned exactly what other reviewers have said, that this gel was not good, created ineffective suds and was prone to suds overflowing. He recommended the Cascade balls which are also recommended by Consumer Reports. http://www.amazon.com/Cascade-Complete-Phosphate-48-Count-Container/dp/B002SB95ZK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1288293195&sr=8-1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Without a doubt the most ineffective dishwasher detergnt I've ever used. I have a very good Bosch dishwasher and had no problems getting my dishes clean until I used this product. Every knife and cooking utensil has to be rewashed, regardless of how dirty it was to start with. Even butter knives are left with a scummy film. I don't see how this can be good for the environment if everything needs to be washed twice. Unfortunately, I bought it at Costco so I have to use up several bottles before I can go back to my old brand. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water type makes a big difference","review":"I've tried this and other earth friendly dishwasher products here in Nevada. Sadly the water here is pretty bad and I think that is a big reason behind the lack of performance in these products.

It's worth it when you find it though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"I love to keep my house organic and chemical free. This dishwasher soap is horrible. It left the glasses with a film, stuff on plates and the flatware did not even looked like it went through a dishwasher. Horrible stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves tea stains, food, and white film on dishes","review":"Unless you have extra time to inspect and re-clean all your dishes, don't buy this product. We gave it a try for three loads and each time found numerous dishes with food particles remaining, mugs left with tea stains, and even a white film left across plates. We tried increasing the amount and running the loads again, but the stains still persisted. We ended up needing to hand wash about 1/3 of our dishes. Considering all our extra water usage and extra time to get the dishes clean with Wave, we are immediately going back to conventional dishwashing gel, which always gets our dishes clean without pre-washing. We'll recycle the Wave plastic bottle, but sadly the contents are going down the drain. It's a shame that it's useless and actually created extra waste to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good job organic, but is this just water??","review":"This dishwashing detergent doesn't wash dishes very well. We've had to run the dishes through the washer twice! It's terrible. The bottle says it's \\"2X Ultra--High Performance\\", but I'd say 1/4X. It does smell really good before you put it in the dishwasher, but no smell after the wash.I've used ECOVER products and they're great so far! They have lots of environmentally friendly cleaning products that work wonderfully.I don't expect that a cleaning product without harsh ultra-ly processed and petroleum-filled ingredients to clean as well or with as few extra steps as a product with these. However, I don't like to be lied to on the label. Just tell me, \\"use three times as much\\" or \\"pre-soak for 2 hours prior to attempting using an automatic washer to wash\\". :) You get the gist.... Furthermore, I would forgo a nice smelling product for one that works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's awful!","review":"I usually use the Seventh Generation stuff (which works well for me) but took a chance on this gel because it was a little cheaper. It is AWFUL! It leaves all of my dishes covered in specks of food. It's almost as if somehow this soap grinds up any food that's left on the dishes into a powder and fine mists it onto everything. I do use a separate rinse aid but that didn't help. I'm surprised with all the negative reviews this product has that it's still selling."},{"rating":"2","title":"ESSENTIAL FOR ANY TRAIN BUFF","review":"Peter Semmen's book gives accounts of nearly every train wreck of the Twentieth Century up to 1990. He also includes sections on wartime disasters and boiler explosions. How much of this one reads will depend on one's interest, but it is valuable enough as a reference tool alone.

I wanted to learn more about the events taking place in the 50s and 60s in Cuba, but the book is wrapped up in love affairs and personal adventures of the author. Usually this is a good thing, as long as character development of the people involved cause me to feel somehow emotionally drawn to them. But that was not my experience.

The Spalax import release from France costs a few dollars more, but it is much better sounding. Leland Rodgers, the owner of International Artists label and the original recordings, somehow lost them in the late 1970's, and so the so-called \\"Collectables\\" label uses these awful 5th or 6th generation no-EQ'd tapes for their masters on ALL of their Elevators releases. They sound like Hell. Avoid them. Spend a couple extra bucks and buy the Spalax releases instead, if you're at all a discerning consumer, or, if you can, find the (believe it or not) superior 8-track tape mixes available in the trading circles, those have been reEQ'd and are 2 generations away from the master reels."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid movie!","review":"By far and away, this is the most stupid use of film, a waste of time & $.

Instead it rewards you with it's subtle nuanced craftsmanship and vision The ensemble cast hits on all cylinders. Straithairn is brilliant in a dark,yet somehow comic departure from some of his more stereotypical roles. Daniel Gillies is electric. There is nothing here to indicate the shoestring budget, beautifully filmed by award winning cinematographer Christophe Lansberg .First time writer / director Aaron Weidersphann brings together the whimsy of Capra, the pathos of Wes Anderson and the biting wit of Charlie Kaufman to this must see Indie delight.

This DVD bills itself as a response to \\"End of the Century\\", so I expected it would provide a lot of stories and opinions different from that film. Wrong!! All that the viewer gets is three poorly shot (and ridiculously short) interviews that reveal NOTHING NEW or even interesting, and some performance footage that any Ramones fan will have already seen.In short- if you're just getting into the Ramones, avoid this.

This flahlight is not only great for using in the above mentioned tasks but is is so bright that I can also use it to temporarily blind biligirent patrons and take control of the situation much easier with much less force or violence becoming a factor, greatly reducing the liability factor on my part.

Doesn't dim before it dies, like other flashlights. It'll just be dead the next time you pick it up. Batteries get very hot too. If all you do is flash quickly with this light, it will hold out for a while. But, if you use it to follow the dog at night, then it will do that for about 3-5 nights.

I also bought a nice kydex holster, hoping the new tail cap and new bulb would remedy the problem. Problem still exists. I won't mount this on my carbine, cannot trust it. Surefire is way overpriced, technology now provides as good technology or better at half the price. BTW, for ha-ha's I called Surefire and they said they would send me a new tail cap.

It can be carried in a pocket, or a pocketbook, and can easily temporarily blind an attacker with a simply push of a button. Still, it's an incandescent light and despite its power, battery life is only one hour with two CR123 batteries.The G2 used to sell for $26. Now everyone wants about $65 and Amazon, $59. For that price, I'd recommend an Olight M20 Warrior, which is selling for $69 currently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surefire G2 die too quickly","review":"These lights are decent but using the CR123 batteries becomes very expensive after awhile. I always seem to have a problem with them turning on in my pocket when not in use even though i properly turned the light to the off position. Surefire customer service did nothing to help out with the problem. This flashlight uses an incandescent bulb that burns out very quickly and is expensive to replace. I recently bought the Fenix E21 for about 35 bucks..it runs on 2AA batteries. The Fenix is much brighter..cheaper and uses more readily available batteries....and the light has never accidentally turned on in my pocket regardless of the conditions. The Fenix is a better light at a much better price and doesn't have the frustrating issues that the Surefire G2 has and is much more dependable..more cost effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch Incandescent","review":"It's outdated technology, it's plastic, bulb assemblies are expensive, battery life is short (1 Hour-ish). But this light is wonderful, and the so called negatives are actually positives and basically just the nature of the incandescent beast.If you don't need a lot of runtime, and you absolutely love the colour rendition of incandescent bulbs, and the stunning beam quality that goes hand in hand with Surefire, then the G2, (or maybe G3) is just the light for you. I prefer the G series over its aluminium brethren due to the fact that in the cold, Nitrolon will NOT freeze your hands, and when it becomes scratched, underneath the surface is still black (or whatever colour light you get), where as aluminium the scratches show up alot more.Do your self a favour and just buy this dang light!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one was a waste of $20","review":"The DVD is only 35 minutes long and the information is very basic.

Three quarters of the way through the book and I still have not found a story. I am not sure how it is considered of the spy genre. It is obvious the author has traveled in Europe and knows Paris well. It is obvious he likes the details of 1940's France. It is not obvious that there is a point to be made or a story to be told. Without the ubiquitous cold-blooded sex scenes this would make a readable travelogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Read in Historical/Espionage Fiction","review":"This was my first foray into the historical/espionage novels of Alan Furst, and I was very impressed with this little book. The writing is superb: Furst really captured for me the feeling of Paris at the start of the Second World War. I truly savored the way he created suspenseful atmospherics with an economy of words. I also greatly appreciated Furst's attention to historical detail, and the authenticity he lends his depiction of spy tradecraft. There are elements that test one's suspension of disbelief--the ability of the main character, Casson, to draw women to his bed rivals James Bond, and his escapes from disaster are almost unbelievable--but, to me, this mattered little. In fact, these just added to the fun. Furst's novel was a joy to read, and I can't wait to read more of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best.","review":"If you are looking for a current writer of espionage and like dialogue and character development instead of mindless action scenes, try Alan Furst. The World at Night is one of his better novels.I have now read all his books and will read them all again."},{"rating":"2","title":"World at Night","review":"Alan Furst makes the characters come alive as they sift through the ways to help prevent the Nazi spread.

His books are thebest historical suspense ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nightmare Years","review":"I have read several of Furst's novels and they are all very good, particularly in evoking the atmosphere of sheer terror that pervaded Europe between 1933 and 1945 - though he might extend the streak beyond 1945 to cover the early, horrific years of the cold war. I have only one suggestion: that for his future novels he should get a good French copy-editor. He makes a great many mistakes in French. These are novels, so it's a venal sin, but it detracts from his claims to authenticity to write, for instance, 'monsieurs et madames'. I'll send him a list of mistakes in this book, if he wants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story gimmick, poor story plot.","review":"A good deal of this relatively short book held my interest for the scenery and mood presented by the author. When looking at a couple of his other books, I see that presenting a realistic atmosphere of World War II Europe is this writer's gimmick. He is quite good at it, and there are certainly worse schemes in vogue by various popular writers.I rate this book low, but not because it is so slow moving. I have enjoyed other books with a deliberate pace. My problem with the book is that the plot is not presented until about half way through the book. Even then, the climax registered as barely a ripple in the water. When I finished the book, I wondered where was the rest, and what was the point of telling the story. I understand from other reviewers that the writer has a sequel to possibly complete the story. The book would have been better if the two volumes had been combined. I doubt that I will invest in the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only too little known recent history brillantly told","review":"A spy story used as a pretext or background for a fascinating -and sometimes frightening - brilliant book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic book attempt at Greene territory","review":"Alan Furst is no Graham Greene, and nowhere does this become more apparent than at the end of this silly, often trite book.

The setting - an aging chemical tanker bodes well. The plot - if there is one is diffuse. This novel wins the prize for most use of the f- word per page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Occupied Paris- To Resist or Not To Resist?","review":"Alan Furst's \\"The World At Night\\" is a haunting portrait of Pairs under the Nazi heel and one man's decision to oppose it. Film producer and reluctant soldier Casson loses everything when the Germans invade and appears to be a man with nothing left to lose. When some Parisians insist that now is the time to look out only for one's self, Casson soon learns the truth- that his nation and his people are still worth fighting for. He is soon recruited into the secret war against the Nazis and uses all his tricks and connections in the film world to learn what he can and foil their designs. Like most Furst novels the city of Paris itself is presented as a major character, indeed it reads almost as Casson's slavish mistress, or unrequited love. Furst again emphasizes character over plot and provides a richly deep, thoughtful spy thriller. A little slow at times, \\"The World At Night\\" nevertheless maintains the reader's interest throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Evocative","review":"In this book you are immersed in Paris during the occupation, you feel, see, taste, and experience life in this wonderful evocative portrayal of war time Europe.Alen Furst is a master of the gritty espionage thriller of period world war two. The story of movie maker Jean Casson, hedonist Parisian playboy, and his struggles to live and survive while his world collapses is intriguing and whole engaging, the only lapse is the story doesn't have a strong plot, it wanders and then ends... c'est la vie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The world at night isn't dark","review":"The one feeling that pervades all of the work of Alan Furst is HOPE...despite the political terror going on all around his characters, one nevers feels that they have reached the realization that the only future remaining is one of despair. In the case of the World at Night, Jean Casson (who continues his adventure in Red Gold) attempts to continue a somewhat normal life despite the Nazi Occupation of France and an ever increasing political vortex from both the right and the left pulling him in and away, constant reminders that he cannot continue his normal existance in abnormal times. He is ultimately compelled to make a choice and follow his conscience which nearly leads to disastrous results. The characters are well drawn and the story is exciting and like all of Furst's books, difficult to put down. This and the other books in the series are highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Austrian Insturmental music at its best","review":"Beung a folk music entusiast, and having visited Austria at the end of August of year 2006, I was marvelled a when my wife and I were entertained at a folk dance beer merry making.

In the No Limit area I would rather recommend Doyle Brunson \\"Super system\\" and Dan Harrington books on tournaments.

Instead, he stumbled into politics often enough I finally set the book aside, unwilling to mix an objective study of science with a subjective analysis of world political problems. He could have cited a variety of international examples, but chose to concentrate on the USA and a few others, leaving me uncomfortable about his motives. I suggest he stick to science in his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A biologist's vision of man","review":"Frans de Waal looks at humans the way he looks at chimps.It is customary to use animals as metaphores for humans. This never does justice to the animals nor to the humans, but a field biologist like Frans De Waal, who works in a zoo, is conditioned to look at animals in their own right. In this book, Frans De Waal avoids the moralism and shows us the great apes in their own right.Frans De Waal succeeds in describing the fascinating societies of two of the three chimp species, Chimpansees and Bonobos, in a very lucid style. De Waal compares their society and politics to our own, the third ape species. Without becoming moralistic, Frans De Waal shows that humans are neither as violent as the chimpansees, nor as maternalistic and promiscuous as the bonobos. But deep down, we do share a lot of characteristics with both species."},{"rating":"1","title":"One thing that no one is discussing","review":"One thing that no one is discussing out of this book I just finished.We share over 98% of DNAand many behaviorsWhy then, has never a Chimp or a Bonobo ever been filmed praying? or making an Idol out of a stick?

I feel better knowing what an animal I am! The rationalistic view of us doesn't fit (entirely) and I always knew that. I really enjoyed learning from deWaal with his easy to access, anectodal style.

This album doesn't really show off Joan's gorgeous voice but the music and lyrics are great and overall this is a wonderful album with a lot of soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strutting With Style","review":"For a debut artist, Joan Osbourne leaves little unturned. Most of this music is blues based. However, there are heavier touches (Dracula Moon, Ladder) and lighter tunes(Lumina, The Man With The Long Black Coat) and those in between(Pretty Baby). The lyrics really speak to their audience. You get the impression that Joan really cares about what she is saying.Joan's vocal technique is either passionate and strong or grungy and slightly out of tune(listen to Just Get Naked. The emotion of her performances and the support of her band which consists of former Hooters members Eric Brazilian and Rob Hyman makes you overlook any minor vocal misfires. Those who like raw honest rock with a touch of grunge should pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is GREat","review":"Joan Osbourne is gifted! All of the songs on this CD are GREAT! I found the CD in this pile of CDs my dad has. I Put it in the stereo and listend to it and fell in love with the guitar and her lyrics! One of us is one of my favorite songs! I hope she comes out with more CDs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful and Artistic Album","review":"Joan Osborne has a great voice and uses that voice to express her emotions perfectly. This album is a great mix of blues, folk, and rock elements. Everyone has heard \\"One Of Us\\" (What if God was one of us?), but other highights are St. Theresa, Ladder, and Pensacola. A couple songs, \\"Let's just Get Naked\\", in particular, could have been left out. So overall, I give it 4 stars. She really has talent to express emotion in her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need for Ketchup","review":"Joan's bluesy, edgier than Bonnie vocals serve to set this album off to a fast running start. The songs run the gammut between funky \\"Spider Web\\" to the slow and soulful \\"Crazy Baby\\", which kicks in with a vengeance during the chorus and carries you rapidly along til the hopeless end. Beautiful.If you like Blues guitar, aggressive yet soft-edged vocals, and fun lyrics, you'll like \\"Relish\\".\\"I dreamed of Ray Charles last night, and he could see just fine\\"Priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans might like Lucinda Williams as well","review":"I just got this album today mostly because my kids are huge Joan of Arcadia fans and because most of the customer reviews raved about this artist (and rightly so).

Fans of Joan Osborne who are unfamiliar with Lucinda Williams might want to give her a try, especially the World Without Tears CD. Just a thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if God was one of us?","review":"Honestly, this album is fantastic, and the most popular song might actually be the worst one this album has to offer.

Now I know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLUES AT BEST, SOULFUL TOUCH!","review":"When I First saw \\"One Of Us\\" on vh1, I was blown away!,... I believe this song is not against God(I truly believe in God and all his glory), I feel that \\"One Of Us\\", describes the amazing loneliness sometimes the human being feels in this stress out world, One Of Us is a deeply soulsearching song, with great lyrics, great music. Only for this single, the album is worth buying, but the rest of the album has great moments, like \\"St. Teresa\\", \\"Ladder\\", \\"Lumina\\", \\"Crazy Baby\\", and one of my personal favorites \\"Let's Just Get Naked\\", Joan aproaches that song like she really wants it badly!, \\"Right Hand Man\\" it's totally rock roots!, great album, I miss this kind of good music in the record industry this days!, well \\"0304\\" by Jewel is one of the few that are OK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a big letdown","review":"If you're expecting more of the great soul and blues you heard on \\"Early Recordings\\", forget it.

Joan Osborne is an incredibly talented and versatile vocalist, best at a blues-rock kind of thing, and I wish she'd settle down into her own groove. \\"St. Teresa\\" and \\"One of Us\\" are just great, and truly original. But \\"Let's Just Get Naked\\" could be Liz Phair and \\"Right Hand Man\\" sounds just like Bonnie Raitt!

The \\"soundtrack\\" album is one of the all-time great music-from-and-inspired-by ripoffs; only two of Jon Bon Jovi's 10 songs on it are in the movie (and then only over the end credits, and not even in their entirety), and Alan Silvestri - who wrote most of the music that's actually IN the movie - is fobbed off with one token track (\\"Guano City\\") lasting all of 59 seconds, and thus raising the bar for soundtrack album ripoffs to a height that to this day has (thankfully) never been reached. (\\"XXX,\\" which managed to find no room for Randy Edelman's score over a DOUBLE-disc set, will have a score album from good old reliable Varese Sarabande.) Score fans, avoid this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good. Surprised me.","review":"I personally dislike Bon Jovi (the band) a lot. For me, they are nothing more than hair-metal. Pop, ballads, love lyrics, all the cliches.But Jon Bon Jovi has enormous talent. In this album, free from his regular band, he wrote a dynamic, diverse, intelligent and fun to listen rock album, using a movie (a silly one, by the way) as the basis for the album.

The [lower priced] version is a standard stereo CD. The [higher priced] version, however, is encoded in DTS surround sound. The DTS version is will work only if your system includes a DTS decoder, and must be played on a DVD player; a standard CD player can't read it. On the other hand, if you have a DVD player and DTS decoder, you *must* get the DTS version; the difference it makes in the definition of individual instruments is dramatic! (DTS is a relatively new format intended mainly for home theater. It's similar to Dolby Digital, in that it provides six discrete channels of sound.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent playing from Chick and Co.","review":"It's good to know that Chick Corea is recording more albums in the acoustic format, and I hope it stays that way. His solos are best heard on acoustic piano, and this Powell tribute attests to his gift for inventive improvisations. There is much energy on this recording, slowing down only on \\"I'll Keep Loving You\\" and picking up again on \\"Tempus Fugit\\", before Corea closes the album with a pretty good solo piano take on \\"Celia.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"need strong maths background","review":"The author takes you on a heavy journey into probability theory. Covering single and multiple random variables. All the way up to describing the Central Limit Theorem and its uses, like Chi squared distributions. He builds on these to explain random time processes and ergodic distributions. Then in the frequency domain, we see spectral density functions and the concept of a stationary process.All this in the first half of the book is more general than just for analysing vibrations. It could easily apply to communications theory, for example.It is only in the second half that we get to studying random vibrations. In single and then multiple degree of freedom systems. Overall, you need a strong mathematical background before commencing this book, as well as several courses in mechanical engineering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coincise","review":"It's a good problem solving book but not much on theory.

Linking the reconnection of circuitry to the revitalization of our endocrine system and ultimately to ascension. Written in trance, this dazzling quantum poetry marries the new paradigm of higher physics with spirit. The result is a living intelligence that engages the mind whilst transmitting a harmonic that can be understood in the heart.

I figured since it was Disney that it would be aimed at younger children. However, I was disappointed in the amount of reading (alot!)that was required.

Unfortunatley, this game did not live up to our expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for younger kids","review":"We bought this for our 4 yr old.

There's lots to read; the characters don't speak, so if your child hasn't mastered reading, he won't really know the rules of the games he plays.My son and I played it long enough to get far into the 100 Acre Woods, then we turned off the game. It saved where we left off, but when we started the game again, we had to read the prompts when Pooh headed out of his house or we would've lost our saved game, so beware. I showed my six year old how to begin his saved game; if you press the \\"new adventure\\" selection, you're saved game is history.Overall, I don't like this game because you can lose all that you complete within a click of a button. I didn't find the games too exciting, but my son seems to like them...at least for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO FUN AT ALL!","review":"I bought this game for Christmas for my 5 year old daughter. Luckily I tried it out before the event and realized that it was not only very boring but also too difficult for a 5 year old level. Way too much reading involved my daughter could not have played this game without help. Also it's always the same boring activity (play a board game). I sold mine on e-bay and got my money back! Don't buy this one, it's not worth it. I gave it two stars because the graphics are nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game was a major let down!!!!","review":"I got my daughter this game with her GBA for her birthday. It is supposedly for ages 4 and up but there is a lot of reading involved. All this game did was make us all mad and really upset my daughter since she couldn't play without help.

We are taking ours back!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"I was very disappointed with this game. I bought it for my 5 year old daughter assuming that because it was Winnie the Pooh it would be aimed at young children. But, it is too difficult for her. My 6 year old son doesn't like it either.

What was Disney thinking with this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young kids","review":"I got this game for my daughter. She was so excited when she saw it, but then when she tried to play it she couldn't. You need to be able to read quite well to play this game.

It is quite challenging and not for any child who cannot read well."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for baby players","review":"this game is very boring if you are 6 up you should start leaving wini da pu but i love tigger he is very cute"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game Is Full Of Fun Surprises","review":"I think this game is for anyone.

It requires at least a 1st grade reading level and even us adults had trouble figuring out how to move from place to place.

My recommendation: try the Arthur or the Blues Clues games instead if you are buying for a young child."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for small children","review":"My five year old son and four year old daughter like Winnie the Pooh but they were not interested in this game.

No action and you're supposed to be reading very well. If you visit a place in the 100 acre forest again, you have to read the same text all over again, it takes time and slows the game to extremes. Nearly all the ingame games are based on tossing the dice. Once you're in a dicegame you cannot get out and all the dicegames are very alike.Very fast it becomes VERY monotonous.

Because of the way Pamper's are made with plastic, it rubs your child's skin and leaves angry red marks where the diapers come in contact with a baby's thighs.Huggies Supream is clothlike and never leaves irritation marks on my daughter.

I heard the NPR interview with the author and went to find the book... It's not about Lawrence in the way that Watergate's not about Nixon. Mr. Dyer can document malaise like no other -- he has a strange obsessive way that puts him in sympathetic tandem with his subject. I still laugh when I think about Dyer's take on deconstruction early in the book, and his views of academia are dead on. Not to be forgotten, the travel aspect of this is great as well. The things that make Dyer funny and charming (or not, depending on your sense of humor) are also the reasons Dyer finds Lawrence funny and charming -- in his own cranky way.

I sit disappointedly writing this brief review, as there is not really much to say, precisely because the author does not say or do much. In fact, he makes the whole point of the book his failed attempts at writing two actual books: one a novel, the other a book about DH Lawrence. \\"Rage\\" is used appropriately in the title, as kind of a double entendre for the author's rage at his own inabilities, but it also references DH Lawrence's own quote regarding his attempt at writing a book on Thomas Hardy. While the author's writing style appeals to me, it is drudgery to get through this, unless you're a crazy, procrastinating, lazy, neurotic nut like the author. I read books to be swept along, and my disappointment here lies in the fact that the book sweeps you into the life of the author, which is depressing and weird. Plus, it's pretty hostile in there.

With colorful illustrations, this author lets children explore that possibility. \\"If I Could Fly\\" has the rhythm and feel of \\"Good Night Moon.\\" My 4-year-old goddaughter wanted it read to her over and over again. The idea of flying through the wall into her brother's room and outside, over the rooftops, and what she could see below, is intriguing. It is a simple yet magical story about the wish to fly come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Shoe!","review":"The very first time I wore it I felt it was made for me; no \\"breaking-in\\" period required.

Both funky and danceable tunes combine with Rick's rockin style to produce a truly entertaining CD. Lyrics make you smile, cry, or just plain hot. The lyrics give insight into the darker taboo side of emotions. Listening to Sahara Snow is like listening to poetry put to music. I can't stop listening to the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Like Bad Music from 1985","review":"I have been a huge Rick Springfield fan since the early 80s. I have religeously purchased each of his CDs... with the exception of one - Sahara Snow. Well, I recently came across the CD online and decided to purchase it. What a mistake! As big of a Rick fan as I am, the album outright .... Although it was released 1997, it sounds like music straight from 1985. The kind of 1985 music that has not withstood the test of time.Rick, I love you man, but promise me that you will never work with Bob Marlette and Tim Pierce again.P.S. I'll be purchasing the new album the day it hits stores. Karma was excellent... so I know Rick still has a lot of great music in him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sahara Snow is Hot","review":"Sahara Snow is superb. Rick Springfield's voice has changed from his younger days and it is this new voice that distinguishes Sahara Snow from his previous albums. Sahara Snow contains powerful rock and roll songs with a light touch of New Wave. You want to sing along and dance to each well-crafted songs. The best tunes are \\"Psychoactive\\", \\"New Lover\\", and \\"Modern World\\". Rick Springfield has moved his music to the next level. Sahara Snow has a distinct, hypnotic, smooth sound. It is a CD that every music lover should listen to. Rick Springfield Rules!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Collaboration between three great artists!!!","review":"I had heard so much about this CD from many different people that I just couldn't wait to get it. At first listen I though it sounded a bit dated. However the more I listened to it, the more I loved it! Some of the ly\\"Rick\\"s on this CD provide some of the most erotic imagery of Rick's songwriting career! This is a great CD to pop in the car and drive to."},{"rating":"2","title":"An R.S. Fan Must Have!!","review":"Any RS fan has to get this album. After a long(9 years)hiatus, Rick returns a little quietly under a group name on a foreign label. I've owned this album since it's release and haven't been disappointed. I own every album of Rick's from Beginnings to Karma and Sahara Snow fits in perfectly! His guitar and vocals have changed over the years, but his emotion into each song is still pure. If you are a fan like me, it's worth it! Best songs: Lust, Psychoactive, Somewhere, Rovianne, Modern World. Let's \\"Dance this World Away\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick Springfield is back!","review":"Yes, Rick Springfield is back from an all too long hiatus, forming the group Sahara Snow with long-time guitarist Tim Pierce and keyboard player Bob Marlette. RS fans will not be disappointed with this album. The album opens big with the \\"Rock of Life\\"-like \\"Modern World\\", gets funky with songs like \\"Psychoactive\\", \\"Scandalous Life\\" and \\"New Lover\\", dares you not to sing along with the downright infectious melodies of \\"Rovianne\\", \\"Miss Your Kiss\\" and \\"Suzanne\\", and has a couple of truly great rock tunes in \\"Heaven\\" and \\"Lust\\" (a song that could have walked right off his \\"Working Class Dog\\" album). As usual, the songs are heartfelt, have great vocals, and feature hooks galore, with Tim Pierce providing his typically amazing guitar work.If you're a Springfield fan, or just someone who loves great pop/rock music, you'll definitely want to add this album to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"everybody will be happy now!","review":"sahara snow rocks the house from start to finish. put it on and revel in the fact that rick and company still deliver the goods. this is a great cd full of hooks and biting lyrics. everyone i've played it for loves it. a must have. best cuts are modern world, rovianne, scandalous life, psychoactive, and new lover - but they are all great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!","review":"I guess I'm a Rick fan that went to the way-side cause I never knew he'd formed a band called Sahara Snow.

Last two I bought were Eolian Minstrel and Kryptos. I did not get the Rose album because it was not of the calibre of his other works. When Eolian Minstrel came out, I was very satisfied with it. Then came Kryptos which much of the album was not of the same spirit that Andreas had with his previous works but I bought it because of one of the pieces that I became hooked on. When the Cosmo album came out it was just not good at all. It just sounds like he put no heart into it.I do hope that he starts to go back to how he had previously put these projects together starting from Caverna Magica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Andreas, where the hell are you going?","review":"I am disappointed that Andreas has recently failed to live up to the expectations which his recordings usually arouse in me. Basically, there is no substitute for the sumptuous melodies and inventive rhythms that abounded in his early releases. Later Vollenweider has been marred by insipid, meandering vocalisations. And this CD reinforces my opinion that a musician I admire should stick to what he does best - playing the harp."},{"rating":"1","title":"No direction","review":"I have all of Andreas's previous releases and I must say how disappointed I am with this. It seems to lack any sense of direction, almost as if it had been released, for the sake of realeasing something. Andreas, you are a superb harp player, Please play the harp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"I am a fan of Andreas since his first release years ago, I would always rush out and buy the latest record/CD the moment I found out there was one. I usually do not review the music, I trust in his brilliance and have spent countless hours listening to his harp, it is extraordinary, unlike anything else out there. However, since one can listen to samples here I tried it just before clicking to buy this new release -- I could not believe what I was hearing! Is this Andreas Vollenweider? I even went so far as to drive to a store and listen to the entire CD, hoping with each new song to find \\"the old Andreas\\" -- he is not here. A real waste of his superb talent, his genius, and not worth buying. I could not be more dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"You could like it !","review":"Please, don't teach the artist how to compose. Better consider the fact that tastes differ. As one of the above respected fellow reviewers here, I also posses almost every Vollenweider CD, and I bought this one automatically, because I like his LATEST style. I really do. I find this CD quite soothing, and if you want to hear some of those dull harp variations on same theme, better stick to White winds or Caverna Magica, because you wont find them here, or on Kryptos and The Book of Roses. This piece is consisted of short well-composed soothing instrumentals/vocal parts. I highly recommend it to every fan of good world music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, he's back!","review":"Andy is definitely back in business...This cd seems one of hisbetter in many years.

I was appreciative of that but I must confess that my favotrite thing about he film was the ever gorgeous Litefoot, I personally am a big fan of his music and acting and am proud that he is a young Native Man doing something to make life better for himself and for his people.

I would recommend this movie to everyone young and older :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lessons for children! (Enjoyable for adults too)","review":"A non-animated movie children will watch because it has a \\"fairytale-like\\" story, and it shows that there are consequences to acting without thinking. Adults can enjoy a humorous, lighthearted storyline. Well written and well acted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book dumbed down into sappy \\"morality play\\"","review":"Having read the book with my children, and being delighted with its imagination, vivid characters and imagery, laugh-out-loud predicaments, and the subtle underlying story of a child's gradual emotional awakening and subsequent sense of human interconnectedness and responsibility -- I absolutely detested this movie. It was almost as if Mr. Oz had a \\"Humor-and-Depth Detector\\", pinpointed all of the book's worthwhile scenes and aspects, and then completely DRAINED the story. His characters are shallow and one-dimensional and the most engaging, as well as thoughtful, encounters in the book are missing entirely. THEN he goes and finishes with a beat-'em-over-the-head, ham-handed, condescending \\"lesson\\". Bad, bad, BAD. Needless to say, I was not only disappointed in Mr. Oz's film; I was disgusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sorry I bought it, but","review":"I'm not sorry I purchased the DVD because my son really enjoyed the books.

Frankly, they said it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Too expensive for the items included.The photo shows a brown rectangle image that I mistook as a \\"cupboard\\" for the key and figurines; turns out to be a cheap cover for the VHS movie.Indian in the Cupboard: Gift Set (includes 5 figurines) [VHS]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Indian on the shelf.","review":"This is a charming movie with nice special effects, a heartwarming story, and plenty of drama and conflict to keep it interesting for adults and children alike... once.We bought this movie for our kids and they have watched it maybe one or two times. It is a bit long and drags towards the end, making it less than ideal as a \\"frequent favorite\\", at least in our home.If your kids enjoy cowboys, Indians, or magical fantasy (not the Harry Potter kind, but more along the lines of Neverending Story or Labyrinth), they may get a kick out of it. But I'd be lying if I said this movie was worth the purchase price... it's probably best off as a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"No need for some scenes","review":"Bought this for my grandkids without viewing first. I have now sent a warning to my daughter in law to preview it before letting them see it. Cuss words and a music video make it the PG I think. Could have done without both and probably rated it G. From now on I preview even kids movies before sending them to the grand kids. Had I done so I would not have sent it. I hope the Borrowers which I also haven't seen but sent is OK. Now I'll go get it from the library to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Very Beievable Acting Job","review":"In this movie, they show the character's feet at seemingly random times. Play upbeat music when it isn't needed, and some of the parts don't make any sense. When Omry (guy on the front) is asked (by his mom) how he felt, he said, \\"I fell pretty (BEEP!) good!\\" and the mom just stood there, smiling. (I'd like to see some REAL kid pull that one without getting busted)Omry gets a cupboard, that when something is placed in it, locked in, then taken out; is alive. when he first meets the Indian (very scared at the time) and tells him his name is Omry, the Indian suddenly calms down, as if his name was soothing (????). And Patrick, Omry's friend, is probably the worst acting job of the movie.A not-so-good acting job and lame plot don't make this movie worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too violent","review":"My 10 year old son was reading this book in class and we decided to watch the movie as a family. About half-way through the movie is a scene, absolutely not in the book, where Native Americans are shot by \\"cowboys\\", scream in pain and die. My son was so distressed, we had to turn the movie off. I have since met three other families whose children had nightmares or other strong negative reactions to this totally unnecessary graphic violence. I will admit that my 8 year old daughter was not bothered by it, nonetheless, I cannot recommend this movie for young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is great but the movie sucks!","review":"I love fantasy movies like Hook, The Wizard of Oz, and The Neverending Story but fantasy movies like these are just awful when I saw this movie in the theater along time ago it was just too boring for me. It's a lot like the Toy Story movies but I thought Toy Story was way better than this. I think the story is great but the movie is just too slow. Probably a better idea to stick with the book the movie sucks itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insidious anti-Indian film","review":"This film looks wonderful at first glance. But when you stop to analyze what's going on, you realize that the boys are playing with real living toys (i.e. thay take the living figures to school when they know better). The boys never let the Indian have a gun to have equal protection. And the whole idea behind the story is a re-inforcement of the US government's attitude toward Indians: \\"You're nothing but little people. We'll take care of you because you're too small to take care of yourself in this big (read \\"real\\")world.\\" This film is dangerous to young children's attitudes about Indians."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll get straight to the point","review":"*racistUnless a parent is going to use the book/movie as a learning tool to show explain racism to their child don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received","review":"This was ordered on 5/27/09 and never received/billed.

This movie is a mere shadow of the book. Omri's family is nice and even the boy who plays him is okay. The Native American who played the \\"Indian\\" (Litefoot) did a wonderful job but the script was so pathetic. The boy who played Patrick was repugnant and not much of a real friend. One of the major things that just absolutely kills this movie for me is the excessive amount of cussing (at one point Omri even says a cuss word to his mom, and she responds with a proud, wide-mouthed grin). Not only that, but in one scene the boys even have the cowboy and Indian watching a raunchy music video, and plenty is shown to make it offensive. These were fatal mistakes in my opinion, I am sure I am not the only one who was turned off by these things. It would have been so awesome to see what a really good director could have done with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies in the 90's","review":"The Indian in the Cupboard stars Hal Scardino and Litefoot. It is about a boy who turns 9 years old and gets a magical cupboard as a birthday present. And the cupboard brings to life toys. As the movie opens, Omri (Hal Scardino) got a cupboard as a birthday present. But there is no key. So his mom (Linsay Crouse) promises Ormi if he finds a key that works the cupboard she will give it to him. And the key that works is a key that his mom got for her dying grandma (when her grandma had nothing to leave her). Ormi puts in a liitle indian he also got for his birthday for his best freind Patrick (Rishi Bhat)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of Turkish Sufi ney","review":"Neyzen Aka Gunduz Kutbay (d. 1979) was often considered the best of his generation to embody the Sufi spirit of Turkish ney playing. His breathy, un-flute-like timbre, his emphasis of the lowest notes, and his obvious passion conveyed that spirit.

In fact - it inspired me to pick up a guitar for the first time. I figured if they could do it - I could. Not a good place to start in hindsight. Looking back now, Mike McCready is pretty feeble and has delusions of Hendrix.I stopped listening to them after everyone jumped on the bandwagon and they started releasing those excremental follow-up albums. A friend of mine was paying this DVD at his place the other day and I got a shock. I've not followed them since about 1992 and I couldn't believe how old they've got and how annoying Eddie Vedder's voice has become.

(he also looks like he's put on to much weight since the 2000 binural tour, and looks weird with short hair and no beard?) not to be a whiner here but a bands image is important too.Rockstars are'nt suppossed to dress like everyday people in nice tidy polo shirts?Matt cameron does a great job on drums, as for the organ player ........this band are really taking an odd direction and its not really neccesary.Hopefully they can step it up a bit next time.They really should release one of their live shows from 1994 or 1995 on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened","review":"If not for a chance meeting to create Temple of the dog Eddie would be waiting patiently at the base of the expressway exit asking for change.

I was blown away by her acting! I think there are many things that contribute to this really good movie---the direction, the main actress, the supporting actors, particularly Elizabeth Mitchell. The relationship between Gia and Mitchell's character was touching and heartbreaking. This story follows Gia's rapid rise to supermodel stardom and follows her reckless behavior and finally her death of AIDS. If you want to see the pre-Oscar Angelina Jolie, give this dvd a try. You'll see exactly why she won the Oscar later."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY POWERFUL MOVIE","review":"GIA IS VERY STRONG, POWERFUL, AND MOVING.

The supporting actors, especially Merdedes Ruel are also great. The film is just altogether well done, with a great script, wonderful cinemaphotography, and a good directer. Its a shame hollywood films can't look this good.Even if you know nothing about Gia, watch this movie. By the end of it you'll wish you knew more about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gia","review":"Sad and intriguing story of a model that found it hard to keep her life together. I'll watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Descent of a Supermodel","review":"Money and professional success cannot buy you happiness: this, I reckon, is the moral of the story. Gia grew up fast and had to deal with many overwhelming and all-too-adult problems on her own. She could not cope. Her internal state craved numbness, and so she turned to drugs. From there there is, as we know, just one way to go...Jolie is superb in this movie, no question about it. The movie conveys the grit of the real and less than always glamorous world of modeling. Like in every profession, sometimes you face difficult situations, and human psyche is fragile, and often fails in the high pressure professional world, especially when personal life is not working out. Watch this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but true","review":"This is a really good movie. Unfortunately, it is very sad as well. Even though it could be argued Gia did not accomplish much in her short life other than modeling, she had a large effect on people. This is due mostly to her drug use, and general volatility.Angelina Jolie doesn't look like Gia, but having substantial modeling in her background made her good for the part. Elizabeth Mitchell was excellent as her girlfriend. All the other characters were well-acted, too.It is always sad when someone dies early in life. Gia is notable for being one of the first women to die of (drug-related) AIDS, in 1986.No notable extras on the DVD. Get it for the movie. The last shot was a nice touch.I'd never heard of Gia until I bought the DVD. I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I've seen.","review":"Angelina Jolie was great in this movie much like her father in \\"Coming Home' It is a beautiful movie that tells the strory of Gia who is gone but not frogotten it will make you cry like it made me at the end it has a solid cast great director and so fort it will make you look at life and appreciate what you got already and if your male or female im sure you will cry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and deceptive","review":"I find it sad that the nudity should be censored from this DVD.

Specially back when they didn't know what it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing Tale of Fame and Self-destruction","review":"This is really an excellent film and it rightly catapulted Jolie to stardom. Her performance here is outstanding. If this had not been an HBO film, she probably would have won an Oscar. It is a beautifully filmed gut-wrenching story. Not for the prudish certainly, but for those heartier souls, this is a real winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment.","review":"Well, it looks like I definitely have a contrarian opinion here because so many amazonians loved \\"Gia,\\" but I simply could not get into this movie even though I watched the entire thing. Due to its weak plot and characterization, I don't know if we can really make a statement regarding Jolie's acting talents. There's not much that she could have done with such a stunted role. It is profoundly difficult to form any type of attachment to Gia. She's just not someone you can feel empathy for.I will grant that many of the party and sex scenes are magnetic, but, despite their visual interest, they are in no way a legitimate substitute for a meaningful plot. With the lesbian scenes, I understand why the movie caused a stir, but it seems to me that, if one is interested in such things, there are more direct and uniform sources from which to derive these pleasures. At every level, \\"Gia\\" just doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic, but Real","review":"This movie is a tragic tale of the life of supermodel Gia Carnegi. It tells of her life of heartache, addictions, and the rise and fall of her modeling career. Angelina Jolie is exceptional in this movie. She taps into her characters pain and suffering as if it were her own. You feel as if you were watching this horrible train wreck in reality.It saddens me to see what became of this beautiful model who was covered all over magazines and runways. Unable to deal with the pain and hardships of her life, she turns to drugs as comfort. This movie portrays addiction as it is, ruining the addicts life as well as those around her. It is an account of her life in the fast lane ending in tradgedy. I do not want to give the plot away, but it is worth a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"All about Angelina - no Gia in sight","review":"This film was a great vehicle for Angelina Jolie. Unfortunately it only bears a passing resemblance to the life story of Gia Carangi. If you're interested in Angelina's boobs buy this film. If you're interested in Gia Carangi, buy the book Thing of Beauty by Stephen Fried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploits women","review":"Just shows how the modeling industry and then hollywood loves to exploit women and treat them like objects. Terrible in the fact that something like this also makes girls feel bad if they do not look like a model. Shallow idiocy that is again, praised by hollywood who cannot stop making money on this woman's death. Jolie is an actress of immense proportions (no pun intended) but I am surprised she took the role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live the life fantastic.","review":"When talented people lose their lives far too early, it's tragic. The story of Gia Carangi, as presented by scripters Michael Cristofer (Bonfire of the Vanities), and Jay McInerney (nothing worth mentioning) tries hard to present a tale of tragedy with one glaring omission: Gia Carangi was never talented.She was beautiful, and from a broken home. She became addicted to drugs, she had low self-esteem, and lost her life early. It's all a shame but hardly anything earth-shattering in today's world. Unfortunately, Mr. McInerney continues to believe that beauty IS talent, that people really CARE about supermodel's lives, what they think, alas the rub.Angelina Jolie is beautiful and takes us through a range of emotions in her portrayal of Gia. The story is predictable and derivative, the dialogue cliché after cliché.Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"A biography about someone you could care less about.","review":"Contemporary Hollywood loves movies about poor misunderstood actresses and models who resort to drugs/sex/drugs because their lives are so difficult in the fast lane. Someone once said write what you know so Hollywood gives us are these types of stories (at least this one doesn't have a hooker as the lead character!). It is convincingly played by the actors but one gets the idea the parts are not really much of a stretch for them. Additional nude lesbian scenes were added to the video version which pretty much says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cried during the last 15 min","review":"finally a couple of georgious lesbian characters played by people who could both act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated in a big way","review":"This movie was insultingly bad. I saw it before I knew anything about it and was shocked to hear it's gotten so much critical acclaim. My sister - 16 and a usual fan of AJ - and I happened on it on HBO and couldn't stop laughing at it. (It's not a comedy). It was trying to be all deep and glamourous, but we thought it was pretentious and silly. If you want to see a movie about drugs messing with people's lives, try Sid and Nancy, High Art, Train Spotting or Drugstore Cowboy, not this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was great! It was also sad.","review":"This movie was one of the best movies I saw all year. It was so cool. Gia's life made a really good movie. The best part in the movie is when she makes the cover of VOUGE. This movie really focuses on her bisexuality and her life on heroine. I give it 4 stars on a scale from 1-4."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent film elevated by Joli's amazing performance","review":"\\"Gia\\" is a decent film that is elevated due to the extraordinary performance of Angelina Jolie as the title character. Jolie won a Golden Globe for her brilliant portrayal of a young woman who was intensely sexual, deeply vulnerable, vivacious, and self-destructive. The film covers Gia's life as she goes from being a punky kid to the world's first supermodel. Along the way she has plenty of access to drugs and easy sex, but few opportunities for real love and support. Tragically, she contracted AIDS from her IV drug use and died before she was able to create a meaningful life for herself. The film is a little exploitive when it comes to portraying Gia's lesbian relationship, but Jolie's performance elevates the film above pure titillation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake UP","review":"I wish people would stop blinding themselves with Angelina Jolies looks and start seeing what an incredible actress she is. The way she portrayed Gia is absolutely fantastic. Hat off to her for throwing herself into this with heart and soul. If anyone one thinks this is not a soul destroying part to play, think again. If it was me, I would have been burnt out by the end of this. Wake up people and see the actress at work and not her beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong performances, tragic story","review":"This tale of the fashion industry, and how it uses, abuses, and discards its participants, features strong performances. First, Angelina Jolie, as the brassy, sassy, and ultimately pitiful figure of Gia, as well as Mercedes Ruehl, as her mother, and others, make this a tragic tale of a girl, who makes it big; then self-destructs, facing what was then the largely unknown disease which was, and still is, Aids. Not for everyone but a good movie. There is an unrated version; which I'm not sure what more could be added, as this \\"R\\" rated one features quite a bit of controversial material (Nudity, Lesbianism, Drug Use). Not a upbeat movie but a moral fable for modern times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelina Jolie","review":"Wow! What an actress! Angelina Jolie was magnificent in this role. She was very convincing and amazing. I could see this again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gia","review":"Very sad and tragic. I think many of her problems came from users, hanger-ons and Gia's own low self-esteem and intent on self-destruction due to her inability to feel comfortable in her own skin or with her own sexual orientation. Angelina Jolie's portrayal of Gia was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want Angelina Jolie ALL TO MYSELF!","review":"She is so believable as a supermodel! And it's also believable that a heterosexual woman could find her attractive as well, as she's possesses a tough-yet-vulnerable eroticism that I found irresistable! Her love scenes with that other woman were done so very well, I wanted more more more! Of course, the tragic ending was expected, but it only added to what is an excellent telling of Gia's rise & fall. I just hope Angelina Jolie's career doesn't mirror Gia's, as she is just TOO HOT! I want her BAD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Actress in Bloom","review":"A perfect opportunity for a young Ms.Jolie to show her then acting ability to everyone with an intence role of living life in the fast lane based on a true story of a model called Gia.

Her dreadful \\"Life or Something Like It\\" is godawful. As an antidote, \\"Gia\\" shows Jolie's acting ability, and is a gritty, sensual and brilliantly tragic movie. Jolie plays Gia, based on a real model. If you don't like \\"She dies, the end,\\" films, this will be way too sad. If you like looking at lives that are way weirder than yours, this is a great movie. In any case, in this movie you can't take your eyes off Jolie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of the movie Gia","review":"Angelina Jolie does an excellent acting job in Gia.

Are there worse examples out there?... of course but not many (watch 'Titus' with Anthony Hopkins & Jessica Lange for that distinction)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true story","review":"The best film yet, Angelina jolie really shows the story of the model Gia Marie Carangi.

She was absolutely fabulous in this movie and her supporting cast was just as amazing! this movie captures you with the beauty of the lead actress, but holds you with the wonderful telling of Gia's rise and fall from grace. the film makers were not afraid to show the graphic side of a dying aids patient, which shows viewers that aids can even claim a strong beautiful supermodel, such as Gia. i would recommend this movie to anyone who claims to be a movie lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"gia dvd","review":"fast delivery .great price. this is a great movie. jolies breakout film and it is based on a true story. highly recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"No problem with playing","review":"There was no problem when playing this film on my DVD player, even though I did encounter playing problems with two other films ordered at the same time(Hombre, Quest for fire, see their rating).Best rgds, Jozsef Szucs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Hollywood nonsense","review":"There was a real Gia from a real neighborhood - NE Phila. and a real time. No one from my neighborhood even dreamed of a sudden rise to fame but she caught a break and became very famous and wealthy at a young age. Before she was mature and wise enough to handle it. This movie makes ZERO effort at capturing the real person or in capturing the time, place and people where the story is set. It takes the tabloid headlines, sensationalizes them for its own lurid purposes and is praised as great entertainment. If they want to make a fictional story, don't say that it is based on a real person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgetable GIA","review":"An unforgetable film! Personally, I didn't know Gia was an actual person until reading of the editorial reviews. I completely fell in love with the character, wishing I was able to jump through the screen and help her anyway possible. I experienced this movie six to seven months ago while on a business trip and still remember the emotion Angelina Jolie created with this character. I have only had the opportunity to see Angelina in her role as Gia, however, have kept an eye out for newer movies with her in them. Finally, I saw a preview of a different movie with her playing a role and now I am tryin to learn who this amazing actress is. If you see only one movie in the near future, I urge you to feel this movie. You will not only being watching the movie you will experience every bit of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"File This One With the Depresso Movies","review":"This is an excellent film. Well acted, well thought-out. It's steamy in some places, emotionally gripping in others. There's a lot being said here, and none of it is terribly uplifting, especially since it's based in a true story. This movie will leave you thoughtful, maybe even introspective, but most of all you'll just be depressed.

It's a simple movie with a sad ending, I give it 4 stars for the great work by Angelia Golie the staring chachter.

It's, to me, a pretty unique album - Ben's voice was new & I wasn't sure if I liked it - but it grew on me. Styrophoam Plates - wow - so powerful - reminded me of a good friend's upbringing.

I am a fan of DFCF and i loved their other albums WE HAVE THE FACTS, PLANS, etc..... but honestly this album did not click with me. i tried listing to the songs again to see if i would probably grow accustome to it, but no that didnt work. Sure this album has its moments, but trust me when i say your not missing out on anything.

The melodic pop mixed with deeply honest lyrics are just what the music world needs more of. This album is probably the purest of their albums which shows a growth and a band that should get some applause. people seem to compare them to everyone from \\"Iron and Wine\\" to \\"Smoke Ring Days\\" to \\"Neutral Milk Hotel\\", but to me they sound like only themselves.

It's so bad. I actually looked up Monet on line and read a few of her essays and they were okay, so I suspect she was on a time crunch without a strong editor. For content, I'd rate around 3 stars... that is, if you can set aside that creepy feeling that she doesn't quite understand she was an escort. As an example, while she has a point that women don't always let their intelligence be part of what makes them sexy (as I'm sure many of us have seen our female friends dumb themselves down in front of certain men), Monet misses an opportunity to observe that men have reason to flatter her. What is that cliché -- beautiful women want to be told they're smart and smart women want to be told they're beautiful? ...She also glosses over how men are not going to act the same towards an escort as they are around women they see every day.

I also found that she is not very straight to the point. On one of the chapters I read, she talks, talks, talks and never got the any useful info. I kept on expecting that she would expose one of her \\"secrets,\\" and instead she was bragging about the millionaires she met in her career. I think she can rewrite it and make it a better version of it, by going straight to the point of what she wants to say, because her experience is valid.

A badly composed story of a 21st century female who \\"falls\\" through time into the 1800's, instantly fits into a well-to-do family, wears the clothes of the time period with lust and falls madly in love with a family member inside of 20 minutes. Horrible - story, plot, characters - everything. Ms. Cooney, if not already in high school, needs to go back to class to learn how to write before she perpetrates any more of her crimes on readers.

The best song they do is 53rd & 3rd, with some other guy singing it. It does have a moment, when they are in a bus in south america, and they're being chased by a horde of screaming fans.

The score and the music of the movie blended very well to set the mood and the atmosphere being love is in the air. It was also the movie where I was introduced to Cameron Diaz. I think what made the movie worked for the audience is the fact that the plot line is too common that almost everybody can relate to. And top to that, a great ending that I think worked best for the movie.This movie has a huge repeat value. You would fall for it over and over again.

Of course we don't need to say everything in a movie, but just from my impression of THIS man in THIS movie, I don't feel that he has more charm than any other man on this planet. While I feel George really has some charisma: warm heart to friend, witty, active when necessary and mature, good looking. Bu Michael seems a very self-center guy. When his own career was touched, he was irritated, and wanted to break up with Kimmy. He has only himself in this movie, and the marriage is like his patronage to the girl loves him.

The movie is just vapid Hollywood nonsense. If you want a great Hollywood romance, try \\"The Awful Truth\\" or \\"It Happened One Night\\".

I found nothing emjoyable in this film about a reprehensible, selfish protagonist derailing someone else's wedding plans -- the reason is so unclear, too, as there is zero chemistry between her and well, anyone and everyone in this film. Put someone else in the lead role of this film, and it would have been widely panned. I honestly have no idea why anyone would like this movie, I had to come and read some reviews to try to understand. Best I can come up with is that those who saw it in the theater and hated their ex-boyfriends (who had new Girlfriends) wanted to engage in fantasy revenge.

Jules makes numerous of devious attempts to win Michael back.

The only thing that may save this season from utter trash is Julian McMahon who plays Cole, but is soon killed off to better his career. Once that happens, the show sinks deeper with its stupid storylines and repeated events. Seriously, the following seasons become worse and worse, which is why the show is going off the air, but it all starts here. This show was in its supreme during the first three to four seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmed: A new kind of Season","review":"Charmed Season 5 gets a lot of mixed reviews. I am a die-hard Charmed fan so I try to look at the best things. I feel that as much as I loved Cole by this point I was sick of him, I wanted Cole and Phoebe to live happily ever after...but then again he was evil. Paige becomes more powerful and Piper and Leo final get their child from the future...although it is a boy. I didn't like a lot of the baby episodes I felt they could have done with better story lines but I loved the arrival of Wyatt and of course Victor marrying a demon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best yet","review":"Even though season 5 has not been released. I have seen all the episodes on tv. To me these are some of the best ones. My favorite is Cathouse where Paige gets to see several memories that she missed from the earlier shows. I can't wait for this season to be released and I agree that they should release the eposided at the same time."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],R={key:0},N={key:1};function H(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(i(!0),o(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(i(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),o("span",N,"Loading...")):(i(),o("span",R,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(x,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-b8d1fc9e"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/58.md","filePath":"glossary/58.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/58.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(i(),o("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
