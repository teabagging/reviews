I use it on my Canon 5D and on my Canon 40D, if I set my shots correctly, I have some of the most unusual, attractive and impressive shots in my Shot Library.The key to success with this lens is to set the shot correctly. I have found it takes more planning, a steadier hand (or Tripod/Monopod), than even my 100-400MM F/4-5.6L. With a telephoto lens, your area of focus is less a challenge than the 180 Degree worth of study when dealing with this lens.Don't get me wrong, this lens is FUN!! I've never enjoyed landscapes, portraits, artistic shots more than I have when I am using my 15MM Fish.

The problem is that the reservoir for the cold water is made of soft plastic and it makes the Poland Springs water that I pay dearly for taste like plastic. My previous rented water cooler had a stainless steel reservoir which did not affect the taste of the water. There is a stainless steel reservoir for the hot water, so it isn't as badly affected.

A classic western with Steve Forrest at his best and Barbara Eden in a role you can't easily forget. Too many great actors to mention here. This movie, which I do hope will be on DVD, is not shown enough on t.v. movie networks and i believe has never received the recognition it so deserves.

Whether it can be justifiably classified as jazz or not, \\"Carryin' On\\" is a somewhat decent example of this period, though maybe not the best place to start. Green's soloing is in fine form here, especially on the two slower numbers, \\"Hurt So Bad,\\" and \\"Cease the Bombing.\\" However, Green's own composition, \\"Upshot\\" is sloppily executed and treads on the same tired groove for nearly ten minutes.

It took an exceptional player to carry a band on a Fender Rhodes, & Clarence Palmer isn't brimming over with ideas. The sound of the piano is already too close to vibes. The song selection isn't particularly inspired; nice that they gave the James Brown number a try. The great Neil Creque contributes a pretty tune & sweet playing on \\"Cease The Bombing,\\" but what that title has to do with the get-ready-to-make-out mood of the song can only be explained by assuming Neil had a very strong opinion about the Vietnam War. \\"Carryin' On\\" is like the middle set in a night's work; everyone's keeping something in reserve for the hipper late crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good debut from her actic career to singing","review":"This album of ballad music is very good and just about all of her songs are very romantic about the relationships of young people.

To date we have had absolutely no problems with it and have found it to be a very reliable. It has a repeat and random play option, so we can leave the CD player on for a couple of hours while they fall asleep. We are planning to buy another one for our room. Pros: Very good overall.

Ridiculous.Also, I did have a chance to listen to a song on it; the sound quality was not so great, but I figured hey, its an alarm clock, I'm not planning on using it to listen to music much on it, thats what my stereo is for.

I liked the curved sleek shape of this unit (unlike so many I looked at) and that it's hard to accidentally reset the time in your sleep. :-) The built in buzzer alarm was a pretty good sound, insistent while pleasant...mornings are hard enough!I looked forward to testing the speaker quality with one of my own CDs instead of relying on the store's radio reception, though the speakers sounded alright in the store. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed to get the unit home and discover that the CD Player did not work, straight out of the box.

I bought it to replace a very old Emerson that I found at work in the trash (the alarm on the old one didn't work). Side by side, the old one, which doesn't have an fm radio \\"tail\\", has a clear sound, while the new one, no matter how I move the antennae, gets nothing but poor quality static. A real disappointment. You'd think they would have perfected the technology by now. This one's going back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Display Too Bright and 2nd Alarm not useful","review":"My first complaints was that the display is way too bright. Not bright enough to read a book by, but it's darn close. I'm finding that to be the case with most clocks with green displays.The second issue is that, while this has a second alarm time feature, you do not have the option of having one wake up time for CD and one wakeup time for the buzzer. It's either both buzzer or both CD. I like to wake up to a relaxing CD, then have the buzzer kick in if I still oversleep.The fact that it only plays the first track is bearable for me, as I just burn a Wake Up Mix onto a CD (and this reads CD-Rs). Other than those two complaints, the unit worked fine for the week I kept it. I just could get to sleep with a night-light 6 inches from my nose and blocking the display sort of defeats the purpose of having a CD Alarm CLOCK."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a weird machine","review":"If you want to relax yourself to sleep with a cd and wake up to both a buzz and a radio (on two separate alarms) DO NOT get this machine.

She learned at 20 months how to get it to play. Wish I'd payed more money for a better one. I'm looking for one for the new baby's room and it won't be this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Are Deceiving","review":"We picked this cd clock radio for our nightstand in order to downsize from our current one. It was the perfect size, but unfortunately this is where the positives end. I don't like that it doesn't have an automatic shut off or sleep timer (power stays on all night if you go to sleep to cd), the alarm reset and other buttons are hard to engage, and most dissappointing is the sound quality.

We're returning this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Built-in self obsolessence (apologies if that's misspelled.)","review":"Well, pretty much what everyone else said about this unit has happened to me: the CD player stopped working after about six months, it buzzes whenever someone with a cell phone is nearby (even when my cordless phone is next to it!) and now *none* of the buttons works at all, rendering it a useless hunk of metal and plastic. For a while, I actually resorted to plugging it in at midnight so at least I'd have a clock even if it flashed all the time. Horrendous disappointment.

I still reread it about twice a year, my copies are getting rather ratty, and while I've tossed or passed on a lot of manga I acquired in my teens this series still gets packed very carefully for every move, and is one of the first things I unpack.Not for everyone, if you can check it out at the Library first.

I certainly didn't know a lot about polygamy prior to this book. It made for gripping reading. How the women were isolated and oppressed. Their suffering was physical, emotional and mental which made for thought provoking reading.The mystery component of the book was pretty good as well - I like PI Lena Jones she is a strong and get vulnerable character.

I was looking forward to sharing this series with my daughters but wind up trying to explain what was missing and why it might have been funny. This is nothing short of criminal and whoever did this at Paramount deserves to be fired. I have never NEVER seen anything like the utter disregard for anything in the arts. It's not just the music. There are definitely other cuts throughout the series. Like I'm pretty sure they cut the line from \\"I Gotta Be Me\\" in Season 3 where Oscar (in role reversal as felix) during the wine tasting tells the dinner guests to 'roll it around in your mouth until it tastes like shoe polish. 'What's next, Paramount? Going to strip the Nino Rota score from the Godfather?? You owe fans an apology and you also owe them new uncut DVDs that we paid good money for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll stick with my local channel","review":"This DVD is a rip-off. Seasons 3, 4, and 5 of the Odd Couple were butchered by Paramount like there's no tomorrow. The musical cuts are ridiculous. At times there is so much cut that the episodes lose some of their best comedic elements. Seriously Paramount, is this the best you can do?The Odd Couple no longer airs on TV nationwide but it does air locally in my area. I'll watch it in syndication and boycott the DVDs.

The Reader Reviews are the Real Mystery","review":"This is one of the poorest books I've ever read: poorly written, poorly plotted, even poorly printed (very shabby job). I was AMAZED at the reviews on this site, so, in the spirit of a mystery, a better one than the author devised in his embarrasing, amateurish book, I did some sleuthing. I looked up the reviews of his other books. Funny thing: Lady named Harriet Klauser LOVED em all! Friend of the author, Harriet? Then I noted all the other good reviews came from the San Fernando Valley. More friends? Seeing a pattern here folks? As for the book itself, the dialogue is pathetically [bad]. When it tries to sparkle, it makes your toes curl. The plot is beyond implausible, to say nothing of boring. And the exploitation of a dead genius, in this dweeby, schoolboy mystery schlock, is, finally, distasteful. If you love the Beatles, or John Lennon, or good books, or mysteries, or anything, BEWARE! You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close.","review":"Unhappily, this book is a mishmash of characters who are difficult to distinguish at times, and the confusion is madeconsiderably greater by the frequent shifting of decades inwhich the story developes.For me, it was punishment to even finish the book, and I simplycannot recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"The mixture of Yesterday and today was marvelous and I really felt as if I was Here, There and Everywhere. In My Life I have read many books (no, I don't want to be a Paperback Writer) and have enjoyed many sets of characters.

Levinson Does It Again!","review":"I just lost a night's sleep because I couldn't put down \\"The John Lennon Affair\\" by Robert S. Levinson. Levinson evokes the world of \\"the biz\\" when Rock and Roll wasn't canned and stars were more than hype. For those of us who were there, it's a vivid flashback to scary times. For those who weren't, it's an exciting ride. But the real flip comes when the past impinges on the present. Levinison's characters Neil and Stevie are drawn into a thrill ride of murder and intrigue at a Lennon memorial festival in the desert. Good plotting, colorful characters and some thoughts to chew on. Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Lennon would spit on this","review":"Stupidly, I judged a book by its cover. During a recent jaunt to [a local bookstore], I saw this book and the words \\"John Lennon\\" shining like a beacon in the sea of paperbacks. \\"Why, this must be good. No one would dare write a bad book with the words 'John Lennon' in the title,\\" I thought to myself.I was wrong. After several failed attempts to finish this monstrosity, I finally tossed it into the fireplace, where I will relish the opportunity to burn it when winter commences.The writing is stilted, the descriptions cliche at best, and the author needs a thorough lesson in writing a complete sentence. That being said, I read almost halfway through the book without noting even an iota of plot or action. I winced during every mention of John Lennon and the tacky attempts to mimic his accent and humor. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece.Of.Garbage.","review":"I really tried to like this book. Really, I did. It was impossible. I got about 100 pages in before I gave up. This is very poorly written and researched. When I ran into \\"should of\\" when it was supposed to be \\"should have\\", I had a sinking feeling. I flipped ahead in the book and found Brian May mentioned as Queen's keyboard player. Brian May is Queen's lead guitarist, if anyone was Queen's \\"keyboard player\\", it was Freddie Mercury. I am returning this book to the friend whom I borrowed it from.Beware of this time-waster, folks.

There is no explanation as to what happens to \\"The Children\\". The plot is way too simple. The murder scenes lack the gore and shock factor, taking the enjoyment out of this horror. Is it a slasher film? No. Is it a psychological horror? No. What the heck is it? Don't waste your time or money on this one. Oh, and the reason I gave it two stars as opposed to one is that there is one scene in the tent that involves a doll - I don't want to give it away but that scene alone earned this stupid movie an extra star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effectively filmed and acted with excellent storyline","review":"I enjoyed this film mainly because of the believable storyline and realistic acting.

But, right off it was very confusing. The movie was slow to take off like waiting in traffic on the runway at the airport. Then when it did, you were like huh? What caused this? The scenes which could of been better were quick cuts which you really didn't see much. Don't watse your money it will be on TV soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"KIDS DO THE DARNDEST THING","review":"A Christmas gathering goes horribly awry in this chiller. Some kind of virus affects foue darling youngsters who turn murderously aggressive. Starting out sinisterly slow, the movie builds as the youngsters start bumping off the adults.

The hero was basically an abused male the heroin was a complete schrew. She was mean from the start for no reason other then her own attraction. He never treats her wrong and she is always snapping at him! Then to make it worse she starts meddling in others affairs and decides that he is the reason for her sisters possible failed engagement. So she drugs him and then basically rapes him and the leaves him high and dry handcuffed to bed.On top of rolling your eyes at the excessive drama that has no place the story itself is poorly written. I wished in the end that the hero threw the heroin in jail and ran off with someone better after leaving her to rote.I am pretty sure this is the worst story I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babyshower gift","review":"I have not seen any babies playing with this toy so I can't review it in that capacity but what I can say is that the person I bought this for thought this was a very cute toy for her baby. The only drawback is that the birds have eyes that can come off. Babies really like the crinkly squishy shapes, and it would have been better if the birds didn't have eyes that can come off and become choking hazards. It says its for babies 8 months and above probably because of the eyes. Of course any babies younger wouldn't know how to use the shape sorter but they would probably enjoy feeling the birds and squishing them and chewing on them. Without the eyes I think this toy would be for a broader age range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack luster as a shap sorter","review":"Ok. At first I thought this toy was great. But really... it isn't.As far as a shape sorter goes... this is a pretty poor example. The birds are over stuffed and do not fit into their respective holes. In addition, if one DOES manage to a get a bird in to the house through it's hole, there isn't really enough room for all of the birds unless the house is busting at it's seems.The birds are cute, the house is cute, but it just doesn't live up to it's claim of being a shape sorter. My ten month old never plays with this toy and shows zero interest in it. Not even just to play with the birds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-educational and uninspired","review":"I love all things Melissa and Doug, however, this toy was disappointing to me.Each bird fits in and out of each whole, and the shapes are quite hard to distinguish so from the educational perspective under which it was purchased it is of little use.I think the wooden sorters are much better, but in the meantime this is spening a lot of time at the back of the toy box :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality!","review":"Bought these based on a recommendation from a friend.

It was probably the 6th or 7th Cather novel I read, so I had several to compare it to. The characters are wonderfully developed, as is the story. I don't even know how much more I need to say but that you should read it and I think you'll find it's her best.

The first use demonstrated a slow and uneven play speed. After about 10 minutes, the turntable ground to a halt. We can hear the motor straining, but nothing is happening. The company forces the customer to pay shipping, even when the product is under warranty. Amazon needs to stop using this supplier. The Crosley company is well below their standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"We bought one and it came with a damged exterior, so we returned it. Its box was open at one end as well. Amazon sent a replacement and it arrived with a missing foot, so it wobbles and can not be used to play records. It also had veneer missing in two places; chunks of it were missing to expose bare wood. Both looked used, so maybe it was not Crosley's fault, but instead Amazon's for passing off used items as new ones.

This one is not in that category. Mastering C#, Mastering VB.NET and Mastering Cool Fusion 5.0 are all very good books. This author seems like a real C#/ASP.NET Guru but has no ability to convey that knowledge in a clear concise way. It seems to me like everything is just dumped on the pages instead of being built up step by step. This book might be good if you are already very good at ASP.NET and want to gleam some more insight into some of the deeper workings of ASP.NET, but definitely NOT as a beginner/intermediate book.

A few of the ballads are nice but there are no songs with the quality and staying power of a \\"One More Night\\" or a \\"Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away\\".

It's only okay, and it seems like a long lullabye. Not crazy about the production.....Phil's voice seemed buried by all the synthetic music. I have to say that my favorite song on there is one that Phil didn't even write...\\"Can't Stop Loving You\\". I bought a Norah Jones CD at the same time and after having listened to both, I quickly put \\"Testify\\" aside and enjoyed my Norah Jones CD. I've tried to let \\"Testify\\" grow on me, but it just isn't happening. Too bad, too, because I really wanted to love this CD. Oh well. Maybe his next effort will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of purchase for two of the songs","review":"I really like \\"Come with me\\" that is inspired by his young son. As he said during his Farewell Tour concert in Cleveland, \\"he likes it\\". I like it too. It has a bit of a lullaby sound to it. As a new parent, I really like the song and can relate to it. I also really enjoyed \\"Can't stop loving you\\" which is on the album and he performed in concert. It's a song that's easy to enjoy. At first listen to the Amazon sound bites, the other songs didn't really strike a chord with me as much as these two but with any album, two or three songs that I really enjoy make it worth a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"a collection of heart, soul and innocence","review":"phil sings to his baby in this album, says exactly what we feel about our children since we cant always figure out how too say it. every song is his way for us all to testify our love for the ones we love. for me they know who they are... the best songs on this album are the heartbreaking \\"its not too late\\", \\"the beautiful \\"testify\\" the fun and up beat \\"wake up call\\", the sweet and simple \\"you touch my heart\\" the lullabye \\"come with me\\" and ofcourse the sensational \\"can't stop loving you\\". of course the farewell tour, which brought lot of these songs to life was the freakin best and worth the buy, but till that comes out, get this and you wont be sorry. when you can;t find a way to tell you special little one how much you love them, let phil say it for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful album...","review":"This new release by the extraordinary artist Phil Collins is a joy. It is more subdued and toned down than previous efforts...this one is very quiet and mellow, perfect for a rainy day or drive down the open road.

Great Voice, his drumming is excellent, his concert performances are a joy to watch. But the last great album in my opinion was \\"but seriously\\". Since then, everything released solo (with the exception of the big band release) was a disappointment. The best description of this new album is the comment of another reviewer: elevator music.If you want to buy Phil Collins get the Live performance DVD in Paris. Just great."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and uninspired","review":"The first song 'wake up call' is great. Memorable synth lines, excellent backing vocals. But once you get onto track 2, the chorus is so boring and sounds like a melody that has been churned out hundreds of times before. The lyrics are generally execrable and all the songs are all so similar, I can remember none of them. Mid tempo balladry, with a couple of slightly faster ones. 'You touch my heart' has some nice nylon guitar parts and some nice synths. So that makes the opening and last tracks that should have been released as a single. Ditch most of the rest. Boring and repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and mellow","review":"Just a kick back and relax album. All of the songs could be on the \\"easy listening\\" radio station.

I wasn't too thrilled with \\"Dance\\" but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. But disppointment was all that awaited me.As mentioned by other reviewers, the music is generic, contains very little lyrical \\"grit\\" and is overly synthesized. One of the biggest reasons I used to enjoy PC's music was for the sheer power in his drumming. The man used to play \\"with his heart on his sleeve\\" but it seems that Phil thinks that \\"the old days are gone, and they're better left alone.\\"I know we all mellow-out a bit as we get older, but this is ridiculous. The only reason I'm not throwing this CD away is because I paid good money for it. If you grew-up listening to Phil Collins through the late 70's (in Genesis) and early 80's (when he went solo), you'll probably want to bypass this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is not worth your time","review":"I do not own this album but i listened to all of the tracks. The only good song on here is \\"can't stop loving you\\" The song is very upbeat, has a catchy tune and is one of those songs you won't mind playing over and over again. However the other songs on this album are very slow, So slow that it would make you fall asleep to it. It's kind of like Elevator music. Not only that, it's annoying. If you really like the hit \\"can't stop loving you\\" i suggest you download the mp3. Do not buy this album it is a waste of money and you will most definitely be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Faceless\\" music","review":"Contrary to Phil's first solo debut \\"Face Value\\", \\"Testify\\" is completely \\"Faceless\\" music! Too sweet, very boring and monotone.Where is unique sound of Genesis, ecstasy and rhythm of the songs? I think since Phil officially left the Genesis, each album he produced, shows his slow degeneration, and the \\"Testify\\" is \\"testified that\\"! This CD is waste of the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't turn back the years.....","review":"Oh dear, oh dear.....forget about Billy....Mr. Collins himself has lost his number. I'm so sorry to admit that PC's latest effort is an absolute disappointment. Testify is totally.....utterly.....seriously.....disappointing. No winners at all in this album.....not even the title track. Believe me, I was his greatest fan. I was even rooting for this to be his greatest album since But Seriously and Both Sides. For all those die-hard fans out there, I understand your eagerness to buy this CD, but let me warn you about the disappointment you will most likely experience once you pop in this CD. If you dislike Dance into the Light, then don't even bother buying this CD because it's much worse.It can be very devestating to hear such a glorious voice singing mediocre to terrible songs that he composed. Mind you, I listened to the CD several times for the songs to grow within me......but I suddenly realized that I am not listening to Phil Collins.I have nothing else to testify."},{"rating":"1","title":"when will it end!","review":"whatever happen to perhaps tthe best rock drummer out there?what happen to the guy who once played with robert plant?what happen to the great rock/jazz fusion of Brand X?i mean is this guy that old that he has to sing like he's in a wheel chair?is he so old that he has forgotten where his cymbals are?what happen to the guy who produced a pounding song for frida called 'i know theres something going on'?what happen to...ah forget it! i give up! all i can say is pathetic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Collins' descent into utter blandness is nearly complete","review":"I really wish I had spent my money on something else and not this CD. (Those who think it's impossible for Phil to make bad music should probably stop reading at this point.) I used to really enjoy and appreciate his songs, especially back in the late '70s and early '80s with Genesis, and his first couple of solo albums. I remember when a new Phil Collins Cd was a cause for excitement. Now every song is full of light and fluffy synthesizers, and the melodies are so forgettable. They have no more staying power than a breeze through the trees in my back yard. There's really no point in talking about individual songs -- if you think of his songs for children's animated films, this album is like that only worse. Listening to this CD was a very similar experience to listening to elevator music for an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to Phil in Advance","review":"C'mon...does anyone remember when Phil used to be a drummer? What happened??? Rather than pick this apart song by song, let's just say he needs to spend less time in the studio. These songs are good - there is just too much electronic stuff on them - the melodies just get buried.Phil - if you read this... you can call me. I will help in any way I can. My first recommendation is to throw out every drum machine you own. My second is to bring back musicians to play the other instruments - HAVE FUN AT YOUR CRAFT. This cd sounds like you are not having a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not accept mediocrity","review":"Here's another mediocre CD by Phil Collins. I was hoping he would challenge himself and create interesting music again but it sounds like a continuation of the same mundane, mid-life crisis he's been having for the last ten years.The divide between former bandmate Peter Gabriel is greater than ever. Whereas Peter's excellent album 'Up' (released the same year) is an exploration of sonic landscapes and psychological, personal and cultural phenomena using a multitude of disparate musicians from around the globe, Phil Collins' music is self-centered but not self-revealing.In the end, it turns out that Phil Collins couldn't maintain the creativity exhibited on Face Value and Hello, I'm Must Be Going! His music will be forgotten like much of the other mediocre music of the '80s and '90s.[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is bad music!","review":"this cd is what is wrong with music today. pure garbage. just give up you out of touch used-to-be. get some nerve and start making music again, remember your supposed to be an artist, not a sellout. the only person more out of town in the music world today is michael jackson. moto"},{"rating":"1","title":"another piece of garbage!","review":"Phil Collins has not released anything interesting since \\"But Seriously\\". His songs sound more and more like easy listening...with every cd he puts out. He has always been one of the best drummers and vocalists in rock, but he is steadily going downhill as far as creativity is concerned and this is sleepy time music.

The world really needs a book like this. The concept of incorporating css and graphic design as one creature is really pertinant.However, the book was watered down and poorly organized. It takes designs from the website and discusses parts of them. I found this piecemeal approach really difficult to understand. A little code here, a little design there but never enough to provide a solid context.It also tried to cover too much ground, and as a result it didn't go into enough depth to be of any use.This was a pretty expensive book (at the book store it was about $40), and I found it almost a complete waste of money.

I don't think there was ever an example that left that question unanswered. If it wasn't explicit, there was always enough information and discussion to be able to figure it out.

But for all that they exemplify craft, they are all also rather bland.Missing from this book are the designs that are beautiful. The most egregious omission is Mozart, which is one of the most visually arresting designs I have ever seen on the whole of the Internet, to say nothing of this site.Other overlooked beautiful designs are Odyssey, Dark Rose, Invitation, C Note, Egyptian Dawn and Mediterranean.

I was very excited to hear that a book concerning the web site was going to be released. This excitement was quickly stifled upon reading the books...because, frankly, the book is horrible. The discussion of how to actually create such beautiful designs using advanced CSS techniques (and hacks) is pretty much non-existent from the book. Instead, the book focuses on general design principles...principles covered in MANY other books. This fact, essentially makes this book worthless. In the end, it has VERY LITTLE to do with CSS design, making the title deceiving and the book as a whole, quite disappointing.My recommendation: (...) If you want a book on web site design principles, there are much better titles out there as well.Too bad though...this *could* have been a GREAT book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flavor the creamer, not the coffee","review":"I share a coffee service with three other people in the shop, as well as an occasional visitor. None of them want flavored coffee - most take it black. I had a hard enough time getting French Roast accepted. This means that if I want to modify the flavor, I have to do it by sweetener or creamer. Individual packets of Sugar In The Raw have proven to be a good idea. So has this product - International Delight French Vanilla - in individual packets. This version of I/D is specially pasteurized, so refrigeration is not needed. Unlike the bottled version of I/D, these packets will stay wholesome much longer - long enough that I need to buy more.

The wide stiff blade holds up best in our business of garage door installations. Fat Max out lasts the imports 4 to 1. When dropped the case won't break. Though it's no match for a circular saw it is the best tape I have found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just A Paperweight","review":"Bought this to try since I usually work alone and could often use a little extra \\"reach\\" on my tape. While this one does provide a little more than my old Stanley Powerlocks, that feature is worthless because of all the effort required to get the lock to engage. By the time I get it locked I've shaken the tape so much that I might as well have been carrying a little pocket tape. I had hoped that after using it awhile that the lock would \\"break in\\" and become usable, but just the opposite happend - adding a little dirt made it almost impossible to lock at all. Also noticed that because of the large arc in the blade that the end tab needs to be longer; it doesn't want to stay hooked as well as my other tapes. Add in the overall bulk of the case and this is possibly the worst tape I've ever owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade lock is a deal breaker","review":"The horizontal stand-out is impressive but the blade lock that requires two hands to engage is a deal breaker. Also due to the wide blade the tape will not extend far when the numbered side is facing you with out the tape flopping to the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hands to lock it open","review":"Must be just mine as I haven't see another review that mentions this. The thumb locking button is a real pain to push to get the tape measure to lock in place. I have a tough time doing it with 1 thumb.I never thought of this before, maybe my expectation for this well known tape measure had my hopes up, but I'd love it if this tape measure didn't buckle when holding it sideways. You can only read the tape if you are holding it below head level. Sometimes you have to take a reading overhead and need to hold the tape sideways so you can read it. Does anyone make a tape measure that is sturdy somewhat when it's being used sideways?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad purchase","review":"I'm normally a big Stanley fan. But, this tape got one attempted use by me and I ordered a different one the next day. The lock button either does not work or it is the first time I have been unable to make one work. Either way, obviously not for me. The retracting of the tape is sticky and took two hands to reel in. Very disappointed. May have been simply a lemon on its own, but it is the one I got and for which I am sharing this review, just in case there might be a second lemon of this model out there. Certainly would not recommend ordering this on line. Find one you can try working in person before spending the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"16 ' fat max","review":"Ths is my favorite tape to date. I like the small case. It fits my hand real nice.

In the last couple years trying to make life easier while still doing a lot of the work I have let others strap on the tool bags and have just put the tape on my pants pocket.I recomend folks take the pocket clip off and grind the inside so it doesn't cut the threads on your pants pocket. I noticed I've got several pair of expensive work pants and the pocket is just shreaded and many of them have about an inch of pocket missing now.It's like a razor blade on the inside of the pocket clip and a single day of use will completly shread your pants pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"stanley 40 foot tape","review":"excellent tape. this tape is very durable and very accurate. the 40 foot tape with the bladearmor coating is one of the outstanding features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect rough framers tape","review":"They're the only tape that I've used in the past few years.

At only 2 months old the blade wont retract all the way in any more and started to act up soon after it was first put into use. The blade lock is difficult to work. It wont fit into a tape holster without forcing it and then it gets stuck and grabs the tape hook and/or the blade lock. I'm also hearing the same things from others in my line of work. \\"Stanley. What happened to the old PowerLock tape? I can't find them anymore, and that's a tape that was worth the money!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic, Plastic, Plastic","review":"I own a couple Stanley measures and now that I've had this one for a couple months I can say with some confidence that even though the extra width of the tape allows you to extend the tape further than a narrower tape, the other drawbacks exceed this benefit.So, the cons:1) the end of the tape is not firmly riveted to the tape, so you won't get accuracy to the 1/16, probably not to the 1/8th hooking or pushing the end to anything. You would have to start at 1\\" and go back from there.2) The body is plastic. I don't drop stuff unintentionally often. But sometimes my hands are full and I need to drop something a foot or two. With the metal case stanleys, it's never a problem. This tape, as other reviewers have said, is not strong enough to take much typical construction wear and tear. The case, after a couple months, is already a little loose, and that's just from frequent home use.So, all in all, not a real good buy for the frequent tape user, sorry to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a great tape measure.

The problem is that the tape is so ridgid (which is great if your measuring across a room) that it gets nicks in the side of it instead of flexing then when the edge of the tape hits anything the tape starts to rip and after a few more uses the tape breaks. After dropping $25 bucks a tape every couple of months i just can't afford these tapes anymore. They are nice but you have to baby them, even so I still go through them way too fast. I use my tape hundreds of times a day and this one just doesn't stand up to the punishment. The locking mechanisim doesn't work well either, you have to push much harder than most tapes to lock the tape in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I use this tape on a daily basis for measuring houses for insulation. The spring is strong enough to put the full 40' of tape back in without any problems. The standout of approx. 12 feet helps a lot when you want to \\"grab\\" the edge of a board that is out of reach. The blade coating holds up very well. I only wish there was some type of mechanism that would \\"clean\\" the tape as it goes back into the body. Moisture and very small debris can be a problem if it retracts back through dirt or moisture. Overall this is a great tape measure. I next one will be the same.Revision: After using this 4 months the tape is broken in several places and the end finally broke off at the 2\\" mark. I am going to attempt contact with Stanley to see if there is something they can do since this tape measure broke so quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Lock","review":"I like everything about this tape except for the poorly designed lock. The lock works fine if you're just setting the tape on a flat board, but if you need to hang it over the edge of your work piece, the lock automatically releases and the tape falls to the floor. That's a big pain especially when you're on a wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works so far","review":"Was familiar with similar item so purchased this one.

Its creation was solely for marketing purposes, and had nothing to do with improving existing tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be improved","review":"I bought this tape awhile back, I have been a Stanley tape using for years, I find that the hook on the end does not grip properly, I think that it is because the wide blade has a deeper arch in it and the hook needs to be a little longer. It pops off alot which is a real hassle.

I measured it with another tape (irony) at 3 1/4\\" but wondered why there wasn't an indication on the housing. Finally, with my arm's-length near eyesight I found a molded legend that's almost covered by the belt clip. Pisspoor product design, but it's a Stanley tradition. Even with reading glasses its hard to read the reflective chrome plated numerals on earlier Stanley tapes I've owned.

However, Stanley does not make replacement blades for it. My Fat Max is a little less than a year old and has developed a hole at about the 11 foot point. Because no replacement blades are available, the cost for replacing it with a new one is too high.

Yes, it is the tape to buy for hooking the far end of a board and it will win your tape races, but it is a little bulky and awkward. That's not necessarily a bad thing. I've yet to see a Stanley tape in the recycle bin - you CAN'T hurt them. The best free advise is; if your a framer, they're ideal (in fact a must), if your a cabinetmaker, maybe not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not cracked up to be what it claims to be","review":"I have bought the FAT MAX when they first came out, they claim 11' stand out and I never made it past 10 feet.

And for [the price] I would expect more from the product. I have bought a new tape called WIDE BOY from SNS Tapes, now this one takes a fall from 20 feet and they hit 10'6\\" to 11' everytime. And that is not on the 35 degree angle needed to get the FAT MAX to hit 10Feet. One other thing that makes it better is the WIDE BOY fits in the tape hold on my tool belt. It is also [less expensive] and comes with a utility knife I give this one a five star!

Put them together and you get Anthony Burgess' novel _1985_.The first half is easily the more interesting of the two, as it clearly expresses Burgesses' views on other novels (specifically _1984_ and his own work, _A Clockwork Orange_), anarchy, good, evil, and society in general. The interviews with himself are wonderful- a brilliant new way to express an opinon while being sure that the only questions asked are the ones that you have a ready answer for.As for the second part, the continuation of _1984_, the very problem is that it is such a continuation. The first novel was so wonderful that it's hard to have the sequel live up to the legacy, and it necessarily pales in comparison. That's not to say that I haven't read it a couple times, but it still isn't among the celestial greats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak for Burgess","review":"The novel itself is pretty weak, especially for Burgess. He seems scared by the gulf oil money that was flowing into England in the 1970s, perhaps even a bit resentful. However, preceding the novel is an extended essay on imaginary fiction that includes Burgess' take on Orwell. This essay is worth reading. It is as insightful as the novel is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now it's an AH novel","review":"The thing that strikes me about this book is that it now reads as alternate history. Say Margaret Thatcher never goes into politics, and the Labour ascendency of the '70s is not cut short. Given the grimy, hopeless bitterness of many ostensibly socialist societies, the excesses depicted in this novel become more realistic. The resolution of these excesses (to the extent that they are resolved at all) is, alas, less convincing.Minor spoiler -the idea that the elected government would fall under the general mess could be found in almost any book. The idea thatthe King (Charles Tertius) would emerge as the _de jure_ head of state to get things moving again was pure brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"dead and unprobable","review":"i quite enjoyed burgess dissing of the faults and quirks of '1984'.the only fault with 1985 is that it tells a unprobable story in a totally un-living fashion. his misinterpretations of syndicalism and anarchism also disturbs me. a good idea, but poorly executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This is a hot hot hot CD.

Cons: 1) Very loud, but I don't mind using ear plugs 2) When it's locked in upright position, it's difficult to wheel it to another area in that position, since the back is too low and scrapes the carpet.Overall, considering the price, it's been a good machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess you get what you pay for...","review":"Pros: It's cheap and it seems to have good suctionCons: The power cord comes out of the cleaner at the bottom near the floor and is hard to keep from running over- extremely inconvenient.

The only thing that I can figure is that they were written by the author himself, or by friends and family.

While there is no actual town of Floralee on the map, I found clues that made me believe we were in Taos--Michael's Restaurant, Sage Bakery, etc. Mapson's strength in painting locales and developing characters is strong and convincing. She doesn't shy away from examining human imperfections, but she doesn't male-bash, either. Austin, the alcoholic vet Rose has a crush on, comes across as a complex, sympathetic character. So does Rose's father, Chance, but I have to say my favorite character was Shep Hallford, the ranch wrangler.

After listening to the CD, I didn't have any music stuck in my head like John Williams usually can make. There aren't any really exciting parts, and even if there were, they were the same as the Sorcerer's stone.Buy this CD if you want to collect all the Harry Potter soundtracks. But if you haven't heard the first one, buy that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Williams is great!","review":"John Williams has done a supurb job (with William Ross) for the music for this movie. There is a lot of music that's similar to the first movie, but that is to be expected. The theme \\"Fawkes the Phoenix\\" is beautiful and fits perfectly. This music should please anyone! John Williams has done it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great score","review":"John Williams does it again. Another brilliant score to accompany these wonderful movies. His musical depiction of Gilderoy Lockhart is priceless...so simple, yet very descriptive (he uses a very simple, snooty tune with strings and harpsichord). I can't say it's my favorite of the series, but nonetheless a great score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthusiastic and intriguing!","review":"It's a great soundtrack! John Williams managed yet again to recapture the magic of Harry Potter by this rousing and inspirational film score. I really liked Fawkes the Phoenix, in fact it was one of the best I've heard since the Jurassic Park theme. Most of music score is similar to Philospher's Stone but there are a few certain new scores bound to capture your ears like Spiders and the Flying Car. Also, the CD includes bonus CD-ROM and collectible covers (I got Harry! :-) All in all, a wonderful effort from Wiliams and no doubt it's definitely worth a buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great no matter how you look at it","review":"This soundtrack is beautiful and wonderful to listen to whether you've watched the movie or not. Every song has a mood of its own and will absolutely sweep you off your feet!This cd is a great addition to any soundtrack collection not only becuase of the brilliant John Williams but becuase of the essence of the pieces. Most songs can stand alone especially Fawkes the Phoenix. It's also fascinating to listen for the themes from the first movie that are sometimes not so subtlely incorporated into the music. The character themes are also very believable and worth listening to especially if you didn't pay too close attention to the movie.Another thing I've noticed about this soundtrack is that, unlike many others I own, this one is very easy to listen to all the way through without being bombarded with random battle themes and overdone effect songs. Really a great cd for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as Good... or Better!...","review":"I really enjoy the soundtrack from the first film, but I think that I have found something even better. I can listen over and over to this soundtrack and it never gets old. I have several favorite tracks that others are sure to enjoy. I remember #2 from the end credits, it enthralled me then as it does now. 3, 9, 11, 14, 19, .... I can't just name a few, they are all great.

I thought it was going to be even better. When I got it, I was very disappointed. It says in the booklet that they wanted the same Harry feeling but a little bit grown up and different. I think they should stick to the first one. It felt like I was listening to the same song over and over again. And none of it was very distinct to me, the only one would probally be the first song on the soundtrack.This almost made me scared to get the Two Towers soundtrack, because I was so disappointed by this one, but I was blown away by LOTR. It was even better than the first one. Whatever Howard Shore did, John Williams needs to follow in his footsteps! I only hope the third soundtack is better than the 2nd one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great soundtrack from John Williams","review":"John Williams has done it again with his musical score to \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\\" I bet he is again going to be nominated for an Oscar for this and hopefully win it this year.

Margaret Frazer's tales of a 15th Century Nun and her life in Northern Oxfordshire are always very well written and very enjoyable to read.

I would recommend this for ages 6-12 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good infant toy","review":"I am often hard on Melissa & Doug products but I really like this one. It is very cute and good for infants from about 6 months to a year. All the bugs make a different sound (crinkle, rattle, honk, etc.) and it takes just a bit of dexterity to get them into the jug. My son has never really liked soft toys so he didn't play with it too often. However, I passed the toy on to a friend's 6-month old baby and she (as in the baby) couldn't believe her luck - she couldn't stop staring whenever I rattled or crinkled the bugs and very intently chewed on them for at least 30 minutes (which is an eternity for a baby)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a buggy house","review":"The Bug Jug was a birthday present for my one year old daughter. She loves that all the bugs make different noises, the butterfly and it's crinkly wings is her favorite. And she's not the only one. My two year old son has fallen in love with it as well. Each bug is well made and stands up to the test of little ones. They wipe off easily and clean up nicely. The kids love to put them into the jug, which is also very durable and then dump them back out. Absolutely a great deal considering how reasonable the cost was. We've only had one other Melissa & Doug toy previously and it had held up will, which is why we purchased this. I will be purchasing more of this brand for Christmas and birthdays~!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loved these","review":"It makes me smile just to look at this toy. This set was given to us as a gift when he was a newborn, before he really had any other toys around, and he loved to stare and stare at the bugs! He would pick them up and drop them behind him before he was really that interested in grabbing anything else. His favorite by far was the spider, he loved to grab its legs and he also would stare and stare at it, we joked that it was his frenemy because he went right for it any time it was around, and would grab it, but then would drop it behind him. He didn't play with any of the others in quite the same way. It was super cute. This was probably around 4-5 mos old. He doesn't play with them that much anymore but we don't really have them all together in the jar anymore. The spider lives in his jogging stroller now and he is always happy to see his old buddy. Highly recommend this set for a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson loved it.","review":"My daughter said this is my grandsons favourite toy.

Even my 3 year old couldnt get them out, and asked for my help. hmm. I usually love melissa and doug toys, but this one I just don't get. i even looked online to see if there was something i was missing but no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of buggy fun!","review":"My daughter loves this toy. I think the bugs are amazing, and very well-constructed. The lid on the bag has a mock-realistic mesh to allow the bugs to \\"breathe\\" while they're in the jar, which I thought was very creative. My only complaints are as follows: The bug fit compared to the size of the neck of the jug is very tight, and could be frustrating for smaller children/babies; my little one keeps putting her arm in to grab the bug and then pull the bug out and is having some trouble with it. Good for tuning fine-motor skills? Maybe, but mine are pretty good and I have to work at getting a couple of the bugs out. The other problem is the plastic used for the clear sides of the jug seems like the kind that gets brittle over time, though this strikes me as less important than the actual bugs, which are amazing!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"This toy is really cute. The quality seems very durable and the colors are bright and fun.My son loves biting on the bugs & chewing on the antennae and getting them in and out of the jar. When we play, we learn about \\"inside\\" and \\"outside\\" and the names for the bugs. As he gets a little older, we could probably learn about colors & count the bugs' legs or something like that.The butterfly and grasshopper rattles & wings crinkle. The spider rattles and the ladybug squeaks and wings crinkle.I do wish that the opening of the jar was a little wider, my 1 year old gets frustrated because he can't get any of the toys in our out with one hand. But I'm sure he will eventually figure it out (as it's part of brain development & dexterity) & learn how to use two hands or turn the bugs so that he can get them out on his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"It's a great toy... it was a gift for my 6 month old but my 2 year enjoy playing with it also, he keeps putting in and out an sorting them.

It quickly became his favorite toy. It is fun, plastic free, and educational. A+ in my book. Good toys for this age group are hard to come by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The product is a \\"fill & spill\\" type of toy, but it doesn't do that. You can FILL the bag, but you have to practically PUSH the toys through the opening, and when you turn it over to dump everything out, nothing falls out because either the opening on the bag is too small, or the toys are too big. My baby loves to play with the toys inside, so we just leave them out because there is no way she would be able to get them in or out of the bag. A little disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Find!","review":"I love this toy! I got it as a gift for someone with a little girl, and then when she had a little boy too, the toy got double use. It's super durable, the quality is exceptional.

I didn't think he'd care too much but the reviews were good so I thought I'd give it a shot. He LOVES it. He doesn't care too much for the bugs themselves, it's just the putting in and taking out that he likes. He fills the jug with all kinds of toys and then dumps them out again. Even my 3yo and 4yo have had some fun with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to fill, impossible to spill","review":"This is a cute toy, and my baby enjoys the sensory features of the bugs, but to describe it as \\"fill & spill\\" is misleading. The mouth of the jar is so narrow that it takes a little force to insert or remove the plush bugs. Boo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Antennas are an issue...","review":"I bought this as one of the Christmas presents for my infant 8-month old. While she loves the little bugs and they make great sounds, the ladybug's antennae were unraveling when we took it out of the package.

Our first language is Arabic, but their second language at school is English and they can deal with levels 2 and 5 of these daily language reviews. I want them to be fluent in their native tongue and in English, and these books help in a practical, \\"daily\\", way. It just takes 5 minutes or so to do a daily exercise, we correct it, then we do what we have to do. It's not a chore,and I guess that by the time we finish a book, it will have made a difference in their sensitive grasp of the language.

In it, the De Camps give a quick overview of magic, alchemy, and ghosts, along with related subjects. The word-portraits of such luminaries as Madame Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley and Mary Baker Eddy, conjoned with extracts from their writings, are alone worth the price of the book.De Camp's name on a book ensures lively, well-written prose, backed up with solid research. About the only quibble I have is that there are a few minor errors in the account of the Salem witch trials."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book puts in perspective some of our \\"every day\\" ideas.","review":"I like this book. It thought me a lot of things. That is to say that it cleared or put in to words some of the ideas I was thinking at the time. The first part of this book is an exelent path for those who are looking for a different view on martial arts if not life as a whole. With the good things said, now I have to write about the only draw back of the book. The second part of the book talks about exercises and meditation technics, and these are fine and easy to follow. However, after these technics come a serious of fighting moves an teachings that quite frankly didn'tsit well with me. I don't mean that they are bad technics. I just didn't see a real reason to have them in the book because the fighting technics shown are common to most martial arts that teach some kind of grappling. Maybe after I mature more as a person and a martial artist the secound part of the book will make sense to me. In closing buy the book and pay attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very entertaining book!","review":"As a young adult, I very much enjoyed this book.

There may be a few chuckles, but otherwise you'll find yourself saying \\"so what\\".

The back of this book states that Max, \\"..embarks on a journey that threatens to shatter his firm grip on reality\\" as he falls under the spell of Shiva. None of this was really included in this novel; the book was more mundane and contained the same elements other murder mysteries contain. I expected more of a focus on the character of Shiva and was dissapointed when he was downplayed. Other than that, it was a decent murder mystery that also contained a side plot of Macarthur's dealings with his girlfriend, Ruth.

It explains all the things you go through with a divorce, even things you would not think of. It goes into things we hide from our own selves or just don't realize. One thing that is very touching and personal about this book is that at the begining of every chapter there is a love letter to you from God (based on scripture, of course) and at the end of every chapter is a comparison of what our fear tells us and what our faith tells us. This book truly can change your life if you are in the valley after a divorce (which most of us are). And the chapters are not long, so you can take it in little bits at a time, one issue at a time.

The simple inclusion of the tracks from BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY OF A MADMAN not featuring Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake would be enough to avoid this like the plague. Then, we come to the content of the box itself...There are some box that cointains absolutely everything recorded by the artist inq uestion (example: MESSAGE IN A BOX, from The Police). Of course, in Ozzy's case, it would be impossible to do that in four discs. So, the artist has to throw some juicy gems around the box set, to make it really worth.But what did they do? A lot of annoying cover versions, annoying duets (the worst of them all being the butchering of \\"Changes\\" along with his bad-mouthed and spoiled daughter, Kelly), previously released live versions, some demos.

I agree with most reviewers, the price of the boxset is a bargain, but if I want to pay money to listen to Ozzy stuff, it BETTER be Ozzy stuff, not collaboration with others that is just crap. What's next? Maiden doing duets with Gwen Stefani? Oh please no...I'm a huge METAL fan...lets keep it that way...Bottom line, buy at your own risk. If you are an loyal Ozzy fan, you may not like it.

The other milspec BDUs I have all had button fly - these are zippered.These are made in China and the stitching is sloppy. Of course, that's not directly related to being made in China.

The little girl explained during the story how her little yellow tomatoes were able to grow on the farm. Very educational! I think little kids will enjoy having this book read to them over and over.

It is a waste of time to watch this one, unless you want to see what is wrong with America today. That these people probably do exist, and have positions with some prestige, is a testament to the decadence of NYC in specific and America in general. This movie is just one absurd, disjointed, and boring scene after another.The only reason I gave it two stars rather than one star is that it does reveal, albeit in a non entertaining manner, the sick and tragic people involved in the NYC art and fashion world."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap perfume","review":"This movie was absolutely terrible. They were trying to work the whole \\"artsy\\" angle, you know- New York and fashion mixed with culture. I didn't even know when I started to watch the movie that the actors were improving, but I didn't need to- it was a dead give-a-way! The actors had uncomfortable silences almost in a \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" way, but no where near entertaining. Let me just roll my eyes and say \\"Find a (good) script and stick to it!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want an hour and a half of improv, this is for you","review":"The little caveat at the beginning of the credits should also be on the DVD box, \\"All actors dialogue was improvised\\".Wow, does that certainly make a difference. Perfume had an excellent cast including Jared Harris, Jeff Goldblum, Mariska Hargitay, Rita Wilson, Paul Sorvino, Peter Gallagher, et al, in roles that would have been fantastic if fleshed out. However, the movie fell flat due to choppy and hesitant dialogue, save two scenes that were excellent and seemed lifted from an actual movie.This movie doesn't even reach the level of a good documentary, but is more like sitting through an improv class. In my opinion it's not worth sitting through for the very few reedeming moments. Unless you want to see how well some of your favorite actors perform when improvising the entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um.... what is this movie about again?","review":"I watched this movie not to long ago with one of the guys in my dorm and we were both at an extreme loss as to what the movie was all about. There quite literaly was NO plot what so ever. The acting was ok, no great or poor but ok however that does not make up for the very poor character development,lack of plot twists (aside from the dude dying from cancer there were none) and I was confused why they put Carmen Electra all over the over, the back and in the trailer when I only saw her for 15 secconds. I'm sorry but I don't think 15 secconds of Carmen is worth my time, I get more of her when I watch Battlebots before the first commercial break.I'm sorry but I can only say what a flop this is and hope the producers think twice before releasing a script they deam to be 'artistic' to the unsuspecting general public.

The songs are simply drek. I have just about worn out her other CD's from playing them so much, but I gave this CD one listen and tossed it across the room in disgust. It's still on the floor behind the bookcase and I have no desire to retrieve it.

There is not one song on this joint that I can say I like to any degree. The production on More Than A Woman are not complimentary to Toni's rich alto and is pretty uninspiring. The music and vocals have no drive and no passion. It's amazing the record company actually released this product for an artist that's supposed to be reputable. Toni's musical efforts have not been the same since her debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than ur average singer","review":"Not just any singer can continue to deliver good albums over the years.

Toni has one of the best voicest in the industry, but it's wasted by bad production, weak melodies, and watered-down commericialized hip-hop R&B that disguise her vocal talent. She has sold out folks -- all it takes is one look at the \\"Hit the Freeway\\" video to realize that she's peddling glitter to fans and is not longer into the artistry. I surely hope she'll get back with Babyface to produce her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irv Gotti , Loon and Big Tymers Killed This Album","review":"Like many that have reviewed this album, I am a fan of Toni's earlier efforts \\"Toni Braxton\\" and \\"Secrets.\\" The songs on those albums represented her true vocal talent. While \\"The Heat\\" wasn't a bad album, it was a slight step backward from the first two albums, however, \\"More Than A Woman\\" has to be her worst album production wise. I understand her wanting to reach out to a younger audience, but Irv Gotti, Loon, Big Tymers, and others are not the answer. What saves the album are the ballads \\"Rock Me, Roll Me,\\" \\"Selfish,\\" \\"Always,\\" and \\"I Love You,\\" \\"Do You Remember\\" and \\"Tell Me.\\" I am glad that Toni is going to back to Babyface though. 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back and better than ever!","review":"Though some think this CD is one that should have been left in the studio, I think that in Toni Braxton's beautiful hands, it works extremely well. Theres the imagery (Who doesn't want to see Toni in a Thong?!, or hearing about her telling her man to get out!)There's the triple threat of Let Me Show You the Way, Give it Back and Hit the Freeway. I am still in awe of Rock Me, Roll Me, after a year of listening. I can't think of anyone else being able to sing so much truth. This is yet another link in a chain of magic albums of a true talent. (Even her Christmas CD \\"Snowflakes\\" is great!Check out Toni!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worse CD!!!","review":"I am a big Toni Braxton fan and own all of her CDs. This CD is by far her worse CD ever. I am not sure what she was thinking when she made this record. I hope the next release allows her to redeem herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"Toni Braxton's latest album is the second disappointment in a row. Her first three albums contained tunes that hit me right between they eyes, particularly songs like \\"Unbreak my Heart\\" and \\"Another Sad Love Song\\". To me, nothing there is nothing distinguishing on this album. It was difficult to tell one track from another. It seems to me that Ms. Braxton could be the new Whitney Houston, in that her ability with ballands is second to none. An opportunity wasted with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"R&B diva mixes it up with a hip hop flare.","review":"This album is pretty good. I would not venture to say its Toni's best work but its very like-able. Selfish is probably my favorite track but Me & My Boyfriend, Lies Lies Lies, And I Love You, Rock Me Roll Me are good in their own right. I feel like this album took on a different sound and life of its own. Not really any ballads like Toni is known for but its a fun album."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"More than a woman?\\"....LESS than an ALBUM!","review":"Braxton is merely \\"going through the motions\\" in this attempt to appeal to a cross-section of the listening audience. Not a single track on this release is worthy of the singer or the attention of the buying public. There are no selections that grab ya.I hate to be critical of an artist of her caliber, but Braxton needs to go back to the drawing board, i.e., her acclaimed pairings with Babyface and the sultriness that is her forte."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great singer.....Bad album","review":"I have to say that Toni has one of the most beautiful and distinct voices of all time! I loved 'Toni Braxton' and 'secrets' as soon as I heard them. I have had this album for a while and still can not get into it. NOTE TO TONI FANS: If you want to hear Toni at her best...buy any other of her albums...but not this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toni ENHANCED","review":"We all know of Toni Braxton being the female vocalist to just sing slow songs and be known only to do just those types of songs. But Toni Braxton turns that around for herself to be versatile and not afraid to enhance and flip the pages of her book.\\"More Than A Woman\\" compiles Rock, R&B, and Hip-Hop in accordance to Toni Braxton with her own rules and policy. She took a risk to use writers, producers, and arrangers (including her husband Keri Lewis and sister Tamar Braxton) outside of Babyface and Darryl Simmones to bring versatility to the table. With songs like \\"Give It Back\\" with Big Tymers and \\"Lies, Lies, Lies\\", she truly isn't afraid to show versatility.Besides the lack of promised record sales with this album, it's still worth buying. Toni Braxton is still her best and strives for that all the time. Hopefully with buying the album, you will help that statement to be forever true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I am a big Toni Braxton fan and was one of the first people at the store to pick up the new album. Boy, was I disappointed. I agree...this is not her best work. Her last albums(including the Christmas one) were all great with good quality songs but, I didn't find that on this one. Even the Babyface and Darryl Simmons songs were lackluster. Well, it wasn't broke so she shouldn't have fixed it and changed up what was working before with the hit albums. This one doesn't fly. Even the provocative image won't sell this album. Time will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her Voice&Album Cover are still Hot,but","review":"the Album on a whole is a Lemon.seems Contrived&forced.I can tell She isn't happy with the Music Industry Politics going down.I would figure with Her Being a Piano Player,Good Vocalist,Her Husband Kerri Lewis being a tight Instrumentalist&Babyface working with Her that the three of them would be all you would need to making a Album? but not with the majors these days.too many sauces going on with this Album enough Flavor.Her Voice Saves this Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get me wrong I am a toni fan","review":"2002 was the year that hip hop was all over the airwaves and the quality had nothing to do with that. So toni decided to go hip hop and even name her album after an aaliyah song and it sounded like a hot mess. This was not the toni I was used to hearing, but her new music from her upcoming record Libra sounds awesome and like Mariah Carey, she will make a huge comeback. This album was just a low point but she'll bounce back from it"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to the old Toni Braxton?","review":"I miss the old Toni Braxton songs like \\"Breathe Again\\" or \\"Love Should Have Brought You Home\\".

But after I got a chance to get the c.d it's was bad..I only liked \\"hit the freeway\\" & \\"let me show you the way(out)\\" very bad album it's like a r&b meets rock gone bad \\"me & my boyfriend\\" was good but here verses was soooo airry! I just wished Irv Gotti pimped her out a little bit thank god she didn't release this as her first single. Buy it only if you like typical airy r&b"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hip-Hop Disaster","review":"Just when I thought she had she had hit an all-time low with \\"The Heat\\", Toni comes back and hits rock bottom with \\"More Than A Woman\\". Obviously a pitiful attempt to capture the interest of the hip-hop audience, \\"More Than A Woman\\" is a disaster from beginning to end. I mean, I don't have to say much. Just listen to snipets of the songs and you'll see how horrible they are. Other than her first album, I've never been very impressed by Braxton's vocal ability. This album proves most of her success has been based on her looks and not her voice. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last 3 albums is Toni failure","review":"I'm very dissapointed with Toni perfomance on this album, all songs except \\"Hit the freeway\\", lacked famous Toni smooth tender deep voice.

Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear!","review":"Toni, or whoever is pulling the strings for her, appears to have completely lost the plot with her latest album \\"More than a woman\\". Inovation and development are all very well but the songs on the album are so lacking in depth and R&B. They remind me of how Prince sold-out with \\"Purple Rain\\" and such after such a promising start.I can't be bothered to detail anything about individual songs as they don't demand any constructive comment.She needs to have a word with Babyface to try to get things back on track (sic) as far as I am concerned.I shall not be buying another of Toni's albums on reputation alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"from a swiss","review":"hey people ! Forget about Dianne Warren and the R'n'b stuff ! Nobody listen to this anymore ! \\"Secrets\\" it's done and Toni doesn't have to do it again !

I think this album is maybe not the greatest one in the world, but look at the market right now...do you see many \\"classics\\" coming out ? Maybe i'm not disapointed because i wasn't excpecting anything, i don't know, but one thing i know, is that i'll be, for the next 4 month, singing her stuff all over the place as i did with the songs from \\"the heat\\". cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Than A Flop!","review":"This has got to be one of the worst albums of the year.

Do not, I repeat, do not purchase this garbarge, you will be solely disappointed. I like Toni, but sorry, this just doesn't cut it! Where is Jam & Lewis, Babyface, David Foster, Narada, Michael J. Powell, etc. when you need them. Someone please tell Toni she's 30 something, not a teenager!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Greatest Hits CD Would Be Better!","review":"Well, I just listened to 'More Than A Woman', the new CD from Toni Braxton, and let me tell you that it wasn't the great work that I expected from Toni.The CD is produced by a large number of producers (at least one for each of the 12 tracks!!), and Toni's vocals aren't used properly (... Toni's vocals can't rescue the weakest songs!!).The CD lacks focus, and it's a shame for Toni to continue singing the mundane R&B.In my opinion, Toni should've released a 'Greatest Hits' CD, and used the 2-3 quality songs on this new project as bonus tracks.This CD pales in comparison to Braxton's previous 3 projects!!My verdict-This CD is probably the WORSE by Toni Braxton, and only her die hard fans will enjoy mere portions of it.If you MUST have it, get a ... used copy (there will be plenty of them available!!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is HOT!!!!!!","review":"I love this Album... All the songs are sultry and HOT!!!!Toni puts her heart and soul into this. Her voice sounds great, the music is bumpin' and will have you moving and grooving.

You will definately not be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"totally a major disappointment....i purchased this c.d. without listening to one song based on miss braxton's previous work which i adored...this c.d. is strictly commercial and is basically soft-core rap, one song after the next...there is not one song on this c.d. that i truly like and i will never listen to it again.....she completely deviated from her sultry, rymthm and blues ballads and songs displaying the quality of ber voice to singing JUNK.....i don't think i'll ever purchase another one of her c.d.'s unless i listen to it entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"p.u.","review":"im not sure what toni is doing or trying to get across on her new cd but it is a big p.u.

Better luck next time i hope"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful - Perfect example of the sad state in music","review":"Unfortunately Ms. Braxton has reached an all time low. Catering to people with absolutely no taste in music whatsoever. This CD is completely uninspired. Full of tasteless, uninspired lyrics and music. Her beautiful voice is wasted on this CD.She works with artists (should they even be given that title?) like Cash Money, Loon, Irv Gotti? Even her own husband and sister! These people are not renowned producers and song writers in the industry. How in the hell do you go from working with grammy award winning song writer/producers such as Babyface and Diane Warren to working with Murder Inc.???? Irv Gotti is not even worthy of her presence!!Ms. Braxton should be ashamed of herself. As of this writing her CD is at #86 at the Billboard charts!!!! And only after 9 weeks. Good for her .... She puts out garbage like this and she should get exactly what she deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than I first thought","review":"I first heard this album 3 years ago and I thought it was such bland hip hop crap. 3 years later I decided to give it a second try and I've decided it's the most musically diverse album of toni braxton's career and for that it deserves it's props.

It is very different from her previous albums. This shows the hip-hop Toni. I recommend this because it is good. It is fresh and new!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! she's definately more than a woman!","review":"This album from Toni is awesome, and is a total must have! This has got to be her best album to date! It may be a little different from her previous albums, but it's still pretty darn good! Best songs are: \\"Me & My Boyfriend,\\" \\"I'm Selfish,\\" \\"Tell Me,\\" \\"Plain To See,\\" \\"Rock Me Roll Me,\\" and \\"Bet She Doesn't.\\" Least best songs would be: \\"A Better Man,\\" \\"Let Me Show You The Way,\\" \\"Do You Remember,\\" \\"And I Love You,\\" \\"Always,\\" \\"Lies Lies Lies,\\" \\"Give It Back,\\" and \\"More Than A Woman.\\" It's a great CD from start to finish. She dedicates this album for her husband and children and her husband and sister Tamar even help out on the album, writing a few of the songs for Toni. She seems to just get better with time and her voice sounds alot better on this CD, however doesn't meet the same satisfaction as \\"Secrets.\\" You'll like this even if you're not that fond of Toni Braxton and her music, you'll eventually grow into it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toni is the BEST!!","review":"I realy haven't had the chance to listen to toni's new cd but i have been a fan of hers since i was born and heard her voice i think that toni has set the height for other female artists who have worried about what others thik i just think toni baraxton is great an would like her to keep on doing what she is doing Thank You Toni"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average hip hop... not the Toni B. we've come to love!","review":"This CD was disappointing! It basically sounds like every other female hip-hop genre cd! Toni's ballads and strong vocals were completely gone on this cd, she sounded like any other group out there today... nothing distinctively Toni about it. Don't waste your money, I'm glad I listened to it at a friends house first and didn't waste my money. C'mon back to the strong vocal ballads Toni, and stay away from the hip-hop scene... it's not your best!!![.] Be different, make a difference! Be yourself!!![.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Surprise","review":"Unfortunately not a good one. I was greatly disappointed after hearing the songs on this album; granted there are a couple of songs (literally) that were acceptable, other than that I found myself skipping most of the songs.When you hear the \\"Unbreak My Heart\\" song from her second album \\"Secrets\\" and then listen to the song \\"Give It Back\\" from her latest album you could hardly believe that it is the same talent. As a big Toni Braxton fan I'm truely and utterly disappointed, and hope that she is able to recover from this gradual and saddening descent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah!!!!!","review":"How can I say this...Toni came out better than ever. She has displayed the ability to adjust to new styles and the way the music business has been moving. I love the hip-hop based beats, but she still hasn't forgot how to make ballads. And lets not forget to mention how beautiful she is. All I can say is her husband is a lucky man. Overall one of my favorite CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty friggin' cool","review":"Most reviewers submitted unfavourable remarks for Toni Braxton's latest CD,...though I don't know why. I was pleasantly surprised. The entire CD has a flirty/groovy feel to it. Besides \\"Give it Back,\\" I dug every song. The standouts are \\"Lies, Lies, Lies,\\" \\"Tell Me,\\" \\"Selfish,\\" and \\"Hit the Freeway.\\" The key to enjoying this CD is to NOT compare it to her others."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Than.....needs More work!","review":"She still has a great voice, but this cd lacks a lot! I have tried to listen to it several times, but it is just not good. Seems to have been rushed. I really enjoyed Toni Braxton's other cd's (even the Christmas cd), so I decided to buy this one without sampling it. That was not smart. Save your money and wait to see what the future brings from Toni. Hopefully, she will pair up with Babyface again and get back to her sultry ballads. \\"Selfish\\" and \\"Hit the Freeway\\" are good, but that is about as good as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Boring would be a compliment for this album","review":"Did they clone the real Toni or something? I have been totally unmoved by her last two CDs. Actually, nothing got to me like her very first one.

This album didn't deserve this one star.My gracious, end the pain already...."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars","review":"Normally I never buy an album without listening to a couple songs,but because I liked the track \\"Hit The Freeway\\" so much I decided to get it on impulse. This album really is amazing!!I was quite surprised at how good it turned out,despite some of the not-so-good reviews I had read about it. This album has some hot tracks on it from her up tempo tracks like \\"Hit The Freeway\\" to her slower ballads like \\"Rock Me,Roll Me\\" it is definetly a really,really good album to listen to. If you like Toni Braxton you are bound to like this album. I recommend it to any fan of r&b.Best tracks:\\"Hit The Freeway\\", \\"Rock Me,Roll Me\\", \\"Tell Me\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"whats wrong with you toni??are u sick??","review":"i'm so sad with her, and i dont know what happen to her. coz she's a good singer and she got a vety damn nice alto voice. in this album are [bad], well some of itare kinda so so good. I would like to compare her from her first and second album. in her first album OH MY GOD it has been my very damn favorite album and i even still hear it everyday. like one of the songs in her first album titled YOU BELONG TO ME she really take her voice very damn high and in this new album , she doesnt even take her voice high, just miming likea deaf person. god, she is getting worse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toni still has what it takes...","review":"I am not a big R&B/hip hop fan, but there is something about Toni's spectacular voice that does not do Mariah justice on her hip hop/R&B songs. Toni still has the nack for those luscious ballads, and although \\"Lies, Lies, Lies\\" is not one of her best, it is still good, however. My favorite on the disc, the pop tempo \\"Selfish\\" is the best. It ranks right in there when Toni first came into the scene. All in all, she does an amazing job of R&B, as well as combining pop and ballads into the mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music and a Beautiful Woman","review":"Toni's latest effort is great but it's one that might need to grow on some. If you have been a fan, you will love this album. If you are just discovering her, where have you been? I feel that this album is just as beautiful as she is.

I am very understanding to his lack of employment but I do not feel Toni should have made us suffer. WHY? WHY? WHY? I was so disgusted with this CD that I only played the day it was released. I should have ran it over with my car. PLEASE TONI UNBREAK OUR HEARTS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same Toni","review":"This CD has the look of Toni but not the sound. It's full of over produced bass and percussion that completely takes away from her sultry voice and superb lyrics. By using the latest trends in mixing, the Toni of old is lost or wasted. I will not ever buy another CD of hers and cherish the old. Her talent is too much to squander for a hip sound. There is not one song on this CD that I can listen too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A used to be music fan until this album","review":"Looks like Toni will have to definately \\"Hit the Freeway\\" and find a new career with this one because I was not too impressed. She had too many producers. She should have just stuck with ballads but I guesss when you trying to be like everybody young in the music and not be true to yourself--this is what happens!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but also GREAT!!","review":"I actually found this album really different from her previous albums and to be honest, it wasn't what I had expected it to be. Sure, her style has changed, but I really don't think it was a bad change. I guess she just wanted to play around with different styles of music and I thought she pulled it off really well, especially in the song \\"Selfish\\" which is one of my favorites on the album. I have never her her sing like that before and I was very supprised. I have only just bought this album because I live in new Zealand and I had to order it from America through the music store, but it was well worth the wait and money!!! haahahaOverall, Toni, you did a really good job on this one and Im looking forward to hearing more from you girl!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have everything by Toni, & this last cd was disappointing.

Toni as the ability to turn (what would be \\"bubble-gum\\" song) into a sexy ballad with her husky voice....most noticeable in last track ALWAYS.

Then when that didn't work, they told me that the problem was that the hot water switch needed to be on at all times or the water would taste stale(if this is true why is there a switch at all). The third time I called they told me that they use the same plastic as peanut butter jars and that the water is fine. However, my taste buds and stomach tell me otherwise.

I got the pepper ball because I thought it'd be easier to use than a mill (since it's one-handed) and Ming Tsai uses something similar. Sadly, this is a rather cheaply-made device. It actually takes quite a bit more effort to grind with this thing than with a conventional peppermill. And the fragments it produces are very coarse -- even at the finest setting. If you only occasionally do dishes that call for cracked peppercorns, this might be an okay device. But if you're looking for a peppermill alternative to use regularly, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A unecessary gimmick","review":"For some reason when I saw this, I thought I needed it. I thought I'd actually need to grind pepper with one hand while stirring with the other. Turns out, I didn't.The levers have kind of a mushy feel to them and don't take any less hand strength to squeeze than twisty a well-made traditional pepper mill. For people who have serious hand strength issues, a top quality battery operated mill is the way to go. The grind is too coarse and comes out in a wide swath.

My problem was I had replaced my traditional peppermill with this pepperball, so I forgot that peppermills aren't that bad. The amount of effeort it takes to get a minimal amount of pepper out of one of these is amazing. It might not be effort but time. I personally believe that a good pepper mill works better, especially the courseness adjustment. It's a novelty item that doesn't have staying power.

Half of the pepper stays in the ball to fill the grinder teeth and further reduce the output.Although advertised as a one hand pepper mill, it is best used as a two handed device. The squeezing action tends to broadcast the ground pepper over a wide area.

I'd say that it performed adequately for the first couple of years (not great, but OK). However, the grinding mechanism, which looks kind of like a plastic washboard, has worn smooth over the years. Now, it seems to take forever to grind a half-teaspoon of pepper (5 minutes, last time I counted).

Even with the dust canister completely removed, paint dust still collects inside and is not properly expelled. Obviously, this requires constant cleaning with an air hose coupled with a heavy \\"tapping\\" on the exhaust port with my hammer handle to help dislodge the caked dust. Hopefully, it will die soon from my endless tapping so that I can buy another, this time from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porte Cable is supposed to be the best","review":"I have owned 3 of these sanders and none of them will grip sandpaper very well.

The only way to cancel out noise is to turn the volume up as much as possible and still then you here noise not to mention the speakers shake and distort even at half your computers volume, again not worth the money at all. i might buy another pair if they were 4 or 5 dollars because thats about all there worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!","review":"I recently purchased these headphones.

The town has been experiencing illness and disappearances. There is a biological/chemical facility nearby.The mutants are not scary by modern standards. The opening credits has \\"Special Guest Appearance by Jennifer Warren\\" like they did for old TV shows. Indeed, this movie looks like it was made for TV down to the sound track, which may or may not have been better than the bad \\"Tempe Video\\" style I expected. The build up to the mutant scenes was better than the mutants themselves. I got bored at that point.Fired lush Sheriff Bo Hopkins delivers comedy: \\"Proof? I got proof.

It'll work but I end up adding tape to seal it closed.If I didn't need these the day they arrived to send out a large mailing, I would've returned them for a refund.Depending on your use, these may work for you. I was relying on the photo and description of a \\"tear tab for easy opening\\" because I am sending these out to paying clients and I really need good packaging. Reading the reviews here, someone said there wasn't a strip under the tear tab. What I received didn't have a tear tab at all, never mind a strip under it.It is white paperboard, which is easy to store and easy to address.

It is also modern when compared to other sourcebooks. IN particular the authors often provides the reader with different, sometimes contradicting interpretations of the sources, which is both exciting and instructive. Some of these texts also give the reader a sense of the (sometimes) very low reliability of the extant sources, an aspect often ignored in other books on the same subject. A warning: the authors give a minimal amount of explanations in short headings for each chapter; therefore readers -especially beginners- should not expect to find in it a historical narrative. At best it can serve to illustrate such a narrative. Or, in other words, it shoud be read with one of the classical histories of mathematics."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good, quick read","review":"After a tough day at work, I retreated to the library to gather chick lit. This was the only book in the pile that held my attention (granted, my work situation is similar to Ellie's at the beginning of the book), and I finished it that weekend.I like that things aren't completely resolved at the end. I think that, at that point, Ellie has grown into a person who will be able to handle the lingering problems and face future ones, too.Although my library hasn't ordered Gaskell's forthcoming book, I put in a request for it to do so!

I was thoroughly entertaining and hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"Ellie was OK, Ted might as well have been a cardboard cut-out.

She is not happy with her career (a litigation lawyer), her hair color (to the point of even doing at-home highlights), or her love-life (she's had her share of boyfriends but no fireworks). This all changes when she meets Ted Langston, a sexy, charming, witty and well known t.v. news anchorman who happens to be 23 years older than Ellie.This book engaged me right from the start. Although I am happily married, I found myself able to relate to Ellie in many ways and was cheering for her to get her guy right up to the end.

But the toys are cute, and bright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sorting toy.","review":"This is a great learning toy. Our son loved putting the objects in side and taking them out.

She loves playing with all of it, including the bowl by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lived toy","review":"This toy has a lot of elements for a child to focus on through different stages. There's more to it that simply taking the 4 creatures out, and putting them back in. The fishbowl itself is a fascinating thing because it is clear plastic with a mesh bottom and is can be squished and molded (and it's safe!). My child loves to hold it up while laying on their back and gaze through the \\"bowl\\" of blue plastic, like sunglasses, after she has emptied it. Honestly I think she loves the bowl more than the creatures. Over time she has had favorites of the 4 creatures. Each creature has some little thing about like a rattle, or squeak, or jingly bell. Some children may enjoy just emptying the bowl and have no interest in putting the creatures back. I think it depends on the child. Well worth the price I paid, I do wait for sales and a certain price point, I paid under $20 at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toy Parents and Babes Love","review":"Great quality, easy to clean.

When I applied it on my scalp, it would be sore and itching like someone beaten my scalp with poison oak. It took me a while to realize that my scalp was reacting to this product. So I tried it on my ends. I think it was too heavy for my ends. I assumed that with my 4a/b/c hair, I can apply heavy butters and oils without much thought. But it turns out not to be the case. So I used a small amount on damp hair and seemed to be a teensy bit better. Unfortunately not only did it leave my hair greasy yet dry and hard, every time my hair came into contact with my neck or scalp, my skin would react negatively. Plus the scent is atrocious. I am not a fan of the patchouli oil or cedarwood (to a lesser extent) so I will pass it on to a friend or my mom.

This stuff is pretty thick, smells awful, and doesnt add any shine to the hair. Oh did I say it smells awful?! I then zoomed in on the ingredients and noticed it had beeswax in it. Well Im sorry but beeswax is prettty heavy for my liking. I like moisture BUT also MOVEMENT, not a stiff drying looking, smelly hair. Plus I had to reapply this stuff the next day.To give you more insight on my hair and styling preference, I process my hair every 6 to 8 weeks. I wash my hair every 4 to 6 days.

Unfortunately, I was never able to actually use it because as soon as I opened it the smell overpowered me. It smells way too strong and the scent itself is an odd combination of ingredients. To me it smelled kind of like an Asian food market, with all kinds of spices and herbs mixed together. Separately they are good, but together they are too much.We had planned to used this on our infant daughter's hair, but there was simply no way it would work for her simply because of the scent. I wonder if all Carol's Daughter products smell the same way? This was our first purchase. I think next time I will purchase in store to smell prior to buying.

The whole cast is excellent, including the secondary characters as well as the main ones...I loved the mini subplot with the butler and maid getting together! And having the original Vicky Robinson play the fiancee's mother was brilliant! My eight-year-old niece can happily watch either the Haley Mills version or this one and be equally content...partly due to both these films, she is enthusiastic about her first week at sleep-over camp coming up this summer!

If they wanted to compete with the old Parent Trap, they should have changed the plot. The plot is believable & real, but the acting was poor. Lindsay Lohan has talent, but Elaine Hendrix, Dennis Quaid, & Natasha Richerdson obviously didn't study the script enough.Dennis Quaid (Nicholas Parker) needed to have more heart when dumping Elaine Hendrix (Meredith Blake). Natasha Richardson was too stiff.But Lisa Ann Walter & Simon Kunz added a comical glimpse to the movie.

She talks and looks exactly like her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishful thinking, travesty for children.","review":"It's amazing to read all the positive \\"5-star\\" reviews of this movie. I think one reviewer got it straight by pointing out the devestation of divorce on children. There is always room for fantasy in film and fiction. However, a movie about murder, for example, would never be classified as \\"heart-warming\\". I am not in favor of censorship so they may go on making movies like this for as long as they want, but it doesn't mean anyone has to buy into the lies inherent in theplot. Children suffer horribly from the failures of their parents to stay married. And the parents DO NOT reunite in the end, so raising the childrens' hopes is rather cruel--unless one can regard this as an escape from an unpleasant reality. Movies like this raise good questions, though, such as whether such fantasies provide escapism or false hopes."},{"rating":"2","title":"More features, more Lindsay","review":"I have this movie on both video and DVD and this DVD is the third Parent Trap I own, and they are all three the LindsayLohan one. This DVD has more authentic, awesome features. It's worth buying. This is actually my favorite movie in this wholewide world. I love it so much! Lindsay is my favorite actress and it's amazing to see her talking back when she was just a kidand you see her years later in 'Confessions of a teenage Drama Queen' and 'Freaky Friday' and soon in 'Herbie: Fully Loaded'! This is a cool DVD, and I think you should buy it to!--Quick Note--Before you see the sequel to a movie,make sure you see the original moviefirst then you'll understand the secondmovie more.

Until 2007, I had a crush on Lindsay Lohan (this was her film debut, no doubt). I personally like this version better than the 1961 original to be honest, probably because I saw this one first and it came out during my generation. Brings back some good memories of when Lohan was a good actress and wasn't a law-breaking druggie.

As for the DVD , it lacks extra features such as commentary from cast,director,behind the camera,production notes etc! What we got is another bare bones DVD that lack the stuff the other studios such as New Line,MGM,Paramount etc pack into thier DVD's ! if you want to see this movie check your library or your video store to rent the DVD before you buy it!

The first thing I have to point out is what a complete frigid biatch Kelly has turned into this season! Well, she always was, but even moreso here. And they always said Brenda was. Please, right off the bat in the second episode Kelly makes some snide remark about Ginger without knowing her all of 10 seconds. Not to mention her little confrontation with Valerie in the same episode where, OUT OF NOWHERE, she tells Val that she \\"hasn't changed\\" and the \\"the gloves are off.\\" WTF?

It bolted on very easily and sounded just like the original factory muffler that had rusted out after fourteen years. The problem started when I went to replace the downflow O2 sensor last week. The studs that hold the sensor to the pipe had completely rusted to the point where I could crumble the threads with my fingers. The studs are now completely useless; the only thing holding the sensor to the pipe is the rusted mass.When I called Walker to inquire about the warranty they directed me to Amazon, saying any replacement would be handled through them.

JB's work on this jazz/rock instrumental offering is nothing short of phenomenal and is a must hear for any aspiring guitarist.

So when I saw this book, I thought it would be sad, but a happy tearful ending like \\"The Christmas Shoes\\". Wrong. This book was thrown together, not touching, and you wanted the character to die already to end it. The main character seemed almost blase about her impending death, spending more of her precious time sending people on errands, instead of talking to them. If you want a good Christmas read, try Joe Wheeler's series, \\"Christmas in my Heart\\". Those are heartwarming, while this is just horrid.

Laura mentions that she has a headache, and on the way home their car breaks down in a busy tunnel. While they're waiting for a wrecker, the headache that Laura has been having escalates, and she becomes severely ill.The story continues with a shocking diagnosis for Laura and a gathering of their children, Laura's siblings and mother at the hospital.This is a very small book and a fast read. It's well written and although the title is appropriate, this is not your usual Christmas story. I do recommend this book, but some people may prefer not to read it until after Christmas. This is a serious and mind wrenching story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal, not touching","review":"I just finished reading this book, and couldn't understand the glowing praise it had garnered. I gave it 2 stars, because it was well written, but the story was brutal. The potential in the set up was there, but wasn't realized. Why was the surprising \\"secret\\" included? It didn't make me see the heroine as more human - it made me dislike her. Why did she keep sending people, e.g. her husband, her brother, on errands? That seemed cruel. The final chapter which could have been a balm, simply reinforced my impressions: this was a family which was brutal to each other and the death of the mother did nothing to change that.I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor video quality","review":"The image quality on this DVD is quite poor. It appears not to have been remastered. Greenway unfortunately has a habit of shooting scenes with deep shadows (I think he got Rembrandt to do the cinematography) and this results in very murky images at the best of times. In this case it was little different to watching a video.The film is typical Greenway with the usual highly contrived stylized acting and dialogue. The number puzzle certainly drives the film forward but I'm damned if I can see all the numbers! After a Draftsman's Contract, drowning by numbers has one of the more coherent plots to follow. But who cares, its the images that are the best bit.

I recommend it to anyone who is considering having a culturally centered wedding. My husband and I are culturally conscious (he more than I) and I truly appreciated the Yoruba Tasting Ceremony.

It is designed to be cheesy and campy with names like \\"N. Hale High School\\" and \\"Ralph Skinnfloot\\". It has an immaturity appeal to it. The plot is immaterial and the film would have been better as a \\"Groovetube\\" type film than trying to follow a plot about an old pot dealer in HIGH school.The humor was re-hashed (pardon my drug pun) jokes and dialouge that would indeed sound better stoned. The movie suggests that you smoke pot continuously. Even seasoned pot smokers know better than that. The cartoon aspect of the film was good as was the talking joint with the bloodshot eyes. If they had incorporated the joint into the film, rather than someone talking as an aside, I think that would have been more entertaining to a stoned audience.Parental Guide: Over abundance of F-bombs and N-words.

Further, his reccomendation on nonuse of Diamox for altitude sickness prevention also disturbed me. Mr. Burns gives the impression that the trek is nothing more that a brisk walk and that a genuine workout program of cardiovascular training and weight training is of little use. If one were to rest on his reccomendations they would stand a very small chance of reaching the summit. Further, the use of Diamox for many who summited proved to be a key factor in their success. If one were to take these sections of his book to heart I do not think their Kilimanjaro experience would be a positive one. Be in the best condition you are able and have Diamox at the ready if you need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential guide!","review":"Cameron Burns has filled a void with the publication of this climbing and trekking guide for Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya. While much is probably written about Kili, there is very little practical literature about Mount Kenya. The introductory pages are full of useful hints for traveling in Kenya that, from my recent experience there, all ring true. The route descriptions on Mount Kenya, while lacking in some detail, certainly convey the necessary information for a successful climb. It is already time for a new edition, however, since some of the features have changed. Kami Camp, for instance, no longer exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well its a research text","review":"So you decide you want your master's degree. So guess what, you have to take stats. Social statistical research is about as fun as removing your own tumor to be sure, and this book is the lemon juice that reminds you that 1. you are not a doctor, and 2. you are using a rusty butter knife.Did I learn anything from this book? Yes, I learned that apparently there were 3 previous editions of this prose that failed to drive the reader to insanity. My favorite part was reading my wife's stats text book for an unrelated master's degree to understand what the heck this book was talking about.I give this book 2 stars because in the event of a world ending disaster, you can use its many useless pages as either fire starter paper, or toilet tissue. I would personally recommend the later, because world ending event or not, this book already stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than death, but not by much","review":"This book should come with a reference to decipher exactly what these authors are talking about. In my Master of Public Admin program, the stats professor assigned this as one of three required textbooks. The other two books were used to translate what these guys were talking about.

Jenna knows there is more to it than a simple mugging and turns to her former flame, Frank Renaldi, for help. The police detective is at first surly, as he fights his attraction to Jenna, but when danger heats up, he can't fight it any longer. He must save the woman he loves.** Unfortunately, relational transitions are jumpy and the plot tends to meander, as well as having holes. What could have been a wonderful story falls short. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I'd expected","review":"I must be the only person who DID NOT find the story \\"Scent of a Killer\\" engaging, thought-provoking and a great romatic suspense.I was really disappointed in the development of a relationship between Jenna and Frank. It's like, one minute he's a friend and the next, she's in love with him? I thought this needed a little more development, as well as the reasons why Frank was such a butt when he was younger and didn't fight for the woman he loved. It might have made all the difference.The plot involving the Russian mob was a little... well, I guess it wasn't my style. Interestingly enough, I normally love stories involving the mob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Block - bleak noir, desperate characters, and a pretty good mystery","review":"This is the 3rd novel in the Matt Scudder series. It's early Lawrence Block, lacking some of the polish of his later books, but even back then he was great at hardboiled noir, and desperate characters, and driving a story quickly. The mystery aspects of each book have improved -- this is the first one where I didn't figure out the murderer before the end.I haven't read the later Scudder books (except Eight Million Ways to Die), but I understand the style and tone changes considerably. This book was bleak noir, in the same vein as other early Block novels such as Grifter's Game and The Girl With the Long Green Heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spongebob is great","review":"I love spongebob, my kids love him too. cant wait to get the remaining series.

The tiles appear to be branded with ink that runs outside of the lines of the characters and numbers. For example, a #1 dot looks like a number 4 because of the sloppy imprinting. The imprints are also not in alignment with one row of dots higher than the other row, and once again, ink running into the wood around the imprint. The wooden racks are not long enough to use as a guideline when you build your wall in front of them, so you need to physically count your tiles each time you start a new game, as opposed to the American version with the longer, clear racks. These racks are also low on the table and hamper viewing of exposed tiles because the wall is directly in front of those tiles. Do yourself a big favor and buy the American version with the ivory or white plastic tiles and the higher racks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy crap on a stick.","review":"Let me get this straight.... I really wanted to like this game, and did, for awhile at least. Stories great, great characters, blah blah blah. None of that matters, because, you're not going to be playing the game. This thing is so full of holes its unplayable, if not a first, eventually. I started out fine, wondering what all the bug complaints were about, but now, I can't even play.

However this game is not without its high points the charecters are interesting(espically the interaction between the NPC Jolee Bingo and Canderous the Mandelorian in particular)However once you work out all the chinks in your own gameplay the game is not really worth it.

By far, the best Star Wars Game that I've ever played, and one of the best RPGs I've played as well. It is in-depth enough to satisfy a hardcore gamer, yet simple enough to be played by a more casual gamer. It offers excellent, solid storylines; good graphics, even to this day; replayability; and, most of all, tons of enjoyment. It will continue to be a classic for some time to come, I am sure. If you like Star Wars and/or a good RPG, buy this game: it will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Program crashed repeatedly","review":"This program became unstable after just a few hours of play.At one particularly difficult part (which also required sitting through a long cut-scene) the program would crash just before you got to the point where you could save.

Even though I've played it countless times, I still don't think I've explored all of the possible storyline options in the game. A must-play for any Star Wars fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Star Wars game","review":"This game captures the spirit of the first trilogy (IV-VI) perfectly without it being a complete clone. This game feels like Star Wars.Word of Warning, don't expect a huge challenge to morality because the game makes it clear on what is light/dark. You can't really play a neutral Jedi, but you really have to choose your side from the get-go. However, the light/dark side is a big part of the Star Wars universe, and if you are interested in that I'm sure you've already chosen your side. :)The story is well paced, and has the illusion of it not being linear, but pretty much is. And you will love the twist. You'll see. ;)There are some annoying aspects though. Like the mini-game where you have space combat (more like a turret sequence). It can happen frequently. Just keep pressing the fire button and shoot madly at those incoming interceptors.Play this game! It's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Awesome Awesome","review":"Awesome game definitely worth playing not for graphics but for story!!! -It is Essential because it will help put ancient Star Wars into perspective for you as well as the Jedi Civil war, and the mandalorian wars.

Two of these are essentially twitch games -- Swoop racing, and fighting other ships from your turret gun. What's worse, both of these twitch games are mandatory at various points in the game -- you cannot go on without performing adequately. The Swoop race while tedious is not too difficult, but the turret gunning is almost impossible for me -- and represents exactly the kind of gameplay I hate.That's all and good if you expect it, but most folks buying this game will assume that as an RPG it does not require twitch skills. That is not the case, and you could end up being stuck with a game you can't finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it..","review":"Short and sweet...

Maybe I'm biased against RPG games but.. If you like pointing a sword cursor over an enemy and watch your character from a third person view slowly walk up and attack in one predetermined way, than this is your game. If you like overly complicated controls, tiny unsymbolic icons, complicated classes and scoring for every imaginable character attribute, than this is your game. I didn't get very far in this game after I \\"watched\\" the action instead of playing the action. If you like to track countless meaningless character attributes, this is your game. If you like action get one of the excellent Jedi Knight series games.

I'm pretty sure I won't either - BECAUSE I WON'T PLAY IT AGAIN.Listen, with all the cool technology out there today that enables the player to enjoy full range of motion, excellent graphics and exciting gameplay this one is definitely a step back for the industry. What a joke!Look I know it is an RPG but you can have the best of both worlds and the result would be a much more immersive, fun experience. This is like watching a mundane movie that just happens to have a mouse connected to it which lets you navigate the whole boring experience. Yippeee!!!

They are out there believe me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The force is strong with this one...","review":"This is a great game. Designers did an amazing job of making the Star Wars universe look how you think the Star Wars Universe would look 3000 years before the time of the movies. You visit some famous places of the movie (e.g. the Wookie Homeworld) and you will spend HOURS on this game and the kicker is that while the game is fairly linear, you can actually make choices that will make you a champion of light or a vile dark lord. At it's current price it's a steal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down like whoa","review":"Commercials, add campaigns, and hype led me to believe that I was buying the greatest game ever created. Something that would keep me busy for hours, intrigue me with a compelling plot and wow me with ultra-cool gameplay. Nope.This is just an overly decorated point-and click mouse adventure. (Do you want to open/blast/lock the door?) Maybe if you are REALLY into Star Wars, you will like this, but, basically, for a person just looking for some fun, you won't find it here.Lucasarts comes out with some great titles, like the Jedi Knight games and Indiana Jones, but it also comes out with a bunch of crappy ones, this game included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy.","review":"I bought this game before Christmas and my word of warning.

I've played it on the Xbox and what Bioware was able with the transfer to the PC was seamless. The controls are great, and the atmosphere is reeking of Star Wars (in a good way).This game has more atmosphere and more of a \\"Star-Wars\\" feel than the two prequels combined, no joke. The differences from playing the game as a Jedi or as a Sith is very exciting, and with the different character qualities, you'll be sure to go through this game more than once! The only thing you'll need is a fast computer, because this game is pretty glitchy and slow at times, even on my 2.8 and ATI Radeon 9800.

'Knights has no joystick interface which means you must play the entire game via keyboard or mouse.

The light and dark side choice allows for massive replayabilty which makes up for a missing multiplayer mode. The sound was excellent and dialogs excellent.

The story of Jo, who moves in with other women during WWII and share cost and heartache and laughter, played by Ginger Rogers is sappy but fit the times.The most compelling scenes for me were when one of the girls is blessed enough to see her soldier and have a special evening, all the other women make their man's favorite dish, all of which the poor soldier can't eat. It showed how desperate they were to be with the men they loved. The next scene that stuck for me was the last scene where Jo has recieved the telegram of her husbands' death and tells her new baby about his daddy. She tells him never to let anyone say his father died for nothing. It was all pure drama but did the job for the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, interesting twist, great title","review":"You won't know all the title entails until you read the whole book.

Also, the bi-material handle was supplied damaged, when I was expecting a brand new product. Under the circumstances, it's no consolation to me either, that the Stanley jaw-capacity opens to 42mm compared to the Sidchrome's 37mm.But to now put things into perspective.

The research seems to have been carried out well.It is written in support of post-tribulation rapture theology and gives some fairly daming evidence against pre-trib history.However as a post-tribulation convert due to my own study of scripture, I do not think it goes far enough in giving the post-trib piont of view based on scripture.If you are looking for something that gives the post-trib view, backed up by good solid biblical exergesis, then I think there are better resourses available.If you are interested in the history behind pre-trib theology then this is the book that will give you that.Would I recommend it?

We're not all Martha Stewart, nor want to be, and Bari Lynn and Abbe Aronson expertly hold our hands and tell us it's okay. Their quick-tip guide, a kind of decorating for dummies, makes the point that it's our house, our apartment -- and it's supposed to be comfortable, not some kind of sterile showcase. The text starts off by letting you know that you really can do it yourself, and that you don't need a six-figure income to pull it all together. Just a little imagination. And the pictures supply a lot of energy and mix and match ideas. Best yet, all the while they're holding your hand, you never get the sense they're talking down to you. You get the sense there's no 'wrong' way to do a home. What works for you works, and that's really all that counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing new ideas about home decorating","review":"Eclectic Living by Bari Lynn shows her unique eclectic vision.

It's so neat to read what is possible to do in the snow, all the while describing it in a rhyme. My favorite part is when they go skiing and the dog slides down on his tail! He's the first to discover the snow and gets his little child friend to come out and play. They go from there and it is just very, very cute. Especially in the end when they put an umbrella on the biggest snowman so he wouldn't melt, but wind up putting snowballs in the freezer to play with another day.

Children of all ages will like this tale of finding a new family to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful childrens book","review":"This book was outstanding. It was one of my personal childhood favorites, and for good reason. This book is ideal for parents to read to younger children, and older, more advanced readers will be proud to be able to read it.

It does have extras, but you may find, as I did, they are up to the level of the remainder of the DVD.On a positive note, some of the \\"commercials\\" are actually not painful to watch, although there is little they can do to save this film from festering in its own squalid wretchedness.

Instead of being a stark and grim account akin to Dickens, this work instead is uplifting and hopeful.

Then, when cleaning, dump the box into the other pan containing the sifter.

She likes to dig (like a dog burying a bone) and she hates being trapped in a cave. Still, she took right to this box with no fuss and the only litter that gets out of it is stuck to her paws, which is unavoidable with any box design. The three-tray design is brilliant and you need to go look at the other reviews and read up on the \\"awesome method\\" for using them. The only problem with this box is that it is *huge* and doesn't fit in a modestly sized bathroom. It's too tall to go under the sink, too wide to go between the sink and the wall or the toilet, or between the toilet and the tub, and in the end the only good place for it was a corner of the bedroom.

Reliability? you would be better off finding a card with internal power connector as the FireWire 1394 power drain can be quite a strain on cheap PC motherboards, especially with external drivers and burners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with Thinkpad T60","review":"I bought this Adaptec AFW-1430A FireConnect to transfer video data from a Sony DCR-HC62 Mini DV camcorder to a Thinkpad T60. The adapter accomplished the job easily and perfectly. Windows XP Professional recognized this Adaptec cardbus and there was no need for any external \\"driver\\". This PCMCIA cardbus has 3 IEEE 1394 Firewire ports and a DC power jack for optional external power adapter. I did not need to use the power jack for transferring the video data to my computer. I assume the power jack may be needed for some other tasks requiring more power??. In summary, this card provides 3 firewire ports, is recognized by Windows XP, it is well made, and reasonably priced. Just make sure your computer accepts CARDBUS rather than ExpressCard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value and great product!","review":"I bought this so I can transfer video from my Panasonic PV-GS300 camcorder to my PC.

The recipes are authentic and those I have prepared from the book are delicious, especially the eggplants imam baldi (eggplants stuffed with tomato, onion and garlic and slowly roasted while slatered in olive oil). A drawback for non-Greeks is the lack of recipes for tzatziki (yogurt-garlic sauce) and a typical Greek marinade for grilled fish and meats. However, no cookbook I own in Greek contains them either. I suppose most Greeks know how to prepare these things just from watching their mothers, and Skoura's book was originally written in Greek for use in Greek households. But since this book is an adaptation, even the very basics might have made a welcome addition. Overall, it is an excellent reference guide on the how-tos of Greek cooking, with a straightforward presentation and chock-full of delicious recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pictures","review":"When I purchased this book I was looking for a Greek Cookbook asap.

Mattie runs into some trouble while trying to buy the gift for her mother: for one thing she doesn't have enough money.

Having said that, we had to remember that the Chinese character being examined are one of the modern evolution of the CHinese writing system from the Qin Dynasty where Qin Emperor enforced a common writing system. We had to examine that various form of writing before the Qin Dynasty and how it influence the modern evolution of Chinese writing system.With this background, then you will be able to recognise that we are trying to read our pre-conception into the Chinese character and form a conclusion that it related to Genesis.

Her lyrical self-questioning voice will be missed. What I found myself missing most from Appetites was more of the straightforward personal narrative that appeared in her earlier works. Appetites combines this type of narrative with a more academic look at the causes of and institutions that reinforce anorexia.

The more general parts of the book could have (and have) been written by any numbers of writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a misprint","review":"Plenty has been written about WHAT women want; movies have even been titled as such. But this book by Caroline Knapp isn't about WHAT; it's about WHY. Knapp's 1996 book, Drinking: A Love Story, chronicled her battle with alcoholism, whereas Appetites, a much more ambitious book, examines her early battle with anorexia, a condition which was referred to only peripherally in her previous book. According to Knapp's self-awareness revelations, the denial of food is a metaphor that explores the difficulties women have even acknowledging their deepest desires - desires for sex, love, freedom, professional recognition... just life. The message behind Appetites is made more poignant by the fact that Knapp died last year of lung cancer at age 42.

Secondly, this book contains only SIMPLE pencil drawings of some of Royo's artwork. It's just a rough sketchbook. The cover art is the most elaborate of all of the images in the entire volume. And although the pencil images are well done, they lack the amazing realism of his completed color paintings. Illustrators (or anyone who's aspiring to be one) may enjoy it, but others like me probably wouldn't. If you're just discovering Royo, I'd recommend getting Secrets, Malefic and Visions instead. In my opinion, Women isn't worth buying, because it simply doesn't reflect the mature Royo fans love (rather, it highlights Royo as cheesy 70's sci-fi cover artist)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Away","review":"An interesting book full of ideas, and obviously, conceptions...Although there are some interesting ideas(???) portrayed by Royo, the art world still has to admire Fantasy Artists for their imagination, prehaps one of the hardest subjects to create.

If I were to buy another one I would buy a different one that is bigger because right now my twins are too small for sitting up toys and I would like to put them both under the gym instead of taking turns but soon they will be able to play with other things that entertain and this wont be an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but not sturdy","review":"I like that this item is a cute play mat that zips up for easy storage. The part I dislike most is that the activity bar does not stay standing-the mat is so lightweight that only with adequate weight on the mat does the activity bar partially stand. kinda defeats the purpose!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable","review":"Thankfully I got this second hand at a a great discount, but I still feel like it was a waste of money! The rounded bar support for the toys is not stable and falls over which I don't need to explain why that is such a poor design for infants. Save your money and pay extra for a product that is safe for your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves this Gym!","review":"My baby girl loves to play on this gym since she was 6 weeks old. I have not had any trouble with the bar popping out. It is very sturdy even when I pull on it. I like that you can change out the toys. I didn't realize that the flower played music - you do have to pull on it hard to make it do so - I don't know how a baby could reach this toy to make it play which is one of the reasons I give it four stars. I also didn't like the rattle/mirror toy and changed it for something else. Overall, it is a fun activity for my baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great design","review":"We bought this playmat for our daughter and we have the same problems with the bar popping out and hitting our baby. She likes to play on it, but gets so scared everytime she kicks the bar and it pops out. Also, I think the toys are positioned too high. My 4 month old can barely reach them. Also, we have to lay her more towards the bottom for her to really even be able to see the toys. I do love how it zippers closed and is easy to transport. However, overall, I would not recommend this particular mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"This toy doesn't stay together well. After a couple of uses the base gets flimsy after folding it up and the bar flops either back or forward, causing the toys to be out of reach and out of vision. This toy ois designed for a child who is ready to track and grab, but the toys are out of reach. I had to buy longer toys to get my child interested in it enough to try to reach for the others, but he would freak out when the bar flopped out of useable reach. I replaced it with the fisher price aquarium wonders model. This one is WAY better for the extra $10. It has 2 bars, one for kicking, or just reverse the baby when he gets bored. Plus it has a great tummy time set up and way more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life-Saver Product","review":"This product provides an Activity for the infant that allows you to watch television, talk on the phone, or whatever.

However, he really like the lil pillow at the top. So he naps on it now. (2 months old)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea; poor execution","review":"I used this toy because it was something easy to travel with. We were taking the baby on a week-long trip and wanted to make sure to have a toy that would keep him entertained. The toy was definitely amusing to him. He loved the colors and the toys that dangled from the bar. It was compact enough and lightweight enough that I could throw it in the suitcase. But like many other readers have described, there's nothing to hold the bar in place. The bar and the plastic piece easily pop out. The purpose of the toy was to entertain my son safely while I gathered needed items for the day. Unfortunately, I felt like with this toy, it was inappropriate to have the baby out of my sight for even seconds.I wanted to love this toy, but I just didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but don't waste your money","review":"I got this for our LO because the baby gym was one of the items from our registry/shower that we didn't receive. I figured he would not really need anything special until he can grab at them, etc at first so this would be fine. I was wrong, the hippo is cute and my LO does like to stare at the hanging animals but it a piece of junk, the bar falls over forward and if I was not sitting there watching him it would hit my LO in the head! It is nice that it all zippers into itself but overall I would say to take the $20 and put it towards one of the $50 play mats like the tiny love mat or the FP rain forest one that seem to be safer and have great reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wiggle Worm for My Wiggle Worm","review":"My baby loves his wiggle worm gym, and I love watching him play on in. It is convenient to zip it up and take it anywhere with us. The only thing I would change is that I would make the bar a little sturdier, it has a tendency to tip over. Other than that, I love this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy would not recommend","review":"I bought this product for my 2mos old granddaughter. I received the package right away no damage etc. Problem I had is that the bar with the toys is too heavy & doesn't have a stable base so it leans forward or backwards & I'm afraid if I'm not there holding it up that it will fall on my granddaughters face.Will be returning & searching for a more sturdy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsafe bar","review":"I LOVE THE IDE ABOUT THE TOY HOWEVER THE BAR IS NOT SAFE. THERE IS NO WAY TO KEEP IT IN PLACE AND FALLS OVER OR POPS OUT. THERE IS TWO STRAPS ON THE ENDS OF THE BARS BUT NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE FOR OTHER THAT TO BE THERE. I LOVE THE FOLD UP DESIGN EASY TO STORE WOULD HOWEVER BE A MORE EFFCIENT PRODUCT IF THE BAR WOULS STAY IN PLACE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but Arch falls down constantly","review":"Really poor construction whenever my son bats at the toys the arch bends over and falls down. Not safe we are returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so well built","review":"My daughter is now 4 months old and has had fun playing with this gym, she is now loving pulling on the flower and hearing it play music. But, I also have the problem with the arch popping out constantly. I'm surprised with the reviewer who hasn't had a problem - I can't figure out a way that it won't do this. Also, my older daughter was playing with the baby, leaned on this and broke one of the support pieces on the bottom. I like the idea of this really cute gym, but wouldn't recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"We received this play mat as a gift and I am so glad that we didn't spend a dime on it! Although inexpensive in comparison, this play mat isn't worth the money. My daughter can easily kick the overhead bar and it will go flying from the mat. The toys are way too high for her to reach, and she has not gotten any use out of them. Yes, it's cute, but that is the only positive feature of this product!Spend the extra money and get Tiny Love's \\"Gymini 3-D Activity Gym\\" from Babies \\"R\\" Us. Both of my children have loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hippo Gym Not Good","review":"My daughter has not been injured by the bar popping out but does seem to get frusterated with it, I can't believe honestly that they would design something for a baby this way. She also gets very frusterated by how high the toys are (virtually unreachable) and she has very long arms and legs for a baby her age. I have posted a picture of my baby after the bar popped out on her, she doesn't look thrilled. The gym was a gift so I am not out any money but I sure do not think it is worth anyone spending money on even if it is inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Safest Toy","review":"This toy can only be used with ABSOLUTE supervison. The activity bar continuously pops out. It will catapult many feet from the playmat if kicked just right. It has so far scared my 4 month-old, hit the dog, and knocked over many things. HOWEVER, my 4 month-old loves to bat the toys. I only recommend this item for babies who do not kick much."},{"rating":"1","title":"merry monkey gym","review":"I am not fond of this item. The arch falls over repeatedly and I am constantly try to put it back up. When this happens my son ends up kicking the toys instead of being able to look at them and grab them. Not satisfied at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Infantino Merry Monkey Gym","review":"It looks good in the picture. When I received it and put it together, the bar kept falling. How can a baby play with the toys without making it fall apart? It was very unstable and flimsy. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE, had to return it!","review":"I bought this thinking it would be a good option as a small playmat for my baby. But the arch DOES NOT STAY UPRIGHT. It would fall over right on my baby's face. It was completely unusable and I returned it after 2 days. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use stabilizer flanges on the bottom!!","review":"I bought this for my granddaughter and I didn't notice, at first, that there are fold-out plastic stabilizer flanges for the light-weight arch that are built in under the mat. You have to open these flanges and that makes the arch much less likely to keel over. There are also some velcro straps on the top of the mat to hold the arch at the base, but they won't do the job alone. You must use the stabilizers to achieve arch stability. For the cost of the item, it's nice for a small infant when set up properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"This play mat just sucks. My son got it for Christmas. I returned it within the week. The fabric is cheap, the toys aren't anything special, and it isn't sturdy. AT ALL. Everytime he would bat at a toy the toy bar would come crashing down onto him, and he was playing very gently. I tried repeatedly to balance the mat and toy bar \\"just so\\" so that it wouldn't fall, to no avail.And the advertisement that you can attach the toy bar to the crib? Well, i'm a pretty intelligent adult and I could never get it to stay attached to a crib without looking really tacky.I returned it and bought the fisher price precious planet play mat that has three bars that connect in the middle for about $35 and have had no issues with it. It has alot more toys, collapses well too, and is ALOT better quality.So, for $15 dollars more, my son has a better quality toy that he can enjoy without getting bonked and me having to hold the toy bar up so it won't hit hom in the face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cages of Glass, Flowers of Time","review":"This book is the best, ever!

Well I've finally found it and I feel like I've been reunited with an old friend! That book made such an influence on me as a young teen, my parents weren't even alcholic's. But now I have a son going on 9 and I will be sure he will read it when he gets alittle older. And any of my friends that love to read. It may be a youth teen book but I'm quite sure it will touch anyone that has a heart. Good luck finding it, but it is well worth the effort!

It was a little awkward and extremely exhausting at first but after a few consistent weeks I was keeping up pretty well. I have since purchased other Kettlebell DVD's (Steve Cotter) which are also excellent but this one from Phil Ross is the most complete, well rounded KB workout I've seen yet. The Cotter videos are more diverse and better explained, but with Ross I use just a fraction of the weight I use during the Cotter workouts and it takes absolutely everything out of me. I saw better physical results with two months of this video than with a year of free weights. Anybody who gives up just didn't give it enough of a chance.

The disk is so small that I thought it wouldn't fit into my disk drive, but it did! Some of the words that I say, it doesn't understand, but if I keep my head level and speak clearly it works fine. It doesn't want me to raise my head or lower my head, I guess it sounds like mumbling. Overall, I would recommend this software.

Also, the house has little holes where it locks together, so the smaller seeds fall right through. The main problem is the suction cups. They are warped. They are not flat so that they can not create an air-tight suction seal. One suction cup was a little less warped, but since the other one was completely warped, it wouldn't hold up and the house fell immediately from the second story...seed everywhere.

I had intended to buy a large, fairly expensive one with a two way mirror, but the reviews for this one was good, so I decided on it instead. To date, the bird feeder has been up for about three months and the birds still have yet to find it and I even put other bird feeders nearby. However, at the end of the day, it's performing well. It is still sticking to the window with no problems and the large roof with an overhang keeps most moisture out and the holes in the bottom allow any water to run out. I'm going to relocate it and hope the birds find it this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"I have no idea why this feeder got such great reviews!

For some reason the birds at my place couldn't even figure out how to eat out of this feeder. They would stare at the seeds longingly, sit on the window sill, and peck at the plastic. But I think I only saw one bird sucessfully eat seeds out of it. I had the same handfull of seeds in there for weeks until I just gave up and took it down.I don't think it's that my birds were too big to land on the edge. They were mostly just sparrows. Maybe it was that they couldn't really notice the clear plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small, too cheap, too expensive","review":"This item is too very cheap (think cheap tupperware) pieces of symmetrical plastic snapped together, value of about $1.99.

I was told about Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India. I had trouble believing that a single individual could have so much impact on the world. After reading, Shashi Tharoor's book, I've changed my mind.Tharoor's analysis of the intertwining between an individual's biography and the birth of a nation is masterful. The book stays close to its subject, Nehru, but then ventures to link his biography to many of the Indian institutions we now take for granted, including: secularism, democracy, non-alignment, and the country's prowess in science and math.

However, he also does something to get himself arrested and sentenced to several years in prison so that he can be there while the judge's son serves his time.Basically, the whole movie is about life in jail and how this man tries to make the judge's son have a horrible time in prison. It goes from fights, to homosexuality, deaths, etc. Anything that you might expect to happen in prison does, so its not a big surprise.The movie is not really that funny, there are only a couple of times when you laugh, but not all that much.

I literally caught the last showing of the film, and I was very touched by it.First off, there have not really been a feature made by, about and for gay Asian Americans. \\"Ethan Mao\\" is pioneering in that way. Really it is the first gay Asian American feature, discounting those about Asians or Asian immigrants like \\"The Wedding Banquet.\\"What I love about \\"Ethan Mao\\" is that it's a rebel story which everyone would identify with.

You want them to make it through, but you know they won't. The odds are all against them - or are they? It's indy, it's low budget, it has a cast of unknowns (at least, to Europeans).

For anyone seriously interested in the lives of women medieval mystics and medieval religious movements in general, this book is an absolute necessity.

However, not only are the scans not up to par in some pages but (here was a shocker for me)THE CHAPTER TITLE PAGES WERE MISSING!!!!!!!EVERY ONE!Instead of this, they just put the chapters title right into the manga on the first scene. Yuu Watase usually puts an establishing shot (such as trees) in the first frame, and they put the chapter title there instead of using her cover pages. I was really angry when I saw this and I will reconsider buying the rest of this manga. It is already very expensive and they do this sort of thing to save themselves money. I will put this review for each book that I have. I encourage people not to review this translation so highly because manga should be uncensored when it comes into publication in english.Note: After complaining to Viz, I am happy to report that the end result is a newer publication of FY which has all the pages.

It is very entertaining, definitely will make you laugh out loud! I read the summary of the story on the net before I decided to spend money on the graphic novels. Trust me, it is a totally different experience to see the real plot. Graphic novels are a good choice to buy, because you can read more in one neat book, rather than in lots of books, if you know what I mean. In case you didn't know, FY's third volume is already out-\\"Disciple\\" check it out. I personally love the art work of Watase Yuu, it has some really sophisticated, detailed graphs, as well as some funny cute ones! I just love the combination!

Whereas the last volume gave a lot of story and not much on action, this particular volume does a good job of balancing both. The stories in this one are very emotional, and give key background information for a couple of characters. An issue like this gives the author a chance to shine as a great writer. You can see how his manga has won several awards, as it goes beyond the action/shallow-emotion that so many other manga and anime have. I cannot stress enough how good this volume is, I literally read it from cover to cover.

My kids have never been bothered by the fact that his potty chair doesn't look like our toilets - kids are intelligent and I think it helps them to realize that not all potty chairs are alike. They really enjoy the humor behind trying to guess what the potty chair actually is in the middle of the story \\"Is it a milk bowl for the cat?\\".

Also they seem to stray from potty training itself a bit. However the biggest part that bothered me was the reference to \\"where you poop from\\". They refer to it as a \\"HOLE\\". Now personally my first choice is 'bottom' but even if someone was more inclined to use another word your would usually hear 'tush', 'butt' or 'rear' but never have I heard 'hole' in a childrens book. Often you here hole used in terminology as rude (ex: \\"shut your hole\\") or in perverse comments, I can't understand why the author chose to use a word that sounds more insulting the realistic or informational.

Apparently not, as the 'once upon a potty-girl' book also says that girls have 'pee pee's'...So I guess the only difference is the color of the flowers...not sure why you need separate books.

But I HATE this book. I realize hate is a strong word to use with something as benign as a children's book but seriously, this book is awful.My issues with this book:* The language used. We use proper names for anatomy, not silly nicknames like \\"pee pee\\".* The tone. It feels like the book is trying to guilt children into potty training by going on and on about how often the mother has had to change the boy's diaper.* The pictures. A chamber pot isn't exactly something today's toddlers are going to recognize. Looks more like what my son plays kitchen with, not what we're trying to get him to use in the bathroom.There have to be better potty learning books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waist your money","review":"This is one of four books about the potty I got for my 18 month old son. He has very little interest in it, it is long and has 4 pages showing the baby playing with the potty. As well as a page with him missing the potty (with pee and poop). Also, the potty is a flower pot. Very strange. You would do much better getting \\"Potty\\" (by Leslie Patricelli board books) this is a much better book and my son loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our favorite potty book","review":"I bought a few different potty books and this is BY FAR our favorite. What is with all those potty books out there skating around the issue of pee and poop?? This is the first potty book that actually shows the pee, the poop and the penis! Bravo! It is a natural normal thing to use the toilet and not educating our children about it properly when trying to potty train seems pointless and counter-productive. I am so happy I found this book and I finally feel like my toddler finally gets it. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that I wish the potty didn't look like a giant pitcher (don't get that) and also I wish the potty book showed the main character Joshua washing his hands after using the potty! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good quality saucepan","review":"I bought the Calphalon One pans because I was tired of replacing my non-stick pans when the non-stick surfaces ultimately wore off. Regardless of use of nylon utensils, hand washing, and warranty, the surface always seemed to blister and peel after a few years no matter what brand I bought; including Calphalon. So I bit the bullet and spent some money on my pans and have been happy with the Calphalon One Infused. It doesn't release food quite as easily as non-stick, but I also won't have a problem with peeling. I tend to use a lot of butter or oil in my cooking, so it's not a problem. It does release easier than aluminum though.Overall - Nice heavy pans that sit well on a glass top stove and heat evenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A collectors must.","review":"Great collection of stories that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

The weight of the wood had already snapped two iron hooks from the wall so I wanted something with a little give in it.

Through three important battles in history, tactical issues that are relavent in most all military history books are glossed over in favour of, one might argue, the more relavent logistical and socialogical details of war. How did men relieve themselves on the battlefield? What kept infantry men standing in square against charging heavy cavalry? What happens to the wounded left lying on the battlefield? There are alot of answers in the book that give the reader a more rounded sense of how war exists beyond traditionally emphisised tactical outcomes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent early work","review":"I found this to be thoroughly researched, well-written, and focused.

Europeans, on the other hand, are spoiled by good field guides to butterflies! This Kaufman guide is nothing compared with Tom Tolman's \\"Butterflies of Europe\\" or Bj?rn Dal's \\"Fj?rilar i naturen\\" (a Swedish work). My main objection to it are the illustrations. I'm not sure what on earth they are supposed to be. \\"Digitally edited photos\\"? They are worse than painted illustrations, while not looking like photos either.Frankly, it's amazing that you can screw up a book about *butterflies*, making it aesthetically unpleasing. I'm sure the range maps and species presentations are good for beginners who want to identify butterflies, and with some imagination you might make something out of the digital photos too, but I long for the day when Tom Tolman or Bj?rn Dal makes a trip to North America...You have longwings, swallowtails and milkweeds, and yet you blew it!

Good size, covers the stroller pretty well and mine is a relatively mid/large size umbrella stroller. The tie-string and handle are well made and feel durable. However, like the other reviews mentioned, the bag material is not very thick, therefore tear easily. After the first 1.5 hour plane ride, it already got a 2-3 inch tear near where the bottom wheels are. (only via gate-check, not baggage claim.) I'm duck-taping the hole for now. Still usable, but I don't expect it last for more than 3-4 more trips. If the material is little more durable, it would've been a very good bag.Also, the storage pouch is a bit too small. The bag will fit in the pouch if it's folded nicely and air-tight. If you are in a hurry and just stuff the bag into the pouch (like they showed in the video on the manufacture website), good luck zipping it up.I would buy it again if it's about $5, just use it as a few-time-use disposable bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"About As Useful As A Paper Bag!","review":"I just bought this last week and it didn't even hold up for the first leg of our flight!!

Luckily where I was going I had access to a sewing machine and I reinforced all the seams and repaired the hole (a tight fit getting the stroller back in the bag). That didn't really help though it got destroyed, same thing with the fabric fraying at the seams, on the way back and I had to throw it away. At least by buying it online I saved a few bucks.

The main objection I have to this film and the reason I say it isn't good family entertainment is the drinking element. Drunkenness is not funny and I don't believe a normal social life in the old West revolved around saloons. Sadly, many westerns portray that generation as universally accepting drinking (including this one). The cowboys always go to the saloon and order beer or whiskey. You have to be careful what you teach your kids is funny. If they see you laughing at drunken antics on the screen, they will act out; that's never funny. That's my two cents worth from a Christian perspective. Just remember that if your kids get in trouble and alcohol is involved you may find yourself asking the question \\"Is drunkenness really funny?\\" The only redeeming quality for this film is that the aging rangers persevere and use their wits (sort of)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Picture quality","review":"I bought this movie because I remembered how funny it was when it was shown many years ago.

The only trick with this item is finding the right method and place to mount it. It comes with some self-stick velcro pads, but these do not adhere well to the interior surfaces of many vehicles. I found some heavy-duty hook/loop with a better adhesive to attach it to the tool, and ended up using just the \\"hook\\" side to adhere to the floor covering in my Honda, just below the mid-point of my dashboard.

However, I prefer the speed of BW2. I'm a guy with short hair and am not that concerned with damaging my hair like most.

The stylist I had before I moved always got it right so I know it can be done. I came to her with recently-colored black hair and she got the highlights perfectly blonde. Now I'm told because my hair is color-treated (again I'm going from dark brown to blonde highlights) that it can't be done. The bottom parts of my bleached hair are orange.I've used this product twice now and both times left it in for almost an hour (I saw someone on here say don't do it for longer than two so maybe I can go longer next time even though it says not to..) There are parts that look nice and blonde but there's still a bit of orange left.

Finally, the description said the set came with 1 pillow case. I thought that was odd since it was a full size set, but that's what it said. As a result, I ordered (and paid for) a second pillow case. As it turns out, the set did come with a second pillow case so I now have to send the extra one I ordered back and have wasted however much money I spent in shipping.

It helped a little bit, but the ends were still raised off the ground with the cables in. The double-sided tape (supplied) worked for about a day.All in all, very unhappy with the cable protector.

This was a story with so many plot twists thrown in that the author might just as well as thrown the kitchen sink in, too. The characters' personalities underwent such a change during the course of the story as to be totally unbelievable. It became tiring, rather than interesting, trying to keep up with what was going on. The ending just left me scratching my head - it was so rushed and out of left field, and so obviously a set-up for a sequel.I got the impression reading this book that the author was hoping that it would be made into a mini-series on TV - it had every possible hook thrown in.This was the first book that I read by Ms. Michaels, and it was a total waste of my time.

I got about half way through and realized that I could barely recall the plot, let alone the qualities of the characters, and this was a red flag to quit wasting my time. Nobody has a personality. Even when they had outbursts, they were wooden and monotone. The dialogue is cringeworthy, stilted and contrived. She attempts to use the character's awkward monologues as exposition and it's just painful to read. If one of the characters said, \\"that's another way of saying....\\" One more time...ugh! And what 18 year old barely out of high school lands a job with a high profile politician, managing his office staff?? The dog's death scene was awful. Not believable.

Light on the gushy stuff and good interaction with all the characters. I was kept guessing. Loved the dog. My wife tells me there really are women like that.

The plot was excellent, but handling of the story was not up to Michael's usual expertise. After the extended crescendo of the plot, the conclusion was handled inconsequentially.

As Jessie grows up, the only person she feels close to is her friend Sophie. They vow to always be there for one another. When Jessie gets old enough, with Sophie's help, she leaves her parents, intending to never look back.

They were really good friends and cared for him. Monty is Andy's little brother. He is my favorite character because he asked so many questions that make you think. My brother would never ask me questions like that. This book taught me alot about some of the things that may happen to any of us.

It wasn't written like a normal book, because it had newspaper articles, letters, conversations, and even police reports. I think that's what makes it so interesting. I have to say this is one of the best books I've ever read. It doesn't candy-coat the truth, but it slaps it right in your face. It leaves you on the edge of your seat.

I thought that this was a very good, easy read. I liked it because it was about a teen problem. Another reason why I thought that this was such a good book was it had many different points of view.

Hoyt's view is that Hirohito was overwhelmed by the militarists when it came to war. I think the judgement is still out on this. Overall I think the book gave a good summation of his reign, with a concentration on pre war and war material. The source material Hoyt uses are predominately Japanese, with some Western sources.This is a good read of Hirohito's reign.

I cannot recommend this to anyone who needs to print PDF files on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Massive headache for Mac users","review":"Despite Apple's claim that the wireless HP 5850 color printer is \\"Apple-friendly,\\" it took an entire Saturday on the phone with both HP and Apple to configure the printer for use with Airport Express. HP's instruction booklet is insanely complicated--a far cry from Apple's \\"Plug 'n' Play\\" ease of use--even for a computer savvy Ivy League grad. Under the best conditions, with optimal signal strength and a speedy internet connection, it can still take up to 3 minutes after turning on the printer for it to be ready to print. It made me rethink my insistence on wireless technology--what's a few cords compared to hours of headaches, troubleshooting, and waiting with fingers crossed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great... until the warranty expires!!!!","review":"When I purchased this printer about 18 months ago, I was very impressed. Having some networking knowledge previously, the net set-up was relativly easy(although I had to go beond the manual to get it running smooth). I preformed without problems for quite some time until just about a week ago, when out of the blue, no warnings at all, started giving me the little blinking ink light and kept teling me on my comp. to change my cartridges, even though I had changed the cartridges 2 weeks earlier and it had been doing fine.

Knowing the Kierkegaardian and Nietzschean existential atmosphere De Unamuno was working in, I wasn't quite sure how the catholic angle would fit in, but De Unamuno contines to impress me with everything I read by him. \\"San Manuel Bueno, Martir\\" is the best thing I have read from him (also recommended, obviously, \\"Mist\\").Basically what we've got here is a kind of foundationless charity. Instead of turning with Nietzsche violence and the YES (after the collapse of what was), De Unamuno turns here to charity and tradition. Very interesting contrast. Good read. Thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profunda, conmovedora","review":"Esta novela corta relata la historia de un cura que, por m��s que haga el esfuerzo, no logra creer en Dios.

My parents had come of age during mambo/cha-cha dance \\"crazes\\" of the '50's, so the arrival of the cumbia must have struck a chord in their thrity-something psyches. I was seven when the distinctive clarinet section of the Rivero Conjunto woke me up. I still have the cassette of it that I took with me to college. A few years later I was working in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where cumbia is a secular religion. But when I put this tape on, the Guayaquile?os would readily admit that no band was ever hotter.

It is a creepy, twisted, blood bath, that holds absolutely nothing back...and that's what makes it awesome! From the creators of the Evil Dead trilogy, and the masters of the modern horror movie, Ghost House Underground. Offspring is everything you could want in a horror movie. Not just blood and gore, but a truly scary story. This movie has it all and I can honestly say I enjoyed every minute of it! Fans of horror and gore get this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Absolutely awful. Don't waste your two dollars.

OFFSPRING lays on the gore and blood without any real regard to plot or acting, offering nothing but torture and sadism. This is the weakest of the recent Ghost House releases--THE THAW and THE CHILDREN are much better. If you're into this type of film, you'll probably enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Very choppy...disoriented...and confusing. I'm not really sure I watched a movie that made sense...from start to finish. I tried to understand what was going on...but even the police in the film didn't have a clue but for a alcoholic retiree. There was plenty of second rate gore and pain, but gore needs to be partners with a sensible plot. I couldn't find one. \\"GHOST HOUSE\\" should be ashamed that they placed this one in their horror collector's file. You've lost a lot of credibility with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHILDREN OF THE CORNY","review":"The Offspring is one of those movies that's so awful you have to stare at the screen and keep watching to see if it can get any worse. It does. Cannibalistic, feral children whose idea of show and tell is disembowelment-and a simple disembowelment is a slow night to these kids. They grunt, stab, grunt, mutilate, grunt,and the quickly passed over reason for their existence is that they are the offspring of the children of a lighthouse keeper gone missing off the coast of Maine in the 19th century. I gave this movie two stars because despite the lousy plot, lousy script, lousy acting--the cannibal kids can't even grunt convincingly, the movie is so fascinatingly bad that everyone should watch it to see just how bad a movie can be. Oh scratch that thought----don't watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on target","review":"Another fine performance from Barenboim. Although Abbado's recording is deeply imprinted in me after two years of listening and therefore defining the symphony for me I find Barenboims interpretation to be quite similar as far as tempos, dynamics etc. Once again subtle differences that unsettle and enlighten at the same time. The difference in the phrasing of the french horn solo, the reserve on a melodic line rather than lush indulgence, is it a tambourine you hear more clearly in the first movement ? , all the things that reawaken the listener's awareness of each measure of music. Do you like it this way or do you like it that way more? Barenboim is the perfect conductor for those who like their Mahler with feet still on the ground rather than having fallen into the score. I may be a drama queen but the music does speak for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiderman pillow","review":"My 4 year old was very happy with this pillow. It's very soft and very well made.

I needed a replacement when I put my printer/scanner on a network interface and lost it's scanning abilities.I gave this one a try, because of the small space it takes up. But, I was wary of the negative reviews it's been receiving.I got it and installed it. I didn't have any problems with Windows XP. Properly installed with administrator rights, and not making the mistake of hooking up the printer before installing the software, I didn't have any problems with the computer not recognizing the scanner.Admittedly I don't use the HP software, but my own 3rd party software. The software isn't really that good.Scan quality is good. The first scan does take a long time, but subsequent scans are very fast in comparison.The negative and slide scanner does turn out good scans, if you're using the default quality settings of 300dpi. It's better on higher settings, but takes forever to scan.Overall, an excellent buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to look at, poor scan quality","review":"I have an HP Scanjet 4C that has been a workhorse for the past 4-5 years (It still works, but my new Macintosh doesn't support SCSI devices).

If you actually care about the quality of your scans, do not buy it for any reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful to look at but deeply flawed","review":"I purchased this scanner for the simple reason that it looked beautiful and took up less space than the conventional flat bed scanner. This was a mistake. The software that drives the scanner is unnecessarily complex, clunky and difficult to use. Scanning slides often results in the HP Software locking up. What is a great idea has been spoiled by poor unfriendly software. Even the manual is difficult to follow - there isn't even a clear instruction of how to fix the slide adapter. A simple show and tell DVD might have helped. Perhaps, HP might expand their new relationship with Apple with iTunes to advice on how to write easy to use software. I cannot recommend this scanner until HP re-writes their scanning software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Owned for years, worked great.","review":"I bought my ScanJet 4670 new several years ago, and it's been nothing but rock-solid ever since. I've scanned tons of text, lots of color photos, portfolio clips and more.It's true, it isn't the fastest printer at very high resolutions. However, adjusted properly for B&W; scanning or scanning for the Web, it's not that slow at all. As much as it would be great to just put something in and have it figure out exactly how you want to scan, the fact is that you've got to know how to make software adjustments.I don't understand the comments about \\"banding\\" - and some of those comments sound suspiciously similar - I haven't noticed that in any color range.And it looks great as a piece of hardware - in fact, it's become a collector's item (look at the used prices!).As a consumer who just wants good quality scans, I give my 4670 a big thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible- don't buy this scanner!","review":"Although it looks cool...the quality of my color photos are horrible.

I never had these problems on my older cheap scanner (non HP). I contacted HP support and they were nice but unable to fix my problem. The best answer they could give is that the bands may be caused from \\"interference\\" from other electronics. I find it interesting that so many people are having the same problem. I also have trouble getting the photos straight since they tend to move after they are put in the scanner...and since the scanner is smooth there is no guard to rest the picture next to if you take it out of the holder.

It has been my experience that what really counts is not the scanner itself but the softwear you use with it.

On the other hand, scanning at 300 DPI with the standard bit depth settings, I got a scan in 1 minute. Not bad, but still, a bit slow for 300 DPI!The quality even at 600 DPI was not what it should have been.If you want the most stylish scanner ever created to date, and don't mind really REALLY slow scans in order to get decent quality, then I'd recommend you consider getting one for yourself.

I pity the newbie trying to install this.I have had this unit for about three months. I can print wirelessly, which is why I purchased it. The software is a POS and locks up my laptop with XP (hpqtra08) every time upon shutting down. The other features like scanning have never worked well and I gave up on the support people who know very little or NEVER CALL BACK AS PROMISED. Faxing has worked o.k.Would like to read memory cards and transfer to desktop, but of course that has never worked and HP support can't figure it out after hours on the phone WITH technicians.

Prints great, scans to PC when it wants to, makes horrible noises (which HP does not seem to care about or offer solutions to),drivers stomp on camera and other software, causes \\"My Computer\\" to go into search mode until I finally had to uninstall the printer from my main work PC. Private tech help websites offered some temporary solutions which involved disassembly and plugging power in/out while powering on. All too much of a hassle.

I have it set to mixed mode and it immediately turns its wireless tranmission off. Maybe others will have better luck than I (I tried it with windows 2000 professional both wired and wireless and 98SE wireless). I'm taking it back tomorrow.

The hardware is fine for printing, but don't expect to get the benefit of the full features supposedly available in the bundled software. The full PSC download (500 MB!) is a pig that dramatically slows down total system performance whether or not you are printing, even on a brand new high-speed machine with lots of available RAM. It took me weeks to isolate the problem until I discovered that HP PSC full install totally screws up system performance, though the \\"light\\" install without all the features works fine.

That works great. I can still scan by HTTP and do local copying. If it were not for the 990C discovery, I would have thrown it off a bridge. The software is huge, slow, and full of bugs.

The machine now sits idle for two reasons--one, it causes so many errors so often, each time requireing a uninstall and re-install of a gargantuan file, and two, because I simply do not have the time for more pointless circular conversations with 'support.' I inherited this lemon because HP finally gave up on trying to fix the earlier model I had.

It truly is a POS.I exchanged the first one I bought thinking that this printer couldn't possibly be this bad of a product (hoping that the wireless card in it was defective) and low and behold: the new one has the exact same problem. Net/net, HP produced the worst product I've ever purchased in my life.

Morrison does a good job with teaching the reader to deal in terms of eigenvalue equations (a thing he harped on a lot in his first book).There are downsides though. The biggest is that he does not cover WKB approximation.

The scanner preformed well with all tasks except, as noted elsewhere, the Automatic Photo Feeder option and its many problems--failure to feed, jams, misalignment, ad nauseum. Seeing as how the APF is the main reason for buying this scanner, such issues become major concerns.But that's all been exhaustively detailed. My main complaint has to do with longevity: I've had the scanner a little over 2 years and it died dead. HP said there was nothing they could do but offered me a \\"special deal\\" of an upgrade. Well, their offer was indeed special, especially pricy. NewEgg offered the same scanner, shipped, for $65 less. Yikes.My last scanner, a Canon, lasted for 9 years before I decided to upgrade to the HP. The Canon was still working beautifully the day I got rid of it.Upshot: not happy with HP, product quality, supposed support, and product durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"The auto feeder does not work!","review":"Dont waste your time on this one. You are buying for the auto feed mechanism but you will find that it works so sporadically that you would be much better off lifting the cover and scanning by hand. With the by hand method there is far less frustration. With the auto feeder you are tempted to try to make the machine do what the instructions promise it will do. This cost time and will undoubtedly raise your blood pressure a few notches.Dont waste your money. A good flatbed scanner can be had for $..., Why pay close to $... more for an attachment that has no value.

The directing scene in his studio apartment is so funny. Furthermore, I can relate to his determination in succeeding. How he goes about accomplishing this is so inspiring. However, the best part is when they are all in the main house running from room to room is hilarious. To top if all off, they come back together to pull off the take over and become friends.

And the software itself is overly complicated and was designed by a newbie programmer who wanted to impress with all the bells and whistles, without understanding that people want simple, effective functionality.Spend a few extra pennies and save yourself the frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the fuss?","review":"Product set up just fine - no hardware/software problems at all with Windows XP.

(but it could be better)","review":"I love this printer enough that we got one for my parents, too. The print quality is good, papers come out fast, and the fax and scanner work pretty well.The two reasons I didn't give it 5 stars:1. I often have a hard time printing labels with the Avery templates that came with Word Perfect. I get an error message that says the printer doesn't have the right driver.2. It's probably b/c the printer is hooked up to a DSL line, the phone, and an answering machine, but sometimes faxes don't come through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not install - Bad support","review":"I bought this unit from Staples and was very excited at having my first AIO. I had read good reviews on the Amazon site and was thinking I got a good deal at $100 (refurbished).The printer just could not be installed. I am an IT Professional and understand technology a little more than a lay person. I tried everything possible to get this installed. I managed to install the drivers for scanner but not the printer. I changed my USB cable (HP Not including USB cable is very irritating).The support over email and phone was prompt but not useful. They kept telling me the same things which I had tried and not worked. They were unable to provide any insights into why the problem could have occurred.I do NOT recommend anyone to buy this machine. I have read other reviews on the web talking of installation problems. I hope HP fixes this problem soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY HP AT YOUR OWN RISK!","review":"No matter how good a product is, the company that stands behind it is just as important!

Unless you have a long extended warranty, I would not touch HP with a 20 foot pole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme installation issues","review":"This product won't install with Windows XP! I was on the phone serveral times for several hours with HP customer service trying to get this thing functional, but Windows XP has severe compatibility issues. Things I tried...new USB drivers, updating bios, changing USB settings, windows updates, changing startup settings, downloading newest HP software, and numerous hours of installing and uninstalling the software. This was not an easy task considering installation includes over half a gig of software and countless registry changes. Furthermore, their uninstall application leaves those registry changes; affecting future attempts to reinstall the software. What does HP recommend doing to fix this?....Installing and uninstalling the software AGAIN! In searching around the web for solutions, this device has issues with other versions of windows as well. This all in one is worthless, spend the extra money to get a differant one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HP Printer without the important thing","review":"Well, I support what Kelly said.

Therefore, we could not fax which was one of the main reasons we needed it. After a lot of jumping through hoops, HP decided that the line interface unit (where the phone cords plug into the printer) was defective. I returned the printer to Amazon and they sent a replacement. The new printer has the SAME problem and HP tech support cannot figure out what is causing this. So, the second printer is being returned today. Amazon is great about returns, by the way! I'm really disappointed as a I LOVE my HP Photosmart printer, but I guess it's not meant to be with this all-in-one product. I'm going to search for a different one from a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of crap","review":"I've been trying to get this printer to work properly for two months.

(I also installed it on XP Home and had no problem.) The software is terrible - at least half an hour to install, and it kept failing with a generic \\"fatal error\\" which gave you no idea what was being installed at the time. Then it would go through a slow process to delete everything it had installed and then I would have to start over. After tech support suggested I reinstall Windows XP, I gave up on them. Finally got it working after cleaning HP entries out of the registry.Then, a couple days later, when I tried to print labels, the labels would not feed right. An obvious hardware problem. But, support kept trying to convince me that it was a problem in Microsoft Word.So, I returned the printer and bought a Canon MP730 which I LOVE!

I purchased one of these, it had a loose wire inside it that wrapped around the paper roller while trying to print the first page. It was dead - so I returned it for another new in-the-box one. It wouldn't load the USB drivers, after two hours 5 reboots and reinstalles , etc. with HP support I gave up.

It paper jams regularly as does the printer cartridge. I cannot print more than a page or two without it jamming.

Not so with respect to the printer/fax/scanner/copier combinations. This is the second HP fax, etc. that has failed me in less than 2 years.

Paper jams are hard to clear and it stopped working with envelopes after a few months.

I'm switching to Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great AIO, setup was a breeze","review":"I followed the installation poster to the letter and there was no problem. The ONLY glitch was that as part of the process, a calibration sheet is printed once the cartridges are installed. The next step calls for the sheet to be placed on the scanner.Place the sheet UPSIDE DOWN to make this step work.Yes the software is BLOATED at 1GB! Minimum install requires 100mb. I've not tried ALL the functions yet. It will take me sometime to get there. Pretty quiet, Very fast. Very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent All-In-One for the Price","review":"I did my research on Amazon when searching for the best all-in-one printer for my money. I read several reviews and decided to take a shot with this one, and I am extremely pleased that I did.This printer is excellent and is easy to operate (I had no trouble setting it up with my Windows XP). The print quality is also excellent. I recently got a digital camera and decided to print some pictures (on HP premium glossy paper) expecting them to be not that great of quality because this is not specificly a photo printer. Again, I was blown away, the pictures came out great.I highly recommend this printer for home or small business use. It is also good if you want to print out pictures for personal use. Great printer for the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"My biggest beef is with the scanner. The copier and printer work fine. They're a little slow, but it's an inkjet, so I didn't expect much. The fax is great, probably the best feature in the bundle. But the scanner is hard to install and hard to operate.Also, paper jams are incredibly hard to clear compared with other printers/copiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT machine!","review":"I was skeptical when considering an all in one. I'd purchased a nnew Dell Dimention computer, and it came with a Dell a940 all-in-one. I'll be writing about that fiasco in a minute... yikes. Anyhow, after reading reviews here on Amazon and at other sources, I screwed up my courage and purchased an HP 5510. I'll never regret my decision... it's an absolute dream. Setup was NOT difficult as others say, albeit it did take a little while, but good things come to those who wait. I suspect that the reason that people had trouble installing this machine is that they did NOT take the time and effort to read and follow the directions. They are plain, easy, and informative. Also, this machine is for USB 2.0 and not below, as stated on the HP website. It is FULLY compatible with Windows XP, and is NOT loud as others say it is. It's a brilliant machine, and it comes with my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent at first, but then it just goes downhill","review":"I loved this unit at first, but after a little over a year of ownership, I wish I didn't own it! The ADF has continuously given me problems. My current problem is that printing one page it taking 10-20 minutes!!!! I was on the phone with HP trying everything to fix it to no avail. They decided it needed physical service, which as another reviewer stated, would cost about as much as it would to just buy a new one. I'm buying a Konica color laser printer and a Canon laser fax machine. I'll also be buying a separate scanner. This all-in-one idea doesn't seem to work long term. This is also my 3rd HP printing machine in 2 years. I think their quality has gone completely downhill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short planned obsolesence","review":"It's quite annoying when a product has to be thrown away after 2-3 years because the cost of a minor repair is greater than the cost of a new one. Our HP Office Jet 5510 no longer feeds paper and the Geek Squad says replacing the barrings costs more than a replacement. Do we need to be a throw-away society? I'll do more research before buying next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recomended","review":"I don't know if it's because of the software cd that comes with the printer for installation, or if it's just a plain bad model but I've had problems with this all in one printer since I first bought it...It wouldn't print and so I send it back and HP did actually send me a whole new one in return, but then that one had problems functioning also...in the end I can't print with it though I already exchanged it for a new one once before."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Begining ( El Comienzo )","review":"of one of South Americas Best and most Versatil Pop Band .

But the series was not 93 min long in total (as mentioned in DVD features), and the picture leads me to conclude that the \\"Young Hercules\\" in this pack is the movie, not the television show, and that was starring Ian Bohen, NOT Ryan Gosling.Other than that typo that got my hopes up before dashing them against the rocks, I guess it's a pretty good pack to get, unless you're planning to get the first season of \\"Hercules:TLJ\\" on DVD, 'cause the movies are on there too, and then just getting \\"Young Hercules\\" by itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too political","review":"I bought this book hoping to get some good info on solar power.

The print quality is outstanding with the purchase of the uber-expensive photo cartridge, but you're better off buying an HP printer and a separate scanner, because this one is a pain. The card reader is brilliant however, with seamless integration into the OS."},{"rating":"2","title":"capable printer","review":"Out of the box this is a good looking, small, multifunctional printerThe software took an extremely long time to load. It spun my cd-player the slowest it has ever gone, crawling to occasionally stopping. You'd think that people who were smart enough to design this could hire some good software writers.The scanner ran well when I scanned the test page that automatically came out of it. Haven't tried scanning photos yet but I think it will be good enough for what I do with them.Prints very nicely and quickly. Not that noisy either except for a grinding noise at the end of a scan that someone else I think has mentioned. I hated my Lexmark from the moment I got it for free with my Dell computer. Glad to get back to HP which I think are fairly bullet-proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible printer!","review":"Absolutely horrible!!

Anyway, the software was a breeze, I use a cartridge refill place in town,( less than half the retail) and the print quality for photos is every bit as good as some of the really high-dollar 'photo printers'.

The second one worked until I tried to print wallets, then the photo reader failed and stopped working.The third one didn't read memory stick at all.HP support was not knowledgeable and offered no help.

I thought it might still be of use as I could still make copies by hitting the \\"copy\\" button on the printer itself. No such luck, pressing \\"copy\\" illicits no response from the thing.

To start, it doesn't come with a USB cable, so that adds more money onto the total. Second, it is extremely slow, much slower than the specifications say. My biggest complaint is that it will not print certain formats, such as powerpoint slides and some pdf files. Instead of text, it prints out those annoying little boxes. As a student whose lecturers use these slides, it is extremely disappointing not to be able to print them out at home. I can't tell you how much paper and ink this printer has wasted because of this problem. I have not had a problem with the copier or the scanner, but the printer part makes the whole thing not worth buying unless you're okay with just printing in select formats."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP jumps the shark with this printer","review":"I'm so dissapointed in HP.

Luckily my husband is an IT guy so he happened to have hordes of USB cables to choose from, but still, it should've been included. Having to go out and buy one after getting it home would've been a pain. The little $20 camera we got our kids for Christmas even had the cable included, so c'mon, this should've too! :)As with most HP printer products, it also makes a lot of noise and prints violently. :) But we've found that's normal with HP products.I love the copy feature.

I read this book in between these other two books and was thoroughly disappointed. If you are looking at getting into buying and selling homes, then this book may be for you. There was a heavy focus on improving your home and then selling. If you look at the preface, the author tells you that he has moved quite a few times, which should give you a hint about the vibe of the book. He is interested in fixing up houses and selling. The whole book wasn't about this, but the info that didn't focus on this was not explained as well as either of the other two books noted above.

Fine, that is the title after all, but I didn't find it very helpful. It seemed like a sales pitch to me somehow (how to get the best deal, etc). It isn't until the last chapter when they say the biggest mistake of all is \\"being too afraid to buy because of fear of making a mistake.\\" Well, after reading that book how can one NOT be suddenly afraid of all that can go wrong???This book is definitely not good for newbies to the house-buying market. It just freaked us out way too much. A better book for newbies is BUY YOUR FIRST HOME by Robert Irwin. His was informative and reassuring somehow. It walks you through the facts without freaking you out about every possible thing that can go wrong, which I found much more helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth its weight in platinum","review":"Having read a pile of homebuying books, I would rate this one tops for six reasons:(1) The author clearly knows what he is talking about from experience--unlike too many authors who are primarily journalist or biased real estate agents.(2) It's easy and fun to read. (3) It gives dozens of ways to buy with little or even nothing down. (4) It reveals scams and tricks that real estate and mortgage \\"profesionals\\" use to fleece the unknowing. (5)The author knows real estate across the country--not just in California or other specific locales(i.e., too many HB books are written by writers who don't seem to know that Chicago or San Francisco aren't the areas where most people are buying). (6)Unbelivebly, the author lists his telephone number and email in the book so as to invite comments and questions. I queried and he called and talked 20 minutes to adress my concerns. And no, he didn't charge me or try to sell me any more books and tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good so far","review":"I started out with Home Buying for dummies which read more like a text and got me discouraged.

It is not written for those \\"newbies\\" who want to be led by the hand without exercising any of their own intelligence. For homebuyers in the \\"smart\\" category this book is the best. It alerts you to so many things that you probably wouldn't even have thought of. But then it tells you how to go about making sure that you don't fall into a common trap. The advice in the mortgage financing section is worth far more than the price of the book. For us knowing what could go wrong and how to deal with it was a real confidence builder. Highly recommended for people who can think for themselves. The basic message is this: Don't fear homebuying, fear lack of knowledge. Then it delivers rhe knowledge that gives you the ability to make better decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Out-of-date","review":"This is one of those people who should have to eat every copy of their book sold. Most of the first few reasons detail why buying is better than renting (not always true; us California renters are laughing now at the people who bought 2-3 years ago) and how you can finance a home with zero down and bad credit (and get the taxpayers to insure your bad debt.) The latest edition was published in 2006, at the very precipice of the housing price spiral we're all riding down, down, down with no bottom in sight. It's the irresponsibility of advisors like this that got us into this mess; do yourself -- and the economy -- a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's the info your agent didn't tell you . . .","review":"As first homebuyers, we made a wise choice when we selected this book.

I am constantly irrated by the author bragging on how real estate would make money. Based on what? His calculations are seriously flawed to a point that it is not even funny. He assumes one does not need money to maintain his/her house - no money out.I did a simple calculation which assumes $180,000 house with 10% down and 3.25% property tax and 6.5% interest rate on 30 years term. The out of pocket money WITH tax credit will run you up to $1100. If you add lawn mow, cable, water, electricty etc., you know what I am talking about. This is the money down the drain. You house needs to appreciate at least 9% to just break even, and how can the author say 4% appreciation rate would make you money?I give it 3 stars because it does provide some good comments like priorities you need to list out before you buy. It is still a good read on many other topics. I just hope the author can save his sales pitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Relic of the Housing Bubble","review":"This book was not at all what I expected. Instead of dispensing cautionary advice to help the buyer avoid pitfalls, the author devotes much of the book to the most irresponsible sort of encouragement to buy a house almost regardless of the buyer's circumstances. I suppose it may be of some academic interest to future historians documenting the mindset that led to the housing bubble and bust, it is certainly not of any use to anyone buying a house in 2012.

This is my third pair of Clark's this year, same problem. Otherwise, very nice and fashionable. Nice to find dressy, fun shoes in larger shoe size. No more boring and bland with the Clark's styles. The Melanzane color looked more brown on the computer, they are actually purply-reddish color, decided to keep them just for something different. Will definately buy more Clark's in the future.

I disagree with one of the reviews above that the English/Tagalog format creates confusion with the illustrations...it makes perfect sense to me, and I think the illustrations are very well done.

Another reviewer said he fixed this problem by uninstalling and reinstalling the HP software; that didn't work for me. I took off 1 star strictly for this flaw.Outside of that it's been a great printer. Installation was trivial on WinXP Pro SP1 (Athlon 64, lots of RAM and free disk space).

When I wanted to install the software again, because I needed, I put the CD on the CD Room and it started giving me a \\"fatal error\\". I went to the HP web site and downloaded the setup from there. After I installed it, my PC was pretty slow and giving me errors. I wanted to do a system undo and I found that the HP software was updating every day and changed my PC configuration. Then, the printer started asking me to replace the ink. I replace it and installed the software again (thirst time) and now what it prints are codes and errors. ENOUGH!.

I still have not had a reply from them.The software is too large and there is no option to just use the drivers. I find the color isn't up to my other 2 HP printer standards (720C and 1220C), it being quite dull in comparison, and the speed is 0 - sluggish. I timed my first print run and cried and that was using fastNormal. Also, for some reason it would occassionally only print 3 or 10 copies if asked for more (example 70+), not a reliable machine.I have no solutions but had to get this off my chest - buy something \\"anything\\" else.

You can find many errors in almost each chapter. I have to check carefully before I use their examples, equations and solutions. Otherwise I will get embarassed by letting the students pointing it out in my lecture.

I had read Psalms several times and thought this was a great way to dig deeper into the meaning of the individual Psalms. Although the author included some great additional information regarding things such as who wrote the psalm, place it was written, meaning of certain words, circumstances in which it was written, etc, the devotional apsect of it I fould child-like. The questions were not in the least bit thought provoking, rather it was more like filling up space. The daily study begins with asking you to circle certain words that appear over and over throughout that day's Psalm, so you find yourself more concerned with finding the hidden words than you are in understanding what God is trying to show you through the word. I was actually somewhat relieved when the 30 days were over. I reccomend that you just read Psalms, and don't bother with the study."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blessing","review":"I was blessed by this study. It is thirty days worth of Bible study.

Therefore, you'd think it would be lucid, burning and deadly in its aim. Instead, its a loosely cobbled evaluation of his position on various things, and comes to a conclusion that he contradicted himself, made some wooly remarks, and just didn't provide a one size fits all solution to moksha.The only good thing about this book was that it gave a good insight into the starting of the Brahmo Samaj in India, and a bit of an insight into various figureheads such as Ramakrishna etc. Oh, and at $24 is one of the most expensive books per page I've bought.Can't say I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Mr.Lincoln's","review":"This book is about a bad kid and he is a bulie and a teacher whow show's himto be a good person.

Not only is the lamp gorgeous, but the base is sturdy and assembly is easy. Don't look for the lamp couplers as they are actually screwed into the bulb holder base so you must unscrew them during assembly. It is easy to think you are missing these parts. The frosted glass is sylish and elegant and the design is very attractive. You can light the reading light separately or both lights if you need the extra illumination. The reading light takes a maximum of 40 watt bulb and the upper lamp a maximum of 150 watts. The 40 watt is just enough light to read with, although some people might need a few watts brighter--but the receptacle is only rated for 40 watts.

The newer grammar books have more zest and personality that make it easier for a dreamer like me to understand what they mean by an antecedent, or a dangling modifier or nonrestrictive clause. I think you know what I mean.The reason I gave \\"Essentials of English\\" a five-star rating is: when I need and answer to a grammar problem and I can't find it in all of my grammar books, I can always rely on \\"Essentials of English\\" to have my answer. That rates a five-star rating with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good grammar (especially at this price!)","review":"This book offers an excellent basic coverage of English grammar (and includes, almost as an aside, an approach to composition).

Let's say I would not mind paying ... to see this movie second time. The only way I would agree to watch Bourne Identity second time if I would be paid twice of what I paid to see it first time. Why?

These excerpts do not provide any adequate insight into the nature of these mystical texts nor the mystics themselves.

It skims over topics without providing enough exposition on the topics to allow students to have a fair grasp on the subject. This may just be the nature of teaching discrete math, but there seem to be far too many topics that Truss is trying to squeeze into too small of a space. He tries to throw in some more advanced topics such as formal machines and complexity theory, but only at the cost of having the overall quality of the material be watered down.

And I am intensely interested in the subject matter.Hard to believe this thing was made as recently as 1987. To me, it has the feel of a B-movie from the 1940s or even the 30s. Bad writing and bad acting. I admit that I lack that nostalgia thing when it comes to film -- I want my movies all to approach the modern standard of being convincing and realistic. I just have no taste for the hoaky and the contrived. And I expect actors to be nuanced in their performances, not like amateurs in a skit. It just looks very, very old and second rate even for something old. In my opinion, it is nowhere near as convincing or as appealing as, for example, \\"The Waltons,\\" which was a period drama depicting the same era. And they turned out Waltons episodes weekly without -- I am sure -- anything like the budget of this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the history of Ford?","review":"If your a car guy and looking for some detail on the history of the Model T's development look elsewhere. I was expecting some time devoted to Ford's other cars before the T, like the model's K, N, R, and S but I saw none of that. To my mind all the joy of this man's career centered around his Model T. In this movie the Model T, which was developed after many months in the experimental room at Ford's factory, basically appears out of thin air. Henry's son Edsel Ford was a real gentleman who did an awful lot for the company but none of that comes through either. He is portrayed childlike when in reality he was a brilliant executive. This is Ford for a TV audience at the usual 8th grade level. All the good stuff is left out and all the sensationalism is left in. Edited severely and in better hands, with the inclusion of the brilliant job that Edsel's son Henry Ford II did, then maybe the Ford's would of had their due.

In Survivor, once again, you have a middle age male heroin. However, in this novel, things are a little abnormal as instead of trying to save the world from a supernatural phenomenon, he is searching for some kind of inner truth in why he was a survivor of a deadly plane crash. For its time (1976), the concept of the novel was original and reflecting back, I enjoyed the premise. However, I found reading the novel quite taxing and I struggled to finish it. If you enjoy Herbert, try reading the Fog, Shrine, or the Rats trilogy. I enjoyed these novels much more than Survivor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like this one at all","review":"This was a disappointing horror novel by Herbert. Its about a demon on the loose after a plane crash. I didn't like the religious tint to the story and the demon wasn't scary either.

This, followed by hundreds of mediocre sample questions. No exam tactics, study suggestions or mnemonics to speak of.2) It is riddled with typos, errors, and mistakes. Several answers for the practice questions are wrong, too.3) The practice questions are often too easy and there are no explanations for the answers given (although to its credit, it does direct you to the page in the Reference Guide that it refers to -- some of the page numbers, however, are misprints as well).4) It's expensive!

So, if you want this movie on video buy the Vci Entertainment copy and see how great the quality is compared to some real cheaply made, discount dvds for sale.

I tore the TV apart and found a bad capacitor on the power supply board (2200uF 10V DC). I got a high quality replacement cap for $2 and soldered it on, put the TV back together and it works fine.

We have only used this thing in the winter months in our downstairs. After reading some reviews it seems that this is the common issue with this product.

NEVER received a call.I opened up the unit & noticed a slightly \\"ballooned\\" capacitor which is the same one discussed in another of these reviews. Location CE105 which is the electrolytic radial polarized 2200 MFD 10V. I have on order a replacement capacitor & will see if that fixes the problem. I'm ordering a Panasonic 16V thinking that may protect against any slight overvoltages & am also ordering one rated at 7000 hours @105C versus the typical 2000 hour ratings.

I researched it and thought I'd made a very good buy even at $409 (on sale). Yesterday (04/11/09) it died. Now I've done more research in hopes of an easy solution. Turns out this has been a common problem for this model with sets failing usually 1-3 months after the one year anniversary. In addition, it seems that some of the problems I had before it died are also common (HDMI screen troubles that I attributed to cable). One site estimated repairs at $150 to $250 (over and above what I already paid) AND it is still likely to fail due to the way the components are welded together and the fact that one failed part usually affects others, which means future repairs and lost $. If the manufacturer is aware of these problems, they should have a recall.

The father say: \\"You have to do boxing!\\" But Billy isn't a good boxer so he wants to join the ballet school in London.

The language is course, but depicts the tough outspoken people of the mining communites in England and is appropriate in the movie, however parents should be warned. My teens watched the movie and loved it, they don't use bad language and I knew that watching this movie would not cause them to start.

Anyone who has known the pangs associated with being different and not fitting in can relate to this fine movie.I have seen this movie again and again. The poignant ending still makes my eyes water.What makes this movie even more meaningful is that it is based on a real little boy's experience.

It's not just another quirky British comedy, or another boy-defies-father's wishes story.The story has a great message of being yourself, and following your dreams. It's basically saying that no one knows what's best for you except yourself; do whatever makes you happy.Jamie Bell was excellent as the title character--showing an impressive range of emotions. The rest of the cast was superb as well. And an unexpected surprise like Billy's supposed gay friend, just makes the movie more complex and interesting!The ending was memorable as well, but I won't give it away.You won't be disappointed in this movie, even if you're a macho man who's too insecure to think it's okay for boys to dance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BILLY ELLIOTT","review":"A GREAT MOTION PICTURE NOT TO BE MISSED!

Quite a kick in the pants for the older generation of grandparents and parents who were raised in the help wanted men and help wanted women classified ads of their generation. It's more about breaking stereotypes and staying true to your vision than it is about dance steps.

I've since watched Bell in other movies, and he's incredible. This movie is extremely heartwarming. His dad and bro are tough-as-nails coal miners, and Billy likes ballet. No, he lives for it.

About a young lad who is forced to take boxing lessons by his macho father and older brother during the miner strike in England in the early '80's, Billy stumbles into a ballet class...and, well, you can use your own imagination to know the conflicts and emotional roller coaster ride all are invited to enjoy in the films conclusion. One of my favorite films of all times, and have seen the stage musical 60 times/plus over recent years.

Just dont expect anything to be sugar coated, its not that kind of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta dance...","review":"Like \\"The Full Monty,\\" this film is a comic (but in no way belittling) treatment of hard times in a socially-challenged small town. The accents are thick and some of the cultural references are a bit curious, but there's no denying the true heart pumping through the story.*** Billy Elliot is an 11-year-old boy who secretly ditches his boxing lessons for ballet class. His father and older brother are both participants in a bitter miner's strike gripping their town in northeastern England. The whole family is also still in recovery-mode following the death of Billy's mother.*** Billy's exuberance and talent (and actor Jamie Bell's) are such a joy to behold. It makes it all the more poignant when he has to face his dad and brother's discovery of his dancing (as the audience knows they must). Billy is the title hero here, but by the film's end, every character has made their own stunning contributions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, but how can you refuse?","review":"It's not the best art-house movie ever, but gosh it is a lotbetter than so many films.

Although tips are scattered throughout the book, I wish there was a chart in an appendix that outlines suggestions for which foods to start at which age.I agree with Joachim and Christine that children should enjoy meals with their parents, eating age-appropriate versions of what is prepared for the whole family.

I have had the priviledge of having Mr. Derbyshire work in my Department at a Wall Street firm allowing him to write his novel at the office. What has John done? He has put together a masterful novel of a Chinese immigrant who comes to this country with his Chinese wife and as many of us do, fantasizes about a former girlfriend who has also immigrated to this country. Unlike many of us husbands, he visits her. He then weaves in the 30th president of the United States who helps preserve his marriage. It should be noted that Mr. Derbyshire is English, went to China to teach and fell in love with and married one of his students. He does have a genuine fondness for Mr. Coolidge. We have debated to what extent the book is autobiographical, which he vehemetly denies although his wife hates the book. So be it. If you want a good, thoughtful read, try this acclaimed book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Novel","review":"Seeing Calvin Coolidge in a Dream is a fine work, quite amazing in weaving together such different strands as the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the pain of regret and lost love, the terse, no-nonsense wisdom of a vastly underrated President and individual, and the question of making moral choices. A book very deliberately against the modern grain. In short, just what we need in an age when art so often fails to elevate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"A delightful little novel about an Chinese immigrant who comes to idolize Calvin Coolidge. The author manages to portray a character who is quirky but eminently human, eccentric but likable.

A bright yellow piece of paper informed us that as US customers we could not purchase larvae, instead we had to purchase live bugs. This completely defeats the purpose of this product.I take umbrage at the packaging promising one thing and the product delivering something different.

I was surprised to find that printing isn't addressed until page 147. The section on printing amounted to 10 pages in total, out of 160 pages in the book. The title of the book should be \\"Black and White Digital Photography\\" -- the word \\"Printing\\" doesn't belong in the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"To anyone really interested in Digital Black & White Printing, this book will disappoint in two crucial areas. Firstly, the information generated is too superficial and vague to really benefit someone trying to learn and secondly, most of the images displyed are of poor quality. Instead of leaping out at you and making you wish you could have created something equally nice, most of these images leave you feeling that maybe your childhood snapshots were not so bad afterall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very useful book","review":"I do not recommend this book to anyone who has more than very basic knowledge of the computerized digital process.

I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book I was Looking For","review":"This is an excellent \\"how-to\\" book for making the transition to digital black-and-white photography. Unlike Photoshop books, it is not so much organized around tools as around the different attributes of a black and white print that the photographer and print maker wishes to control. The book gives a clear explanation, with examples, of each attribute and how to use the tools in Photoshop to control that attribute. I'm an amateur black and white photographer with about 20 years of experience in the darkroom, but I think the book would also be accessible for someone just starting to learn about black and white photography and printing."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books on digital black and white photography","review":"I've seen many of the books covering digital black and white photograhy and I think this is one of the best. The approach is straightforward and there are lots of good examples.

The explanations are usually confusing, either because they are too dry or too verbose. If examples/derivations are included they are rarely practical and one tends to wonder at the author's reasoning for choosing those. I often find myself only using the textbooks to work the homework problems, and base almost all my knowledge on class notes.This text is a welcome deviation from the standard: I have found it extremely easy to understand and follow. There are numerous examples and derivations, and I have referred to them more than once to gain familiarity with the topic. The book became my friend and ally; a priceless resource for the class. My course has only gone through chapter 13, but all the chapters that we covered were written well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Textbook of Mechanics","review":"Taylor simply did a marvelous job in writing this book. Users will find Taylor's wry sense of humor solving hard problems that he assigned in this book. This book pretty much covers all important concepts of undergraduate mechanics.

I will be using this book for my GRE preparation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylor writes great textbooks!","review":"Very well written, and full of instructive problem sets.Problems like \\"Use X to Prove A.

It is the first of its kind to follow the lives of Chinese-American women from the late 1800s when Congress placed strict regulations on Chinese immigration through the War Years. Compared to most history texts, I found the writing accessible and the stories intriguing. I do not consider myself a feminist, and I get annoyed when textbooks about women's history go preachy about their subject matter, and this book avoids that, maintaining academic distance without being remote in tone. This is a book I will actually probably keep after the course has ended because it sheds light on a minority group not often considered in the context of oppressed minorities, and does so in a way that leaves a lasting impression without putting the reader to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational AND Fun!","review":"At first the size of the book was a bit daunting, but I found myself sucked into the lives of the Chinese women as they navigated through American society.

This author spent half of his time preaching that Jesus was not the Son of God, and the other half preaching that a lot is lost in the translation. There was absolutely no real insight into anything. There is nothing worth reading in this book, and after I finished reading it, I promptly threw it into the trash. Frankly, I learned more about the Jewish faith by reading books that were written by Dr. Scott Hahn - who happens to be a Catholic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but lacking in useful details","review":"I looked forward to reading this book but am left with the feeling its more of a sophomoric essay than a useful guide to interpretation of the gospels. Its repetitive in its statements of evidence that the scriptures were of Hebrew origin, using the tried-and-true 'and this fellow said it was and so did that fellow...'. It has only a few examples that it repeats across several chapters.

He can relate to so many of the characters (especially the michievous ones), and the CD has now become a nighttime favorite.

However, the actress reading it delivers the worst performance of a children's book I've ever heard. For reasons known only to her and her director, she chose to voice Austine as a geriatric New York male with a learning disability. Every time Austine spoke, it completely ruined the book for my family. Even my KIDS noticed how incongruous the voice of Austine was: \\"Mommy, why does Austine sound like an old man? What's wrong with her?\\" Truly, truly awful. So be warned -- a fabulous story, a horrific read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute","review":"Ellen is so adorable, and it is always nice to re-visit with her story.Cleary is a classic and truly is able to grasp the terribleness that follows growing up.

Falling Underwear","review":"My third grade class read this book together about a million years ago. Oddly enough, two of us were named Ellen in the class, and we certainly got teased! It's a terrific book about an unusual, yet average, little girl. I love how Ms. Cleary creates a heroine who is at once awkward, shy, and opinionated, and has a wonderful temper. Her tendency to stretch the truth brings unexpectedly hilarious results.I still have my tattered 1973 (?) copy (yikes!) and am considering purchasing a copy for my young nieces. It teaches some lovely lessons about friendship and about individuality in the face of peer pressure (hopefully I'm not reading too much into the book, but I don't think so). Most important, however, it is truly funny. I still have a vivid picture in my mind of the skinny Ellen leaping like a falling leaf in ballet while clutching at her slipping underwear. Leap and clutch....leap and clutch... And who could forget the monkey dress and her first horseback ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"Shy eight-year-old Ellen's life is filled with daily traumas, from being forced to wear itchy, bunch long underwear beneath her tutu to dance class, to longing for her teacher to select her to clap erasers.

Although she's fresh from California, the two girls have a lot in common (including the dreaded long underwear!) With Austine, Ellen is more confident, and happier than she's ever been before.

Starting the cd with Alfie was a touch of genius. Next to Theme from Valley of the Dolls, Alfie holds my heart. Isley did it and he did it magnificently.

The story contained the well-thought out plot, quirky humor between Ed and Roy, and the ICness of a well-written fanfiction based at a young age group.I picked up this one, and not the third, because it contained a lot more of the military in the plot, which I enjoy in FMA works. It still bothers me how the characters never even threaten someone's life in even the direst of situations, but I suppose it makes it suitable for a varying age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sub-Adequate- a bit outdated.","review":"This was the first review book I purchased and have purchased additional resouces.

In each case, there's a color photograph followed by a one page description of a tree. Some are famous because they're connected with a historic event (as in the Bell County Charter Oak, under which the county's first election was held) or personage (there's the Houston pecan, for example, planted by Sam Houston himself in 1847). Some served as meeting places, landmarks or hanging trees for years. Still others are included because of their size.Recently some famous Texas trees have been damaged or died. This book, which has gone through three editions, is a useful tool for people interested in trees and the roles they play in our lives. I'd like to see there be a companion Web site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice sheet, not durable.","review":"I have purchased 2 top sheets and one fitted, king size white.

I used them almost all the time and except for the shrinkage other people noted, I LOVE them. They have stayed as soft as butter and it's almost obscene to crawl into bed and night and be cuddled by the softness. Since they don't fit the Sleep Number bed we have now, I just put the fitted sheet on the pillow top. It works.

I duplicated the effect someone was complaining about, where it hums, and just like him I could \\"null out\\" the hum just at one position of the output control -- but that's with *nothing plugged into the input of the preamp*. When I plugged a condenser mic in, with the 48v *off*, which I assume makes the mic a low impedance into the input, there was no hum at any level. When I turned the 48V on (after *of course* lowering both volume levels to zero), the hum was still absent, with both volume levels at max. ... Good-enough for me! ...

It also works as a great direct box, with the added tube pre making you sound great.This is easily the most well spent $30 for ANY piece of equipment in my entire sound equipment set up.

I like the way it is organized by color. It also has great info on their growth habit (ie, whether they get to their ultimate size quickly or slowly) and how to site the yellows for maximum color by telling how they form the yellow pigmentation, which is how much chlorophyll they inhibit. I also like how they tell you what hostas are similar. As any hosta afficionado knows,there are many hostas that are similar, so if you can't get the one you want you can try to find a similar one. The pictures are good, but as with any hosta photos it is hard to tell size from a photo alone, so you will have to read the narrative. If there is one hosta book you need, I think this is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"an informative work but not an encyclopedia","review":"The author makes a concerted effort to bring to you the vast numbers of hostas available today in a concise way. The book is designed to assist you in finding the hosta that best suites your needs. It does not meet the definition of an Encyclopedia, the species and cultivars are not arranged alphabetically, however in alphabetical order by the way they look, an informative work but not an encyclopedia. So the name of the book is yet another marketing ploy. For me, I can only use the book by way of index. It does have some information that's hard to find elsewhere. They make a darn good hit at getting info on some of the best hostas available and some that are barely available. It is not a five star book but it is a solid four star. The pictures woo the ladies but men want content, we know that a hosta may only look that way for one week in spring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hostas, a bargain","review":"This book is a valuable asset for every Hosta collector.

Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is awful","review":"I am embarrassed that I bought this book. It is full of typos and grammatical errors. There is a least one of each on every page. The book is almost entirely the opinions of the author, and when a story involves multiple names, they are often mixed up. The very beginning of the chapter on the James Bulger murder mixes up the names of the two murderers calling them \\"Jon Thomson and Robert Venables\\" only to switch it back for the rest of the chapter. One chapter mentions a person, aged 22 and then on the very next page refers to them as the missing baby in the case. This book is a joke and I only gave it one star because there was no option for zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"No wonder the author didn't put his name on this book.

Now I know what happens to people who don't make it through English 100. They write unsigned books like this one.Besides the problems already mentioned, the language is muddy, the research is shoddy, and the typos are startling. For example, Thomas Wainewright must have the longest criminal career in history. He poisoned his uncle in 1828. He then poisoned his wife's half-sister in 1930.The isssue of plagarism was already mentioned, but no one noted the author's habit of plagarising from himself. Often the same facts (and the same sentences) are repeated verbatim.At best, this is a weak first draft.

You can learn a lot while you see it cause no one can imagine all the (cruel) details of the execution process.I liked the way the characters are presented, they are notstereotype Hollywood figures but it seems like this movie really shows the true story of sister Helen and Matt without trying to make it nicer for the audience and without giving it a happy ending. Furthermore, the movie is really touching and I can't understand those people who watch it and still don't see that death penalty is no solution and does no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching to the Choir","review":"This entire book can be summed up by a look at the index. There is an entry under \\"death penalty -- arguments against\\" but no entry under \\"death penalty -- arguments for\\".

This book was presented to me by someone who disagreed with me, who thought that reading it might change my mind. It hasn't. Sister Helen is obviously a very dedicated individual and I commend her for her passion and respect her views, like I do anyone else's, but I feel that she is simply wasting her precious time with these inmates, time that could better be spent with children to ensure that they themselves don't wind up on death row one day. These vile, inhumane creatures chose to do what they did, so let them suffer the consequences. If one of the consequences is death, so be it. If they are prepared to take someone else's life, then they should pay with their own, and it is about time that the rights of the innocent victims of crime and potential victims are placed ahead of the predators."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"What makes this book so intense is that you know it's real. It is well written, descriptive without being overbearing and detatched enough to give you a fair perspective. The movie runs along similar lines as the book, except the method of execution, and the book delves into far more detail, as you would expect. Although an anti-death penalty activist, Helen Prejean has not written a anti-death penalty book. It's a straightforward narrative that draws the reader in and doesn't let go. She is a very talented lady and you feel a huge respect for what she does. Very compelling reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awakening of the Conscience","review":"When I started reading this book some years ago, I was staunchly for the death penalty. On the other side, I was staunchly opposed. Such is the power and vibrancy of Helen Prejean's writing. She takes you inside the prison walls, inside the mind of the men who commit these desperate acts, the lives they've destroyed by these acts, and the long trek out of the dark night of evil. For some, the journey ends in forgiveness, for others in a hatred and an emptiness. This book will make this sort of crime and punishment real to anyone that reads it, and whatever opinion formed afterwards will be a better-informed one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more powerful than the movie","review":"I started reading this book one night, and couldn't put it down for hours. It's full of information, and really makes you think, no matter what your point of view. It's also very moving; some parts brought me to tears. Although I saw the movie a couple of years ago, it had much less effect on me than the book did. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats the Dignity in the Death Penalty?","review":"Today, I heard Sister Prejean speak about her book Dead Man Walking and about all of the experiances that shes been through concerning the death penalty. Nothing less than amazing. Dead Man Walking calls upon the unjustices in the death penalty but also on the actual death penalty victims. Many people think that death penalty victims are just plain bad people. Read this book. If you want to be challenged on your views, read this book. You can't be idle on the death penalty. Also, coming soon is the Death of Innocence. Sister Prejean spoke on the content of this book and the stories within it. Once again, nothing less than amazing. A story that is priceless to hear and will influence your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"My mind has change","review":"I remember when a guy in Nebraska went to death roll and was killed.

The journal has different sections for you to list what books you want to read, favorite passages and more. But unfortunately every page is identical with a T-chart-like format, which gives you little space to write. For instance, if you're to write a favorite passage, the space to write the title of the book is the same width as the space allowed for the passage. Are you supposed to abbreviate?

Here we have an interpretation of Paul's letters as many early leaders viewed them. Paul's praise of female church leaders is affirmed rather than corrected: \\"even today women deaconesses in the east are known to minister to their own sex in baptism, or in the ministry of the Word\\". (p. 150-151) Freedom is upheld as a Christian value, not deplored as a sin. Basically, Pelagius sounds far more like a modern Christian than his detractors. He is also more in tune with the expansive spirit of primitive Christianity.-author of Correcting Jesus"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you buy 1 wrapping book... this is NOT it, but great part of collection","review":"As others have said, this shows beautiful packages but gives no instructions on how to execute them.

The packaging is unique and fun. If you already own some of the seasons, then I would suggest just going ahead and buying the remaining seasons. The only added extra is the collective packaging and the book, but fans of the series will really love those additions.The only thing that stopped me from giving the product 5-stars was the design of the DVD holders. It is very flimsy, and one of the cases broke on the inside, so I have to be careful whenever I move the whole set. I have to add that it broke before it got to me, so I don't know what kind of force it takes to break it. A good experience overall though."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy on amazon","review":"do not buy this series from amazon. way way way overpriced! even the cheapest seller overcharges. i just bought this same set from eBay for $70 brand new"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"When I ordered my item it was immediately shipped the next day, which was impressive. However, when I received the product I was not impressed at all. The item I purchased was labelled as new, I have my doubts on this and suspect that it may have just been re-packaged. The disks had a number of scratches on most of them, it is unplayable. Even after purchasing items to repair the DVD's they still don't work. For the price I paid for this item, I am extremely unimpressed. The only good part of my order was that I received it in a timely manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Quality and Shameful Support","review":"FIRST AND FOREMOST: The content is spectacular, as you probably know. The package is terrific, with a high quality booklet with character studies and background art.THAT SAID: Several of the discs don't work -- they freeze, stall or don't load. I tried my computer, my cheap dvd, and a friend's top-of-the-line Denon. The vendor replaced it once cheerfully, then refused to do so again [did offer refund]. Warner Bros videos sent me a blow-off reply saying they didn't manufacture it and didn't sell it, so they won't support it. The manufacturer? Who knows and who can tell. It's not listed.AND OF COURSE: My favorite episodes are on discs that don't work on either of the two packages I have.IT MAY BE WORTH A TRY: But be ready to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"When I first set out to find this item, there were several prices that were pleasing, but still a little out of my price range for the time being.

I have owned individual volumes of the series but had not bought them all. So, I jumped at the chance to get the series all in one set of packaging. The packaging is the nicest I have seen for any DVD set I have owned. First, there is the slip cover picturing Batman swinging. Underneath is a long black box with a cool Batman silhouette ingrained on the left side. Inside the box are 2 thick plastic cases. Each case is the length and width of any normal DVD case. The width is thicker though as 8 DVDs are contained in each case. Inside the case, you can flip through to the DVD you want to watch. The DVDs are well-protected. No worries about damaged DVDs with online orders. The set also includes a volume index with drawings and artwork at the end to enjoy as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"This was one of my favorite shows growing up as a child in the 90s, I looked forward to watching every Sunday night, and followed it even when it changed time slots and networks. The animation was superb, the script immaculate...you didn't have to be child or a fan of Batman to appreciate it. I remember when it did debut originally in Primetime on Fox, it was like an even in my household--Dad, Mom, my siblings--the show was just that good.They stopped showing it on Disney's cartoon network (or at least maybe it moved from the 7-8 time slot on Sunday nights that I managed to catch it on), so I broke down earlier this year and just got the bundle that Amazon was offering when it lowered for about $85. I still plan on buying this one as well, I can't resist with all the additional extras.

You become a Santelli. You become an aerialist. Do not let the length of the book keep you from enjoying this story, its one that may very well change your life as it has mine. It will be a book that I continue to compare other books to for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving love story","review":"I read this long ago and I had been hoping to buy it again for my kindle. It tells the story of two young men who grew up together in circus families. The closeness of the families and the circus community and the way these young people had to balance family expectations, the society of the times and their love for each other has kept this book in my memory for a long time. I am glad to own it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I plan on making this a movie one day!!!","review":"Imagine reading a book, that seems to be based off you. I have never found such a great read. I am Tommy, and Matt. Marion Zimmer Bradley, I would like to thank you for living your dream of writing. The Catch Trap is an honest, loving, tender, and cruel reality of the love of two men. All under one tent. I would also like to give thanks to my Dark Knight for sharing this work of art with me. I know now, that I can move on, and that I can achieve my dream. Thank you for opening up my eyes, to the both of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"MZB fanatic begs to disagree","review":"I can't believe the reviews I just read. I'm a Marion Zimmer Bradley fanatic -- AND a lesbian, so don't think it was the theme that threw me -- and I HATED \\"The Catch Trap\\". It's one of the four worst books I've ever read (the other three being \\"Sar\\", \\"Unbalanced\\" by Lass Small, and all that \\"Magic's Prattle\\" garbage by Mercedes Lackey). If you like lots of badly written melodrama and angst, this book is for you. Two closeted gay men who happen to be circus performers stagger around feeling tortured because they scarcely dare love each other. This doesn't even succeed as soft porn. Bad, bad, bad. Go read \\"Mists of Avalon\\" or \\"The Shattered Chain\\" to get the taste of this awful, awful novel out of your mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Trite, Smarmy and Forgettable","review":"As a gay man, I really looked forward to \\"The Catch Trap\\" as one of the few love stories that would really speak to me. Instead, I found a book full of unbelievably shallow and sacharine characters with little to no appeal.Aside from the circus setting, I found the two main characters so stereotypically sappy as to be laughable in all the wrong places. I felt insulted at every turn of the page as the two boys/men toggled between love and hatred of themselves and each other.Admittedly, I'm no fan of Bradley's writing, and \\"The Catch Trap\\" is the perfect example of why. While I understand from many a friend I've discussed this with that I'm of a minority opinion here, I can't help but recommend that this book NOT be read...by anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The epitome of gay love stories.","review":"The circus milieu is fresh and fascinating, the central love story is rich and fully realized, and the sense of history revealed is remarkable. While many readers may disagree with some of the \\"political\\" points made about homosexuality and its place in a conformist society (as I did), the cumulative effect of this heartfelt and meticulously developed tale is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly absorbing read","review":"Well, I have to admit-- I loved this book. I've been an MZB fan for years, but recently have read her work out of nostalgia more than anything else. I came across this book totally by chance, and was amazed that I'd never heard of it (having read everything else she's ever written). It reminded me why I have always liked MZB, despite her sometimes awkward or inconsistent writing style-- she creates such memorable characters, ones that seem to linger in the mind long after the book is finished. I have to admit that I think this is probably a book about gay men written for women, but I thought she handled the kinds of negotiations and compromise necessary during the Cold War era convincingly and with empathy. I think this would be an especially good book for teens to read-- if you can't empathize with these guys, you're not human."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most touching stories I have ever read.","review":"I ordered this book through Amazon just because it had a gay theme. What I received two days later was a masterpiece. From the opening to paragraph to the climactic end, I was entranced. I never believed I would ever read a book that I literally could not put down, but this book...There were nights that I was up until 8:00 the next morning, and I hadn't even realized it had been that long. The touching and dramatic story of Tommy and Mario as they flew through the air and into each other's hearts quickly became my favorite novel. I was desperate when I finished to actually go to the circus. The plot is so centered, the characters so defined, and the story so entrancing, I found myself buying copies for friends I knew. This is truly a wonderful piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book...","review":"Before I read this book, I never knew what to say when people asked me what my favorite book was. Now, I never have to think about it...this is definitely my favorite book. I liked it better than The Mists of Avalon, and that's high praise. If anyone ever wondered what Marion Zimmer Bradley might be like in a non-historical or -fantasy book, this is it. It is the same wonderful writing style applied to a more modern set of circumstances, a close-knit, Italian family of trapeeze artists in the 1940's. The characters are so vivid that I always forget that they are not real... I speak of them to friends as though they were real people, using their emotions to describe my own.PS - If you have enough self-control, don't read the back or the front of the book until after you've gotten at least two hundred pages in. I would give a lot for some of the things in that book to be a suprise to me, and I hate it that I threw away the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favourites","review":"This book is certainly one of the best books I have ever read -- and I have read it at least 3 times. Zimmer Bradley really did her homework. The atmosphere in the book is beautifully depicted. You can almost smell the circus. You are drawn into the story, unable to put the book down.The love story between Tommy and Mario/Matt is essential, yet Zimmer Bradley manages to tell a gay love story in a way that appeals to everybody (who is without predjudices, that is of course). Longing, the difficulties of growing up, beauty, ambition, loss and sacrifices that need to be made mix together and really make you suffer and \\"live\\" with the characters.I was 14 when I first read the book, and still now, at the age of 25, I love it.The German translation is very good as well, by the way :-)."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"i originally read this years ago, and was surprised last year that it was as moving as i remembered. this certainly gave me a glimpse into the pressures faced by gays during this time period -- how much have things changed? one of the things that might make people pause is the age difference between tommy & mario (7yrs) -- but if it had been tammy & mario, would anyone ask questions? anyone else looking for a sequel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic pre-rpg","review":"Fun for uncertain reasons, other than it was the best RPG you could get at the time. Finally out of the dungeons and into the open air. Somewhat of a 3-D feel; but it wasn't, that is an illusion. The vault of a dungeon replaced by a just as immovable tree or body of water. The mapping system is great. The story is almost incomprehensible garbage. Incredibly, incredibly difficult to complete -- they want you to play this thing forever.But it's still fun to have a party and increase their strength through experience -- and the dialogue system?! You get to type in actual questions if you want! No matter that it doesn't work most of the time, unless you mention a triggering word or phrase. It's still what I want in a dialogue system: to be able to ask whatever I want, not to have things pre-selected for me.Final word: as games of this type go, Might and Magic is what you want to buy, but still, the Wizardry titles are not so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emmanuelle Trilogy Censored","review":"These movies have been censored - which are a shame.

The chocolate color bowl is much smaller than the cereal bowls, I don't know why they advertise one thing and send out another, but I've noticed other reviews say the same thing.Since those reviews are no longer here, I assume they just relist to get fresh reviews.

I really love her Southern charm and lack of pretense. The recipes in this book are simple and use ingredients you already have in your kitchen, which appeals to me. The book is in a binder so it stays open easily while you follow the recipe.

This is typical Paula fare - southern cooking that is easy, tastes good, and relatively quick-cooking. It's comfort food. Her recipes are adaptable for a low-fat diet - I know because I do it. If you're the type that considers yourself too refined for this style of food or cooking, then this book is a waste of your time and money. If you're a laid-back person who likes food that is low on the fuss factor, uses ingredients that are easily accessible and don't cost a fortune, and typically taste great, this is a great addition to the collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the lady & sons, too","review":"looking through this book, it was not if I was going to use a receipe but where to start.

I'll be donating or selling it somewhere -- I've just spent half an hour browsing it, and honestly have not found a single recipe I'd want to try. Many sound just like recipes from the Junior League cookbooks that I've owned for 25 years.If you want to try some \\"old-fashioned home cookin',\\" this may have some recipes you'll like.

Garlthick one-eye, a relatively well known character in the earthdawn world, is also a major character in this book.I rated it a '4' because it the typical novel based on game/rpg and as such its not ground breaking best selling fiction but for what it is i thought it was very good and adds alot of depth to how exactly earthdawn characters are driven by their discipline.

At 90% off, Monster still made money.For example, I purchased the top of the line Z series, and the picture quality WAS THE SAME AS THE PACK IN CABLES. No difference whatsoever.Only place where cables made a difference was with audio.

Kids out cow tipping one night discover a dead cow. Soon there are others. The new local vet gets called in to look at the mysterious deaths. He can not see any problem until what looks like a normal parasite comes in contact with a drop of his blood. It grows and he sends it of for testing.Soon the vet is convinced that something is very wrong and the cattle should be quarantined, an idea not met with much approval by the locals. Unfortunately the vet has a reputation for yelling fire prematurely.The plot develops nicely and the suspense builds steadily. Effects and acting are better than most. The ending leaves a little unanswered but most won't notice it. All in all it was a very nice tribute to the great monster films of a few decades ago. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I really enjoyed Ganster High.

I found many irregularities and inconsistencies e.g. Johnny supposedly bought his flight ticket to Amsterdam in the United Kingdom and yet the price was given in Dollars ($90), suggesting that the author was unaware/ignorant of the local currency in that country (Pounds Sterling).The author claims that this is a travel novel about Amsterdam and yet he gives no insight into best tourist attractions etc. The novel focuses mainly on Johnny's obsession with women and gives the impression that he is completely socially inept.In my opinion this novel is best avoided as it gives no useful information about traveling in Amsterdam and focuses on relationships with women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"This novel was a major let down; it promised so much and delivered so little. This poorly written book focused on the inane ramblings and unrealistic romantic fantasies of a lonesome traveller (Johnny) in the Netherlands. The story was very frustrating as it became very repetitive and predictable. The general theme is Johnny meets a girl, attempts to seduce her, fails and moves on to the next girl using the same strategy and so on. There were some distasteful anti-Semitic views displayed by some of the characters. Johnny did little to dispel them and seemed almost to endorse them. In my opinion this could offend some readers.This novel was a real disappointment and certainly not one I would recommend to other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way below par","review":"As travel novels go, this was one of the worst I've read. The story line was predictable and boring with very little action to entertain the reader. After the first chapter I became bored with the constant inane dialogue from Johnny, the main character. I found Johnny a very irritating character, completely lacking in both culture and manners. Johnny spent most of his time forcing himself onto the local girls in the desperate hope that he could lure one into bed. The characters in general were unrealistic and readily divulged personal secrets to strangers. In reality it is very rare for anyone to tell a complete stranger such personal information.I found many errors e.g. street names in Dutch cities given fallacious names and basic typos such as one discovered by the first reviewer i.e. \\"the music backend me\\".I think that most readers will find this novel a terrible bore, therefore its better left on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"The novel was a total disappointment! It was not insightful at all. The grammar and sentence structure was very poor, for example, the novel included sentences that started with: And! It also lacked direction and just drifted from one silly sexual encounter to the next. There was no story-line or plot. I think that the book misrepresents the typical American tourist. The life of the main character, Johnny seems to be based on the fantasies of a frustrated virgin. The story has messages within it that portray American's as being anti-semitic, which is clearly offensive. I welcome free speech, but I must warn potential readers that this book is probably going to be a very annoying read. I think it is best avoided. It is certainly not a travel guide. It seems as though the author does not even own a passport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"As travel novels go, this was one of the worst I've read.

After reading the first couple of chapters I realised that this novel was going nowhere and gave no useful information for the prospective traveller in Holland, instead it focused on the main character, Johnny, and his relationship with various women.I found Johnny a dislikeable character, lacking in basic social skills and culture with some extreme religious views. One reviewer implied that Johnny was typical of an American tourist. I totally repudiate this view as I have yet to meet an American who has any of the characteristics of Johnny.If you're hoping to visit the Holland in the near future and would like to get an impression of what its like before you go, then steer well clear of this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful!","review":"This was the worst travel novel I've ever read. There was very little information about the Netherlands or Amsterdam, instead the novel focused on a series of puerile sexual encounters, based on the prurient fantasies of Kim.The main character, Johnny, came across as an uncultured idiot with an annoying propensity for being 'preachy' and overbearing. The storyline was very predictable and there were no twists and turns to keep the reader enthralled.

All of the characters in this book have a story. Slim's graphic details put you right on the roller coaster with them. At first I was a little taken aback by his language because you begin to wonder if it's necessary but as I read on, I realized it is totally necessary! It's one of the things that makes this story so tangible. His descriptiveness also makes it a easy to picture the rooms, the houses, the alleyways and the people and dramas that take place there. I judge a book on many things but one of the most important is whether or not I feel attached to the characters once I finish it; the same way I do when I watch an outstanding film. Doom Fox was definitely one of those books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doom Fox","review":"This book was too cold even for Iceberg Slim.

Seems to me to be in an extremely unfinished state; the dialogue is bizarre. Not bizarre in the \\"ebonics\\" manner that \\"Pimp\\" was in, but dialogue the likes of which nobody really speaks in. I can't tell if he wrote it out in what he considered educated english (in a way it is just that), or his idea was to write the story as a sketch wherin the protagonists have really pronounced argots; later changing it to be more realistic.While his classic \\"Pimp\\" wasn't exactly what you'd call a cheerful book, this one was positively bleak in its misanthropic outlook. As a novel, it is a complete failure, but the depths he plumbs in this one (exploring his misogyny via what is apparently the story of his childhood), and the fact that it is Iceberg Slim's work, make it worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiesta forever!","review":"Titles says it all!Sturdy, colorful, proportionally correct... most of my dishes are Fiesta, had them for years and haven't (knock on wood) broken a single one!Quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I could watch Christmas movies year-round.

Usually they start out and the expectations are dashed along the way with foul language, sex scenes and unnecessary violence. As the movie moved along at a nice comfortable pace (not hyper like most movies made in the USA) the story became even more engaging.

When installed, you can only pull up on the parking brake about 1 or 2 clicks (not really enough to engage it). If you accidentally pull up too much, the screws break through the plastic (washers would probably fix that problem). But also, the holders are not really wide and deep enough to hold much more than a 12oz can.

I was also curious about the relationship of violence in regards to feminism and the new \\"Sheroes\\" of pop culture such as Buffy, The Bride from Kill Bill and other mentions (Alias, Catwoman, etc.) but they were lightly (and I'm talking a few, faint sentences) touched upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll need 6","review":"Since they last about 3 months before the piezo electric igniter quits snapping properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads Like A Bad Textbook....Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This one is a looser...reading it made me feel like eating hard-boiled cork.

Also, the witch never seems to regret her previous pattern of coldly killing innocent sailors, not to \\"love\\" them below the sea, but just to kill them.The \\"love\\" between the sailor and the sea witch is very superficial---they \\"love\\" each other's eyes. To counter a culture which overemphasizes appearances, I look for stories in which people have deeper qualities to love, such as kindness.I feel I wasted my money on this book, which I will not keep in our school collection.

Of course you can't blame him, I doubt he writes most of the songs he sings. If you wanna hear some REAL country, go pick up an album by HANK III, LUCINDA WILLIAMS, MIKE NESS, or any of the old classics like Patsy Cline or Johnny Cash.

Bland drivel is the only word I can think of to describe this album. I don't mean to bash TK fans who say it is a good album. That is their opinion, but they cannot convince me that this album with idiotic lyrics is a Country album and a good one.

One guy says \\"all country music sounds the same\\". How about the so-called \\"rap music\\"? THAT all sounds the same. Want Hateful? How about rapper Ghostface Killah? Do you know what a \\"ghostface\\" is? Yep, that's YOU, White Boy. I see no reviews for his CD's calling HIM hateful.The bottom line is that this is a great CD of well-written, well-performed music, sung from the heart.

To capitalize on something so awful is barbaric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"More contrived marketable product masquerading as country music.

(and I'm a DIE-HARD Bush-loving conservative)","review":"The problem is that Toby Keith really doesn't have that much talent and his idiotic lyrics are more comical than anything else. His music is grossly overplayed and annoying. Any self respecting country artist would not have recorded 'Who's Your Daddy?' and here it only gets worse. I'm tired of beer/bar songs and cheesy patriotic songs. Patriotic songs can be done well (Proud to be an American, Where were you?, Have you forgotten?) and they can be total crap (anything Toby has written). I have never figured out his recent surge in popularity. Do me a favor and listen to Rachel Proctor, Brad Paisley (a TRUE country artist), Amy Dalley, and Sara Evans. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced to listen...and it hurt.","review":"I was forced to listen to this album, before I bought it as a gift for a relative. Please don't tell me that THIS is what we're becoming (or have, God forbid, have already become).

It has a spirit to it, but not a positive spirit, to be sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking advantage of the current US situation!","review":"I used to be a big Toby Keith fan. Until I started noticing a lot of his songs were about the war and soliders. After a while they all sounded the same and it seemed like he was taking advantage of the current US situation to make more $$$. As a wife of solider, this really turns me off.

I think this reflects where Toby is in his life right now (at least according to bios I have seen of Toby). I am sure this won't be a \\"classic,\\" nor is it a showcase of Toby's best talents. However, it is fun and is best listened to while having a few beers with friends.As an aside -- I think the trend of blocking the ability to rip CDs is really stupid. People have made copiesd of music for years (remember cassettes?), and it just now is such a big concern? What if I happen to own an MP3 player and would like to take some of these songs with me running -- or perhaps I would like to have a copy of the CD for use in my car so I don't worry about beating up my original while driving? I think it is time record companies get more input from thier CONSUMERS and see what we expect.

Over the years he has not only recorded, but also written 12 of his 16 #1 hits. His lyrics are awesome. The upbeat pace and catchy tunes in his music are enjoyable to listen to. The meanings and messages he conveys through his songs are compelling. He speaks his mind yet respects society. He is patriotic and likes to have fun. His music has such diversity. His records have edge and attitude. Most of all he is a great storyteller. His latest album SHOCK' N Y'ALL is awesome. It compiles humor and insight.

I mean it was them arabs that attacked us and Toby tells us what to do; put our big, 8-toed foot filled, boots up there ass!!!

Clint Black, Dixie Chicks, Trisha Yearwood and of course all the \\"oldies\\".This one. Dunno. Don't know how anyone with half a brain can honestly say this is a good album. Politically correct or not. Just read the lyrics to eg. The Taliban Song. Just read them. That has to be the single most stupid set of lyrics I've ever read!Unfortunately the rest of the album's not much better.Guess quality is not the norm anymore if major labels can be convinced to issue garbage like this.

Not only is the music horrendous, but his message is one of hate, intolerance, and violence. The same conservatives who bash the tv for it's violence, embrace this truly evil man with a passion. Go listen to music with a positive message, such as anti-flag, thought riot, or minor threat. At least when you're sXe, you aren't smoking \\"weed with willie\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty and Malicious!","review":"Toby's songs kind of take on his personality i.e. malicious and angry! I am not sure why he had such a change in personality. I think after the song \\"How Do You Like Me Now?\\" he became very bitter for some reason. His music style has changed since then, and I don't like it. His music has no \\"heart\\" and no feeling. They are just meaningless words set to music. \\"we have boozers\\"??? what is that about? How about some real songs Toby? This is album lacks any substance. Not good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, folks this is garbage","review":"Save your money folks this is more garbage of the oversized ego of Toby's being let loose. The guy sure doesn't have class that's for sure. More of the same macho, commerical, novelity songs from Toby that he has been spitting out for a few years now. Trust me these are not what you call classic country songs that make a impact and will be remember 20 years later. They are throwaway songs that are best forgotten. Toby is crude sometimes in his songs and he defintley needs to get over himself. Save your money its not worth it and with the way radio overplays this overrated artist you will be hearing them anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorant American","review":"I don't like any songs on the album. I find track 11 quite 'shocking'. Stupid and ignorant. It is about prejudice against other people's cultures and religions and bombing countries. Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks who criticised his 'Angry American' Song was right when she said it made Country music sound ignorant. With his Taliban Song, TK definitely makes Country music sound ignorant and helps reinforce the idea that it is conservative and narrow-minded in many people's minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH!!!","review":"I wish you could give negative stars, but oh well. This album stinks! Lame lyrics, awful singing, run-of-the-mill production...it's just an all-around bomb! Toby can't fool the fans for much longer. I think his gravy train is about to go off the tracks. But you know as soon as he loses popularity, some other country chump will take his place. Boy, I really hate this type of music. It's a slap in the face to the classic stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace To White Americans","review":"First it was slave owners and the KKK that gave white america a bad name. Now, you can add to that list present day country music artists. People like Toby Keith singing stupid \\"Patriotic\\" anthems and talking about drinking beer, shopping at Tractor Supply, watching NASCAR, and women leaving them. Music like this just reinforces negative white stereotypes to the rest of the world. People like Toby Keith have never served in the Armed Forces themselves, yet they enjoy talking like they are really doing something in this current war in Iraq, all the while kissing the buttocks of George W Bush. I myself live in the country and I want nothing to do with any of the stereotypical activities that Toby Keith and others talk about in their \\"music\\". I would suggest that people who listen to this should explore other genres of music, or just stay with classic country."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointing","review":"Great music!

There's really nothing catchy about the songs (the exception being \\"I Love This Bar\\"). This album is primarily filler material. I find that whenever artists release albums fairly quickly, as was the case with this CD, they don't seem to have much to offer. Perhaps Toby Keith should have allowed himself MUCH more time to write a CD with substance after the release of \\"Unleashed\\". I'm pretty disappointed with the album, and pretty angry that ~$15.00 was wasted on it.As an aside, I find it pretty pathetic that artists are using the 9/11 attacks as a way to make their albums sell. These artists don't need to rehash it on their CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than \\"Unleashed\\" but that doesn't take much","review":"Keith is still sunk in testosterone overload in this album, but returns to his true country roots with tunes such as \\"Whiskey Girl.\\" One hopes he will leave politics and return to entertainment. His first album is still his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Toby I Love","review":"As a huge Toby fan, I couldn't wait to get to the store to buy \\"Shock'n Y'All.\\" Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed in this CD. It seems as though was thrown together for the sake of putting out a new CD.

Oh yeah and Terry Clark opened up for him once at a concert of his and made him look like Tito. Hopefully he made a lot of money off of the war so hopefully he can retire from country music and let Randy Rogers or Pat green or somebody with half an ounce of talent correct the wrongs he's made in country music. Man he sucks, ok, i'm done"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great singer and performer...mediocre album","review":"I love Toby Keith, but this CD feels like a rushed-up attempt at cashing in on his rising commercial success. \\"American Soldier\\" is a moving and effective song, and is definitely the best thing going here. \\"I Love This Bar\\" is not overly original, but does sort of worm it's way into the listener's consciousness after awhile...in a good way, I think. But...\\"Whiskey Girl\\" is embarrassingly bad and hokey. The pretentiousness of the title of \\"If I Was Jesus\\" is a pretty good indicator of that tune. \\"Nights I Can't Remember\\" is not bad...but \\"Critic,\\" \\"Taliban,\\" and \\"Weed\\" are. Because Toby is Toby and I can't help but like him, I'll add a star to this one, which brings it up to a grand total of...2 stars. Sorry, Toby, but maybe if you dropped the cliches and took a couple of steps sloooowly backward, you'd be a little better off next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Show, No Substance","review":"The Britney Spears of country music.People, please listen to \\"real\\" country music like Hank Williams, Loretta Lynn, Lucinda William, etc. Keith boasts that he is a \\"singer/songwriter\\", with these kind of songs he should give up saying that forever. To be quite frankly, you should never put Toby Keith in the same sentence as the Dixie Chicks. At least their songs are bareable, Keith's songs doesn't have any realness or heart to it and his voice sounds like a dog that has just been ran over by a moving vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: EVEN THIS TOBY FAN IS DISAPPOINTED","review":"True, Toby shocks us all with this album.

After I listened to it I took it out of the CD player and never listened to it again. Don't waste your money folks. The last CD was awesome from start to finish. Shock'n Y'all shocked me because it was so horrible.

There are just two songs on there that are really good - I love this bar and American Soldier, but the rest I thought were not good at all - in fact some were irritating to listen to - not because of content but the way they were sung. I am very disappointed. My husband can testify that I am one of Toby's biggest fans and his other cds have been great - this one -- skip it. Given a little more time they should come out with another Toby Keith's greatest hits and I Love This Bar and American Soldier should be on it - buy then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Shocked -- disappointed","review":"Pros: Toby's voice, the music was okay, two or three of the cutsCons: The other eight or nine cutsI was looking forward to this CD.

Until now. As I said, I was looking forward this release and went out at 7:30 am to grab it -- now I wish I hadn't. American Soldier is a nice tribute piece, I Love This Bar is a good-time piece with a nice feel to it, and Nights I Can't Remember, Friends I'll Never Forget was another one that I liked, as for the rest?.....

I am ashamed that TK is an American. His answers to the questions are WRONG. I actually change the channel whenever I see him or one of his videos. He nausiates me.Although TK is not the only artist to write songs about the 9/11 tragedy, he's the only one that purposely wrote his so-called \\"moving\\" songs for profit. His lyrics are assaultive and do not profess peace.Bottom line: There's a place in Paris for you Toby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking","review":"Yeah there's never been music written about drinking and doing drugs before. Toby Keith sure is \\"Shock'n\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT! Shock'N Y'all","review":"I just knew that Toby couldn't top anything that he had already came out with, I was WRONG!!! I just love every song on this CD. I was so excited to add it to my other CD's from Toby Keith. It's a must for any Toby fan. His songs are from the rougher side of him, and the are awesome. Can't wait for another CD from Toby."},{"rating":"1","title":"still blows","review":"Ha ha no PETA lover here, but this album still blows as it panders to illiterate rednecks who worship Fox News, oops, I mean to say, the salt of the Earth. You know, them good ol people, who dont really question things in life, the kind of folks who do what they are told.Steve Earle and Ryan Adams could write songs around the uber hick Keith and any of his buds any day of the week."},{"rating":"2","title":"He only gets better and better !!!!","review":"Toby is a great songwriter and singer.Shock'n Y'all is a great CD all the way through, although the Bus songs are my favorite, the whole CD puts me in a great mood. Toby has proven (not that he needed to)once again that he knows his audience and their needs :). He speaks of the people who LOVE their bar, he speaks of his boots to those who don't seem to ever get enough of boots, and he once again honors our soldiers with the excellent hit \\"American Soldier\\". Thanks Big Daddy for another excellent CD ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"Toby Keith has never disappointed me before, and he certainly hasn't done it this time! I think that this is by far the best album that has come out this year, and is by far the best album that Toby has ever done. It has songs to make you smile, songs to make you laugh, and songs to make you think. And yes, songs that can make you cry, like \\"American Soldier\\".To those reviewers that viewed this album negatively, I would strongly suggest that you give this album a few more listens. It took a few listens for it to grow on me, but once I really gave it a chance, and I mean REALLY listened to it -- COMPLETELY -- I came to the conclusions that I have already stated. This is a great album, worth every penny I spent on it. It is sure to go down as a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The musical embodiment of the Patriot Act","review":"This past weekend I was in a car and was forced to listen to The Taliban Song over and over. It is the most racist song I have ever heard. Probably it is the most racist song in the history of humans.Hearing people cheer when he sings about bombing civilians is absolutely disgusting. To characterize the HUMAN BEINGS of Afghanistan as cave-dwelling camel herders is sick. And then he brings religion into it, suggesting that people deserve to die because they are Muslim.If I were the head of a terrorist network I would translate this song and use it to incite more terror. This is the reason why people in other countries hate us."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review could shock you, too.","review":"It sounds like Toby Keith recorded these songs while he was fishing for turds in a sewer pipe in Dallas. Even the low expectations of radio-friendly country music are not met by this album. Sure, he's blue collar, but so is Johnny Cash, who would never produce this type of manure. I appreciate music for the blue-collar man, but Toby Keith must remember that blue collar does not equal bad music. Even more so than with his previous albums, Toby hopes to ride on controversy, rather than the quality of his music. The album makes this painfully evident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send this idiot to Iraq..","review":"If there's one thing I hate it's racist rednecks who sit in a bar bashing others. If this isn't the most racist record I have heard in the 2000's, then somebody slap me.This is trash for Nascar fans, so go pop in this CD, burn down some Arab houses and throw rocks at gays!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake up....READ or just disagree automatically","review":"I'll admit it. 'How do you like me now?' was a catchy song. It was fun, even the video was entertaining. Now 'Shock'n Y'all' comes along and delves deep into tastelessness. The title, which uses slangs and abbreviations to show how country he is, is a military term in which people were bombed and killed.I've read reviews saying he's a good ol' boy speaking his mind and doesn't care that he's not politically correct. It's capitalizing on current trends. A majority of the songs have no substance and often ring of unintelligence.The spectrum of Toby's songs seem to be that of hatred and sappiness, the latter being country music's staple. Don't support this, don't spend money on this manufactured garbage. Think. Wake..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shock'n All very disappointed","review":"I got the new Toby CD today. Let's just say \\"disappointed\\" is a understatement!!! Such a shame that a great talent like TK has to go to extreme measures to build his career. I like Toby's old stuff a lot better, the stuff before the WAR. Hopefully his next project will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we perhaps deport Toby Keith to Saudi Arabia?","review":"Toby Keith and Jessica Simpson, and all that other teeny bopper/boyband/country crap is exactly what is wrong with American music today. Its not so much music as phony, flag-waving idiocy that passes itself as music just to make a quick buck. Johnny Cash is rolling in his grave as phony jingoist garbage like Toby Keith and others of these \\"new country\\" artists hijack what used to be a great music genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"by the Numbers&Lame","review":"\\"I Love this Bar\\" is a trip&that is all I can tolerate from this Album.Vocally Toby Keith is decent but the Music&overall direction here is not working.it seems like He is trying to live up to a certain Image of being Precieved as the OutLaw RedNeck or something&the Novelty wears pretty thing really fast.the songs feel more like Skits than anything else overall.He has always been one of those type of artists that is alright in spots but not alot of substance for a whole set but this Album even questions that logic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice + heart = awesome","review":"Toby Keith is one of the great country artists of today. He has a great love for this country that many Americans lack, admittedly myself included. No matter what his political views, he has an amazing voice and writes terrific songs with great melodies and lyrics that make people stop and think. That's what makes him a great musician. Shockin' Y'all is meant to do just what it says and is an incredible, inspiring album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Toby Keith on the payroll of the CIA?","review":"A hired propagandist, Keith continunes in a long line of CIA subversion in the country music branch of populist entertainment. It had been determined that mainstream country fans, along with NFL and NASCAR fans, have the lowest possible ability to understand and digest complex problems and issues and therefore are more easily swayed by simplistic slogans and tightly edited images.With more and more of the country convienantly distracted by popular entertainment and sports, governments can operate more smoothly in clandestine and illicit transactions domestic and abroad."},{"rating":"1","title":"America&#65533;s most sanctimonious redneck&#65533;","review":"If possible, I would give this album negative 5 stars. Terrible songwriting (lyrically) and mediocre riffs (and that is being extremely generous). The precipitous decline in the quality of country music never ceases to amaze me, and buying and supporting artists like TK is aiding the decline. For example, what the hell was Willie thinking when he decided to team up with this buffoon? Just more evidence highlighting the putrefaction of country music. Hopefully someday the country music world will come full circle and welcome back those artists that exhibit true talent. Until then, keep digging deeper in your local music stores and try expanding your horizons to include artists that have scored higher than their shoe size on an IQ test (like Steve Earle - the perfect Anti-Keith)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music For The Mindless...........","review":"This guy only fuels the stereotype of the \\"dumb redneck\\". He's a typical oppurtunistic right winger catering to the same mindless Americans that his hero George Bush does. I am so glad that myself and many others recognize crap when they see it. I am a military veteran and not all wars are justified. It's OK to question your government, in fact it's the most patriotic thing an American CAN do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life Changing Experience","review":"Mona Simpson gives a wonderful and realistic account of the abusive yet loving relatiionship between a mother and daughter. They learn to respect each other and adapt to the situations they are placed in. The book presents the need so many of us feel, to keep moving from our past as we overcome the stuggles of life. This book truly allowed me to grow and see life from a different perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"It is very rare that I do not finish a book I start - I tend to feel compelled to plow on through. However, in this case, I just could not. I thought this book was a total bore and I did not care about the characters at all. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS the Great American Novel - a must read!","review":"Mona Simpson is America's best hidden literary gem. While she doesn't do herself any favors by allowing such a long time to lapse between her novels, the depth of her work is memorable. Anywhere But Here is a mirror of contemporary American life. Her characters are realistic, strong, and independent, yet are limited by their shortcomings and the strictures of familial obligation. Simpson's greatest skill is her mastery of dialogue. In this novel, her characters reveal so much about themselves through their words, and more through their acts and omissions. A fine read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anywhere but Here","review":"I too am suffering through it because I can't not finish it -- I keep waiting to get to the plot of the story. There's too much flashbacking and time swapping going on throughout the story that you're not sure who's telling the story and during which time frame. I may see the movie just to end the torture of reading the book to find out how it ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED this book. POIGNANT","review":"Beautifully written, great character descriptions and moving. I really loved this book -- it's a true GEM. I will look to buy Mona Simplson's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bre's","review":"This book is a beautiful representation of the way families are - certainly the best I've ever read, and I've read a lot of books. While it is true that nothing ever happens as such, it powerfully demonstrates character relationships and development in a realistic fashion. Ann remembers, talks like, thinks like the average teenager. It is a story of normal people living lives that people all over the world live. It is well-written, sensitive and powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh....","review":"I didn't understand why this book would've struck so many people as moving. First of all, Ann's character - it didn't seem like she grew up at all. When she got to 17, I was struck by the fact that I was still thinking she was YOUNG - like, under 10. And, where were Ann's emotions? A lot of the things YOU could imagine how they would've hurt, but I never felt like ANN was all that connected. Adele was very believable, and Carol and Ann's grandmother were also good. But Ann herself just seemed like a very cardboard person. Also, I agree that the explicit stuff didn't seem to have any basis in the story half the time. The jumping around sometimes disturbed the plotline and was annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Mona","review":"I have read all of Ms. Simpson's books, and this one is my favorite. I also enjoyed The Lost Father as well, but Anywhere... has the most engaging characters and left me wanting more. I especially craved to see the main character of the young girl as an adult. I empathized with her enough to think that part her experience paralled my experience growing up. Her most recent work, A Regular Guy, was a tough read. I don't know if it was the book's many main characters, or I was stuck on loving the Anywhere... characters. Ms. Simpson does have a quality that speaks to women in particular, and this book should not be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"drawn out and unrealistic","review":"i've had this book sitting around for a while. i decided to read it before i saw the movie. haven't seen the film, wondering if it is worth it. the characters were dull and hardly believable. i don't think adele is real. she's got some crazy in her, but i don't know that anyone would let her get that out of control and drag others down with her. although the structure is appealing, it is hardly necessary to make the other characters more understandable. i suffered through it because i can't not finish it. i wish i'd never started. sorry. but i just didn't care for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a must-read","review":"I, too, picked this one up because I saw the movie previews. Good news: the movie can only be better than the book. The book is too long -- especially with these characters. They fail to endear the reader. I felt as if I could stop reading the book at any point and not care what happened to these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh...","review":"I absolutely hated this book, it made me sick. Normally I can handle and usually like disturbing books but this one really rubbed me the wrong way. Adele the mother is...infuriating, and completely unpleasant to read about. I got so sick of hearing about all the red meat they ate, especially the chateaubriand! Like many other reviewers, I thought it could have been edited into a much shorter book. I actually liked the movie, I thought they culled the best parts from the book and made a cohesive story. If you want to read something good by Simpson, find her story called Lawns. It is devastatingly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The epitome of a mother-daughter finding themself novel","review":"I picked up the book idly, and was soon engaged in the words of the brilliant Mona Simpson. I can not put down this book, and am going to read it again. I have recommended it to my friends and relatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ver good & engrossing book.","review":"I was given this book by friend who did not like it that much, but as soon as i started reading this book it was very interesting & entertaining. There is a very earthy & raw feel to this book, such as \\"this can happen to you & me too\\". I feel that the book was more excellent than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I thought this book was awful.

I found this book; shallow, predictable and petulant. If you are into the mindless, repetitive episodes of 90210 than you would enjoy this book. I'm not, so I didn't. I thought the 'theme' (mother and daughter brave it alone and struggle for riches)was overplayed and overdone, I was not inspired to closeness with a single character of this book. This book lives up to all the stereotypes of a woman's gold-digging empiness and is so much what so many struggle not to be viewed as. It almost made me think the novel was written by a man making fun of the inferior gender.At the end of this long and boring read, I was at least expecting the heroine to develop above the petty and supericial character of her mother; dispairingly, she never did. This might be a good book to read if you just need the soothing aprodisiac of mind candy, but overall I would not reccomend it; I'd rather watch 90210."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, superficial","review":"This book is high-up on a lot of booklists, but I wasn't impressed.

When I finally finished it I immediately went and rented the movie, I kept thinking if the book was based on the movie (which was just OK) that it would have been 1/4 of it's size.

I absolutely do not like the double ridge around the outside perimeter of the plate and even worse, about a two inch diameter circular imprint in the center of each plate. I realize now that I should have studied the images provided much more carefully. This design pattern does not show up on dark colored plates but now that I have gone back and taken a second look at the images of the lighter colored samples I can make out the imprints. Got two plates, they're quite heavy, and arrived very thoroughly wrapped, thus would never consider returning them. No doubt they'll last forever--just like most things I don't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Mr. Kurz does go into a little too much depth sometimes, making it a little boring in spurts, but it more than makes up for it with the great information.

His reply was very unprofessional and he further posted it to an e-mail list serve among a number of other questions he received in which he puts down the individuals asking the questions, using such terms as \\"stupid\\" and \\"lacking in common sense\\".

The Cambridge edition is in my opinion the best out there for the English speaking world. It is a clean, literal rendering that does a great job of capturing the Latinate sense of Descartes' terminology in English with minimal obfuscation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The roots of the Scientific Method","review":"I really am pleased that I read this book because within its pages you can see the birth of our modern world.Despite the fact that Rene contorted himself to try to prove that God exists; he still managed to create a great work. He began the inquiry into reality wherein we try to understand the world through experimentation. I think he failed in many ways to develop a coherent philosophical structure due to his attempts to please the Church but given the social conditions of the day this was the best that he could do. Even in this flawed analysis Rene paved the way for what would later become the Scientific Method.I only wish that he could live today and write without fears of reprisal from religious entities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Philosophy Text","review":"I'm relatively new to reading philosophy compared to a lot of people (I've read some Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and miscellaneous others), but I really enjoyed Descartes' \\"Meditations on First Philosophy.\\" It seemed more focused on the method than the actual conclusions, which is great for those who completely disagree with what Descartes has to say. This contrasts with some of the other philosophy I've read in the past (especially Aristotle). \\"Meditations\\" could easily become one of my favorites.Of course, the edition of this is also superb; it provides very adequate footnotes and introduction (most of which is useful and interesting) to supplement the actual text. Overall, easily worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good book","review":"The last summer with Maizon was a good book. The book was somewhat confusing in the being of the book. You had to figure out who everyone was and who everyone belong to. After you figured that out the book easy to read. The book kept me interest the whole time. You did not know what was going to happen next.I thought the book was sad at different points because I did not what the childrens feeling to get hurt. I felt bad for Margaret and her brother.

It held my adult attention with no problem, but is still age-appropriate as marketed. The fascinating story of Maizon and her best friend Margaret unfolds largely on their block in the big city. These two have grown up together and are as \\"thick as thieves\\". The story follows them over the course of a summer when Margaret faces a personal family crisis and Maizon deals with the uncertainty of moving away from her beloved grandmother, family and friends (including Margaret) for the very first time.Jacqueline Woodson crafts a fine story that is so real you'll believe it could have happen to you or some beautiful brown baby girl you know.I'd highly recommend all of the books in the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as pictured","review":"this hat is not as pictured. since SU changed their logo to the block 'S' I have hated it and was excited to think this hat would have the old logo, it doesn't.all around it's probably still a good hat, quality wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful illustrations","review":"I bought this book for my kids (ages 6 & 7 then) and they loved it, especially the absolutely gorgeous illustrations.

If this is, as Amazon claims, a change in supplier that has resulted in this HUGE increase, then Amazon NEEDS TO FIND ANOTHER SUPPLIER. Telling their customers that this is a legitimate product price increase just shows that Amazon.com is not paying attention to their customers AND their products. I hope someone at Amazon.com is looking at these recent reviews, since they don't seem to be taking their e-mails seriously about this ludicrous price increase!

Tito allowed his writings to be published, not only so they could be shared with the general public but also to raise awareness about autism.

After song 4 the album starts to get really bad. Nothing on this album is really much to brag about though. The guitar is less then sub-par, and its really just a bunch of noise, 'Never Belive' is the only song with patential, other then that this was an extream let down, dont waste your money and more importantly your time, on this, it really should be called The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible to taste, good to hear.","review":"There are some album covers you can look at, and just know the music within is going to be hard and heavy. This is obviously one of those albums. Some may argue, but I believe more than other bands, and even more than Ministry's prior album, this is when industrial and metal came perfectly together. Sure there's a few repetitive low-points, but the majority of this album is like a punch to the face. The opener \\"Thieves\\" with it's power-drill sample sets the tone, and \\"Burning Inside\\" and \\"Never Believe\\" take it from there. The next powerhouse is \\"Breathe\\", which leads to the climax of the album \\"So What\\", which includes the choice lyrics \\"I only kill, to know I'm alive\\". These tracks aren't simply heavy, they're also well written, and basically catchy. \\"Test\\" even makes rap sound good. I recommend a proper stereo for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Ministry","review":"Before \\"Psalm 69\\" made mainstream America take notice of them, Ministry's \\"The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste\\" was the album that saw the band reaching their peak. Industrial laced metal guitar carnage that is surprisingly catchy is in abundance here; especially on fan favorite and classic tracks like \\"Thieves\\", \\"Burning Inside\\", and the concert staple \\"So What\\". Other standout tracks include \\"Never Believe\\", \\"Test\\", and the more than memorable \\"Cannibal Song\\" which features vocalist Chris Connelly and the song just sounds so dark and eerie that it might become addicting. \\"Breathe\\" is probably the best song on here with it's angst ridden lyrics and yet more catchy yet carnage inducing music. All in all, this would be Ministry's finest hour up until the classic \\"Psalm 69\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"If you were not around when this first came out, you will never understand the intensity that it signified. There were hard groups, but nothing that sounded like this cd did. After The Land of Rape and Honey, which was just as great, there was something missing in the whole \\"industrial\\" scene. This filled the gap, and lost the \\"disco\\" edge and lameness that had become of the scene before and after this release.

It is nearly as good as his masterpiece, Carnival. The CD has a good flow to it, and it doesnt have to make references to guns or gangs, and even keeps the weed out of it for the most part. Eminem made fun of Will Smith for saying that you dont have to \\"cuss or use drugs to sell an album,\\" but that is truly the case here. When your as talented as Clef I guess its really not a challenge to do so.

But the first time, his music really reach me was when I was working at the music caranal at Quebec. I was working there, and I miss his show!! And the critics were soooo goood. So I had to buy his album.. I hadn't heard one song yet... And the first time I putted on...I couldn't beleive how It was good. Starting with:Industry : talks about the all those rappersParty to dasmacus : A great party song!!!celebrate : younghood momories...great songbaby daddy : this one touch me right inside...he's taalking about step-fathers and their hard timesthree nights in rio- A great dance song--great beatclass reunion--- this song is so cute!And all the rest...are so much better from I'm your doctor, to take me as i am to party to dasmascus remix ( which he talks in french in it )You need to buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely GREAT !","review":"Yeah!This album is absolutely great.My favorites songs from this album are : Celebrate, Baby Daddy, Class Reunion, Linda, Take me as I am, Next generation, Party by the sea.As you can see it's almost the whole album.What I really about this album is it's not 100% rap, but \\"World Wide Hip Hop\\". I mean you find a lot of different style of music. And what so grateful about this album is it's a life story not Wyclef's but anybody's life, because he sings about everything from partying to school memory, to mistake in life everything and everything.All I can say is GOOD JOB NEG PAM' - KENBE LA - PA LAGEAnd this one is to T-VICE : BON BAGAYS'ak Pase :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must buy","review":"Preacher's Son is a bad-ass album. Wyclef is one of the realest artists out there. He doesn't try to be gangsta or anything of that nature, he's just Wyclef. He doesn't have any gangsta tunes on this cd like hollyhood to hollywood, but it's still great. Grateful is probably my favorite track, a song about nothing other than him being grateful for where he is instead of bitching like a lot of other rappers about how their moms and everyone else has made them into the scum they are today. Industry, Celebrate, Baby Daddy, Next Generation, Rebel Music, Class Reunion, and Who Gave the Order are also top notch tracks. This cd is a must buy for anyone who loves real music that says real things and has a point to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyclef Jean - The Preacher's Son","review":"Yes, it is true that Wyclef has strayed from traditional hip-hop. Far away. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing. This album is filled with many hits, and few misses. Wyclef has always been an innovator, and this is most evident on \\"The Preacher's Son.\\" He mixes and matches so many musical styles, and the listener is introduced to a new one on nearly every song. Some of the guests featured are Carlos Santana, on the upbeat \\"Three Nights In Rio\\", Patti Labelle on the nostalgic \\"Celebrate\\", and Scarface and Rah Digga on the more rap-influenced \\"Next Generation\\". The production is excellent overall, thanks primarily to Wyclef and his parter in crime, Jerry \\"Wonder\\" Duplessis. Wyclef's message is positive and relatively simple: if a man who grew up on the streets of Brooklyn can succeed liek he has, then anyone can. This CD may not be for everyone, but for those who can appreciate good music, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless product!","review":"I have tried this product on two occasions, one with bad tarnish, the next with slight tarnish.

It's a live disk, so I expected sound and performance quality to not be up to studio album standards, but this was REALLY BAD. The audio quality sounds like it was recorded on one of those old mono cassette recorders. The vocal and musical performances are abysmal. I don't know if John Payne has any talent - but he has no business trying to sing these songs. Not only does he not sound anything like John Wetton, this is closer to screeching.It wasn't until after I bought it and was astounded at how bad it was did I look up the band's post 80's history. In all fairness - shame on me for a $6 impulse purchass. The original band is back together (as \\"ASIA\\" vs. this disks \\"Asia featuring John Payne\\" mess).All appologies to the members of this Asia impersonator group if you happen to read this - nothing personal - but you really suck at recording the original guys' music."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Payne is not Asia","review":"I would not have given this even one star, but Amazon makes you choose at least one.John Payne should be ashamed of himself.Asia was not his band. He was the singer for Geoff Downes version of Asia. Nothing more. Now that the original and only Asia have reformed, Payne needs to be a gentleman and let them be. Instead he decides to try and make more money off of someone else's reputation and hard work.How can you call the band Asia when there are no original members left?I realize that Geoff appears on this release, but like all other Payne era releases, it is still a cover band pretending to be Asia.If you buy this you are betraying the real Asia (Wetton/Howe/Palmer/Downes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concert DVD","review":"If you have been an America fan from day one like myself, you will love this concert.

I believe the concert was recorded about 10 years ago, when Gerry was in his pre-android phase (vocally speaking). He actually sounds very good here. Dewey sounds a bit hesitant, seems to be suffering a bit from Al Jardine syndrome regarding confidence.

It is unfortunate and obvious. My guess is that these young singers would rather have their fans praise them instead of focusing on putting someone else down.Because of the ill will of many reviewers, I'm not going to give my own review. Avoid the reviews. Listen to song snippets, find someone you can trust to tell you the truth, or borrow a copy from the library before you purchase so you can make up your own mind.You may find that you love the performance of your preferred singer and are still willing to buy the CD for that one song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kimberley Locke Brings It on Holiday CD","review":"The star standout on this CD is by far Kimberley Locke -- what a silky, smooth voice that girl has! \\"The Christmas Song\\" will forever belong to Kimberley. Heartfelt, beautiful job; worth buying the CD for this song alone. Unfortunately Kimberley was underutilized on this CD, given a very small portion in a Silver Bells \\"duet\\" with Clay Aiken -- too little dueting and too much Clay Aiken! I also love the vocals of Tamyra Gray on this CD, both on her Silent Night solo and duet with Ruben Studdard. Kelly sounds good. The guys (Ruben, Clay, Justin), just ho hum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Brandon in Col.Hgts.

I wasn't too impressed with the rest I thought they could've done better. Clay was good,but would be better if he didn't over pronunciate so much. So all in all Kelly's tracks of OHN and MGUCL were by far my favorite. I've listened to the cd once or twice and I've listened to Kelly's bonus disc about 100 times.

I can only imagine what the holidays would be like with this collection of freaks. Santa would be upset cause Reuben ate all the cookies...not to mention that Christmas ham, stuffing, yams, pies, green beans, rolls and even cranberry sauce! The Queen of Uncool (Kelly Clarkson) would just sit around with a scarf on moaning about we have lost touch with the holiday spirit and then make sure everyone knew she was the first Idol. Later, the Christmas Queen herself, Clay Aiken, would descend the staircase in a long flowing silver gown with missletoe attached to his tiara trying to hunt down Josh Gracin for a Xmas kiss.

Her voice is so mature and defined and soulful; therefore, makes her one of the best out there today. I only heard the CD with the other wannabes like once, and once was enough, except for Tamayra, she's okay. Clay Aiken is sooooo overrated it's sickening. He's soooo broadway!!! The two stars are for Kelly Clarkson's contributions to this CD. Kelly Clarkson can really make buying a boring album into something worthwhile!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy it","review":"look this cd sucks cuz not evryone from american idol 1 and 2 are here this cd should have ft. everyone will if u like the people in this cd buy it but if your fave. idol isint on this cd dont buy it cuz it wont be worth the money hearing someone u dont like sing this cd should have evryone from american idol 1 and 2 on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth the money","review":"Other than Clay Aiken's \\"The First Noel,\\" which is a beautiful version of a rather repetitive carol, this CD doesn't really contain anything exceptional. And actually, Clay should have been given \\"O Holy Night\\" instead of Kelly Clarkson, whose rendition doesn't quite make the mark. She's all right as a singer, but her slurring style doesn't suit for such an exquisite song. Justin Guarini sounds very good on here, and Ruben is Ruben. Kim Locke's version of The Christmas Song is adequate, but Christina Christian's participation on this CD is a mystery -- why exactly is she on here?All in all, this could have been a much better album if the songs had been assigned to the right singers, and if certain singers had been left off entirely. Kind of a disappointment for this AI fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an enjoyable CD!","review":"I have to admit that I am an avid watcher of \\"American Idol\\" but this is honestly the first CD I have ever bought from the series; solo CDs and compilations included. With that being said, this was a very enjoyable CD! My favorite vocalist on this whole CD was Tamyra Gray. Her duet with Ruben and her rendition of \\"Silent Night\\" were absolutely incredible! I just can't get enough of her voice. Someone else whom I also enjoyed was Kelly Clarkson. This was the best I have ever heard her sing! Clay Aiken, Ruben Studdard, Kimberley Locke, Justin Guarini and Christina Christian all give good to great performances of their solo songs, but Tamyra and Kelly were the true standouts to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Noel makes it all worthwhile","review":"I'm really not fond of albums with numerous artists contributing but I'm a sucker for Chrismas music. I had heard the clip of First Noel by Clay Aiken and had to have this. And, that song alone made it worth purchasing- it's a wonderful version and he does a superb job with it. I found the rest of the album had some nice suprises and some disappointments. I did not like Christina at all but I did like the Silver Bells duet. One of the surprises was that I actually enjoyed Guarini's singing. I had previously tried his own album and found it rather painful but this was a side of his singing that made me think he may have some potential in the future - wasn't half bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Christmas album!","review":"A year since I bought this album, and it still sounds good! I liked Clay Aiken's The First Noel, Ruben Studdard and Tamyra Gray's Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (pretty), Kimberly Locke's offering on here, the ensemble songs and Ruben's This Christmas (with shades of Donny Hathaway in his voice). The only song I didn't like was Christina Christian's Winter Wonderland, which lacked something. A very moving and uplifting Christmas album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Justin Guarini is the only reason to buy this CD","review":"If it weren't for Justin Guarini being on this CD, I wouldn't have bought it. I generally do not buy Christmas music, but I bought it because I heard clips from the songs online and Justin's voice was so angelic I had to have this CD. The CD does not disappoint as far as Justin's voice goes. His song, I'll Be Home For Christmas, is a gorgeous rendition I will love to hear over and over this season and all year round. His a capella singing in O Come All Ye Faithful is so beautiful it gives me chills. Some of the other singers did a fine job, too, most notably Tamyra and Kimberly, but Ruben and Clay did not shine, nor did I love the Kelly songs on the bonus CD. Christina should not have even been on this CD and unfortunately her song sounds much worse than she has sounded in the past.Overall, a decent CD, but not completely wonderful top to bottom. Still, for Justin's contributions, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Based on 2-songs, I'd give it 5-Stars of it were all Kelly","review":"I was looking forward to this since I loved Ruben's \\"Superstar\\" so much, but his solo here was a disappointment. Tamyra's solo was surprisingly unenjoyable. I had read justin did well on his solo, but i was unimpressed. I have no comment on the others yet. Although I struggled to listened to the group disc once, and some songs twice, I have listened to Kelly's disc about 30x already. Kelly breaks ground w/ likely the 1st ever \\"O Holy Night\\" w/o any music whatsoever. Kelly follows it up w/ \\"my grown up x-mas list\\" which I don't think i have ever heard before, and which will likely become a holiday regular on radio. I would not be surprised if Kelly got her own disc to make it easier to send to radio stations. This x-mas will be very interesting :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversung and Overproduced.","review":"This has to be one of the worst Christmas CD's ever produced.

Tamyra Gray's \\"Silent Night\\" would've have been much more beautiful if she hadn't lisped on \\"Christ the Savior is born\\".

Kelly's great but, I don't understand why her 2 songs are on a seperate disc. The only song that dissappointed me was Christina Christian's Winter wonderland. Her voice isn't as strong as the others.

He's still very good, of course because of that VOICE, and I also enjoyed his duet with Kim Locke. The rest of the gang are not in the least noteworthy. The ensemble pieces, in particular, I found to be grating - their voices just don't mesh very well, with the powerful voices of Aiken, Locke and Studdard doing a disservice to the weaker voices contributed by the rest of the ensemble. Give Aiken and Locke their own Christmas CD next year. That will make up for the money wasted this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay Shines!","review":"The only song I like on this CD is The First Noel by Clay Aiken!

If you're a beginner, be cautioned that it doesn't tell you upfront whether or not each plant is evergreen, semi-evergreen or deciduous, which is very important, though it generally will tell you if the plant IS evergreen; my complaint is that they should have listed this feature in the header for each plant.

Records weren't kept in the 40's and 50's with an eye to the future restorers so many details have been lost or damaged. It took someone like J.P. Bickerstaff (a highly qualified engineer by profession) who knows and loves the motorcycle, to ferret out the details of these machines from such sources as still remain. I have at least six other books on Vincents and consider the Original Vincent Motorcycle to be the absolute best source for restoring, or for verifying details of one you might consider for purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Car Part Kings Drops the Ball","review":"Can't say much about the tail pipe, since Car Part Kings sent me an A/C hose instead (Sent me a four seasons 55143 instead of Walker 55143).

Their is no greater joy in an editors' heart then to find and be able to assist great talent. Jon Sutherland is a great writer that I hope will continue onward for many years to come. His stories speak for themselves.The true heroes in this world are not on basketball courts or gridirons, they are the men and women who sacrifice and give their lives every day so that their children will have a brighter future.

Three-word lines with third-grade rhymes, accompanied by the same canned music you've heard on every other song on the radio. \\"Cannot hide/this emptiness inside\\"? Cuts like a knife, that one does. Go back and listen to \\"Liberty\\" or even \\"You're a God\\" (two great songs from completely different eras) and then try to listen to this flotsam with a straight face.

I own and listen to 4 of theirs, and just recently saw them live, unplugged. By far the best small concert I have been to, and the venue wasn't that great, so it shows how good they are. The harmony they achieve, especially on Forever and I'm Still Here is incredible, I had thought it was done with sampling, but after seeing the concert, I know it is real. In fact, the only song I don't like on Go is Underwater..it just seems to break the tone and drag the rest of the album down with it. But nowadays, to have 10 out of 11 (I bought it early, before the bonus track was added) songs be excellent enough to listen to over and over is a rare achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Effort from Vertical Horizon","review":"This is a very good album. The sound is somewhere between rock/pop and hard rock. The songs flow very well together and the lyrics are very thoughtful and poetic. The only weakness seems to be that there are very few songs that sound different from one another. They all have basically the same tempo and rhythm. However, if it ain't broke don't fix it. My favorite songs are \\"It's Over,\\" \\"Echo,\\" \\"Sunshine,\\" and \\"Forever.\\" All in all I recommend this album for any fan of rock music that's neither too hard nor too soft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madd Props for these Hip Hop Theologians","review":"Hey I got a madd Props for these cats they have boke it down for the church, Christians to get it about how Hip Hop and it's potential to be righteous, espeicaily to the Kingdom of God.

For instance, the index shows that dealing with the police is mentioned once, but I counted at least six places where she wrote about how to work around law enforcement.It's not that the information in this book in not helpful.

Reading the synopsis, I didn't think it would be too good but it was great. Her writing was so sensual and beautiful, matching the actual climate of the Amazon, and it was one of those love-hate novels that just pulls at your heart-strings. Every time I go to the library I look it up and I am a pretty fussy romance reader.

From the cover I was envisioning more along the lines of \\"Romancing the Stone.\\" There were adventures of course and the romance heated up the pages, I was just wishing for more. The whole point of the story, checking out a possible church involvement, didn't lend itself to Indiana Jones type adventures so it was true to the storyline.

She also did not make every incident so short you could not get the the story. The amount of sex went very well with the story and did not get grossly detailed but, you knew what was happening.

My birds love these seeds thats why I gave it 2 stars and not 1, cause product itself is OK. That being said, I am highly disappointed at Amazon for their lack of care. I am sure that they would refund or replace the item, but I am still deciding if its even worth to submit a request and have to deal with return shipping and so on for a few dollars.

If you look at reviews on Consumer Reports, there are lots of people with similar problems after a year or so of ownership. As other reviewers have noted, the repair options are awful.

I returned the unit at my own cost to Westinghouse. That was in April 2008, this is almost July, and I still...don't...have a TV. Their warranty process is completely screwed up, and though the agents on the phone are plenty nice, they can't do a darn thing.

After a year the tuner started giving us problems and won't hold in the HDTV mode. No one in Michigan repairs them or carries replacement parts.

Went through all the Westinghouse troubleshooting with them. Now they want me to pack and ship it at my expense to their repair center!!! Westinghouse policy is that 42\\" and smaller lcd's need to be shipped to their repair center, while bigger lcd's will get a repair person sent to your home to fix it. This policy makes no sense since the size of it should not matter. A better option would be to have the customer take it in to the same local repair people and have them fix it in their shop.

I contacted Sony Canada and they did some research for me. Turns out this BD is in 1080i50 format and Canadian Sony players do not support that format (they like 1080i60). I was told that Sony had no plans to market a compatible player in Canada in the future. So be warned: if you have a Canadian, and I suspect, US Sony BD player, you will not be watching this BD on your widescreen television, except via computer linkup, if your computer is capable. My laptop, with a BD reader, wouldn't touch this BD either. I suspect that is because there is an older, stripped-down version of PowerDVD on the laptop.I have watched a couple of episodes on my main computer. Not all that impressed.

Lee's pen is wicked; there's no doubt about that. His horror scenes are always nasty, which is a good thing when one seeks out that sort of thing. Just try to pick up his Creekers without cringing. Hardcore stuff. Yet, behind all the gross-outs and the violence is always a Lee with a purpose, a Lee with a story to tell. Which is exactly what lacks in CITY INFERNAL. What we get instead is just an amateurish take of hell where nothing really happens except when the heroine discovers yet another God-given gift that will help her on to next level in her search of her already dead missing sister. A sort of a Nintendo game with no winning gold or, in this case, no plot rewards. Yes, Lee's prose is still clear and fast and his action scenes are somewhat effective, but his vision of horror will need some retooling if his next delivery resembles anything like this lackluster one.-----Martin Boucher"},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful!","review":"This book has the distinction of containing the world's most implausible suicide. It goes a little something like this: Girl slips drugs in twin sister's drink, girl catches twin (that she roofied) fooling around with girl's loser boyfriend that she doesn't really seem that into, girl produces gun from nowhere and without hesitation kills boyfriend and self. WTF? I am totally willing to suspend disbelief for the whole \\"harrowing of hell\\" thing, but not this utterly stupid suicide. If you can get your mind past this nonsense, maybe you can kind of almost not entirely hate the rest of the story. Maybe. You're still going to have to sit through stuff like a pointless description of masturbation that has no relevance to the plot whatsoever. The ending is also kind of lame and open-ended. I don't know if Lee wanted to do a sequel, or what. Luckily, it isn't too upsetting because the characters are unlikable anyway. You'll just be glad it's over.Bleh.

It was written in the style of a 1950's pulp book for adolescents, and whenever a character ran into some difficulty, someone would pull a \\"sprinkle\\" of some magic dust from a pocket to solve the problem.There was no tension, nothing was scary, and the book just kind of fell into a heap of uninteresting rags before the end.Despite this, and despite an angel being described as looking like Brad Pitt with, like, you know, a really great bod (!!!), I churned my way to the end, hoping that it would get better, even a trifle.Two hours of my life was stolen by this book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst read ever!","review":"This has to be the worst book I've ever read. The plot was ridiculous, the characters shallow, and the writing a total mess. Any time the characters were in a jam they just conjured up something out of the blue with little explanation. A guy tries to kill Cassie and her father at their house, gets knocked out, and with no explanation wakes up the next day in his own house not remembering anything. I was really looking forward to it based on other reviews and the original concept. Unfortunately I had to struggle to finish it. I wrote a better story than this when I was in third grade.

However, this book was incredibly boring.I'm not trying to be harsh, but from the very start I knew I didn't like Birdy Stone.

The author goes on and on and on describing things to the point that i kept forgetting what he was talking about. I also must admit to you I did not finish this book.

He is the only person qualified to write this account because as the chief of Elvis'Security he was in a position to know the facts he writes about. He tells you honestly and factually what took place and does it in such a manner that makes the book very difficult to put down. You find yourself reading \\"just one more page\\" and that is the aim of any author. They get you interested and keep you that way. Mr. Grob writes in the same manner he treats people. He is straight forward and sincere and it is these very traits that have endeared him to Elvis Fans all over the world. His honesty and sincerity is what sets this book apart from other books written by Elvis \\"Associates\\". The book is thoroughly researched and factual in its account of events. First hand and genuine. I heartly recommend this book to all fans. You would not find a more truthful accont anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please let this book end!","review":"Dick Grob is a security guy but he is NO writer.

One particular author of this book sticks out in my mind as questionable and that would be Ron Fournier. I have read his journalistic diatribes in the past and as he is a reporter for the Associated Press, in my opinion he is less than impartial and more biased toward the liberal stance. It's one thing to publish the Truth but another to slant the Truth.

I gave it a 2 stars because of how short it is. I think it's an insult to Luther's fans that it is so short. My advice is buy Luther live on DVD.

If you are a Luther fan, this CD is a must!!! If you never have seen a concert, here is an inexpensive way to get a taste of what you hear.

He knows how to arrange music and voices to take simple lyrics and melodies into a dimension that no other artist has mastered -- or dares to go. The version of Superstar, with a stirring piano solo, and then wafting harmonies, is worth the price of admission alone. But Luther doesn't begin or stop there. He does just a touch of taking the smooth off of his velvet voice to give \\"Glow of Love,\\" which has never been one of my favorite songs, a rawer and more upbeat edge. It works. In fact, this whole CD works. It is destined to be a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not actually a film, just a slideshow","review":"My fiancee and I will be traveling to Morocco for our honeymoon in October, so we were excited to check out what was advertised as a \\"documentary\\" about various cities in the country. Much to our dismay, what we purchased was a 45 minute slideshow of someone's trip to Morocco that looks like a poorly made PowerPoint presentation. There is no narration, just some text that is very small and difficult to read. Needless to say, we did not watch the entire thing and felt that even though we only lost $1.99, it was a waste of money.

I also read Mr. Matthews newest book, which was Okay but not something that was much different than Never Say Goodbye. If you are interested in reading little snippets of his readings for people it would be a good book, it you are looking for something with more substance keep looking.

I bought this book for a church youth group kid who is a true beginner at playing any instrument. It is the best bass guitar book ever written for beginners. I have tried to find a bass guitar tutorial over the internet that is free, but this book was worth paying the $8.95. This book comes with a cd that provides a thorough tutorial. The voice on the cd and the play-along segments made me feel like I was getting a private bass lesson from a professional. If you're debating whether or not to get this book, I would say that if you're a beginner and want to learn the basics of bass guitar as well as the slap/pop technique, I strongly recommend this book. Don't forget to check \\"yes\\" if you thought that my recommendation was helpful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need more explanations","review":"This book probably was written for absolute beginners. The book is only 40 pages long and spends 15 of its pages on background information on how to read notes, tabs, and on how to hold and pick a bass guitar. If you're a guitar player, you probably know most of this already. The rest of the book is a play along to the CD with no explanation why a particular note was chosen to start and to end on. So you can't really create your own bass line for different songs even after you complete the lessons. It's a short book so you can go through the material in few days. If you had no exposure to music in the past, this book will start you off and help you become familier with the instrument. If you are looking to learn more, perhaps books on bass by Berklee school of music is a better deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"El Puma con Los Panchos!","review":"What a combination!

You can NOT change the combo from 0-0-0 no matter what you try. This a bug that they have never fixed and that is the only reason these are on the market so cheap. They are simply dumping and selling thousands of units that do NOT function properly when it comes to changing the combo . . . and good thieves know that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"What a true disappointment...this book was long awaited, since Homeland was a mark of acheivement. Unlike Homeland, The North & South Trilogy, California Gold and the Kent Family Chronicles (I'm a Jakes FAN!), this book lost its steam before it even started. The only interesting focus was that of Paul Crown and his assistant, as they filmed WWI. Everything else was a drab attempt at trying to give the other characters interesting lives. There was too much jumping around, and not enough of character growth/evolution. Stagnant and wimpy, a real downer.Will heartily recommend any other book by Jakes...he's my History Man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DUMBING DOWN HISTORY YET FURTHER","review":"I read the first book in this series and enjoyed it, but this is now beginning to look like a bad television mini-series. Do authors of so-called \\"historical\\" novels think we are just plain dumb? This is written in elementary school level english; and can we really believe that the family members ever got so close to world leaders and business types? Poorly written, boring, I think John Jakes only wrote this because he had a contract for another book. It doesn't come across like he cared. SAD from the man who brought us one of my favorite historical fiction series on the Civil War. It may be time to put down the pen on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading \\"Homeland\\", I eagerly awaited the next installment of what Jakes had promised would be a trilogy. Now, however, I don't care if there is a third volume or not. Each novel by Jakes has kept me transfixed; I couldn't put them down, but \\"Homeland\\" is entirely predictable with no climax. I couldn't decide whether Jakes was bored with the subject or simply rushing to finish the story. His subjects are usually engrossing and the saga of the Crown family uniquely American, I am just very, very disappointed. Please, Mr. Jakes don't write again until you regain your passion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American Dreams","review":"The condition of the paperback was excellent; it appeared to be new although it was listed as used. Like all of Jakes historical novels this one was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Continuation of the Saga","review":"This volume of John Jakes' story concentrates on Joe Crown's daughter, Fritzi, as she struggles to make a career for herself as an actress. I was really looking forward to reading this one, as it concentrates on one of my favorite eras - the dawn of movies in Hollywood. All the big players are here: Pickford, Chaplin, Griffith. Jakes makes some bush-league research errors in regard to things that a silent film buff would know (Roscoe Arbuckle's friends NEVER called him \\"Fatty,\\" for instance), but the story itself was good enough that I was able to overlook such mistakes.As with Homeland, the least interesting sections of the book for me were the military episodes. I understand their necessity to show Paul's integrity and talent, but the subject matter just wasn't calling to me. But this is why I enjoy a Jakes novel - the family story is so sprawling and varied that I know within a few pages I'll be on to something that grabs me again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This one is certainly not as good as the previous novel in the series, Homeland. The plot is weak and highly reminiscent of Homeland (the tensed relation between the general and Fritzi, Carl wishes to marry Tess but she marries someone her father has choosen for her). There is little surprise in all of this.Furthermore, Fritzi is not a very compelling character, she's like a drifting boat with little power over the direction she takes. All the while she will be a reluctant star. Carl is much more interesting, but is given very little show time as Jakes centers whatever plot there is around Fritzi. There is also a lot of name-dropping (much of it useless), and it gets boring after a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry....","review":"I read this whole book because it bore John Jakes' name on the cover, but I must admit it was a bitter disappointment. It was a fast- very fast- read but equally as disappointing. Homeland was excellent, magnificent...but this was a very big let-down with relation to its predecessor. Let's hope book three doesn't slump any further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another historical masterpiece by Jakes","review":"I want to rebut the reviews that this book was \\"not up to Jakes' usual par\\". Readers have criticized the \\"lack of depth\\", \\"shallow characters\\", and so on, but I felt that the fast pace of this book was in perfect rhythym with the brisk historical pace of the early 20th century. All of the characters were real and believable and I fell in love with Carl the man that I adored like a puppy in \\"Homeland\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality and can injure you","review":"These are poor quality.

The artist's voice is full, flexible, filled with soul, playful, and in perfect pitch. While all the songs are good, cut 3 on the album (Cuando me Faltas) is one of the most beautiful balads I've ever heard, and I can't even speak or understand Spanish! This song should be broadcast widely, and I'm certain the public response would be excellent.

It just didn't pan out. The second half did not deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"an utter disappointment","review":"Let me begin by stating Daniel Quinn is by far my favorite author. Ishmael, My Ishmael, and Story of B are simply some of the best books i've ever read. This book, however, was a challenge to even finish. There are no lessons to be learned, philosophical debates to be opened, or even an interesting story to follow. Instead it feels like a poorly written acid trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"i have read every quinn book...","review":"This one was very painful to read. Granted, it is a piece of metaphysical fiction, but it really is a bit hokey.I could not wait to read this. All the reviews seemed positive and the story seemed very interesting. Once I started, I was captured again by the story- but then I got lost. There really is no flow. Things just happen. And in this case, strange things, that make no sense, keep happening. I am halfway through. Hopefully all of this random, forced story will start getting better?I noticed the same thing with Dachau. Forced story telling. Events occur that are disjointed, dialogue is confusing, and the plot gets shadowed by these things.I love Daniel Quinn and the message he is putting out there. But I am learning after each book that his early works were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. A whole lot of nothing....","review":"I have to be honest about what I expected when picking up this book. I was hoping for an \\"American Gods\\" (by Neil Gaiman) experience, filled with personal discovery and revelation. Instead, I really felt like this book was 400+ pages of setup for maybe 10 pages of explanation. And the explanation wasn't anything new. You saw it coming from about halfway through the book. I do want to read more Daniel Quinn, but hopefully it's better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"muddled confusing and not worth the effort","review":"Being a HUGE fan of Mr. Quinn's, and loving and re-reading everything else he's ever written. I feel compelled to ask \\"WHAT THE [HECK]!\\" I found myself reading and re-reading whole chapters and not only being bored to death, but confused and angry that I was wasting so much of my time on this drivel. This is truly...bad. I should've stopped reading after the scene with the devil worshipper and the main character going through a barbarella-logan's run-esque debauchery. Shame on you Mr. Quinn. Very very dissappointed. AND I want those hours I spent reading this back."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-Time Quinn Reader Bowled Over!","review":"Unlike other reviewers here, I'm a first-time Quinn reader, so I have no idea whether The Holy is his best or not, but I can tell you it's one heck of a book, a true supernatural thriller that I can only compare (favorably) to books like The Shining and Shadowland, with a cast of unforgettable characters that climb off the page right into your head. I opened it the other night after dinner, figuring I'd read till bedtime--wrong! I couldn't quit till I turned the last page at 3 a.m. If I had a couple of books this good to read every week, I'd be in heaven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All action, no preaching","review":"Having read and loved some of Quinn's better known work, specifically ISHMAEL, I was pleasantly surprised when I cracked THE HOLY. His message is as strong as ever-humans are still ruining the planet with their selfish notions of entitlement-but Quinn's approach is more subtle than the Socratic conversations of ISHMAEL or MY ISHMAEL. This book is part road novel, part detective novel, and a convincing metaphysical thriller throughout, but it doesn't fall in to the trap of new age hooey that might have convenienced a less skillful writer. Quinn keeps things fresh, strange, beautiful, and cynical enough to keep the most hardened skeptic on board. It's fun, fast reading, and you might actually learn something along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely up there!","review":"Daniel Quinn questions yet another set of fundamental beleifs! I'm familiar with all his past books and I can honestly say that this one is at least as good as any other of my favorites. The way the story was written kept me glued as well. Lots of irony, dark humor, and thrill. A MUST HAVE for any D.Q. fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no Ishmael","review":"The first thing a perspective reader needs to know about this book is that it has nothing in common with Ishmael. You wouldn't even guess that it was written by the same author. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in this case it is. This is a \\"metaphysical thriller\\" according to the front jacket. Well, it is neither a thriller nor particularly metaphysical. The story is very superficial and unbelievable. The reader follows along through a series of story lines that lead nowhere with the thought that all will be revealed at some point. But no, the book simply ends with no enlightenment given, no story told, no insights gained, no pleasure taken. It is an empty, poorly executed book that will sell because the author has a following from earlier works that were profound and meaningful. This one isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"searching for answers","review":"I'm sorry I haven't read the book, but I was reading a comment about Drummond and at the end it says if your on Paxil don't stop using it. my question is why?

The author succeeds in creating a moving and poignant event in the selfless heroic sacrifice of a young mother. In her resurrection however, she is saddled with a horribly cynical burden. For the most part, the Avengers are portrayed as a superhero team completely unable to function due their own personal problems, and lack of professionalism. Themes that could be quite effective are treated in jerky, unconvincing fashion. Long-time followers of the title will find several inexplicable developments, and unrecognizable charters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh those Naughty \\"Odd Girls\\"","review":"Make way for Lesbian Pulp fiction!

At times I found the whole social order (men are always right, women just need to follow them) so funny that I was luaghing out lound.

I also purchased the matching strut boots but didn't purchase the matching spring isolators, which was a mistake.

This, I suppose, is both good and bad: on the one hand, qualified applicants with some quality that doesn't necessarily manifest itself as anything special in test scores often still comes across to admissions officers. On the other hand, you get all sorts of biases, and admissions officers who hope to \\"discover\\" themselves in the applicant pool.One interesting observation. Many people who've reviewed this book have expressed near glee that the underqualified affirmative action admit went on probation and failed to return to Wesleyan. This is exactly what affirmative action has done to us: instead of bridging gaps of culture and inheritance, it pits us in some sort of imagined zero sum game where we actually start crowing over someone's misfortune.Steinberg is obviously sympathetic to affirmative action throughout, but he does an incredible job of displaying its pitfalls, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tool for Parents of College Bound Children","review":"Excellent read for parents of college bound children.

It read more like a short story that didn't end than anything else. I also didn't like how vulgar the author was in this. There was some great detail put into certain scenes and the characters themselves didn't mind dropping the F bomb every few words. The lack of editing drove me nuts too. There was about an error a page that didn't get caught when the book was published. An example is \\"break\\" instead of \\"brake\\" when someone was driving.I'm not trying to put down this author.

One of my chairs' backs broke while I was pulling it out to sit down. The seat cushions have all become incredibly stained just from sitting on them. The chairs on either side cannot be pushed in fully because they will run in to each other and only allow one side to be fully under the table (on the long side.) Pass up this opportunity.

Secrets abound in this book - who is pregnant?, who was pregnant?, who slept with whom?. Too many secrets and a poorly developed plot ruined this book. The secrets never seemed worth keeping, causing the whole premise of the book to crumble. I also hate this author's trademark forced seductions. Can't her heroines ever maturely realize that they would like to sleep with the hero. The occassional forced seduction can be quite sexy (see The Well Pleasured Lady), but this author uses the template again and again in all her novels. I did not enjoy this book and do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Secrets and Immature Behaviour","review":"This book is full of secrets about babies and pregnancies and affairs and religious groups, etc... It was too much for me. This book is trademark Shannon Drake - with cliches designed to build tension, forced seductions, shrewish heroines, etc...

However, if you like a poignant journey to love between mature adults, pass this book up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"This book just didn't fit in the trilogy. We went from American soil and the escalating Indian problems, to some weird satanic cult in Scotland. The author tried to make a \\"who fathered this child\\" mystery throughout the book, and yet it was so glaringly obvious what was going on. The plot wasn't that believable and the whole time you just wanted to know what was going to happen back in America with the characters from the first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indian sweets made simple!","review":"Ras malai is my idea of going to heaven and I love all the others on this video.

Childhood friends Bo Renney of the Jangga tribe and Melbourne academic Annabelle Beck, recently returned to her ancestral home after a marriage bust-up, forge a new relationship based on a realistic view of their shared history. Once having stared into the face of the violence between their two families in the past they are able to set their sites on a possible shared future. The narrative drags a little in the middle section but the latter half of the book is particularly moving as both of the protagonists make discoveries about their past that force them to rearrange their present. I was attracted to the cover because I have always felt a kind of connection of some sort to monoliths. My friend Gerard tells me it's part of my dreaming. Maybe so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Video That made me a Firm beliver","review":"this was my first Firm video,and i can truely say that i'm hooked on The Firm!I used all different types,Kathy Smith,Billy Blanks,Cher,and others.I borrowed this video from a friend just looking for a change,when i read the \\"lable see results in just 10 workouts\\",I thought to myself i'm going to see if that is really true.AND IT WAS!!!...It's a great tape for everyone,but just a word of caution to beginners,learn proper form first before doing this tape,that is one thing the instructor does not really go over.I Have odered 3 different Firm Videos and do not intend to stop here.I can proudly say I AM A FRIM BELIVER!!!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Another Great Workout From The Firm!","review":"So far I've loved every Firm workout I've done other than their yoga one, which I didn't like at all. I've done yoga for years and it just didn't work for me.This one is excellent. I learned still more about how to handle dumbbells, how to build muscle and burn fat, and generally get a great workout.I always modify the workouts so that I don't do jumping jacks or other high-impact moves. I dislike those and if I forced myself to do them, I wouldn't do the workout again. I just don't like the way they feel.Other than that, I really enjoyed this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ole' school fitness, it gets the job done","review":"This video gets the job done.

My recent firm purchase really satisfies my fitness needs. The moves are ever changing the repetitions aren't too long. The moves are also clean and graceful. You really get a work out when you're done. I was completely drenched in sweat at the end of the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most people dislike this one","review":"I own TONS of Firm Videos and DVDs ... I own everything The FIRM. I love them! B U T I do not like this one. The work out is good, but she's not very charming and so its not fun to do. Janet Jones FIRM video or anything by Susan Harris are much better. Plus the workout from Jones or Harris are far better (which I know they didn't construct, but I'm using their names for definition).So... I feel bad giving this one a bad review, but it is the one FIRM tape that I am willing to throw out. 2 friends of mine tried it and did not want to keep it, but they liked the others.That's it.

Sandahl is a fun kinda sexual instructor and the \\"aerobic interval\\" phases leave me refreshed and energized. I do this workout with heavy poundage and find it really gives me a good fanny lift as well as hitting the ole hip flexors. I wouldn't suggest it for beginners -- I do think one should have a solid grounding of weight training before attempting a Firm (or at least one of their earlier videos) -- but the genuis of the Firm is that they never grow stale. 15 years after the making of this workout, it still packs a great punch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alleviating critics","review":"One of the few graceful big pressure indie sophomores that felt slightly compromised from one perspective, but enhanced in the next. The kind of follow up that does refine some of the grittier urgencies which made the debut stick out but in trade gets expansive production and refined compositions. Unfortunately it could have even been better had they spent the time end it properly, and by that I mean it was too short only just over a half hour with the wrong closer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down Stroked","review":"Room on Fire is pretty much a mixed bag. Its true that the strokes seem to only have one style of song, but on Room on Fire they try out some different rhythms and guitar textures. There are several exceptional tracks and cool guitar riffs flow throughout. Although I personally expected a bit more, I think this album fares better than most nowadays, thus the 4 star rating. Over all this is a solid (and a bit repetitive) effort.Dan"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is It!","review":"A bit of an offset from Is This It, with more complicated bass lines and extravagant riffs, Room on Fire has it down. This album is well done. Each track manages to meld with one another, that is until the wonderful surprise of \\"Under Control\\" where The Strokes go 50's. The rawness of it is amazing. From lead singer, Julian Casablancas, explicitive use of the phrase \\"Say what?\\", to Nikolai Fraiture's jumpy bass, this album is a must for 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this it 2","review":"this album is \\"Is this it?\\" 2. But, i liked is this it, so it works for me. The strokes sound like nothing else on the radio, and every band has to be influenced by other bands.

How? room on fire has ONE pic of them, and you cant even make out who is who. lynyrd skynryd had more pictures.jus my two cents"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of 2003! Fun to listen to!","review":"This album is one of the best. It is this year's \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" (Coldplay if you are not literate in music)! Yes, this sounds alot like \\"Is This It?\\", but who cares?! It's the Strokes! That's all that matters! I only have one thing to complain about on this album is that the CD is only 33 minutes. To me, this is what I consider to be an EP. To be considered an LP would be 40 minutes or more. Why can't we have a long Strokes album? Are they afraid to bore the audience? Come on Strokes, bring out a 40+ minute album! It'll make me love you guys even more. On the plus side, this is better than Is This It?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They're still the best at what they do","review":"These guys have been able to bring back the style of the 80's and make it fresh for today. It's nice to hear something different than what is forced on you by commercial radio. The album is just fun to listen to. If you listen to every album thinking that it's going to be a life changing experience, you won't enjoy a lot of the good music that's out there. \\"What Ever Happened?\\", \\"Automatic Stop\\", and \\"12:51\\" are great songs that you can listen to over and over again.P.S. To \\"Pissed Off Critic\\" and you other Britney freaks(Cranky Reviewer), why are you listening to this type of music? All your reviews bash good albums and glorify braindead music like Duran Duran. How can you put a remark in your review of an alternative rock band that says, \\"Justin and Britney aren't on it, why buy it?.\\" You insult the album because you can't dance to it? Did you misinterpret the type of music you were listening to? Stick to the type of music you know about best. Mindless noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is This It 2??

Every single song on the CD is catchy, and the style of the music is unique, from the pop-stylings of \\"What Ever Happened\\", to the more rock n' roll of \\"The Way It Is\\" to the keyboardisque bass of \\"12:51\\" to the excellent guitar of \\"Automatic Stop\\", every track is a whole new song, a whole new musical journey, The Strokes are definitely one of my musical influences, with me playing the drums, and now that I can play the whole CD, im very happy, Julian Casablancas' low-toned singing is very cool, with Fab Moretti's symbol-snare based drumming that I learned how to do, The Strokes also have 1 of the best style of clothing ever, I am starting to dress like them now, with there tight jeans, old t-shirts, jean jackets, messy hair, its just such a cool style. I highly reccomend this CD to any rock fans who are looking for something new. You Will Not Be Dissapointed!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i hope this is it","review":"other than Reptillia and 12:51 this CD basically sucks. The two mentioned songs kick ass but the rest of this album deserves to be burnt then burried and then dug back up to burn again. I would not recomend waisting money on this CD. Besides even if you like it the whole damn CD last only about 30 minutes so you don't even get time to savior it."},{"rating":"2","title":"catchy","review":"CATCHY is the key word with the Strokes. Not GROUNDBREAKING. Not REVOLUTIONARY. Not VELVET UNDERGROUND (because Lou Reed wasn't always catchy. Think I'm wrong? Listen to \\"The Black Angel's Death Song\\" 20 times in a row and see if you don't want to throw your stereo out the window).The Strokes truly define CATCHY. The reliable drums, the expert guitars, precise as ever, driving infectious melody. The lyrics don't sound like they care one way or another. \\"Don't wanna be forgotten. Don't wanna be reminded\\" Even the hair, the clothes, the voice, all preordained to require a minimal amount of effort. It doesn't even sound as if they put any work into the album, but for some reason I get the feeling that it does take quite a bit of tinkering to perfect the impression, or the illusion, of carelessness.But why analyze the grand mystique that is the Strokes when you can just pop in the CD and turn it up?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rock","review":"When this album came out it got great critical reviews, but they ended up hurting it in the long run because of the over hype. Some critics claimed the band to be \\"the saviors of rock n' roll\\" in the fury of their first release ofIs This It. While both of their releases contain some great rock n roll tunes that are incredibly catchy and memorable, there just isn't anything original. But then again it's kinda hard to come up with something ground breaking and original when just about everything has already been done.Singer Julian Casablancas sings with a straightforward style a-la Lou Reed, yet lets it rip from time to time, kinda breaking away from his style on the first album. Oddly enough the guitars at times sound like synthesizers, making it a slight different from than their first album into a more new wave '80's vibe. The album is only a mere 33 minutes but it it sorta nice because it's not weighed down by boring \\"filler\\" tracks/songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Between Love & Hate","review":"MORE head nodding drum beats, pulsing, interweaving, layered guitars, infectous melodies and sing along if you can lyrics from the band you hate to love.\\"Wait, um gonna give it a break.

I never...WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!\\" -Automatic Stop"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pull The Vocals Out of the Mix","review":"This is a new review of an old record. I like the songs, good hooks, catchy, etc. I just have trouble listening to it because they decided the singer's voice was so crappy that they buried it with distortion into the buzzy guitar mix. Personally, I don't think the guy's voice is so bad, so I don't get why the producers and mixing engineers ruined a good record. Too bad you can't buy the multitrack raw cuts and make your own mix. Yeah, I know some people claim that this is a Strokes sound thing, but in my opinion it is just crappy production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Dear, is it really all true?!","review":"Did The Strokes really write an amazing sophomore album? Granted, the second release is not quite as good as its predecessor, but it's pretty damn close. \\"Reptilia\\" is probably their best-known and well-written track. Maybe the best song they've ever released. The sophomore album does show a bigger sense of maturity, but some people gave it crap because it sounded too much like The Strokes on Is This It. I must disagree. \\"Automatic Stop\\" sounds like nothing I've ever heard of, the first Reggae/Rock song I've known about. This CD is definitely one of my favorites and it changed the way I see \\"garage\\" rock forever. Definitely two thumbs up for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"It's a must buy. It's slightly less accessible then its predecessor, but after a few listens the songs flow together great. This is my second favorite album of the year right behind Radiohead's \\"Hail to the Thief\\".A lot of people criticize the Strokes for not evolving their music in the past 2 years, but they really are doing what they do best - making great songs with catchy hooks, mixed with the outstanding laid back vocal stylings of Julian Casablancas.This one is definitely worth the money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it.","review":"I bought this record after asking the guy at the shop for \\"something that rocks, and doesn't suck.\\" This CD completely fit the bill. It's the kind of album that you can listen to over and over again, the hooks become like friends, and you hear them in your head when you're not even listening to the music.Don't listen to the guys who think they are too cool for this disc. Once more then 5 other people like the same band they consider them sellouts. Listen to the album, judge for yourself.If you like the kind of music that rarely gets made anymore, something with a soul, something with a hook, then you will love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"they're on fire!","review":"This is just as good as the first album, \\"Is This It.\\" They have - in a way evolved but still keeping the same catchy rhythm that people just can't get enough of. I waited the whole month of October to get this CD and I'm telling you right now, it was damn worth it. It also arrives on nice date, nearing Christmas - probably the best time to listen to their tunes. I remember driving around Christmas last year while listening to \\"Someday.\\" It was fu*king awesome! I love the first track of this album - \\"What Ever Happened?\\"...12:51 is the first song to be put out and is a great choice - \\"we can go out and get 40s, fu*k going to that party..\\" That's something I would say, hehe. My favourite track would have to be \\"Meet Me In The Bathroom\\" mainly because of the Charlie Brown type of vocals. All in all, almost all the tracks are awesome.

However, upon finding a vinyl version of this album, I figured if I was to buy it, I should in style, and it sounds better for it. These guys aren't saviors, they are merely a band who plays tightly and writes songs that are retreads of earlier classics, yet sound like their own style. If you did not like their debut, there's a strong chance you will not like this album either. However, if you give them a chance, you may surprise yourself by enjoying \\"Room On Fire\\". Can't wait to see how they follow this up..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good, take it from a Skeptic","review":"I was all against the whole fad, the Strokes-Vines-Hives-White Stripes-etc. although I liked some of their songs. When I started to listen to this album, I wanted to hear how bad it was and what a fluke their first album was, and say it was too bad that the son of Elite's founder couldn't hack it no more. However, after a couple of listens (well, after a lot of listens now) I can say this is a pretty good album. Almost all of the songs have good melody and short strange lyrics. I love their guitar sound, especially on tracks 3, 4, and 9. That's as far as my review goes, I won't get into any further music trivia puzzling metaphors, other than to say it's good - at least listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I read lots of great reviews both for this album and its predecessor, Is This It, and I went out about bought Room on Fire on a whim. I listened to it all the way through once. I tried to listen to it again, but...couldn't. It was just so bad. The bass figures are the sort of simplistic crap you expect from a high school garage band, the guitar doesn't do anything interesting on all but maybe one or two songs, and the vocals are buried so deep in the mix that you can't even hear them (though after looking at the lyrics in the liner notes, I decided this wasn't necessarily a bad thing). The whole thing just seemed bland and uninspired. I really did want to like the album, honest. But bottom line, if these guys are supposed to be the \\"saviors of rock and roll,\\" I don't think I want to be redeemed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as anything they've done before","review":"Let me start by saying that Room of fire is a big disappointment to me. When I bought \\"Is this it\\", I was blown away within seconds by the low-fi still raw sound/noise of the opening track. When I gave this a try, I could not believe my ears. Why insist on the same technique? Why not take a step ahead and dare to push it to new limits? It seems like mister Casablanca and co. have been goofing around just looking forward to complete an album that is mediocre in comparison to their earlier work. Most of the songs sound like a pirate copy of some backstage rehearsal, and throughout the CD Julian does not seem very interested in opening his mouth to let a single clear word come out of it. I usually keep an open mind with new bands, especially when they are praised as the bearers of a new moment in music. But after listening to this bunch of incongruent noise I can only wonder, in a very Carrie Bradshaw way, Is this it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Room on Fire","review":"The Strokes have made another incredible album.

The Strokes have talent. Some of the guitars here are great, if formulaic, and sweet. I've seen The Strokes live and both guitar dudes know what the hell they're doin'. Moving on, though, the bass player is incredibly inept, and Julian Casablancas is quick to get on nerves with that grating voice of his.I must say that \\"Reptilia\\" is one of the best rock songs I've heard in a long, long, LONG time. It gave my rating the extra star to make it two (**). That's about all this album has going for it, however, and that should be frowned upon. Listen, \\"Reptilia\\" was recently released as a CD single. Buy that instead, and save a few bucks.The Strokes are NOT the saviors of rock 'n roll. Some of you have mentioned The White Stripes.

The rock critics kept telling me how great they were, so I bought the first album and found it pleasant enough, but spent little time in my CD player. Then the follow-up and more hysterical orgasmic moans from the music press, so I caved in and discovered... ROOM ON FIRE. Yawn. Another reviewer mentioned the vocal distortion device, which left me wondering, \\"can this guy really sing?\\" The band sounds mechanical and devoid of passion. The best word I can use is \\"underwhelming\\"... not really bad, just competent.

Sold it back as used to record shop bought from!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over Substance","review":"The strokes have ripped out the skeleton of bands like television and the velvet underground and given it a cute little bow tie and are now selling it back to a new generation. The music on Room on Fire is delivered in the laziest and most apathetic fashion possible because thats what's perceived as \\"kewl\\" these days. The lo fi production is truly an ingenius gimmick because they're not only saving money in the studio but also marketing it as trendy and fashionable. This music may be more tolerable than britney but it's still the same in principle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"If you desire just plain noise - this is the album for you.Didn't see anything noteworthy in it - only when it concluded, the silence was wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Return of The Strokes","review":"Two years after the strokes released their smash - hit debut album \\"Is This It?\\"in 2001, they've finally returned with another great CD. Bassically, if you enjoyed their first album, you will like this one as well. It's the exact same formula that the band used on their previous album. Alot of people have complained about the length of the album, which clocks in at about 33 minutes with 11 songs. It's all about QUALITY not quantity. So many bands nowadays overproduce their albums, but not the Strokes. I kind of prefer short albums anyway. My only complaint is the 2 year wait for \\"Room on Fire.\\" I guess they were touring so much for \\"Is This It?\\" that they probably didn't have time to write for awhile; but lets be honest - It wouldn't take that long for them to create a 30 min. CD with such simplicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Strokes \\"Room On Fire\\"","review":"\\"What Ever Happened?\\" (5/5): An amazing opener.\\"Reptilia\\" (4/5): The second single. Music to my ears.\\"Automatic Stop\\" (3/5): One of the not so good songs on the cd.\\"12:51\\" (5/5): This song is so catchy, can't stop listening.\\"You Talk Way Too Much\\" (4/5): Another great song.\\"Between Love And Hate\\" (4/5): A melodic catchy track.\\"Meet Me In The Bathroom\\" (3/5): Not a great song\\"Under Control\\" (3/5): Another pretty stale tune.\\"The Way It Is\\" (4/5): The album starts to pick up again here.\\"The End Has No End\\" (5/5): One of my favorites.\\"I Can't Win\\" (4/5): Not a bad closing track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tanto tiempo para esto........?","review":"Realmente que existe mucha decepci��n debido a la falta de imaginacion de esta banda que probablemente se sobrevaloro con el primer album que ralmente tiene como 3 o 4 temas muy buenos y los demas aceptables...... para haber sido el debut me parecio buen disco pero no a niveles a los cuales se les llevo. Actualmente existe una carestia de nuevos talentos que propongan algo nuevo o por lo menos que reinventen algo la verdad que este segundo disco no me parece que haya tenido algun sentido de salir a la venta, pareciera como que son los materiales ineditos que tenian reservados.....en fin. Y para esto se tardaron tanto en editar un disco ? realmente que sera la ultima vez que considere a este grupo>"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Strokes do it again","review":"Before the cd came out I was a little scared that The Strokes would do something to make a crummy cd. Well when it came out, I was impressed, until I noticed a lot of the tracks are much shorter then in Is This It. It really got me mad at first, but when you listen to the songs, they feels complete, unlike some short songs. When I say short songs, I mean over the two minute marker. Also their new cd sound similar to their first one, but what is there to change? You might say, \\"Is this better or worse then their first cd?\\" Well, it is kind of hard to say, I really have no favorite. They are both great cds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring","review":"Clearly these were tracks left off their 1st release. No energy, no imagination, no creativity, no life, no soul.Britney Spears(ugh)makes more of an effort than these guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it or not they are a pop band.","review":"I like this album. I listen to it every few months from beginning to end. If it got stolen I'd buy it again. I just can't see writing 3 pages worth of praise and devotion to a POP band who don't even take themselves that seriously. It's not as if they reinvented music as we know it. This band, and others like them, get way too much praise for churning out good POP songs...although they are \\"indie/alt-rock/throwback\\" etc. their videos still get played alongside Brittany Spears and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as \\"Is This It\\" but still a very good sophmore effort","review":"\\"Is This It\\" was a pretty hard album to beat, and I think they realized that. \\"Room On Fire\\" is similar, but not in a way where you think \\"hey this is just 'Is This It' but with more songs\\". Like the first album, \\"Room On Fire\\" contains no filler and is pretty much just as enjoyable (it's very much a foot-tapper). Like \\"Is This It\\", \\"Room On Fire\\" also has a bunch of hit-worthy songs that help make it appealing to the masses (\\"Reptilia\\" for example). Every song is laced with a very catchy beat or guitar hook and they mostly contain interesting lyrics, although Julian still sounds kind of emotionless most of the time. Nevertheless, if you like rock or are a fan of The Strokes you'll most likely enjoy this album. Recommended!Highlights include:the entire album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired, Fresh Rock & Roll","review":"Obviously Mr. \\"heidikakes\\" down there doesn't have a clue. He slaughtered this album in the most mindless ways insulting it as if it were his mission in life to do so. This guy obviously is not a musician and he also obviously does not understand music in the slightest. What kind of moron trashes an album so utterly and completely in the fashion that he did? Really heidikakes you must have some serious anger issues. Did you get beat up in the schoolyard by The Strokes? Seriously, dude, you need therapy.Besides getting my beef with that idiot off my chest I would like to say that if you are an intelligent person and a music lover you will enjoy this music a LOT. The Strokes' sophomore effort is better than their first disc in my opinion, and it sounds so much more like rock than a lot of bands that are out there these days. Give this one a listen, I guarantee it will not be anything like what heidikakes claims it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review for the awesome room on fire!!","review":"Hello! This album is truly a must. The strokes have ,in a way, grown with room on fire by experimenting with new sounds. Songs like \\"Reptilia\\", \\"Under Control\\",\\"I can't win\\"....heck the whole album make you listen and pay attention to every chord that Nikolai, Nick and Albert play , to every beat Fab creates and Julian's not-so-soothing-but-nice-in-a-really-really-good-way voice. I really liked \\"is this it\\" and I'm a huge fan of them...but sometimes....I get annoyed in their songs \\"You talk way too much\\" and \\"The way it is\\"...but other than that, one of the greatest albums.....PICK IT UP NOW!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"the strokes are alive","review":"this album lives up to the hype. I think it really is great. The perfect follow up to the perfect band...THATS RIGHT. \\"You Talk Way Too Much\\" and \\"The End Has No End\\" make this album worth getting. It has been dismissed as a \\"carbon copy\\" of Is This It but that is a weak argument. This album is darker, few songs have the same unreserved singalong feeling as \\"Last Nite\\" and \\"Someday\\". \\"Reptilia\\" and \\"12:51\\" are both hits without choruses, but somehow you dont notice. The guitar playing is great as can be expected from Valensi and Hammond Jr. This album is worth your time. The only reason I give it four stars is because there is no element of surprise with this album, whereas with Is This It I am still amazed with it. This album delivers in all the right places (catchy riffs, great vocals, an air of cool) and you would be foolish to not at least listen to it."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],N={key:0},B={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-434e7749"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/22.md","filePath":"sponsor/22.md"}'),P={name:"sponsor/22.md"},L=Object.assign(P,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
