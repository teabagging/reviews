Mont Abbott was born in obscurity, and lived a humble, hardworking life on the land. But his life story is made poignant by tragedy, and enriched by a wonderful memory, and zest for life.

There was also absolutely no sex in this book, unlike Ms. Hayes other stories (if its a love story, there needs to be at least ONE love scene!) I also didn't buy that a married woman would fall instantly in love with the lady from the past because they barely exchanged more then a few words.

All things considered, at least listen to this album first, don't be like me and take a gamble and pick it up without hearing it. If you like bands like Godsmack, Disturbed and Hatebreed, you might think this cd rocks. But if you prefer slamming Death Metal, you may want to be forewarned.

To some extent, it suffers from immediately following the excellent Turing Test, as Endgame covers much the same ground, being a cold war spy drama instead of a WWII one. But it's a very quick light read, good for a warm summer day.It's somewhat odd at times that there's a lot of focus on the Doctor's lost memory -- by this point, he's been without his memory for over fifty years.In the end though, this series of Doctor Who novels is turning out to be the best I've read in a long time, starting with the Burning but especially Casualties of War and the Turning Test.

As a electroclash or new wave revivalist band Ladytron was doing a great job and everybody was wishing to hear the evolution on their next album. This is not an evolution, its a change of style. They are trying to be Franz Ferdinands clone and may I say, they do it very wrong. IF you were hoping to hear the same Ladytron it was used to be but with new fresh ideas you will be dissapointed. This is Ladytron as a B class punk revival group. No melodies, no hooks, no catchy songs, no memorable songs, no nothing.

However I came back and listened again after a few months, and I found them strangely addicting. Songs, one after another started sticking very persistantly in my brain, and before I knew it I owned everything of theirs that I could get my hands on. The band has a rather enchanting sound that is very sublime and beautiful, matched with with a smart head for songwriting that gives them a very dreamy feel.

That's crazy! Especially when you can buy a lowend laptop for about the same price and have alot more functionality. Forget the small size.

I bought a HP 360 LX handheld PC two years ago. It is the old version of the new Jornada. The stylus system went crazy, and I sent it to HP to repair. Well, they want to charge me more than the price of a new one! I have tried to complain to HP. It was a waste of time. They could not care less about customers. I am now about to buy another Palmtop (not HP, of course). I have talked to many electronic stores, and they all say that HP palmtops are not reliable, and break down easily. They also say that HP is very arrogant and never helps its customers.

With the ability to type notes have a calender and well, the email ability is very helpful. I have small hands and the keyboard is a nice feature since I am not one who could use the digital keyboard on some of the Palm models.(Although if your hands are some-what larger this may not be for you.) This may not be the smallest thing but it could easily slip into a purse or a pocket.(very helpful for me since I have books to carry!) I also was delighted by the touchscreen feature,and the fact that I could make short recorded notes on my way from class to class! Although this may not be the best present for a child much under my age, but it would make a great gift for someone on-the-run or who likes neat tech-no gadgets! ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP Jornada for Ham and APRS stuff","review":"I got a Jornada for my local group of the Emergency Communations as we can keep track of units by APRS (Automatic Position Reporting System) it allows the Net Control (NC) to keep track of everyone without having to ask over the air. I have the same program on the palm but the screen is so small and I have a greyscale one that the priority messages that arrive in color I can't see. The Jornada has solved all of that. The nice thing about the unit as it's color and it has a real keyboard that I can type on whereas the plam did not. Also the keyboard on the palm would cut out if there was new traffic and I was typing a message. another nice plus is that I can run the unit off of 12VDC with a portable printer, the radio, and the GPS all in the car if need be. I have had this unit for about six months now and love it.

Although the manual says you can set it up to do this, the techs at HP don't have a clue about how to make it work. After paying the best technical guy I know for a full day's time, he also couldn't make it work. If you remember to leave your desktop computer on, you can pick up email in the Active Sync mode. But if you forget, you're out of luck. This seeems to be due to the fact that Windows CE, like many Microsoft products, just has too many bugs. The Jornada is NOT ready for prime time.

Upon relistening I realize I was listening too loud, attempting to get more than was realistically possible.Leaving aside the question as to where to properly place and rate this work in the pantheon of Shostakovich symphonies, the performance here is first rate: I have heard other performances that I like equally well, but this one will do just fine. When it comes to the audio, this was recorded at a rather low level, no doubt to prevent overloading during the final loud passages. It might well have benefited from a bit of gain-riding by the engineer at the end, to bring the overall record level up a bit. Before I had cranked my headphone amp up high enough that it ran into clipping during the coda. Be warned. Too much gain will result in things going wrong at the end, if you are not careful.

The little surprises in plot and dialogue are cute and funny. The characters are realistic and you like them both equally.

In fact, it gives me an opportunity to discuss with my children that they should follow rules, but will never be \\"kicked out\\" for their transgressions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendship is the Compromise of Differences","review":"This is the story of a baby fruit bat, also known as the \\"flying fox\\", named Stellaluna who fell off of her mother's belly during an assault on them by an owl, who is bats' natural enemy, as they flew in the night sky. Stellaluna, whose weak wings not being ready to fly yet, finds herself in a bird's nest among chicks. And a beautiful friendship begins as Stellakuna assumes the role of a \\"good bird\\" and becomes a member of the family. Soon nature makes them realize how different Stellaluna is from the other birds. Ultimately friendship proves to be the strongest force of nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent book.","review":"Stellaluna is an excellent book for kids.

It's about a bat who reunites with its mother and on the way, she meets some friends. I liked the story. The story is for anyone! I give this book a 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Stellaluna","review":"Stellaluna is a precious story that is beautifully illustrated. A young bat falls from her mother's grip during an owl attack and lands in a nest of baby birds. They notice one another's differences when Stellaluna has a distaste for grasshoppers and hangs upside down. She struggles to obey the rules of the nest, but does her best to fit in. Finally, she happens upon some bats and learns that her ways are not wrong - just different.I deducted one point for the same reason as the reviewer with an adopted son who gave this just one point. I wish the author had been a little less harsh in the wording of the mama bird who threatened to kick Stellaluna out of the nest if she didn't obey their rules. Maybe there could have been consequences or merely a request to keep the rules in order to not endanger the other young birds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing illustrations, great story, and real facts!","review":"Janel Cannon's illustrations are reason enough to love this book, yet they are not the only reason. The story of Stella Luna, a lost young bat taken in by a family of birds that are confused (to say the least) by Stella's preference of sleeping hanging from the bottom of the nest - and her diet is not the diet of bugs the birds eat. Those differences though, don't stop the birds from loving and protecting Stella when she needs it most, and before it is all over, she is able to return the favor for all her foster bird-sibs. Once you have enjoyed the beautiful drawings and the heart warming story, read through the bat facts at the end - also wonderfully and accurately illustrated, and full of the answers those young inquiring minds will want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Illustrated, valuable life lessons","review":"This is a sweet story of a baby bat who is separated from her mother and raised by a mother bird along with her other baby birds. Stellaluna tries to fit in, even though she is not at all like her \\"bird siblings.\\" The illustrations in this book are fantastic and the story-line is fabulous. There are numerous life lessons to be gleaned from this delightful picture book.~DeeDee Fox, Author of The Ruby Red Slippers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellaluna will forever hold a place in my daughters heart","review":"Danielle was first introduced to Stellaluna when she use to go to school early with her grandmother who was a teacher-librarian. She spent her time before school reading books. When she first read Stellaluna she fell in love with it. Danielle loved stellaluna so much that she wrote out the story and made a drawing of each picture on the right page so she could have her own copy. We had it bound for her just like a real book. She was 5 at the time. Danielle is now 10 and has the book as well as the stuffed bat. She still sleeps with stellaluna every night and takes her on all her trips.

Lens arrived in peach condition. Everything on the lens functions as it should and for the money; it gives a good focal range. Pictures taken with it are wonderful.

But, if you are starting out; you can't beat it.I would definitely recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to specs","review":"I was very disappointed with this lens. It has a very cheap feel and the image quality was terrible. I was only able to test it with my Canon 20d and not with film. I couldn't believe how lousy it was, I had read some other reviews and they seemed positive. I tried it on a tripod and shot a variety of things text and 3-D objects and never could pull a sharp photo. I noticed that I had to use a lot more unsharp mask than normal to be useable. I tend to use primes a lot and so maybe I expected to much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Documentary Lens","review":"I've had this lens for a few years now, and I absolutely love it. It is compact, sharp, and dependable. I'm a wide-angle shooter, so this one is just about perfect. Canon's USM is beautiful. Unlike Nikon, Canon seeks and achieves quiet, fast, and accurate auto focusing. Coupled with a light and quiet EOS camera body, and you've got an excellent documentary kit, great for shooting people in close and personal. At 24 mm, this lens gives excellent range for close work, with lots of depth and sharpness, making focusing and composing a cinch in evolving situations. My only gripe with this lens is its manual focus ring. I grew up with manual focus, and I love excercising that skill, but this lens has nothing more than an obligatory, plastic, and poorly placed focusing ring that discourages manual work. Fortunately, Canon's autofocusing system is phenomenal. Round-out your EOS kit with a Canon SpeedLite (compatible all the way down to 24 mm)."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH...........

It fell between the \\"puke rock\\" days of Reek and Symphonies and the more well-known days of Heartwork. But people, this album is Carcass at the top of their art. Adding Michael Ammott as a second guitarist made a huge difference, Ammott and Steer having recognizably different and complementary lead styles. The production was cleaned up immensely, making this a far more listenable album than either of the first two. As a die-hard Carcan, this is their #1 album. Period. The music, the attitude, the sound, it's all there.If you're into any kind of metal at all, thrash, death, black, give this one a listen. I bet it makes you go and buy Heartwork, and then you'll never be the same again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is death metal in its finest hour.","review":"Carcass was the first death metal band I ever listened to and I've listened to many since, but they will always remain my favorite. Necroticism: Descanting the Insalubrious is by far their best album. This is the one CD after they had refined their brutality, but before they ventured into the more mainstream sound. Don't get me wrong, their other work quite surpasses that of most other bands of this genre. Evidence of this can best be found on Wake Up and Smell the Carcass.

I was excited to see this book because it looked like exactly what I needed but overall I was disappointed. The material in this book is VERY basic. It would be appropriate for someone with NO knowledge of the beauty industry or business in general. Anyone who has any industry knowledge or who has done even the most basic research will find nothing new here. Much of the information is basic business knowledge that I hope most people contemplating opening a business would already have.

The size difference is not a matter of breaking in and a little stretching that may occur, it is far greater than that.

I like them so much because they all have a wide toe box which is good for my feet, however, I have found that a size 10 in one style of shoe is definitely not the same as a size 10 in another style.

I would highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in deliverance and the role of satan in our current world."},{"rating":"2","title":"great insight","review":"This is an amazing book, it gives a great insight in the thinking and believes of the people who provide exorcism which has nothing to do with the popular beliefs about this procedure.Fr, Gabriele Amorth takes his calling very serious and gives good examples about why and what he does. It is interesting that the ritual was developed in 1614 and of course includes and is based on that time thinking. Also revealing is how the Catholic church sees the position of Mary, Jesus' mother. What is somewhat disturbing to me is that Fr. Amorth obviously believes that there are witches and sorcerers who have power over people. Sounds very much as in the black times of witch hunting and can be dangerous for certain people.I think that this book is best understood by Catholics but may be also very useful for everybody else who is interested in exorcism. I would advise to read it with the necessary critical open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-inspiring","review":"Fr. Amorth comes across as a very sincere, devout and orthodox ecclesiastic. He warns the readers about the danger and theologicall shortsightedness of ignoring or dismissing demonic possesssions. Agreed. He mentions several times in his book the work of Fr. Candido Amantini, a Passionist priest and exorcist who was his \\"mentor\\". While I feel very happy and greaful for Fr. Amorth's ministry and service to the Church, I also feel that his narrative (resulting from years of experience)is boring and uneventful and that his exorcisms were not as dramatic and tragic as Fr. Candido's (luckily for him!). I recommend readers who want to read about exorcisms and demonic possessions to read Malachi Martin's \\"Hostage to the Devil\\". The contrast between Martin's and Amorth's narratives is very palpable."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect compendium","review":"This is going to become a classic and a fundemental reading.This books is a complete overview of the complex subject of exorcism and the evil/demonic presence in the World. Fr.Amorth's treaty covers the whole issue with such clarity that he can make even the hardest thing simple to understand, so that this text is suitable for both experts in search for guidance and people who just start to be curious; but it is especially useful to those people who do have a certain familiarity with the subject but need a deeper, trustworthy and accessible education.Fr. Amorth keeps his treaty balanced and rational. He is respectful of science and although what he writes is obviously catholic based, it is going to make sense to whoever thinks that evil beings do exist, independently from the religious or spiritual background of the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Father Gabriele Amorth, the chief exorcist of Rome, excellently describes the reality of Satin and the other evil spirits, the power they can have other poor human souls, and the power God and Mary have over those demons.

It seemed since Vatican II the demon's influence on our daily lives has been hush hush. I have always prayed the Pope Leo XIII exorcism prayer for St. Micheal's intersession. This book reveals the Church's true belief in the reality of Satan and his demons. I just pray that priests take the devils attempts and successes to corrupt our contemporary society more seriously and preach on the demonic presence and encourage prayer by the faithful for his admonishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"As a good and true Catholic, I believe in the reality of demonic possession and in the authority and power of the Church to exorcise demons from those people they plague and torment. Having said that, however, I'm disappointed in the books I've read on exorcism. Putting myself in the shoes of a skeptic, I know how uncomfortable, embarrassed, and unpersuaded I'd be by these efforts. Father Amorth's book is no exception. Granted, it may be partly the fault of the amateurish writing (or the translation), but the good Father comes across as, well, rather silly. I'm sure he's not, but that's the impression with which I'm left.Furthermore, Father Amorth is clearly an adherent of the charismatic movement within the Catholic Church. In the interests of full disclosure, I must say that this movement is not at all my cup of tea; I consider it far more Protestant than Catholic.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Exorcist","review":"This book was written by an Italian priest who has held a very high position in Rome as an exorcist. If you are interested in exorcisms and demonic possession this seems to be a credible source that is not sensationalized.

The MPI tape shows a picture of marine in WWII battle dress, so it can be easily distinguished from the 1936 classic.

The DVD covers the very basics of the long and short games, and offers a few additional tips for females and seniors. However, there is no substitute for professional face-to-face instruction. I later took a group training class at a local golf club and learned 10 times as much from the instructor compared to the DVD, but the cost was also 10 times the cost of Ledbetter's DVD.

In these early Wildcats stories the cast are little more than 'cool' names, powers and guns. Most of them don't even get a civilian name or appear out of costume.Lee's art is the one strong point but even it suffers from garish colors and busy character designs. And he relies far too much on two-page spreads to cut down on the number of panels he has to draw.Later the Wildcats would get some depth under writers like Alan Moore and Chris Claremont but in this book they're just not that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP","review":"Windows PC users.

The movie is fun enough, but not a drive-in classic. It was released in 1972 under the title HOT SUMMMER WEEK, and then later retitled GIRLS ON THE ROAD. The girls only spend the first half of the film on the road, so the retitling is a bit exploitative (wow-a drive-in movie being exploited?).One of the girls is played by Kathleen Cody, who mainly played \\"the girlfriend\\" or \\"the cute girl\\" in some Disney comedies. It's fun to see her get a little trashy in this film, and a nice change from her normal goody-two-shoes personna.Those who enjoy films like THE YOUNG GRADUATES (1971) and THE YOUNG CYCLE GIRLS (1978) would probably like this one, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Ok Movie, One Crazy Movie.","review":"The movie came with two movies, the one with Michael Ontkean in it is good.but the other movie was terrible, and it dosn't even have Michael Ontkean it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in Good Shape","review":"This book did not come in good shape as it said it was.

In fact, everytime you stop, back up to review what you just dictated and start again, it creates a new file. My first letter had 60 voice recording files!!!

This is a great full sized brush that is firm enough that your teeth feel clean and fresh but not too firm to harm your gums (may be too firm for someone with sensitive gums)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Story - Different Title","review":"What a disappointment! Nowhere did I see that this was a reprint of \\"McDuff's New Friend\\" when I ordered it...and to make matters worse it was done in the same cheap looking format as the most recent new release, \\"McDuff's Wild Romp\\". Gone are the wonderful glossy pages with the beautifully detailed artwork; gone are the dustjackets. How sad. Take a pass on this one and buy new copies of the original \\"McDuff\\" stories instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Story","review":"I must have read this book every day before Christmas, once that day came and went it was still my childs favorite McDuff Story, two months later I was able to pack it away for next year's holiday reading. We just love the McDuff Books."},{"rating":"1","title":"McDuff books","review":"I bought this book not knowing that it was the same as one I already had, with only the title changed. Big disappointment, but the book itself, in its previous incarnation, was lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good introduction to Doumbek","review":"This DVD is a very good choice for beginners and it also serves as good reference material for intermediate percussionists like myself.The instructor is very clear and his technique is superb. The video starts with simple but important exercises that get more and more complex. All main Arab rhythms are covered and there are some nice demonstrations of what they sound like in a performance.The one thing that is missing is an actual performance, where the viewer could see the different rhythms in a whole song, as well as have a taste of more advanced techniques, which are not addressed in this DVD.If you want to start to learn how to play the doumbek or want to improve your basic technique this video is a must. It's probably useful for bellydancers and other musicians wanting to get familiarized with Arab rhythms.Hope it helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely recommended.","review":"Fantastic material. Techniques are presented very didactically with rhythm notation on screen. Very useful for the beginner drummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doumbek DVD","review":"I really enjoy this DVD. Amir is a good teacher. He shows great basic classical Arabic doumbek technique. Amir takes that further by demonstrating technique in the context of middle eastern rhythms. Then within each rhythm Amir shows several, increasingly more complex variations to challenge your newly learned techniques. This DVD is good for beginners as well as seasoned drummers wanting to polish up their classical Arabic technique on the doumbek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional learning format.","review":"This video is of a thirty year veteran of playing, who has forgotten the harder parts of the learning curve.He has a slick way of getting you to practice and play with him. After a month of watching a practicing, I wish I could meet him. If you want to learn the doumbek, Get this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great informational book","review":"I love chemistry and the elements, and this book didn't let me down. It is very interesting to ready and covers most areas about each of the compounds. It also lists the major uses and even some of the health problems associated with the elements. The pictures are also very good. The pictures represent the elements themselves or the uses of the elements. This helps a lot. There are only two small things I don't like about the book. First, it doesn't give much basic information. I would recommend \\"Exploring Chemical Elements and their Compounds\\" by David L. Heiserman. The two books together create a treasure trove of information. The other problem is just a small one. The author focues a lot on the uses in radioactive procedures. I guess that doesn't interest me too much. Otherwise this is a great book! I would suggest you get this book for personal use or even for schooling purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've bought it five times!","review":"I have now bought this book five times, because I keep giving them away.If you want clear, interesting, and learned text, this is a perfect reference book.

We took a cruise to Alaska from Vancouver and I thought this would be a great little toy to take with me. Some of the pictures and video turned out great. Some was extremely grainy. Many of the pictures were completely out of focus, and while that does not surprise me on landscapes, portrait shots of people taken less than 12 feet away should not have focus issues. The video recorder itself works ok, but I would suggest spending just a little more and getting something with better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Cam","review":"This product is horrible, I brought this cam thinking the digital pictures would be great, they were horrible, NO FLASH, not many functions of selecting picture quality such as contrast. The cam is horrible both inside and outside. I wanted to take pictures of items that I made, but I spent over 30 minutes to take one picture that was clear. You have to supply your own batteries vs other cams it comes with a battery that you can recharge, so that was another waste of money. I will never buy a cam from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"When I bought this camera I assumed it had flash, it doesn't.

Compact, fits nicely in a purse or bag. camera takes great photos outdoors or indoors with plenty of light. If you are trying to take pictures indoors with low light, even with the flash, the pictures are often too dark to use. Camera eats AA batteries like crazy so I carry a package of AA batteries just in case. (\\"low battery\\" indicator always seemed to go off at the wrong time!). Speaking of \\"low battery\\" indicator: once it flashes, camera will NOT take another photo and will turn itself off until the batteries are replaced. View finder is a little deceiving: objects being photographed may not look clear but once I upload them into the computer, they are much larger and clearer than when I took them. All in all, its a good camera. Its not great but its okay - for a gift that I didn't have to pay for. I plan on upgrading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing camera","review":"I purchased a Samsung Digimax A400 camera; it was a very reasonable price and the seller listed it as \\"very good\\". It was not very good. I would rate it as fair to poor condition. The LCD would not display properly (it was nearly impossible to view), the USB cover was broken (this could have happened during shipment as it came in an envelope without bubble wrap or other protection!!). Overall, this was not the camera that I ordered. I contacted the seller and returned the camera. The seller noted that Amazon does not offer a fair or poor condition to choose from for item condition. If this is the case it seems very odd."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Insects Are My Life\\" is one of our favorite books.","review":"My grandaughter (age 4 and a half) loves this story. All of us have felt a little at-odds with the world at times and Amanda Frankenstein is no exception. She is a strong heroine with a passion for insects. She is a \\"toughie\\" - she can jump from 3 stairs while wearing her butterfly wings and stand up to teasing in school. She is a resiliant and likeable little girl who eventually meets up with another whose passion is reptiles. I would definately check-out any offerings by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insects Are My Life","review":"I guess I am partial about liking this book. The reason is that I am the mother of the Amanda Frankenstein, whose name was used in this book. When the \\"real\\" Amanda was young, she too liked bugs. I thoroughly enjoy sharing this book with the students at my school where I teach. The students love the story and that my daughter's name is in the book. It is a special book to my family and I as well. Mrs. McDonald wrote a cute story showing how girls can like bugs and things of nature. She also showed how students can meet others who share similar likes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insects are great!","review":"I like when Amanda Frankentein loves insects so much that she tries to act like one. Amanda wants to even let bugs in her window! I like that part where Amanda finally finds a friend that is a little like herself. The illustrations are so colorful and make me feel like a part of Amanda's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cool and smart girl!","review":"My mom asked me to read it since she thought it was a great book. I did. And I like it. Amanda looks like any nerd in school, but she is actually really smart and cool.She is smart because she knows everything about bugs, most of them in the story that I have never heard of. I would say she is an Einstein in the field of insects! I bet it takes a lot of hard work and a strong passion to be able to learn so much.Amanda is cool too. Nobody tries to understand her. However, she never gives up her passion even though she often gets herself into troubles for it. That's what a real hero is about.Well, I am glad that hero is not always lonely. At the end of the story, Amanda finally finds a bosom friend that shares the same passion with her. I like the happy ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Street Atlas USA 2008","review":"The product is confusing and hard to use. Very cluttered interface. While this was the 2008 version of the product, some major highway updates in Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2007 where not in this product. I thought this product was suppose to have new map updates? GPS interface also isn't very good compared to the GPS control panel in Sreets and Trips.One thing unique in this product is you can draw a new road on your maps. This is helpful if those highway updates never get made.I have used both this product and Streets and Trips. In my opinion, no comparison. Go with Streets and Trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a horrible. It is simply plaigarism","review":"This book was horrible. It mentions John Cromwell's book, \\"Hitler's Pope\\" in the forward and calls it \\"the latest contribution to the sorry genre,\\" but does nothing to refute it. This author is just plain bad. He does NO ORIGINAL RESEARCH!!! This book has only TWO SOURCES, namely, Pierre Blet's \\"Pius XII and the Second World War\\" and Pinchas Lapide's \\"The Last Three Popes and The Jews.\\"All this author does is repeatedly quote his two sources and fail to counter any of Cornwell's arguements.The bottom line: This book is the worst book that exists on this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Read- one of the best","review":"IN response to the recent trash novels about the role of the pope in WWII, this excellent book is a welcome arrival.The author shows with great accuracy how the pope saved directly or indirectly the lives of some 860,000 Jews.But why has Pius XII been so defamed? What has motivated the untruths? It has been the result, the author argues, of the Church's stance on sexuality. In fact, it can be easily argued and defended that as soon as the Church changes its teaching on sex and abortion, the \\"faith\\" would be welcomed with open arms by the left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but Good","review":"Dr. McInerny starts out slow, but builds to a nice rollicking finish. As an ex-Catholic I have little sympathy for his support of dogma, but I don't appreciate seeing th Church get bashed for things it didn't do either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome series Yoku Wakaru Gendai Mah","review":"I saw this on Crunchyroll a few years ago and I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD ever since. It's about a murderous sorcerer who wants to get his hands on a magic staff that is held by a young girl, whose best friend from the future uses magic (really a kind of powerful computer code that, when used properly, is very like magic)to go back and save her. The best friend, Kiyomi, is clumsy and scared, but brave enough to try anyway.The writing behind this story is more complex and interesting than most of the newer anime these days. The computer-code-as-magic idea is one fascinating example. The character designs are gorgeous, and at only 12 episodes, there's not that much filler, thankfully. The theme songs are very cute and catchy, and there is some fanservice. Oh, and if I remember correctly, some of the episodes are shown out of order, to make things seem more mysterious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the MP3 player?","review":"I bought this thinking it would be my do-it-all device.

Originally issued in 1992, it features second guitarist Robert Hampson, who would also play on the subsequent album \\"Pure\\". \\"S/CW\\" rather leans towards the industrial sounds of \\"Slavestate\\", with dominating machine drums (similar to Front 242 or Nitzer Ebb). Unfortunately, the guitar work often sounds like a bunch of uninspired noise and the melodies are weak. The time between \\"Streetcleaner\\" and the third album \\"Pure\\" was something of a career low in GF's history. \\"S/CW\\" is edgy, noisy industrial rock, but taken as part of the largely brilliant GF oeuvre, this item is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"New York texture\\" meets \\"french class\\" with raw honesty","review":"Wonderful New York additude & texture, with an articulate poetic sensibility.

In fact, it's a powerful story of the appalling commercial and political developement of that strange country. As such, it's rather dismaying, because the country is naturally beautiful, though awful as well as awesome, but what was done in it and to it is a tragedy. When you read Crawford's penetrating narrative, you get a sinking sense of the inevitable, merciless arc of history.

The prestige classes are really no better or worse the S&S, so if this is what you really are looking for, it's not the book for you.One of the things I really liked about this book goes into detail about possible uses to explore and roleplay that may never have been considered. It's very role-play oriented, giving more then just statistics of use, it gives you possible scenarios to use them in. I particularly liked the focus on mundane, every-day items and their use for a rogue.Some of the feats are redundant, but some of them open a path to some really interesting uses. It gives the character more depth then just the person to open locks and disable traps.This book was certainly worth the price and the wait.

As my children grew, I introduced them to this book. Both my sons read it while in middle school. My daughter read it a few years later. All three are now in their twenties and all three still love this book. My daughter has read every book in the collection and especially loved the books told from the perspective of Bean, a secondary character in Ender's Game. My sons have read all the sequels, including my younger son who does not always enjoy reading.The book feels as current today as it did then. The characters are completely engrossing, even though they are presented as children in this first book. The experiences they have as children define them and define their lives. I have re-read this book over and over again. It is on my shelf as one of my favorite books of all time, along with Dune, anything by Jane Austen, Lord of the Rings, and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Game","review":"This book is packed full of excitment and adventure as Ender goes through battle school. He may be young, and seem small, but he's the best of them all. I loved the whole concept of the school and the futuristic setting, but I found it to have a little too much battle in it. The overall book was excellent though. Ender has a very built up character aswell as some of his family and friends. They way everything works out in the end is perfect for this science fiction book. I would recomend this book to anyone who doesn't mind battles and likes ideas of the future.

It's the story of young Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, the third child created by the government as a child-genius, drafted to be a military leader, who suffers from loneliness, anger, and really misses his sister. If you're looking to be entertained for a bit, this book will do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most amazing book I have ever read!

The book made such an impact on me that I really cannot imagine what it would be like to not have read it. The other three in the series were also incredible books that followed the story of Ender. I hope that by reading this book it offers you a different perspective on the value of children in our scociety and the things that we can accomplish if allowed to put our creativity to good use. I think that the book can also be taken to the level of a fantasy novel that is entirely unrealistic, and this may be true, but the truth rings out throughout the novel, if you know where to look.

Meanwhile, his two siblings are controlling the Earth by joining some chat rooms on the internet. Yeah, right.

I can guarunty that 99% of the people who read this book will love it. This masterpiece by Orson Scott Card will be remembered by me for all of my life. Read this book or you will have really missed out. If you read this book I would read Ender's Shadow before you start Children of the Mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I really loved this book just because it was a really interesting plot and the games and training were so creative! I love the idea of the anti-gravity games and stuff. This is one of those books that you can read again without getting bored. My friend is reading it for the forth time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mother's 2 cents","review":"I have not read this book, but my 15 - year old son has. What is remarkable about this? My son HATES to read! This is the first book he has ever voluntarily read, and he is now reading others in the series. In my opinion, this is nothing short of a miracle. he is not only reading these books, he is devouring them! I caught him reading Ender's Shadow at 2:30 a.m. this morning. Always in the past when I caught him staying up till the early hours of the morning, it was because he was playing computer games. So, any parents of teenage sons who you despair of ever getting to read anything but comic books, I highly reccomend you try them on the \\"Ender\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"CARD AT HIS BEST BY: CVD GRADE:5","review":"This story takes place mainly in Outer Space. The main character is Ender Wiggin a very capable six year old. Ender is a normal boy, except for the fact that he was born a third child(considered a great humiliation by most.He is a genius among geniuses and the army is looking to recruit him. Ender excels in Battle School(a school that prepares students for intergalactic war).He gets promoted to commander.

A young boy named Ender must save the world from aliens and go through rigorous training. I liked the book a lot because it has a good message about life and death, and displays views of the future of humanity. I also liked the book because it gets into detail about what goes on behind-the-scenes, when Ender isn't around. It talks about how and why Ender was specifically chosen to save the world instead of his homicidal brother, Peter. There are many more books after this one in the series, which expand on Enders life and works. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes science-fantasy and war novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"The moment I picked up this book I couldn't stop reading, this is by far one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ender's Game","review":"While the story line is intriguing, the coarse language ruins it.

Which is also true of Miss Rand's work.The characters were two-dimensional and unsympathetic, and the writing pedestrian. Also, the big surprise twist at the end was a surprise chiefly because it was utterly, ludicrously non-credible.Don't waste your time. Go read Patrick O'Brian instead. It will be much, much harder going -- and it will be much, much more rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sci-fi classic","review":"Ender's Game is a great read and a classic in the genre. The concepts, characters, and overall story are fully fleshed out and realized. Seeing how Ender is shaped by the people in his life is the key the the novel.

It is well targeted at the middle schooler and above."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 10 for \\"Coming of Age\\" novels in Science Fiction","review":"I admit, this isn't the most mature novel you will ever read.

If you have \\"progressed\\" beyond this stage, then I am truely sorry for you. In being so, you miss out on what must be one of the top ten science fiction books of all time. To put it frankly, not the absolute best science fiction book ever written, but very, very close"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, but not the best ever.","review":"Many have given this book a 10, and written that it is the best ever. Other have given it 3's and written that is overly simplistic...Well, they are both right. The book is a great read, especially for 9-14 year olds. It is also fairly simplistic in therms of plot. But the characters are great, and the rials and tribulations of Ender are fantastically written. I could not recommend this book enough for older children.Adults should like this book as well, but the next book, Speaker For the Dead is much better for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game is a great book and everybody should read it.","review":"Ender's Game is a GREAT book that put you in the mind of the main charector Ender Wiggin. The book create a picture of Ender and his situation in your mind that is so powerful you feel like you've known Ender your entire life. You can relate Ender to yourself and improve on yourself just by reading the book. Ender is just a young \\"prodigy\\"who is responsible for defending the earth. If you haven't read this book already I strongly suggest it because in my opinion it is the best science fiction book ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wretched novel","review":"I bought this book wanting to like it. Given the awards it has won, I fully expected to like it. But I was completely disappointed. The reason for the book's popularity is clear: it panders to a very common personality flaw among young, intellectual males: a belief in one's own intellectual superiority, the notion that one is rejected simply because one is so much \\"smarter\\" than others of the same age. The way the characters talk about their own \\"smartness\\" is totally juvenile and ridiculous. This theme of the intellectually superior adolescent is also hackneyed beyond belief. It turns up over and over again, especially in science fiction; and no doubt this happens at least partly because the author knows it will sell to the cadres of geeks who imagine themselves geniuses. For a mature person, this sort of stuff is simply tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated puerile homoerotic guff from a man who professes to hate gays","review":"\\"I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and I tell you he's the one.

There are hardly any girls in the program because of thousands of years of evolution has left female unable to do this man-work. Or boy-work.I spot read most of the rest of the book and found I missed nothing in my assessment of this book and author. This dude is weird and can't imagine females in fighting roles.

Can women float around playing war?Let this crap go back into obscurity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had expected","review":"After reading the reviews here on amazon I expected to read one of the best sci-fi books of all time. I was truly dissapointed. In short i'd say that it was very hard for me to identify with the main character. He's so young and alone and different from everyone else. If that doesn't describe YOU then you will probably not think this book is so great. Maybe it's because i'm now in my 20's. I have read many great books in my life and this wasn't one of them. If you are a young reader and feel like an outsider then you will probably LOVE this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"move along, nothing to see here . . .","review":"the plot essentially involves super-genius children receiving military training in preparation for an invasion of alien insect creatures. much of the novel consists of detailed tactical descriptions of the equivalent of paint-ball played in zero gravity. the children then graduate to \\"command school\\" and rain on star-fighter simulators.The similarities between ender's game and the dreadful movie \\"Starship Troopers\\" only make matters worse.I read sci-fi either for (i) intelligent imaginings about future technology, or (ii) xeno-anthropology, for lack of a better term.Jack Vance and Iain Banks come to mind. This book lacks any of these qualities...However, the book has received good reviews from reputable sources, so maybe it just was not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci-Fi With a Surprise","review":"This was another book club selection. It was a quick, easy read - but left no real impact. A pure pleasure read - if you're into science fiction, that is. I thought the end was overly contrived...too cute. It was almost as is Card was getting as tired of the battle room as I was. Then, as if to suddenly try to redeem the book as more than just a video game fantasy, he rapidly ages his characters and gives them conscience struggles.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book. It's harmless, and there are worse books to read - but there are so many better ones out there, why waste the time? I'm just glad that I didn't shell out any money for my copy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated book I've ever read","review":"I got so many recommendations from friends about this book I thought I'd try it out. It was barely competently written, but somewhat forgivable since it was both an early work of Orson Scott Card's and also adapted from a short story. What wasn't forgivable was the incredible tediousness and complete absolute predictability of the story. There are no surprises at all - only stupid characters who fail to react to what is plainly obvious to every reader. This trend unfortunately continues in at least the second book Speaker for the Dead, which has even MORE STUPID characters who can't understand what is plainly obvious to the most intellectually challenged reader. This makes for a poor story and a poor reading experience, thus I cannot recommend this to ANYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pablum for the slow-witted masses.","review":"Science fiction for those who aren't capable of handling real science fiction. No mind-stretching concepts, no uncomfortable questioning of assumptions, no imagination required. A simple, easy-to-follow plot, written in small, easy-to-understand words. The ending is predictable from early on. Plenty of reassurance for the hard-of-thinking. As a short story, it was a bland attempt at an implausible premise stretched beyond the breaking point. Inflated into a pompous novel, it's a crime"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read for open minded people","review":"I read this book years ago, and still re read it from time to time. I loved it then, and still do. It takes an open mind to think of the characters as more than just people, but also as the essence of people. I have read thousands of books, fiction and non-fiction, and have found alot worth reading in this one. Some of the sequels are better than others, but Speaker for the Dead also reflects Card's ability to understand how people, not just individuals, but people work. Many of my friends have borrowed this book and every time I re-read it, I find more little notes in it with comments about the book or the characters in the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, but not the best in the series.","review":"\\"Ender's Game\\" is one of the best SF books I have read in a long time.

It is one of those books you can read again and enjoy. The caracters have depth and are believable, no all-good or all-evil caracters, even \\"sickly sweet little Valentine\\", as one reviewer has it, has her share of conflict and displays a darker side. This is not a \\"one little kid saves the universe\\" type of book in the good old pulp tradition. It's about being different, the pressure adults put on children to perform, making difficult decisions, and about empathy. And just in case that sounds boring, there's plenty of action for the lover of fast moving adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK","review":"I liked this book. I especially liked the fact that all of the children in Ender's Game were smarter than the adults. Not that all children aren't smarter than adults, but this book showed it.

The book is extremely well written, and for that reason alone it it worth a score of 10, but the main reason why I am writing this is because of the chord that the book struck within me. From the first few pages on, I was hooked. I related with Ender, and that is Card's best talent. The ability to make the reader feel and think the way that the current character is. Reading this book made me look back on my own life, and I realized how alike Ender and I were. I was taken away from my parents at an early age because I was also \\"too smart\\", and sent to a 'special' school. It is an unbelievably harrowing experience. One which Card tells as if he actually watched my life unfold. Read it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game","review":"Someone at school told me to read this book.

The plot is very detailed and informative. If you don\\"t get it in the beginning, you will probably not get the idea of the book. The author explains eveything and anyone who actually reads it should get it.

It was extremly interesting and anyone who hasn't read it should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an Ingenious Book!","review":"I totally loved this book from start to finish. Anyone who is a fan of the Playstation/Nintendo genre will love it too. Future Earth is at war with a race of aliens. The only hope in defeating the aliens lies in have \\"computer game simulation\\" like skills. Children are trained in a military academy using all kinds of virtual war games. The training is inspired by the skills of a great leader who was able to rout the aliens in one of the few decisive battles that the Earth had ever won against the alien.Endor, an outcast in society is thrust into the training academy where he proceeds to become possibly one of the greatest virtual game generals to ever train.The book also brings into play the idea of \\"forced\\" population control. In order to have a child, you must be approved by the government. Though apparently not a big issue with regard to the rest of the book it is interesting anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity in a book...","review":"This book just left me wanting a little bit more. The conflicts seemed contrived, the deceptions were weak and thinly veiled, and the twist was not really a twist at all but was pretty obviously there all along.It might be possibly because I'm used to relatively intricate plots and developed characterizations and the author admittedly states the story is kept simple. Perhaps it's because I read this book over 20 years after it was released. It does have its good points, and I am a fan of Card's other works, but this one just kind of felt... juvenile.The best part of the book was after the climatic \\"twist\\", when Ender goes out and about. That part seemed to be the most intriguing part of the book, since there actually seemed like there would be drama and conflict instead of just Ender conquering obstacle after obstacle.Perhaps, it's the Superman syndrome. It is difficult to make a story interesting when the protagonist is basically, admitterdly, undefeatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"Had several people tell me it was very interesting.

I also finished Xenocide and Speaker for the Dead in a day which is tough considering that I'm 12 and Xenocide is more than 500 pages. Orson Scott Card is the most Imaginative author that I know of. If you haven't read this book you haven't read. The idea about the battle room is amazing. He came up with the idea in high school. I have had an idea like that for awhile. I loved the ending. It was THE MOST CREATIVE ENDING I HAVE EVER READ IN A BOOK, EVER. The only reason that I gave this wonderful book a nine is that Card didn't explain some things, like what the Warsaw Pact was.

It is good for anyone. yes, it is about a boy, and there are almost no girls in it for us girls who are used to reading books about headstrong girls. But don't let that stop you!

What will happen? you gotta read to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're the type that reads book reviews...","review":"This book has become sort of a conversation piece among readers. The most important thing about it is that it exposes what people like and don't like about books. Don't go in expecting the Great American Novel. This is a science fiction story about a very gifted boy who is asked to do too much. It's not War and Peace, and if you expect it to be, you'll be sorely dissapointed. However, this is a book worth reading. First, it's a good story. Plenty of action, lots of fun, and a good sprinkling of family issues. It brings up important issues regarding government and war. In summary, if you can go in and just enjoy the book, do so. If you can't keep yourself from (over)analyzing it (and many people can't..there's nothing wrong with that), then skip it; it's not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very slow","review":"I chose this book strictly based on all the rave reviews. The first chapter or two kept my interest pretty strong. After chapter after chapter of Enders time in battle school I began to get a headache just from the serious lack of story. It was really like reading a self pitied diary about some kid in military school. I figured if I could just make it through the first half of the book the story would start to pick up. Unfortunately I wasn't so lucky. It just got slower! It was literally like you were reading different versions of the same chapter throughout the whole book! If this book ever makes it onto the movie screen I'm pretty sure there is going to be a lot of creative fluff added just to keep it visually entertaining. It was just so slow. Very little of the storyline actually held this book together. I did manage to suffer through the whole thing but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"What a fantastic book! I read this because I see a movie is being made about it. Sometimes greatness goes unnoticed because of everything else swirling around.

It is not suitable for kids, neither for adults.Card is a human hater, in his world, children are manipulated to hate each other by adults, to train them to be killing machines, to do that they need first kill each other, the only compassion in this book is from the buggers and for buggers, not for human.The writting style is awful, the story line is as good as an arcade game's(that's why it attracts kids, for worse), the character just keeps going to other levels to fight other monsters, yet they are all the same, only bigger.

Well cyall...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ender's Game is Lame!","review":"I had to read this book for class. I was very disappointed in the quality of this literature. It was so melodramatic! And they made Ender appear to be a semi-God. To keep it short, it was terribly boring. TERRIBLY. My suggestion to you is, RUN, RUN, Run away from Ender's Game, before you get boredom cancer like me!Kit-Kat, Tank, Manny, Nyk"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of truth","review":"This wonderful story of children is full of moral lessons for adults. Although it is a science fiction novel, it really deals with realationships more than hard science. Card draws out character in the most enjoyable way. A must read for readers of all ages. I really can't imagine the person who would not love this story -- perhaps fools who feast exclusively on Romance novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good SFI -","review":"A very well written story that keeps you involved with each of the characters. A unique twist to the old story of human meets alien and the efforts mankind will do to surive."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book rocks i luv scifi","review":"i luv this i luv luv it luv it you MUST get this book or i will buy it for you it is AMAZING"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender is the boy I have always dreamed of being.","review":"I am a 23 year old male in the United Sates Marine Corps. Not that it makes a difference to the people outside the military but Ender's Game is on the Commandant's Reading List for Marines that are Corporal and Sergeant. I myself am a Lance Corporal. I was first introduced to this book from my OIC and she spoke highly of the book. I decided to read the book and found myself staying up until 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning. I also found that I was emotional to the way Ender was treated and I wished I was there to help him. I have had my dreams and nightmares being in the military. One of my most interesting dreams is one in which I am extremely intelligent and nothing can throw me or stand in my way from achieving greatness. I aspire now to be like Ender. Orson Scott Card is now on my \\"Authors to keep an eye on\\" list. This book comes highly recommended from myself to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"It happened that I read Ender's Game after Speaker for the Dead. I didn't like Speaker for the Dead when I read it. Although the author told us Ender unwittingly eliminated the whole bugger race, I didn't understand *by heart* why Ender was so sad throughout the book.I read Ender's Game a few months later. I don't know how many readers read these two books in the same order as I did. The order does matter. I was not excited by Speaker for the Dead, therefore I was not looking for its prequel even though I knew both of them are Hugo and Nebula back-to-back winners. It was purely by chance that I only found Ender's Game when I searched for science fiction on a specific bookshelf. Then I thought, well, one book is better no book at all, I can take this book home.That was a brilliant decision. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book really spoke to me","review":"I found this book to be spectacular, and will continue to read Mr. Card's work since he does what the best Sci-Fi authors do. He stretches the imagination and the value structure that most of us take for granted. It's one thing to craft a good story, but it's quite another to make the reader think and question themselves for feeling a certain way. I have seen that some people feel that this book is written too plain, but I didn't for a minute feel that way as I torpedoed myself toward the exciting climax (which I would never dare spoil for anyone). Any great work polarizes, and I think this qualifies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the Best Story Telling...","review":"This is the first book I feel compelled to comment on. Card creates a remarkable charachter. This book transends the genre boundries and creates a stunning piece of work. I read it once when I was in 9th grade, and I re-read it again this summer, when I am a sophmore in college. I recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wonder how Peter Wiggin Compares to Bill Clinton?","review":"This book was one word...AMAZING. I may only be 16 years old, but even a Junior in High School can spot good literature. A must for fans of sci-fi. It is amazing how Mr.Card was able to envision back in 1977 the things just now possible on the big screen and things of which may be in the VERY near future. Some people may find this book slow and implausible, but those readers may be slow themselves because this book is at the speed of light!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT !!!","review":"I have read this book almost ten times and each time I read it I realize more things about myself through Enders experiances. I also just want to say that the book s expertly written for a 14 guy who just wants a plainly written easily understandable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent part of an amazing whole","review":"In response to many of the negative reviews I have read regarding \\"Ender's Game\\", I wish to clarify one point: Card planned on writting an entire series from the beginning. In \\"Ender's Game\\" you are introduced to the characters, their flaws, their adversaries, and their solution. The hard sci-fi and groundbreaking new ideas come later, in \\"Speaker of the Dead\\", \\"Xenocide\\", and \\"Children of the Mind\\". So, if you decide to read the first book... by all means read the entire series. You will be more enriched for the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bright but alienated kid will feel understood here.","review":"I've yet to find a kid who is one of those very bright but disenchanted with school types, actually at risk of dropping out because school is so meaningless, who does not respond to Ender's story of knowing more than everyone else but functioning as a savior of the world. It is a powerfully effective book to help the bright but isolated to find hope and meaning. The fantasy elements are incidental to me but are what makes the heavy doses of philosophy and insight digestible to most kids. Outstanding for kids with adult reading abilities who still have kid identity issues. No objectionable scenes. Another good one for the same kids but who have younger reading levels: A Bridge to Terabithia. The sequel and Card's other books are not as effective, tending toward much more heavy handed allegory and religious reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sci-fi book ever!!!","review":"Ender's Game is an excellent book with a great storyline and well developed characters. The book will never loose your attention. (I have read it in a single sitting a countless number of times) I love the way OSC makes you think and how he makes you internally debate moral issues. I highly recommend this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This needs to be made into a movie!!!","review":"Ender's Game = must read. This book should be on all of the mandatory high school reading lists. Excellent story plot with a few one liners that make you think. This is a sci-fi classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ender's game is 2 dimensional","review":"I understand this book is very popluar with the new crowd, but I think that compared to some of the books in the 50's such as Clarke's City and the Stars or Bester's Stars My Destination, this book is very 2 dimensional and hermetic, as would be a stage play. While the idea is interesting, the whole plot turns on a trick like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, eg: the \\"game\\" is a real \\"war\\". Whoopee, neat trick, penned for the Nintendo generation. I'll stay with Silverberg, Doc Smith, Asimov or George Stewart's Earth Abides. Ender's game is for the Reagan era offspring - light pap. Ender obviously is incapable of jaunting. Now if you excuse me, I'll jaunte to the Lesser Magellenic Cloud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated SF of all time.","review":"My father, a big SF reader, and my wife both absolutely raved about this book. I've also read a lot of scifi and thought I'd check it out. Well, the beginning was mildly intriguing. The middle was modestly interesting. I knew there had to be a fantastic twist and/or ending coming up. Nope. Kind of like a prime time TV show: midly entertaining gristle for your mind to chew on if there's not something truly insired around.So why all the hype? To this day I really can't tell you. Bad taste? Not having read anything better? A love of all things mediocre?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well crafted, but will disappoint the mature reader.","review":"Following a veritable blizzard of recommendations for this book, I finally decided to read Ender's Game. What I found was an exciting well-written novel, with just one key problem: Card doesn't respect his reader, and thus the novel is predictaable. I know something of Science-Fiction, having read it for many years. I wasn't expecting another Dune or Foundation, but to rank this novel among them is a horrible mistake. There was never a time in this book when I was not at least a page ahead of the author, usually further. The surprise ending should not have been a surprise to anyone who has dabbled in short science-fiction. One ought to read Ender's Game, and enjoy it, and perhaps even cerish it, but to rank it among the best Science-Fiction written is folly."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of imagination","review":"The story line sucks, and the story itself is quite boring, A six year old as a battle commander, makes me think some one has dreams of little boys, that being the homophobic author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as deserving of the esteem in-which it's held","review":"It's not a terrible book, but it left me wholly uninspired. The book's short length happened to be the only result of my bother to achieve the all-too-obvious ending which i had predicted not even half way in. A child prodigy chess-player is just as lame in a futuristic (video-game) setting as it is in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for a quick, easy read","review":"Like many people I suspect, I read this book because of the hype. It was entertaining and an easy read, but didn't leave much of an impact. I didn't mind Card's writing style, rather dull, but to the point. My complaint is how he handled the minor characters, especially Peter. Why even introduce a character if you are not going to develop it in anyway? The psychology of Peter, and for that matter Val, is barely touched upon and then Peter seems to disappear from the story all together, as though the author grew bored with him. It could have been a better story with more character development, as it is, it is still a fairly entertaining and quick-paced story."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"ender's game was definitely one of the best books i have ever read, and all my other favorite books are also by card. it really makes one think about society, and makes you wonder if it will really end up something like that. if you haven't read ender's game, read it, and all the other ones, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another very good read!","review":"I don't know why it took me so long to read this, despite the numerous praises and recommendations. I actually bought this book while Christmas-shopping, it had been sitting on top of my dryer for three months.With that said, this is one of those rare books that really made me stop and reflect for a while after reading it. I was able to guess at the big \\"reveal\\" a couple of paragraphs before it happened but what surprised me was the strong emotion I felt later on when Ender pulled away the mirror from the wall. The ensuing \\"conversation\\" had tears welling in my eyes. Wow! Just wow! Haven't felt a gut-punch like that since I read Odd Thomas by Dean Koontz.Buy it, read it. This one will have a cherished place in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in ALL respects!","review":"A riveting book. I couln't put it down until the last page was read!This book is what Sci-Fi should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best book in this series","review":"I read this book after I read Xenocide, Speaker for the dead, and Children of the mind from the same series. I am not quite sure why they are a series at all. This book is very different from the other stories. Compared to the other books which were more about moral issues and how to live a good life this book is \\"just\\" an adventure novel. Nonetheless, Card, the master storyteller wrote it and it is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another review....","review":"Yes, I'm going to throw my two cents in too, and, in case you couldn't tell from all the 5 stars, yes, it is a good book. It's well written, has good character development, is well thought out, well paced, and entertaining. This book would have good 5 stars except (and here it comes) I had some issues with it. First off, unbelievable. I can take Ender being the military boy wonder, or Valentine the great writer, or Peter the great political mind, but to have all 3 in the same family and forever change humanity is a bit far reaching. I think the military, having discarded Peter, would have killed him rather than let such evil genius run around loose. Another problem was the ending of the war, is there anyone who didn't see that coming? (I'm trying not to give away the plot here). And lastly, while the writing was good, it felt...hollow? It was a very simple read. Don't get me wrong here, I recommend this for reading, it IS a good book, but it isn't without it's faults."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 5 books ever read","review":"Absolutely and far away an excellent book. The first time (of many!) I read this book, I was absolutely astonished. I haven't really liked that much most of the sequels, but you also have to read Ender's Shadow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless Science Fiction","review":"Any fan of scifi really owes it to themselves to read it. Card's excecution of the plot is right on mark. It's original, has a few really decent surprises, and can totally take you out of your world and put you in Ender's. I'm hard pressed to think of an easier read and, beyond that, it has substance too. Perfect.If you like it, don't necessarily jump to the conlusion that you'd like to read the rest of the quartet though. The storyline changes into a much more philosophical mode in the other books. The Shadow series however is much more akin to Ender's Game, and you may like it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book for the ages","review":"This is an awesome book. Everyone that I have talked to that has read it has really connected with the character Ender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I highly recommend this book. In fact, have already bought the other books in the series (Ender Shadow was excellent too). The audio version has multiple readers, really helps with the many charecters. Great for yourself or a family car-trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"I have long felt that Orson Scott Card is the best writer in the genre of Science Fiction today. This is without a doubt his masterpiece. Card pulls you into the lives of all of his characters. You see what they see, you feel what they feel. Ender's game examines the mind and emotions of children equally well as it explore the same in adults. Be prepared to make a commitment of time and emotions to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I like the book, it was a good read. really easy and fun and perfect for my 12 hour flight home. arrived in good condition"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT READ","review":"At first, I thought this was going to be another version of The Maze Runner series or even Hunger Games. Post apocalyptic \\"event\\" world with children bearing the brunt of the fall-out. I should state for the record I loved both those series.I was delighted to find in this book Card takes that same concept but refines it for an older audience and literally and figuratively takes it in a different direction. EXCELLENT book and could not put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"The first 2/3 of the book is essentially the same thing over and over again. Basically until you are just about sick of it. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that something was going to change and I had gone so far already.The concept and story is a great idea but unfortunately doesn't develop through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, silly book. Would not recommend to anyone older than 12.","review":"The book has an interesting premise and a good plot twist, but the characters are so shallow and unbelievable that I would only recommend this book to kids, or only to anyone who has never read actual good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile and predictable","review":"As other reviewers have said, if you are 12 years old you might like it. I love scifi and anything space related, and I have published 3 novels (so I am loathe to rip on any writer's effort) but this book is really not good. It is the Winnie the Pooh of scifi. The training the \\"soldiers\\" undergo is so simplistic it's borderline idiotic (I mention this because it's the central theme of the book), the dialogs and reactions of the main characters are forced and stiff, the ending so completely predictable ... Do yourself a favor and go for adult reading, Richard Morgan or China Mielville or, hell, anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why on earth is this book so praised?","review":"Winner of the Hugo and Nebula awards? Really? This is a book with only marginally decent prose, unlikeable characters and a weak plot and it has been deemed equal to masterpieces written by authors such as Asimov, Dick, Gibson and Le Guin?Sorry to all the fans, because I know there are many who love this series, but this book is not worth the hype. There is nothing worse in terms of characterization than surrounding your protagonist with villains who have no reason to be mean in order to make us sympathize with the victim. It is also mind-boggling to see something as ridiculous as eugenics employed in sci-fi, of all genres, to justify the presence of not one, but three genius children in one family. World domination via message boards? Seriously? The worst part of it all is that Ender is meant to be a long-suffering, courageous hero, according to Card. That is not the book I read.My advice: read this as the 'making of' of a serial killer and you might enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Big Book I've Ever Read!","review":"I rarely ever read books, so when I picked up \\"Ender's Game\\" for a class assignment I was surprised at how deeply engrossed I became in the book I was and that it interested me at all. I am only 17 years old (a junior in high school) and this is one of the biggest books I have ever read, yet I understood it. I am glad that there is a book out there that can fit every age range and be understood. I am not completely done with the book yet, but I know that the end will be great. Thanks! ~*~Kitty~*~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game satisfies on every level","review":"Deep for those who look deeply, straight-forward for those who don't.

Card is an incredibly gifted author, and I have read many of his works. This is by far the best. You feel as if you are there, with Ender, throughout the entire novel. You remember all the trauma of childhood; and see how pitifully it compares with the travesty of what Ender had to endure. You will never forget Ender"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I loved this book. I loved Enders innocence and determination...

Yet i am glad i took the leap! What a book :) Card manages to captivate our imagination and lets us become genius children that experience what it is to be lonely, in despair, isolated yet in control of the situations at hand, This book peaks into the realms of discipline and what it means to \\"do what u must in spite of what u feel\\" i thought i would be bored with futuristic mumbo jumbo... but i am so glad i was not. Even a genius kid like Ender when it s all said and done is simply a kid,who hero as he maybe has lived life and saved lives through the great deception.

I highly recommend it to someone who wants to try a new genre of books or those who want a great new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a big disappointment. Hearing all the hype suggesting this may be one of the best books \\"ever\\", I dove right in and devoted some of my limited time to giving it a read. The story seemed dry and predictable. Especially the \\"revelation\\" that what had been presented to Ender as training, was not. Ho hum. Who couldn't see that one coming?! I learned nothing about the enemy, therefore, I could not appreciate who it was that I was fighting and precious little of why. Interesting? Yes. Great? I don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"a commentary on this book by a person who is a fanatic.","review":"This is an excellent book for those who get their hype of off boy"},{"rating":"1","title":"A really, really boring book!","review":"I had to read Ender's Game as a summer reading assignment for my 9th grade advanced english class, and after a month or so of reading it, I finally finished it. I was happy when I finished reading it. It was boring. The book was descriptive and I could picture in my head what was happening, but I couldn't really relate to any of the characters (except for Ender, maybe -- since I'm gifted, like he is).Also, I really didn't like the awfully odd names that the characters called each other -- farteater and scrunchface, to name a couple. What is up with that?To me, the only truly interesting part of Ender's Game was when Peter and Valentine were on the nets as Locke and Demosthenes.Although there are tons of people that like and/or love this book, I'm certainly not one of them -- especially since I dreaded reading the book (and I normally love reading books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile nonsense","review":"Buy it for your adolescent kid if you must, and just hope he doesnt throw it in your face for insulting his intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a cruel and nasty world this is","review":"Made me feel depressed, desperate, and depersonalized.

Unlike them, he has the potential to become a military genius at a time when it is believed (perhaps correctly) that only a military genius can save humanity. This is the story of those three child prodigies. It would have been a fascinating story even without the mind-blowing surprise at the end. But before you read it a second time, read Card'sEnder's Shadow (Shadow Saga), which takes place in the same universe, the same time period, and mostly in the same places as \\"Ender's Game.\\" The difference is that Ender, while still a major character, is not the viewpoint character. You may well end up reading both a second or third time; they both rank in the same league with Edgar Pangborn'sStill I Persist in Wondering, Robert A.

I read it within a day - half a day to be specific - not long before the major tests of the term. Not only was it engaging and interesting, I really could identify with the main character Ender. It addresses issues about life and humanity that I've been thinking about. It's an eye-opener, a life-changing story and I won't ever regret having read it.But I can't garantee that you'll be satisfied after reading the book. it depends on how deeply you choose to look into the story, or whether you look at it at the same level the author was at when he wrote the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!","review":"This is a FANTASTIC BOOK!

You will, after you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and Exciting!","review":"Orson Scott Card has quickly become one of my favorite authors, mostly because of his work with the Ender series. Card takes you on a four-book journey through the amazing life of a truly remarkable man. Ender's Game ends with Ender still in his teens, and in later books you are taken to the end of his life. Don't be fooled by the cover art. Spaceships and aliens play a relatively minor part in this story. Ender's Game is by far one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game: A Masterpiece.","review":"I found Ender's Game not just a book, but an exhilarating rush through time to the future, where Earth is threatened by aliens called \\"buggers.\\" I loved this novel from cover to cover, not just because it is my favorite genre of literature, but because it contained and displayed elements of life: love, excitement, rivalry, bravery and danger, just to name a few. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to experience a book that you can't stop reading... and trust me, you won't want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant","review":"This book is easily 5 Stars. I read it in one sitting. The strength of Ender's Game is not in its Science but in its Fiction. Ender and the other children's characterization is dead on. I had no problem with Ender thinking the thoughts he did, or acting in the manner he did. His genius, his isolation, his pain all played well in this story. The entire idea of the games and the society of the battle room was very well done. I realize that this book is out-of-print, but I would make it a priority to secure a copy by whatever means possible. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking","review":"Far, far better than Enchantment, I do have to say that this is pretty heavy for a juvenile book. The ideas and concepts presented about war are interesting, and the ending is really amazingly well done. The \\"speaker for the dead\\" concept is different from what we hold to now (no one ever seems to saw anything bad about the dead) but I think far better. I'm not sure if the second book can live up to the first, though I will read it as I am very curious to see how Ender's life progresses. Not for the faint of heart, but a thoroughly thought-provoking book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's always someone, isn't there?","review":"I'm sorry to say, since I respect Card's writing, that I tried three times to read this book, which has been toted as his greatest ever.

To criticize Ender's Game for its main character being a child is silly...there would have been no story otherwise. Heinlein ALREADY wrote Starship Troopers...this is a NEW angle and a NEW twist!Just stick to your safe, politically correct books, and don't wreck the curve of the ratings of this great book. Stop reading Sci-Fi, PLEASE! Just because \\"little green men\\" don't REALLY exist, doesn't mean that a story about them won't be any good. I suppose that an imagination is something that is apparently inherited at birth."},{"rating":"2","title":"End Game! Ender Wins! Play Again?","review":"Ender is a genious and, in my opinon, a saviour to planet Earth, but he doesn't know either of these. The book has a difficult challenge of balence and rightness. Mess with a boy who could save Earth from aleins, or would that be injust. I think in the end it's evened out to say, \\"Okay, ether we all die, including the boy, or toughen him up so he can save us all.\\" But why fight? Is it just out of fear that if you don't destroy them, they'll destroy you? If you isolate the boy too long or too short will he break down? It's a delacate balace with a surprise ending that makes this book impossible to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The review u been waitin for","review":"Ender is a kid and he is the thrid child of the Wiggins family.Which is not common for them to have a 3rd child. He goes up to space to train. Train for a big war that is goin to happen. They make him the one that is always left out. They make is hard for him cause they are hoping that he can beat the Buggers.The buggers are a alien that has attack earth before. Now the earth is repaying them a visit. The Book is boring at first but after the 5th chapter it gets really interesting. It will keep you on your toes and always wanting to know what is goin to happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book brought to life through narration","review":"Long time fan of Ender's Game, I was delighted to get this audio production. The voice talent was spot on. Stefan Rudnicki and cast capture the pain, the stress, the struggle through voice. They tell the tale so well that it added a depth to an already outstanding story that I didn't think was possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape From Reality!","review":"Ender's Game was first published in August 1977 as a novelette in Analog magazine. Card later expanded that short story into a full-length book, which is now his best known novel. Ender's Game is a vision of the future in which gifted children are used to fight in an adult war against alien invaders. It will challenge your assumptions of reality.While written with YA readers in mind, Ender's Game can be enjoyed by readers of any age from 12 on up. The book is clearly Science Fiction yet is not so technical that it can't be understood easily. There's enough room to imgaine yourself in Ender's world - which makes this a wonderful escape from the pressures of everyday life. At the end of the story, most readers are hungry for more, which the author has provided. This was the first but is most definitely not the last novel starring Ender and his friends.If you like Science Fiction, this is clearly a book you should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that takes you farther than you'd ever expect","review":"I never thought that picking up a science fiction book (this was my first) would open my life to a classical education! I read the Trilogy. Then I went on to read the real Demosthenese, then the Campaigns of Alexandar by Arrian, then Heroditus... Card has given his characters lives that fit in with our own ancient mythology. A fine sequal to the ancients!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game is a hit","review":"Ender's Game is a novel for the ages. Orsen Scott Card delivers a science fiction hit for the young and old alike. The book depicts Earth preparing for war after nearly being destroyed by an alien invasion. The government begins breeding military geniuses in preparation for the third invasion. Ender is taken through Battle School and Commander School taking twists and turns that keep readers on the edge of their seats. Card delves into the human mind creating characters a reader can believe and connect with. Ender's Game is a must read for everyone. Whether a fan of science fiction or not, this book is impossible to put down and keeps the reader intrigued until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic that stands the test of time","review":"Ender's Game is the science fiction book for people who doesn't like science fiction. While it has plenty of great scientific speculations in it (it predicted the political power of the internet and citizen blogs), its main strength lies in its strong character-driven story and Card's clear and unaffected prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is actually the second time I've read the book. I purchased it so I could read it again, and pass it on to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOVIE, need I say more?","review":"Yes, I need say more b/c hollywood would completely hollywood-ize it and not do a good job. I say, TAKE THE BOOK, USE IT AS THE SCRIPT!. Of course then we'd have a bunch of little kids running around killing their bullies like Ender because \\"otherwise they'll just bug me the next day and won't leave me alone.\\" Maybe not. I don't know. Everyone should read it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too simplistic?","review":"This is a wonderful book...one of the best I've read...and I may be young but think about WHY Card wrote it so simply...the novel's characters mainly children...it would've been less pleasing had it been cryptic and vague because you wouldn't believe that these were real children...the simplistic style kept reminding me that they were children...I never forgot that point and it made me admire Ender all the more...imagine if you or your child was that strong at nine..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best SF book I've read.","review":"It's one of the best SF books of all time. It won both the Hugo and Nebula awards (as did it's sequel, Speaker for the Dead, the next year.) I have recommended this book to everyone I know, and nobody who has read it has given in a bad review. Even those people who do not, in general, enjoy SF books. This book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Sci-Fi Book Ever","review":"First off, this book needs at least 8 stars. If ever you read a single item of Sci-Fi, make it this great work that OSC put together. His others works are wonderful, but EG starts it off. When he brings to light the prejudices people have when they don't know the other, is an important lesson for us today. The fact that Ender himself was a child was something that I could relate to, being in gifted classes at school. Although he did do a horrible thing, you could see how he was influenced. The book rounds out all its corners, an easy read, and surprisingly short, despite the fact that it's packed with a good story. I immediatly dove into SoTD after reading this, I couldn't get enough. All in all, the perfect Sci-Fi book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for school","review":"I read this book for a project for school. At first I thought I wasn't going to like it, but as i read more and more I found myself becoming engrossed in the book. We had two weeks to finish it, but I had it done in two days. The book had a unique plot and great character development. I found it easy to picture myself right next to Ender, experiencing what he was going through. Some people found it hard to believe that a six year-old would talk the way Ender did, but they forget that he is smarter than the average child that age. Overall, it was a great book, I highly reccomend it, and I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an unbelievable book","review":"I could probably write a book about how incredibly intense and powerful this book was. I read this on advice from 4 of my friends (simultaneously, to boot), and have to say I was reluctant because of the \\"sci-fi\\" stereotype in my head. However, this book blew past all of my reservations and is one of my all-time favorite books, one I would recommend to anyone, and I mean anyone, to read.Orson Scott Card shows a stunning understanding of human nature and the plot twisted and was so amazingly real that I read it straight through in one night without a pause.Read the book, and if you are not a shallow fool (and perhaps even if you are) you are bound to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"as a school project i had to read a science fiction book. I chose Ender's Game. I was expecting it be a pretty boring book but i was so wrong... u should surley read it... i was suprised cause i dont like many books, but i have to say this was one of my favorites -;- -;- -;-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"A friend recomended this book to me, and I went in skeptical. I came out the next day(!) amazed with what I had just been unable to put down. I went through it again, picked up some things I had missed, and I was hooked. I love this book, it's that simple. The rest of the series is OK, but this one is the best. For a younger audience, I suggest skipping the rest of the Ender Cycle and going into the Shadow Cycle (a.k.a. the Bean Cycle). If you like the Dune series, and I mean the whole thing, the rest of the Ender books are for you. Also, while this is considered a Military SciFi novel, I find myself wavering on that point. Hardcore MSF fans might not find this to be their thing. But, try it anyway, you might suprise yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"First book to a fantastic series","review":"I'm too lazy to write a review for each book in this excellent series. If you like this first book (I don't see how you won't), you'll want to get the whole series anyway. We have the whole group and have enjoyed each book! One of the best authors still alive! I can't wait until the day they make them into a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written","review":"If you like sci-fi, you will like this book.I really enjoyed reading it...Its perfect except the bits where boys go naked and stuff.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"In retrospect, this was a good story due to the superior last two chapters. The first thirteen chapters barely kept my interest. Through out those chapters, I found it very hard to relate to a bunch of seven and eight-year-olds who had the responsibility and intellect of grown men. I was also disturbed by what almost seemed like a deep seeded sexual interest between Ender and his sister. In the end, I almost didn't want to enjoy the last seventy pages because by that time I had so much resentment for the book--but those pages were just so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"For insecure children (of all ages) only","review":"Notice how childish the reviews that rate it \\"10\\" are? Gushings of \\"the BEST book ever!\\", inability to see a relationship between realism and Science Fiction, the joy at finding finally something \\"plain\\" and \\"simple\\" to read? If Star Trek novels are waaay too intellectual for you, Ender's Game may be the literary Barney you can finally grasp. A nice, heart-warming story with no scary new ideas to struggle over. However, adults will want actual content in their reading material"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"Just an OK read. The final chapter was a terrible letdown. A few writing classes might help Mr. CARD get over his preachy style"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-Fi Classic!","review":"I re-read this book after what must have been 15 years. Parts of the book were still very vivid in my mind after all this time, but it was fantastic reading it again. The characters are great, and the story flows well.Parts of the story are applicable to how certain groups think, act and work today. More (and fair) communication is needed between the different groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK. A MUST READ FOR ALL ORSON SCOTT CARD FANS AND FANS OF THE GENRE IN GENERAL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding delve into the human condition","review":"To say this book is just a Science Fiction (SF) classic would be an injustice to all those who do not read SF. The insight and understanding of the human condition and the ability to explain it in such a easy manner, makes Ender's Game one of the best book ever. Reading of how Ender thinks as each obstacle is thrown at him, gives a reader an insight into the way we all think (or hope to) and gives us a closer bond to Ender. Ender's Game is a outstanding book. A must read for all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Science fiction that remembers your humanity and your God","review":"Ender's Game is more than the story of an earth that grooms a super-genius boy to mastermind its battle against seemingly hostile alien forces. Ender's Game is a book that initiates a conversation on the sanctity of life of all sentient creatures. How would we react to an alien intelligence that we did not understand and did not understand us? The answer to that awesome question is here as Ender Wiggin takes us along on his journey to insight and wisdom, even facing the worst of situations. Many people have thanked me for recommending this book, as I have thanked the person who recommended it to me. Thank you Anne Scott Miller"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say? It's a non-stop pageturner!","review":"Ender's Game is one of the best books I have ever read. It was recommended to me by a friend, who absolutely adored it. I thought she was exaggerating, but by the time I was on the second page, I was hooked! I finished Ender's Game within four days, and the rest of the series is some of the best stuff I've read in a long time. Even if someone doesn't like science fiction, like I don't, you absolutely have to read Ender's Game"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I'm not sure why Ender's Game is rated so highly. It does not really introduce any amazing concepts. The main character being good at video games does not really excite me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I bought this book based on the thousands of five star reviews. I read a lot, but haven't read too much sci-fi and wanted to *broaden my literary horizons*After struggling through the first half of the book, I finally decided that life is too short and gave up. It is undoubtedly well written, unarguably original and thought provoking....yet I found it criminally BORING. The lack of a real plot is what really lets the novel down. Undeveloped charcters and weak sub plots don't help things along either. Page after page of six year olds showcasing their battle tactics in some kind of zero gravity arena in space just isn't everybody's cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh. Take it or leave it","review":"I first read this book as an angst-ridden teen, and I thought it was great. That was a long time ago and I recently re-read it as an adult, hoping for the same great experience. Not so much.What seemed so deep and relevant to my 15 year old self was a little shallow to an adult. Not well written, the plot movement is glacial, the characters are very 2 dimensional. If you're still smarting over being picked on in school, you might find this interesting. If you've grown up and become an adult, probably less interesting. And, seriously, I'm waiting to stumble across Ender's Lunch, Ender's Afternoon Nap, Ender's Trip To The Grocery Store. Doesn't this author have any other ideas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Overrated Book Ever?","review":"Many people use words like exciting and great to describe this tripe, well, I can only think of one- DULL! What kind of crack are this book's supporters smoking, there isn't one exciting scene in the whole damn book. It's just a bunch of boring kids floating around and shooting at each other with stun guns for 300 pages. Get a grip, people, if this is the best book you've ever read, well, you haven't read almost any other book I've read. I had high expectations for this book after hearing such high praise for it, but my expectations weren't met in the least. I kept on waiting for it to get better, and it never did. Predictable, boring, maudlin, repitive, crap, all these, sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of all time.","review":"This book made me appreciate the ability to read! Everything about the book was great -- the brilliant child Ender, his equally brilliant good and evil siblings and their rise to political power via the internet, Ender's adventure game, battle tactics, bullies, buggers ... every page was worth reading. I only wish that the sequels were half as good but they are not even close (IMHO). It was sad to see Ender grow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game-->A book that crosses genres","review":"This book is one that people all over love. Whether they regularly read SF or not, they love. I have a friend who rarely reads, but he read the entire book, because it was so engrossing. And Ender is so good because he is so realistic. A poor little kid stuck in grown up affairs. And in the end, he gets very tired, and that is what makes him realistic. And the guy who said that 12 and 10 year-old kids couldn't influence popular thought is wrong. He is just afraid of that happening and doesn't want to admit it is possible. There are kids like that, not jus the ones who graduate high school when they are 10, but the ones that have a purpose and know what they are doing. A genetic mutation creating a person capable of being Alexander the Great at 12 is not that unlikely."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am in the minority here.","review":"Well, I must say that I was less than pleased while I was reading this book. It was recommended highly so I bought it. I found the plot to be predictable, boring, and transparent. Ender was an adult dressed up in kids' clothing, and I couldn't connect at all. The theme of superior children is frequently seen in SF literature and has been done much better and more subtly than this. Read Barnes' ORBITAL RESONANCE or Palmer's EMERGENCE instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"It cut straight to my heart and soul.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Ender's Game because of its intriguing storyline and above all because of Ender himself. I am not a kid genius, no one stands in awe of my capabilities, but I identified with Ender on a very personal level. Yes he is just a kid and I had a hard time getting around that concept at first, however, over all i choose to look at Ender as a window into the human soul. It is Card's portrayal of the strength of character and soul that really got to me and assures that I will recommend this book to everyone I meet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enders Game","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's very thought provoking for me as a teacher of young children -age 4&5- that it's important to guide them and do activities to spark creativity. We need children to be future explorers, scientists, finding cures for diseases, etc. we don't need robots just going through the motions adults tell them to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page-turner, to be sure, but nudity is a bit too prevalent","review":"I'm not even finished with the book yet, (within a hundred pages of the end), and I'll say that it is one of the best page-turners I've ever read, but, it is not perfect. For one, Ender is just a bit too perfect at the mock battles in Battle School, about the only thing they never required him to do was walk on water, which wouldn't surprise me if Card actually made him do it. Also, there is a bit too much nudity for my taste. People walkin' round w/ out a stitch on is one thing, but this is kids we're talkin about! A fight in a shower room?! It makes you think things about Orson Scott Card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing to the last","review":"This is, by far, the best book I have ever read (this is written after my fortieth reading of it). It deserves no criticism in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book to bad I can never read it again.","review":"I love this story.Too bad the Card is a homophobic nut job! He wants to kill all the gays or so I have read. Its so sad because I can never read this book again. Its kind of like Tom Cruse or Mel Gibson. I just can't enjoy their works anymore. But that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Boys","review":"This is a great story for people who like little boys. I was creeped out by the premise and was very uncomfortable with the relationship between the trainers and the boys, the hero in particular. \\"Ender\\" suggests enuendo, and not in a socially acceptable context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's \\"not so fun\\" Game","review":"Ender's Game was tedious reading. However... it's an original story with a great ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do so many of you enjoy this?","review":"well, i'm not sure how so many people enjoyed this book, perhaps it was not the right day for me to pick it up and read it. but seriously, it was disturbing....definately not something i will be giving my kid brother to read any time soon...naked children, child wars, lies and deceit, and more!rather insensitive towards real world issues-this is not just a game happening in sci-fi books, has anyone looked in the news lately, ie. child soldiers in liberia?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. You must read this book.","review":"A fantastic read and a great inroduction to the author. This was the first book of his I'd read, after finishing it I read right through his entire catalogue. It's that good. Hooray for morality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The great fantasy of human actualization","review":"There's something so compelling about books that allow us to believe people can be more, and do so much more than we typically do. What is wonderful about this one is that it does not rely solely on inborn genius; there's some of that, but you also get a sense that the greatness of the characters is built up with the efforts of many people, and a dash of circumstance. You get a group of kids, and one in particular, who form the crest of the wave of a humanity as it rolls toward strange shores. It is also a coming of age novel, which for some of us never really gets old. If you like the amazing mental skills of George Herbert's characters from the original Dune, chances are you will enjoy Card and his amazing children in Ender's Game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a lot to add with all the other reviews, but...","review":"Great book. Loved it. Was suggested to me by a man friend who read it when he was younger and was worried the material might be either to juvenile or boy-focused (he had not revisited the material in some time, and I think we can all agree that many times something that was amazing at 14 doesn't always retain its charm at 24). I can attest that it was neither. Very nicely written and produced a lot of emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS THE BEST!!","review":"I loved this book. It is my first book read by Orson Scott Card and it will definently not be my last. Ender Wiggen is such an amazing kid. And talk about good author, Orson Scott Card makes you feel like your in the book. This is no dought a 5 star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Effort From A Brilliant Author","review":"At first, I only read Ender's Game because it was part of the requirements for my English course.Now I thank myself for being in that class! Enders Game is an innovative masterpiece from that wonderful author, Orson Scott Card. It thoroughly examines the life of a particular unpopular boy named Ender, his tough training in Battle School and his endearing relationship with his sister Valentine.Never before have I read such a dramatic and well-scripted science-fiction book. The characters were very believable and at times one felt they could connect with Ender. Card should be congratulated for this novel and commended for a great effort. Anyone with a liking for science-fiction books should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Formative, Influential","review":"I think just about everything that could be said has been said about this book. It was one of the key books I read during my formative middle school years, and has stuck with me. Ender and I shared a paranoia based on adverse conditions, and I've loved the little guy ever since.Great book, excellent plotting, very witty (if sometimes in a school-boyish way) chapter openings, and characters you will probably care about in ways that few other books have ever made you feel.I recommend all of the other books in the first quartet. The second quartet, so far, exhibits decreasing quality with each book. Though everyone who liked _Ender's Game_ should read _Ender's Shadow_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"This book is an excellent book! With a gripping tale, a heartwarming protagonist and descriptive narration, it's not a tale to be forgotten. Ender is brilliant(ly written). His character has been fully fleshed out, and indeed he seems so real, you share his every heartache and his every pain. There've been loads of issues that have been dealt with by the author, but I'm not here to make an analysis of style, character or theme, so suffice it to say that this story is so unstorylike and yet so fantasylike that it will capture your imagination and take you on an emotional rollercoaster like no other. and if you're only in it for the action and gory, well, there's plenty where that came from.I picked this book up by accident at a bookstore and I've read it and reread it a thousand and one times, it's THAT good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book for All Ages","review":"This is a great book for all ages and a great story regardless of whether you like SciFi or not. I've read it and its sequels several times and it never gets boring. I have also given several copies away as gifts and been told that each recipient was quite pleased with the book.Card's \\"parallel\\" book Ender's Shadow is also a great read to get the flip side of the Ender story. Both stories blend seamlessly and complement each other nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting and enjoyable accidental find.","review":"I happened to pick up Ender's Game one day in the book store of my college. When I first started to read it it didn't sound like anything special, the more I read it the more I liked it. After finishing the book I wanted to read more of the story, craving it. Ender's game is a great book, especially for people who like action and sci-fi and all the other interesting things in the book. This book will most likely leave you thinking for some time (not that it's a bad thing) about the future and how we as the human race will be when it comes to peace and war and all of that polical woo haw. If you like this book, you'll like Ender's shadow (A parallel to Ender's Game). I suggest reading Ender's shadow right after ender's game. I still have not yet read the rest of the series but I will."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MASTER PIECE OF PSYCHOLOGY","review":"This isn't a book about science fiction or alien's massive destruction. So those of you looking for bloody action in the future, you may go somewhere else. This is a book about feelings, and every piece of it brings a lesson, a thought, an inspiration that will change your life. READ IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"By FAR the best Sci-Fi book ever!","review":"I've read alot but this book is amazing, i love it to death, i've re read it 5 times in 3 years and it touches me.Its a MUST read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life!","review":"I don't know how to explain it...You just have to read it...It is just that brilliant!!! I was not an avid reader, but this book changed everything for me. I never understood what it was like to love to read...what it was like to not be able to set a book down. I never understood the phrase \\"the book was better then the movie\\" because I couldn't see how just words could be better than actual pictures and sound. But Ender's game made me understand. Thank You Mr. Card! Thank you so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest book ever written!","review":"You should go out and spend a lousy seven dollars and buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"I like to read all kinds of books. I my youth, I grew up on Issac Asimov, Arthur C Clarke and I recently reread a few books I read 30 years ago. Then I found Ender's Game and read the first book, it is really good and well written, the complexity of the story is appealing. Now I am into the second book \\"The Speaker for the Dead\\" which is just as good and exciting. I cannot wait to read the whole series from Orson Scott Card."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"I absolutely love this book and highly recommend it. It is not a children's book although often advertised as such. It is appropriate for teenagers and up. The concepts are very advanced and very interesting. Read the entire series from start to end; it is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game is a must read book.","review":"This book is a classic. Ender Wiggin, child prodigy, is taken at the age of six to begin his journy to become humanities last against an alien race. The games he plays train him. The games also seek to control him. You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game","review":"First time reading this author, excellent story line, I have since read the 2nd and 3rd book in the series because they are so good. Great characters and underlying human nature woven into a science fiction novel. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it!","review":"Was it entertaining? Yes. Was it the best book ever written? No. Will I read the next in the series? Not immediately, but yes. I like the idea behind it and I enjoy young adult literature in general. It had good character development without excessively long descriptions of clothing, scenery, or demeanor. I prefer to let my imagination fill in the blanks and let the plot move forward naturally. Occasionally, I felt like the characters did things that were \\"out-of-character\\" or that were jarring in regards to what I could accept as plausible, but for the most part I enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Boring, uninteresting, and plagued with an early elementary writing style another reviewer generously called \\"staccato\\". I wouldn't say the read was a waste of time, but it just barely cleared that bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did no one give me this book years ago?","review":"Having blown off life, spouse, and cats on Sunday in order to read cover to cover Ender's Game, I was left feeling cheated that no one had given me this book earlier in life and demanded that I read it. On my brief breaks from the book to forage for food in the fridge, I refused to speak to my spouse as I didn't want to come out of the world created by Card in this must-read book.I'm not a sci-fi fan by nature and so wasn't expecting much. But I was hooked from page 1 and never looked back. I'm off to the local library to see if they carry the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game is amazing","review":"I am currently reading Ender's Game and I have got to say it is one of the best pieces of science fiction books that I have read. I am not big on reading books but when I started reading this book it lured me in and is hard to put down. It is about a family that lives in a government that you can only have two children. This family that this book is about had a third child whose name is Ender, Also known as a third. Ender gets into a military school in space called battle school, where children are put into armies and have war games against each other in the battle room which is a room with no gravity. The kids who play the game do not know that they are being closely watched for who will be able to command a fleet when they reach adulthood. That all that I have read so far but I can't wait to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID!","review":"Ender's Game bore me to tears. It doesn't have any point to the story at all.

You'll thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should NOT be on the reading list for children","review":"This book was on my daughter's middle school reading list. I have strongly objected with the school due to the profanity, depictions of women/girls as inferior, graphic sexual description, use of racial slurs, and acceptance of \\"murder by the oppressed.\\" We should absolutely hold up the ideal to our kids and let them see good literature that is good reading, and enjoyable without all the profanity and objectionable themes. Ender's Game is not appropriate for this age, in my opinion. Ender's Game is not good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCREDIBLE","review":"Incredible schlock, that is. Totally without merit.I soldiered on to the end, hoping for some redeeming feature, and found none.Tiresome, repititious nonsense.And, to my amazement, several thousand Amazonians found it significant literature.But, then, Harry Potter never made any sense to me,either.So sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be stacked next to Monopoly","review":"This book is well executed, brilliant and revolutionary. However unrealistic it may be- it still shows great evolution of the character and his attributes and fulfills a primitive need for warfare and the birth of an epiphany after you read it. A great book almost all-around; it also lacks Card's religious outlook which shows his massive strength as a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. Period.","review":"Three years ago I was required to read this book upon entering Appalachian State University. I've never been an avid reader. However (without being redundant like the rest of these reviews), the book caused me to go and buy many more of card's books. Later on during my first year in college, Card came and talked to the interdisciplinary program I was in and I had lunch with him. At that time, I asked him how he knew that each reader would become Ender (the prolouge). He said because it is a \\"true\\" book. And those are true words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically unsurpassed. Brilliant.","review":"Ender's Game is a must read. If you haven't, buy it. It is full of surprising resentment, and full of emotion. This is a book that you could read cover to cover a hundred times and still want to read it again. If you haven't already, I recommend you buy it. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very boring and juvenial","review":"it is a kids' book but it is no harry potter. with all the bullying at schools are going on. why do we need more books like this one? i would not even recommend this to children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sould be a \\"Pop-Up Book.\\"","review":"Who are the people that are writing stellar reviews on this book? Five year olds? At best, this is a children's book for simpletons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sample way too short","review":"The sample for this book is absurdly short. Nearly 90% of it is taken up by the author's introduction. The actual story part of the sample is only 5 pages long. I was seriously disappointed by this. Five pages is not nearly enough to tell me if the book is worth buying. Next time, someone should really pay attention to how much of the actual story is included in the sample."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dumb...","review":"This is a totally forgettable book... the plot is ludicrous, the characters lack depth, and, well, it just bored me to tears.

It's about a six year old genius who goes to an outer space war camp to train on space war tactics. He dominates all the war games and and at the end well you'll just have to find out yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius described","review":"Finally a book that describes the inner workings of the mind of a genius: the loneliness thats inextricably linked to being smarter than anyone else. Should be made a compulsory read for anyone wanting to be admitted to Mensa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranks Among The Best","review":"This is one of the most compelling pieces of fiction I haveread lately ... I'm only sorry that I didn't read it yearsago. For anyone who has ever felt \\"different\\" ... no matterthe reason ... this is a must-read. Perhaps parts of thestory are predictable; that's not the point. It's quite a commentaryon win-at-all-costs. The series can also inspire the reader tobegin looking for areas of common ground in the world ratherthan succumbing to today's societal messages that emphasizethe differences and the negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend!","review":"I chose this book because I really enjoy futuristic society stories. (Plus I was ecstatic to learn that they are making it into a film). Very sci-fi, but with a great human story as well. I read it really fast and now I can't wait for the film. My only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because some of the advanced science theories needed to complete the story went over my head slightly. But hey, maybe you're smarter then me! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book!","review":"I read this book in the 6th grade and listened to it again this past summer during a family trip.Still inspiring, still fun.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good, cerebral, SciFi story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Love it, good condition. Was a gift and really enjoyed. Not in a cd case, in a larger almost vhs case but it is well protected"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Told","review":"The story was, more than anything, a study of humanity and its grappling with good and evil, individual and host values, while setting the story amidst the fight for survival of the human race. I loved reading this book, and read it in 2 short days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!!","review":"The premise behind the story is very creative and unique. It was thought of before anyone else thought of it and and has been copied in the movies since its release, but nothing will compare to Card's brilliance. The author has quickly become my favorite author. He includes elements of science fiction, fantasy, ethical dilemmas, and the nature of men. Overall, this book is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"I'll keep this short.First, if you have never read an Orson Scott Card novel, this one would be a fantastic start. It was my first and I absolutely loved it. So engaging and interesting.Second, the plot seems very plausible to me, not because of the realistic setting but because of Card's incredible style of writing. I love sci-fi, no matter how far fetched, and Scott Card makes me like it even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I loved it the first time and re-read it again after hearing about a Marine friend's use of it for his subordinates. It is required reading. But it is a great story.Ender's Shadow is the best follow up (fourth book, I think) I've ever read but I didn't get it through Amazon so can't review it here, but it is great. All about Bean, if you remember him..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Unrealistic\\" and predictable","review":"I won't pretend that I know how a 5-year old genius' mind works, but I'm pretty sure it isn't as depicted in this book. Card prefaces the most recent edition saying that many people are turned off from this story by the way he characterizes the children; well, count me in. I felt more like I was reading about the thoughts and actions of teenagers. Plus, I was able to guess the ending approximately halfway through. No real surprises here. It's a great idea carried out with little creativity, ala Michael Crichton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the Kindle edition!","review":"Great book, but the Kindle edition is a huge rip off. It's obvious the publisher just tossed a copy in a scanner and didn't even bother to read through what came out on the other side. Ail instead of all, tmst instead of trust, etc. Many pages have more than one typo per page. Wish we could get our money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spartan Boys in Space","review":"I can only assume that those who said this is the greatest SciFi novel ever written have read only one SciFi novel. This novel is at best a challenging novel for YA. I do not understand how it won the Hugo and Nebula awards. There are so many flaws....basically Spartan boys in space."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprisingly disappointing","review":"Here are my random observations. I originally gave this book 3 stars, but after thinking more I had to downgrade.I thought I would like this book, but it was hard to get past the basic premise. I never understood why the hero had to be a 6-year-old child. He didn't talk like a 6-year-old and he wasn't treated like a 6-year-old, so in my head I had to repeatedly force myself to imagine one.I thought the ending was atrocious. When I had about 15% left, I wanted it to be over. It got long-winded and didn't flow with the rest of the book.I'm not one to see sexual innuendo where it's not meant to be, but the amount of nudity seemed weirdly intentional, especially since it involves young boys. Boys were often taking off their clothes or running around naked or showering or wrestling...Awkward...I won't be reading more of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"It really is a must read, I haven't read the whole series at the time but I can already sense why this is considered by some a classic of the sci fi genre"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book for a teen or adult.","review":"I read this book multiple times as a kid. Not to big on the rest of the series but love this book and Ender's shadow. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci fi convert","review":"I loved this book. I found the story compelling and was impressed with how well it has fared in very different work technology wise since it was written. I was taken aback when I realized how long ago it was written but how well it translates to current technologies. Although the content could have been challenging (children \\"playing\\" war games) it was a thoroughly enjoyable read"},{"rating":"1","title":"ENDERS GAME THE LITERARY ROOT CANAL","review":"The only thing worse then reading this book is a root cannal. I have been assigned to read this book and dreaded every line of words. The book has little to no bases and keeps you struggling through the whole thing thinking it might have gotten better, but nobody should read this book who is above the fifth grade level of reading. The only reason I gave this book a 3 is i had found the little bases it had in the beginning was alright. It had been good with full detail in the beginning. I WOULD USE THIS BOOK AS A COASTER INSTEAD OF A BOOK TO LEARN IT WAS WORTHLESS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has not aged well","review":"I loved Enders Game when I first read it as a teenager and maybe that is the best time to appreciate this coming of age SF story. I read it again now as an adult and I almost wish I hadn't. The story is still good but the writing (which I remembered I loved) is simply not there and neither are the characters. Ender and his siblings, who become such giants in the world, are not nearly as interesting as they should be and for me that is the real problem with the novel.So I would recommend it for teens, not for adults. By the latter measure, it falls well short."},{"rating":"2","title":"First read the novella","review":"The novel is powerful and moving, but not perfect. This is because it does not have half the impact of the original novella by the same name first published in Analogue. The novella is perhaps the best piece of fiction I have ever read, and I have read about two thousand science fiction books. Also, if you like Orson Scott Card, you might try to find something from Cordwainer Smith."},{"rating":"2","title":"First book in years to put me awe!","review":"Normally when I read a book I will like it for one of two reasons. 1) Great Plot. 2) Great themes, messages, characters, etc.. Until last week I had never found a book to do both. Ender's Game was the first. I found it completely facitinating, disturbing, Shocking, and in the end satisfying. Since I finished reading, I have recommended this book to all of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone, not just sci-fi fans.","review":"Ender's Game is one of the most entrancing books I have ever read. It capture's the imagination and carries you away. It deserves all 10 stars. However, OSC's follow-ups to this novel left me feeling utterly depressed as they were in no way able to measure up to the story, or the writing, exhibited in Ender's Game. In my opinion, don't bother reading any of the other books of the series, just re-read Ender's Game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suspense but ...","review":"This book was a great page turner that definitely kept my interest. I enjoyed the psychological view of Ender's progression thru training. Some of the other characters seemed rather one-dimensional and needed further development. Though the plot was for the most part fast paced and maintained my interest at times details that seemed relatively important were skipped entirely. I felt like the post battle parts were a rush to finish a late assignment in the alloted number of pages. They amounted to what seems like a rough outline for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books i have ever read...","review":"This book is totally amazing. You can't believe it... it is like you are Ender and you know what is going on... Although i haven't read the sequels, i know i will soon in the future.. If you read this book, you will get stuck on it for a long time. Remember that this is a book... it almost seems like a reality, something that might happen in the next 200 years! Absolutely positively WONDERFUL."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best speculative fiction books ever!","review":"When I first read this book I had just turned 11, it was recommended to me by someone who works with my father (he works for a book company) Naturally, I read it, and I was unable to put it down! I have read it many times now and I think that one of the reasons why it was so successful is because the struggle that Ender goes through, not fitting in, having no flaws, can relate to almost every single person in the world today, especially me, because I have trouble \\"fitting in\\" in school. I really loved it and have readthe whole series and recommend ALL of the books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Enjoyed reading this book very much.

Full of action and I was really surprised by the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game is right up there w/ the greats","review":"This is one absolutely excellent book! In my oppinion, this is right up there with Dune and the Foundation Trilogy. Definitely read this book if you have any interest in SF, military theory, or even plain human nature. Forget the rest of the series, though.-"},{"rating":"2","title":"An ultimate \\"Game Player's\\" book","review":"I read this book before the explosion of electronic games,and although I am not a Game Player, it offers anyone whois into games a kind of \\"Gee, what if I could do this withmy games\\" scenario.For everyone else, a fun, fast read.

Ender is a top of the line prospect set to train in outer space boot camp in order to perfect his mental and physical frame to prevent aliens from scorching the Earth.The details regarding the various games and the psychological maturity necessary to achieve in them are tremendous. Despite his young age and numerous pressures, Ender endures through the trails with great results.This makes you long for intergalactic low gravity moonball or crater pit paintball. Very fun and entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read.....","review":"Ender's Game is an exciting book about a young man named Ender who uses his genius abilities to plan a counter-attack to save Earth from being completely destroyed.

They play war games, and work their way up to toon leaders and finnaly command their own armies. The armies fight in zero gravity games. When they graduate they are sent to different schools, such as command school. Ender Wiggins is just a boy, but he is expected to be the next genius to save earth. His life is shaped by the teachers at the battle school.I just finished this book the other day, and I can't wait to get the sequel. This is one of my favorite books of all time, and I recomend it to anyone over twelve years of age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done narration; enjoyable story.","review":"I decided to get an Orson Scott Card book on tape to listen to while riding and to distract me while driving on business travel. This was a good choice. The narration was pleasant to listen to, communicated the feeling of the story well, and was fluid. First book on tape; so far, so good. I liked Card's story, but I was sure that I would after meeting him at a conference in 2005. Carefully conceived and polished storytelling with interesting ideas and an unexpected twist that somehow made everything seem right. Not over-the-top good, but certainly worth anybody's time to read/listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychologically Terrifying!","review":"Orson brings out the side of us that we keep hidden. The terror of it brings to those who empathize with him and those who are horrified is unmatched and unchallenged. One can only feel sorry and respect Ender for being a killer.

It should be read in schools because it can teach one a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written","review":"I was amazed by the quality of this book. I could not put it down. It gives you the story of this small child bred and raised to battle a race of aliens seemingly bent on mankinds destruction. He is awed by the other students at thde school he is sent to and yet is completely isolated from them mentally. I also enjoyed this book because I saw myself when I was little except for the awed part and how well he does. But I saw myself as a young child, alone and isolated from the other children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Started My Ender Addiction!","review":"I loved this book! My friends have been recommending it to me for years and I finally read it. I got hooked on the series and have read eight of the books so far.

I'm glad I finally read it and now I recommend it to my own friends who have even a remote interest in science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite from My Youth","review":"One of the problems with reading Ender's Game in 2010 is that so many good and bad science fiction books and movies have come and gone that riff or ripoff the themes present in this novel that the original now seems cliched and dated, much like a lot of Heinlein seemed to me when I was a boy. If you are going to read Ender's Game, you're going to have to put it in its historical context and remember that this was the beginning of a thread that soon followed.Also I would recommend the next sequel to complete the tale: Speaker for the Dead, where Ender deals with consequences of his actions. The rest of series are little more than filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Ender's Game goes in the Classics category. I really enjoyed it, finding it hard to put down once I started. Ender is a genius boy who's life is not his own in this sci fi story. His intellegence and that of other genius kids are used in fighting another race. There are secrets kept from Ender as there are secrets kept from the reader leaving you no choice, but to keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ENJOYABLE READ THAT TEACHES YOU ABOUT HUMANITY.","review":"I enjoyed this book because it was always surprising me.It showed me that even the most unlikley of people can do what they never dreamed of even if you are picked on as so many of us are.It also taught me that if you get in to deep with something you loose your self in the end.Dont miss out on this sci-fi tear jerker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of Age Sci-Fi Story","review":"Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a very good Sci-Fi story, but I am giving only 4 stars because there are better books out there.

It's like the first time you see the movie 2001:A Space Odyssey. The end makes you feel like that, only with more understanding. I was completely confused at the end of 2001, but here. . . I know why everything happened.Awesome book! It's one of my favorites. I felt like I WAS Ender.

The book definitely does not disappoint. I would recommend to just about anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate twist","review":"I'm not much of a sci/fi reader, but I really enjoyed this book. It pushes the endurance of humans to the edge in what is required from the young boys in this story, and examines the ability of people to adapt and then create solutions under the most extreme circumstances. A gripping story, with one of the best twists of plot that I have ever seen. Truly brilliant. The characters are well developed and have interesting dynamics not unlike what many people expirience in their own lives. Definetely a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a book about a young boy who is a genius among geniuses. It is an incredible book that makes you use your imagination. You can not seem to put it down. Many times at night while I was reading this book I was forced to stay up and read more. I just kept telling myself one more chapter, one more chapter, and eventually it was over! I have read it numereous times and still have not found it boring. I always spot things I have missed the first time. So everytime I read this I look forward to finding new things that I did not get before or just did not see. Every page is something new and exciting. There are always new challenges for Ender to overcome and it makes it just that much more exciting. You always have to finish up the chapter before you can put it down. If you neeed a book to read and want it to be exciting I highly suggest this one its interesting from beggining to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"The book was in mint condition, came on time and there were NO problems in any part of the process.

The entire plot fits together, although the main character (Ender) seemed suspiciously like an adult in a 6-year old's body. But anyone who questions ender is a fool. I've heard arguments that he is a brilliant tactician, yet gets beat up so it doesn't make sense. WRONG. A brilliant tactician doesn't need to be a built up mud-slugger. that's what grunts are for.Easily in the Top 3 science fiction books with only Dune (of course, what else) and 2001: Space Odyssey above it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sci Fi Classic","review":"This is a great read and a classic sci fi story. It opens the mind up for thought on a wide variety of topics including war, imperialism, government, good vs evil, genetics etc. A large portion of it is about the changes the main character, Ender, goes through. Towards the end however, the books offers several plot twists that really deliver and set up the stage for the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encapsulating read","review":"From cover to cover, Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a page turner. If I had one criticism, I'd say the flow of the book speeds up a bit abruptly toward the end.

Not hardcore Science Fiction though.","review":"If you're looking for a very complex novel about future technologies and outer worlds, this is not it. If you're looking for a beautiful story about humanity with an interesting, futuristic setting, then buy this book immediately.

I felt it was too simplistic, however, because it \\"told\\" rather than \\"showed.\\" That is, I felt I was being spoon-fed most of the information, especially when Card was relating how Ender felt at various points, etc. I may be breaking the hearts of a few people but, \\"Tough noogies.\\" The action sequences were good and fun to read but I couldn't help wishing I had read this title when I was younger. (I'd probably be touting it as one of the best books and so on, ad nauseum.) Granted, I appreciated some of the ideas contained within but I didn't feel moved as much as some people have in the past. If you like your books simple and to lay everything out for you, then read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely incredible","review":"unbelievable is the word for ender's game. it's impossible to not get involved in ender's triumphs and pitfalls...definately one to share with your friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Blend of Sci-Fi and Imagination","review":"This book has everything you could want: action, mystery, feeling, and imagination. It is about a seven-year-old boy, named Andrew Wiggin (or Ender), who is sent to a battle school in space where he is tought to be a leader, and how to fight fights. Sounds boring? The thing is this 7-year-old is the human races last hope against an alien invasion. He gets to think up strategies for fighting in zero-gravity, and is tested in simulators. But what happens when they aren't just simmulators anymore? That is what this book is about. So if you enjoy books you just can't put down, then go read Ender's Game."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite SF book","review":"This is my favorite Science Fiction book of all time. It's engaging and well written, and I really enjoyed reading it (several times over the past 10 years). I even think it has something to teach about leadership and how people work together. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 10 BEST science fiction novel written","review":"Enders Game is one of the few novels I recommend to EVERYONE interested in reading fiction. This story is ageless, full of soul and triumph, and appeals to both male and female, young and elderly. I gave this book to my father, my teenage son and daughter.....and my nail tech (20 yr old guy)!If I had to choose 10 books to take to a deserted island, this would be one of them (I know, sounds stupidly dramatic, whatever).*THANK YOU, THANK YOU, ORSON SCOTT CARD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game","review":"It's so hard to remember throughout the book that Ender is only a boy; a child! Easy read and a fun book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BAD BOOK MADE EASY","review":"I have to agree with the readers from Greenlawn, New York and Houston, Texas. This book is a disgrace to the sci-fi community. Even the slightest consideration of the possibility of a little boy conquering the aliens is implausible. The major characteristic of Ender being his astonishing analytical and psychological aspects in which regards himself to never really lose a game is one total and major flaw; this stoy-line truth is lacking both tact and feasability. To summarize, this book is a total mistake and should only be read by young second or third rate readers whom do not really pose a desire to read but a desire to be spoonfed the information as if he/she was a kindergardener."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do people like this","review":"Wow im writing this review because i just read a review of DUNE and somebody said that Enders Game was better, i have to tell you now that that this is the ultimate over-hyped book ive ever read, ya you might like it if your 12, but other then that it is no game changer, its about a bunch of kids floating around, no offense to the author i know what he was trying to do, but i blame everyone else( you know who you are) who says this is the best book, i was recommended this book by a few friends, and i was like ok ill try it, and after i got done i was like why do people like this so much, its simplistic its boring. its about as deep as any twilight novel. So to wrap this up go read Dune and listen to Mer De Noms by a Perfect Circle(for some reason they match up perfectly) and skip Enders Game unless your 12 like i said"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ","review":"This has to be the worst book I have ever read. I cannot understand why anyone would give it even a satisfactory review. The authors descriptions were so vague that you could not even picture it in even the most beckoned mind. If you are considering buying this book, please reconsider and buy a little more mature book, like Curious George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Overrated Book in Fiction","review":"Honestly, I cringe every time anyone recommends this as a good book to read to anyone who's looking to get into science fiction. As if Sci-Fi does not already suffer from a bad enough reputation already, this laughable revenge-fantasy book to make all those kids who were bullied and unappreciated in high school feel better about themselves has to be pushed on people looking for a read above pre-adolescent level. If you want a good Sci-Fi book, read Hyperion. Read the Foundation series. Read Dune. Honestly, read ANYTHING other than this overrated piece of drek.I might have enjoyed this book when I was 12. Unfortunately, I was too late and read it in my twenties. By then I had grown up and moved on to some real literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book manipulates and dehumanizes; it is an empty book.","review":"Before considering reading this, I think that one shouldlook to Norman Spinrad's review of it as it appearedin Issac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine. Failing that,at least realize that the entire book is a deliberatebutton-pushing saga, following the patterns of humanmythology that are older then history, in a completelymanipulative way. Read Frank Herbert and you'll see that hewants to show the emptiness of the Messiah complex; Cardcelebrates it. Herbert wants to explore what humanity isabout; Card wants to explore how much money it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't figure out the hype","review":"In general I was turned off by this book. In the end, I think it is a child's book. It was quite easy to read and good enough to fill the time on my flight, but in the end, I was bothered to have read it. As someone who has experienced sleep deprivation, combat training, science training and much of what described in the book, I just found it pandering. Perhaps it is because in this age, being able to handle three dimensional thinking and movement and game play just isn't that spectacular. The world is full of people who spend hours fighting in games on-line and is also full of people who are bright enough to compose these games. I can't compare this to great writers whose work transcends science or presents philosophical context. It seems dated and naive in retrospect, but perhaps those who love it simply are impressed by things many now take for granted. This could be a commentary on the generational seperation in the wired world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack juvenile military sci-fi","review":"Oh dear, oh dear. Whay do people rave about this book? Trite ideas, religous propaganda (though less overt than some of his earlier books), poor characters and average writing all add up to a pathetic juvenile adventure story that falls far short of the great (Herbert) and even not-so-great (Heinlein) writers he is imitating. I have been told the later books are better, but after this I have no desire to find out. This is equalled in its awfulness only by L. Ron Hubbard, another religous nutcase. How did this guy win awards? I hear the sound of airport cash-tills ringing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender has made an impact, huh?","review":"Regardless of whether you liked this book or not, you must admit it has caught the attention of a significant number of people. I read it and I liked it, simple as that. Read it, and see if you like it. It is worth the effort, or as some people say, not worth the effort. You decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polarized plot; much too politically correct","review":"Good novels stretch our understanding, but bad novels stretch so far and to such silly lengths that they end up breaking the entire story. The author clearly has little understanding of what childhood is, and what we as adults can take from such a carefree and simple time, and use today. Children in even the most dire and truly saddening experiences our species has to offer still remain children. Spend some time at your local Shriner's Hospital for Children to see how children who most likely will never have a chance at life, still manage to see wonder and remain endlessly curious at the world to which they are exposed. Seek your inspiration there. But for heaven's sake don't turn kids into tiny adults, present them in a sanitized, frankly pedantic and highly polarized plot, together with stories of utter silliness about taking over planets with the Internet, and expect it to be readable or even feasible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sci-Fi Novel","review":"Ender's Game is quite possibly the quintessential Sci-Fi novel. It's one of the best around with some truly unique settings and characters. For any fan of science fiction, this is a must read, and was one of the inspirations for my own novelThe Elder Worlds: Book One.I first read Ender's Game in high school, around the time I tackled my first novel, which went through many revisions since those days. Ender's Game was one of those books that was hard to put down, and played out almost like a movie. The writing style of Card makes it easy to visualize the characters while still allowing for individual interpretations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Read!!","review":"I came across this book in the Middle Eastern desert during Operation Iraqi Freedom. This book was on the Untied States Marine Corps Commandant's Reading List and handed to me by my lieutenant. During lulls in operations, I would read this book. It kept me hooked, so much so that I carried it in my cargo pocket every where I went. The concept was fresh, the characters interesting, to the point I wish I wrote it myself. The only problem I had with the book was the ending which I didn't too much like, but it's still a good read. Upon completion, I did the Marine thing and passed it to one of my young non-comissioned officers to read. I am looking forward to learning more about the character Bean in Ender's Shadow!! Get this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book - Must read whole series!!!","review":"I thought this book was one of the best OSC has produced. Being an avid reader of his, I can say this is one of his best works. I read this work in 1988, and have continued through the saga through to the end. He uses a lot of current issues in a abstract sort of way in his writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Card is Sci-fi at its best","review":"For those of us who have followed Card avidly (since his publication of \\"Anaccompanied Sonata\\" in Omni) this is probably his best novel. Fear of the Other, stolen youth, fights, death, action, genius...it's all in here. Card is the Man when it comes to cogent, thoughtful sci-fi that also just happens to be an astoundingly good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personality","review":"Ender seemed to develop his own personality during the book. I feel like I know him after reading this book. The Giant game seemed to be a true view of technology in the future. Ender is the SUPER SCI-FI HERO of the 20th century. THIS SHOULD BE A FILM . IT WOULD BE A BOX OFFICE HIT AND MAKE MILLIONS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written book","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Every chapter got better and better. I want to read all of Orson Scott Card's books after this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be mediocre if only...","review":"... you ignore what Card says makes a good leader. Ignorance, mindless aggression, never learning to deal with any challenges, being genetically superior to everyone else and being immune from any responsibility for your actions.Hmmm, a messianic, child Hitler figure is the hero and this is ignored by all those 5-star reviews?I'll ignore the reviewer's debate on what a 6 year old Napolean's behavior would be because who can really know. I'll ignore the predictable ending plot twist and the lack of any real conflict or character development because perhaps this was meant for grade school readers who like simple, easy to read books.What I can't ignore is that the basic point of the book, reflected in the actions and thoughts of all the major characters, that power and brutality are noble and honorable if you are born to them.As a summary, the plot says that it must be cool to be an amoral, semi-divine being. Somehow I don't agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"Years ago, when I read this, I wrote a very, very lengthy review and posted it here on Amazon. It was never put up, because the Amazon moderators didn't approve; it was too mean, they said.That killed my desire to write a review for this and for books in general, although I'm trying to do so now that it's a few years later.I'm not going to bother writing up a lengthy review again. I'm just going to say this book came across as very, very juvenile and hilariously absurd. One of the highlights is ***spoiler*** Ender's brother and sister changing the world via the internet. I guess Card didn't predict how every argument on the internet ends with people calling each other trolls.Regardless, while I'm not going to make another lengthy review, it does bother me that such a bad book can get such good ratings by others. Thus, I'm trying to temper the enthusiasm with my honest rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile & Dull","review":"I really expected this book to hold a lot of merit as everyone I know has praised it as being a classic must-read work of elevated science fiction. It's really just about the dullest novel I've ever had to endure. Don't believe the hype. This book was juvenile and bland in both content and execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lenders game/quest","review":"A tale of survival for the human soul as well as all man kind.

It takes watching 10 to find 1 that's any good. This is one of the \\"1's\\". The number of reviews on this book is a fitting testament to this work. While I have just finished reading it for the first time, there's no doubt I'll be reading it again. My only regret is that I didn't read the book many years earlier. If you're a fan of science fiction, don't make the same mistake. Read it now"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just action science fiction!","review":"Ender's Game is one of the best novels I have ever read. I have read many of the classics, and they could not hold a candel to the TITLE PAGE of Ender's Game. It tells the story of a young prodigy, with intellectual talent beyond anything humanity has ever seen. Although many have said is unrealistic for a 6-year-old to speak and act like an adult, he must think of himself as one, like prodigies do. A prodigy, such as Ender, has an IQ of about 200+, meaning they are twice as smart as the average person their age. But Ender is more than the average prodigy- he can create strategies that cannot be matched, and cause surprises to all his enemies. And those surprises are why Ender's Game is such a great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you start Ender's you can't put it down till the end.","review":"Ender's Game is one of the best novels I have read in many years. up there with Ringworld, and Foundation.

You don't have to be big on sci-fi to read this book and love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Put...The Best Book I have Ever Read","review":"Simply put, this is the best book in any genre, any time, any country that I have ever read. No deeper look into the mind..no better book...that is all I can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true original.","review":"This book is a sheer joy from start to finish. In fact all his Ender series are difficult to put down. This is an original concept that is well written. A true classic. Every adult and every student I've recommended this book to has loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful sciene fiction - technology is secondary","review":"This was a really nice way to get back to science fiction. It seems odd to say since it was so different and more... adult... but as the alienated child goes to a special place to excel at arcane things, well, it reminded me of Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow What a great book","review":"I thought that this book was great. It was about a small child who goes by the name of Ender. As a young boy a military force takes him to be trained as a soldier. He is not a normal boy though. He has been bred to be a genius in every way. Although he is a soldier he is being trained In a different type of war. It is a war in space, which is being fought against another species. He does not realize it until later but he is being isolated from all the other children in his class. Although this seems mean it is necessary to make him strong. He is being trained not just to be a soldier but to be a general. He is slowly but surely being driven insane.Throughout the book you get a few paragraphs each chapter that explain the feelings of the commanders and why they are doing what they are doing. I Thought that this added very well to the story and was a very good idea. Although I do not want to give away the ending of the book I will say it was a complete surprise and very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"promised well, but completely disapponting","review":"I can't see why authors like this can't manage to finish writing a book in a satisfying way. Why do they rush? Why can't they avoid telling too much, too many years in 2-3 pages trying to justify a non-sense final?Despite all the war-oriented plot (srsly, should I buy the cold-war revival?) the book could even gain 3 stars, but once again, the ending is horrible. Completely disappointing.Sorry, the author won't get another penny from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This book was written with skill and is a very good read. I have read it multiple times and liked it the same every time. The plot is one for children or adults. I reccomend this book to read on any occasion that you want to read. The children in this book almost come alive and make you care for them and hope for their success. To me the way that he (Card) thinks of things to keep the reader going in full interest is great. He thinks of things in a way most of us would not normally think of to get Ender out of his traps and problems. He presents his ideas in a very tallented manner and that made it a book that hooked my attention from page 1. I can only reccomend that you read this book, but you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game","review":"Ender's game is a fast paced, intense read that makes you think. Is it right to make kids lose their inocence? Do we have the right to eliminate an entire form of life? Are there really kids out there that are that smart? Does the Human Race have that kind of potential? It also keeps things simple and easy to read so the reader does not get lost amongst all the happenings. It is a great book and I strongly advise reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I flew threw this book. I just happened to come accross this book and I am glad I did. Unlike most books this stayts with you and has you thinking about it well after you have put it down. There could of been better character development in some instances, but the main characters for the most part were well developed. The story is grand in scope, but stayed very personall which I liked. And the Science Fiction stayed light on the science so even those who are not big sci-fi fans can enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Read","review":"This is an amazing book that I picked up back in high school. I've since reread it twice and each time I feel like I take more from the book than the time before. It is a highly recommended book for everyone to read. Ender will get in your head and force you to test your morals and explore the extent of the human need to survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank goodness theres a sequel!","review":"To start, im really glad theres a sequel. The end left me wanting more. One thing I thing that was a change from some books i have read is the reality of Ender. Hes believable, and doesnt have unrealistic (fake) feelings and emotions. The story was fast paced and exciting. I started a bit skeptical, thinking \\"oh its another sci fi book.\\" At the end, i was a changed kid. if you need something to read, thisis a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Orson Scott Card","review":"This is the book by which all SF novels are measured--none of which deserve to sit in its throne room. I met Card in 1988 at Appalachian State University. I took a writing workshop with him in D.C. that same year. The man is a brain. The novel concept of the training should impress. I will admit I do not care much for the sequels, but Ender's Game literally changed my outlook on SF. Some one replied \\"it all depends on how you look at it.\\" I disagree. This novel cannot be read and disliked by the normal human being. I've loaned it (and thus lost my autographed copy) to people who hated SF, and though it didn't convert them, they admitted it was one of the coolest things they had ever read. I disagree again. It is the coolest."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top ten all-time favorites","review":"I adore this book. I've read it who-knows how many times over the years. And every time, it's new and engaging and wonderful. Love the characters, the writing, the subtext. Just a great book.I'm normally not a sci-fi kind of gal, but this one (and the rest of the series, though the first is still the best) is one of my favorite books. I can't wait until my son is old enough to read it. In fact, I've been considering reading it to him before he goes to bed at night. Though right now (at eight years old), he might be a bit too young for the topics presented. So I'll be patient...and read it to myself again."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I read this book in about a week because I had to travel a lot by subway.

When you think about what a good story should be regardless of genre, then add an amazing SF backdrop, this novel is it. I have not read other books in the series, but I can recommend this one with the greatest enthusiasm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for young and old - worth reading over and over","review":"I love the ender series.

Despite the main character being a child genius, I was able to relate.

It has a fun twist ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to make you think","review":"This was recommended to me by a friend a number of years ago, I could not tell my younger self how much fun I would have reading this book.

It is an extremely entertaining and fast read. It is defintely on of Mr. Card's best works. But even if you love this book, be careful on it's sequels - they are very different in story and tone. If you're looking for a great follow up - try \\"Ender's Shadow\\" - which is the same story told froma different character's point of view. I know it sounds kind of forced and trite, but it is actually very good and will give you what you want if you're an Ender's Game fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\\\WoW/","review":"This book absolutely blew me away. The sheer brilliance of the novel was astounding. It took you to another dimension; one where human beings and buggers are rivals and pressure to save humanity lies solely on Ender's shoulders. The tests Ender goes through were extremely hard, both mentally and physically. You'd think he'd break, but it was Ender's strength and endurance that kept him going. The imagination that went into a work like this is astonishing. Overall, I regard this book as a masterpiece. I commend Card for his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent book!","review":"Ender's Game was one of the best books I have ever read.

I'm ashamed to say I found it later in life, though I'm almost glad I didn't read it when I was younger. I'd have been inspired to be an evil genius! The treatment of the characters, that the children are really little people, the remorse the adults have controlling them, is all very real and fantastic.The only real problem is the ending. It's like the author ran out of paper. I don't want to spoil it, but all subplots end (vaguely), two wars end, and they make a religion, in what amounts to about 20 pages. It seemed awfully rushed. Characterizations seem to fall apart too, though this may be a choice by the author I disagree with. Overall, a great read, and I'd like to see more from the series. PS, the end has a preview of some fantasy book that seems kind of lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! Card takes the world by storm, literally!","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. This book takes the sci-fi crowd to a new plateau. If you've never read sci-fi, this is the one to start with. The scene is set with a young boy, Andrew Wiggins, or Ender, having a monitoring device removed from his skull. He gets into trouble and kills a boy. From there he is wanted for the International Fleet to protect the world for when the \\"buggers\\" attack again.

I thought it was in a cool setting and had excellent characters, though parts of it were like being slowly pecked to death by a duck.

However the book is very predictable and I could tell what would happen ahead of time. But all in all it was a good book. In the movie I would like to play Ender even though I'm a 50 year old dentist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"This typical sci-fi, fantasy novel by Card has unique qualities that only this book has; however, those qualities are sometimes negative. Ender's Game tells a story just through dialogue between supporting characters; the events support the conversations. As much as it is unique and interesting, the words are hard to understand, as the vocabulary is not exactly orthodox.The plot of the story is well-balanced; every event is reasonable. This story ends with a slight twist, as Ender Wiggin finds out what he really is doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I know everyone seems to love this book, but I hated it! It isn't \\"science\\" fiction (like A.C. Clark books), but fiction. I could not suspend my belief THAT much to appreciate what the pre-pubescent main character could do. Perhaps I'm too old (30?). I think this book appeals to pre-high school kids, but it did nothing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Overrated Science Fiction Book Ever?","review":"The most intriguing thing about Ender's Game is trying tofigure out why it receives raves. The backboneof the plot can be explained in a sentence and while itmight have supported a short story (the resolutionof the story is predictable half way through)it's too flimsy a frame for a novel. Theno-gray-zone series of leadership-lesson episodes read like Card wrote a story to thetable of contents in a US Army basic trainingmanual. My only explanation for the book's popularity isthat it hit a sweet spot of readers with their hands onthe joystick,hungry for a rationalizationfantasy for the hours and quarters that theysquander in video game parlors masteringMissile Command."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as advertised","review":"I bought this book and read it on the recommendation of a co-worker who insisted it was the best book he had ever read. I read the story and quite frankly was bored the entire time. I never got truly interested in the character's developement and saw exactly how the book would end long before it actually did. Would I recommend this book? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible .... why does this get such good reviews?","review":"If you are under 15 years of age, you might enjoy this story. But for anyone over 15, move on ... this is just juvenile. The nature of the interactions, the dialog, the story. It was so bad I didn't get past page 100 and I can't bring myself to attempt another Card book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ender's game needed to end sooner!","review":"I feel like all the other reviewers who gave this book 1 star. The book's plot line was weak, I got tired of the endless military babel and the snooze fest \\"battles.\\" The book had unnecessary religious undertones, add to that the continuous anti-military/anti-authority propaganda and you have a great brain washing book for young minds. The only thing I can see that made this book redeemable was the obsessive game play, I SUPPOSE young boys/men who never grew up types love reading about someone playing video games, but I personally need a little more to keep me entertained. This book was a huge waste. If only Card could reimburse me my time and money then maybe I wouldn't feel ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phenomenally boring","review":"A more tiresome, tautological and uneventful novel could not be imagined. All the other 1-star reviews pretty much cover the massive deficiencies of this laughable piece of dreck. I'm stunned that it came to me with such high recommendation. I decided to branch out from literary fiction and read some genre work and I started with Ender's Game on my sci-fi quest. Big mistake. I didn't give up on the genre but I lost more than a little bit of respect for fan's of the genre. This was an award winner? Wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that will not only entertain, but make you think.","review":"Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is the best science fiction book ever written. It not only entertains the reader with a great story, but also askes many philosiphycal questions about life. It is a great combination between science fiction and drama, that no other book has achieved. A must read for all science fiction enthusiests."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I thought this was the best book I have ever read. I felt as if I was Ender and every thing that happened I was Ender acting it out. I would really rate this book 11 but it didnt go that high!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive, most impressive.","review":"If you look at the above reviews- people either love Enders Game or they hate it. Most people love it. Me too. It is so tragic and so intriging and so frightengly real. But if you read it expecting a paper thin Star Wars clone (no wait a moment I love Star Wars and Enders game- it is possible) don't read it. If you want a deep, involving Star Wars book read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"I first read this book many years ago when I was but a boy, and I can honestly say that this is the book that turned me into an avid reader. The book has obvious appeal for younger readers (Ender, and most of the main characters are children of remarkable ability), but it is by no means young adult fiction. Card uses the childrens point of view to look at humanity in a new and fresh way, in a way that escaped me until later in life. I've reread the book more times than I care to mention here, and it always provides me with new insights.Probably the most important aspect of the novel is that it just expounds coolness. The plot is incredible and deftly crafted, the characters ring true and win the reader's heart, and every kid and adult reader wants to go to, or wants have gone to Battle School after reading ENDER'S GAME.I've made many people read this book, and every single one of them has loved it. So now I'm making you read it, and you'll love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of my favorites","review":"I have read this book twice (and the entire series once). Both times after I was over twenty years old. The point is not that Ender is a child, but that he is a genetically created genius who could not have a normal childhood. The reason I would recommend this book is because the second time I read it I was so moved that my wife asked me what was going on and I told her that I couldn't explain it, she'd have to read it for herself. She HATES s-f. Hates it, I could never get her to pick up anything even remotely related to s-f. Well, I convinced her to read this book. She read it, cover to cover in less than three days. She loved it enough to read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief introduction to the story.","review":"Earth is in a perilous state. Aliens have attacked the planet twice and nearly destroyed humanity. In order to be ready the next time around, governments world wide have taken to breeding and raising young children as military geniuses. It is into this world that Ender Wiggin is born. In this story Orson Scott Card weaves an amazing tale, centering on an ingenius, unaccepted boy, and how his journey through life leads him to a startling link with the creatures he was born to destroy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to decide which is best:Hyperion or Ender's Game","review":"Incredible book that is Orson Scott Card's best!!!! I have never met anyone that can read the first 25 pages and put the book down! Be prepared to stay up all night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, exciting tale of a boy's struggle with destiny","review":"Showing great promise, Ender begins his education in warfare at an early age, and struggles through an endless barrage of 'games' until, years later, he is ready for his final test.Orson Scott Card's writing shows his great ability at characterization. You are welded to the character throughout the book. When Ender suffers a drawback, you feel the sting. When he triumphs, you feel the glory!A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Sci-fi books ever","review":"Ender's Game is one of my favorite books of all time, have probably read it a couple dozen times.Not only is this a great story that has a pace that keeps you engaged through the entire story, but the storyline also has so many themes twined together that just about anyone will find a way to relate to the characters. Ender is both a heroic and tragic character, a brilliant child bound for greatness, but at the same time a pawn of the adults who control his life (and even is birth itself).In many ways this book is a treatise on the belief that the end justifies the means. I would highly recommend this book as a subject for any book club who wants to have a lively discussion, even for those who do not like Sci-fi books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entirely fun and games.","review":"Ender's Game is not just about games and strategy, and it is not good clean fun for young readers. This book includes violent scenes of a child killing other children, twice, and also includes one graphic sexual moment. If you are raising your children to be caring and sensitive, stay away from this book. It was somewhat entertaining for an adult, with an interesting plot, but shallow and unbelievable characters, sub-plots so outlandish as to be insulting, a ridiculous foe in the \\"buggers\\" and literally no satisfying ending. I'm sure it will make a blockbuster movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids. Horrible.","review":"This book left me feeling awful. How the kids were treated was sickening-even the adult characters in the book thought it was sickening. I wanted so badly to see the character grow with his age but it never happens. No morals, virtues or honor to be gained from this story! The story lacks direction and climax. Drones on and on in some parts...in other parts as quickly as it gains your attention, it extinguishes it. Horrible book for kids to read-especially considering all the crap going on with the shootings in Connecticut! I would ban this book from kids if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Boring Mega-Series, Or Life inside a Video Game","review":"If you like shallow characters and a story that reads like a video game, dig in. I got suckered into this one and dutifully plodded along until the main character became 'one with the ants' (after destroying their entire civilization)! I can't beleive the author had the nerve to write sequels (do I hear a k-ching k-ching?). And such a symbolic name for a guy that destroys worlds - Ender!SF has become a pile of criminal garbage - stuff like this just adds to the heap.So Look up Sheep and stop buying this junk. Ask for real SF!If I could give this one a zero I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Although I read the entire boring book, I suppose I expected someting to happen....not sure what, but it didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCOMPLETE BOOK","review":"This review is not for the content of the book, it is for Amazon. I received my copy early and was excited to dig in. I got so engrossed in it that I stayed up late to finish what appeared to be the last few pages only to find out my book was incomplete. It was missing 7 pages from chapter 14 and the entirety of chapter 15. I can't imagine that this is a one-time incident, so I would go to your local bookstore to purchase this book, not AMAZON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I found it extremely difficult to put this book down.","review":"I found it extremely difficult to put this book down. From the onset this book is a gripping taleof a boy who is forced into manhood by circumstances.

When I read it then I only skimmed it and loved it, in 6th grade I picked it up again and read it to my favorite CD (311, self titled). Now every time I listen to that CD I remember a part of Enders Game. I can't wait until the movie comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever","review":"Simply, this is one of the best stories I have ever read.

Ender's Game is the best of the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENDER","review":"to this day, this is still probably my favorite book. coming across it at the age of only nine, it changed my prospective on life. since then, i have probably read it over 5 times. the detail that Card uses takes the reader to a different time and place, and even dimension. i have not yet found a book to even challenge this unforgettable novel.if this book interests you, you should definitely check out the rest of this great series.AND IF YOU HAVE KIDS, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR THEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Struggle","review":"Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a great book that goes very deep with each of the characters. After the first couple chapters I really got to know about the characters and by the last couple chapters I was trying to guess what was going to happen. The main character Ender (Andrew is what his mother would say) is put through many tough tasks that test him mentally and physically. It was nice how Card went from character to character in each chapter to help you understand what the person is thinking and why they did something. After about halfway through the book you understand what Ender is going to have to do but you have no idea how he is going to accomplish this task. This book was a great book to read. The theme of the book is anyone can do anything they really commit themselves to."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's this about?","review":"God almighty, I had to read this fantasy scifi book for a book club, and I'm lucky I didn't strangle myself. To start, fantasy isn't my cup of tea, but I decided to give it a chance. Afterall, I'm a proponent of the \\"no contempt prior to investigation\\" movement. Halfway through, I realized I had no idea what the hell this thing was trying to tell me. Some six year old kid freezing computer bodies while adults explain to him in adult terms the reason he's so important. Wait a minute! Unless a hundred years from now preteens are a thousand times brighter than their counterparts today, no way this kid is going to understand anything the guy tells him. Hell, I didn't understand what the guy was talking about. It was excruciatingly painful from beginning to end. Frustrated, I called a friend in the club and she said \\"hang on to the end, there's a real surprise.\\" So, good soldier that I am, I did. But I didn't find the surprise (...). Couldn't stand this read. Dreadful!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"INAPPROPRIATE LANGUAGE","review":"I DO NOT agree with the publisher regarding the recommended age for this book. There is language in it (e.g., bastard, pisshead) that is highly inappropriate for 9 to 12 year olds. This was originally an adult book that was re-released with a new kid-friendly cover. Regardless of how interesting the story might be, I would not purchase it for my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Simple Twist Does Not A Novel Make","review":"This book could have been written as a short story ... by a thirteen year old.It could be retitled \\"Recess goes to Space\\".How anyone could rate this little-boy-saves-the-day story alongside the greats of SF is utterly beyond me.This book was lent to me by someone who simply couldn't wait to see what I thought of the twist in the tale. I won't repeat the conversation we had after I finished.Thank God I didn't spend money on this simplistic, trivial, waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game","review":"One of the very best books I've ever read, not just a fantastic sci-fi story, but the character development really makes you feel for Ended and the others.

Can't wait for this to come to the big screen"},{"rating":"2","title":"modern classic","review":"The book should become a modern classic. I read it years ago, then again when my teenage son got hooked. It's appropriate for young adults. But I loved it as much now as I did the first time - broad age appeal. The hole series is good, but the first book is the best. Very captivating and interesting. Well developed characters with some surprises and twists in the plot.

I know that this greatly puts me in the minority as almost everyone I mentioned I was reading this book to just LOVES it, but I guess it went over my head a bit. It's Science Fiction to the extreme (which is not a bad thing) but I found it difficult to fully follow what was happening and so the ending was a bit anti-climatic for me. In that it's such a classic though I think it's worth reading for one to form their own opinion on it -- who knows you may love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Can't wait for the movie to come out.

I was attached to the book like leach. The author, Orson Scott Card is an amazing sci-fi writer. In fact I envy this book's 1st time readers. His plot was ingenious! This author's detail is absolutely amazing. The story line Card followed was the most brilliant I've ever had experience with. He turned the old, want to save the world and become a hero plot into a story you never want to stop reading. I'll admit it, I don't read a lot of books. Most of the time I don't even read the books we are assigned to read in class. But this book is different, I actually wanted to read it. The only other book that could even come close to being judged on the same scale as this book would be a Redwall series book, which I also highly recommend. But if you want a book to enjoy, pick this one, i promise you, it will be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No book holds a candle to ENDER'S GAME","review":"Ender's Game is the best book ever written.

For me, it was impossible to put down and neverrang a false note. The ending gave me goosebumps. I believethat this book is the standard againstwhich all pure sf should be measured. (Fortunately I do notwrite pure sf myself, but as a newnovelist I'm both awestruck and jealous of Orson Scott Card for havingwritten such an amazing story.)James Halperin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game is more than just great action.","review":"The buggers have attacked twice and it is up to Ender to stop them. Ender's Game could be summarized by that sentance, but it would be a very inadaquate synopsis. For it is not the buggers that are Ender's antagonists in the novel, but the adults. Everything the military leaders and teachers do they feel is necessary for the salvation of humanity, so they will not change their actions simply for the sake of a young boy. Ender's Game is the tale of a child learning to live with the responsibility of an adult and trying to cope with being the best when all he wants is to be free of the shackles imposed on him, to be able to just be a kid again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Sci-Fi","review":"This is by far the greatest Sci-Fi book ever written, next to Dune,of course.

They're all great, although none of the others even come close to being as great as Ender's Game. This book is good for everyone, science-fiction fan or not, because it's more of a human book than anything else. It shows (finally!) that kids are not ignorant idiots. Part of what makes this novel so excellent is that it's written from a \\"gifted\\" child's point of view. Many books that I've read make kids out to be brainless, immature, and inferior. Children, gifted or not, have feelings just like everyone else. This novel finally proves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT.

It was the stuff of mythologies, of urban legend, of scripture. Ender crawled into my heart and I bled for him, I cried for him, I will never forget him. At first I was utterly disturbed by the child abuse, but I couldn't put the book down. So, why the 4 stars instead of 5? Probably my fault. There were parts of this book that just went over my head, parts I didn't get. Like Anderson? Graff made an impression, but I didn't understand Anderson's role? The structure is so different than what we get fed through today's literature. The subplots and how they were woven was like nothing I've ever read in a craft book and I truly thought that Card was just dumping in some words and chapters to allow Ender a moment to grow older. But no. Every scene he wrote had a purpose and closure. In two words, this book was unconventional and brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very tedious reading","review":"Limited action.

You follow the young boy-genius, Ender, as he is being groomed to fight a war against an alien race.This isn't just a story about war; it's a story about being a boy, a freak of sorts because of his intelligence, being pushed through a hostile system where weakness is despised, and losers are dealt with harshly. It's about trying to make friends where friendship is not tolerated, and destroying your opponent is the only thing that brings praise.Ender's just a kid, but he's expected to save the human race. Great book for any genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decidedly Engrossing","review":"This book is very well-written, if not a bit formulaic in style. The story is original and the author presents a very interesting idea about space combat that I'm surprised hasn't made it's way into a cheap video game yet.Unfortunately, the author spends too much time alluding to some commonly-addressed problems with humanity and much of the conversation sounds contrived. Happily, none of these things detract from the entertainment value of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and entertaining","review":"Fast paced and entertaining.

One of my favorite books of all time, Ender's game is surely a book that everyone should read. Even to people who don't like sci-fi( I didn't when I read the book) will love it, and its something I want to read over,and over again. In the books following Ender's Game(the adult sequels), the author tries a little hard to be complicated, but the narration and storyline is great in this book and makes a great read for both teens and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ive ever read","review":"An uncle of mine gave me this book. I wasnt previously a science fiction fan, let alone a Card fan. Now im both. This book is so...so...so HUMAN. Maybe its because of the fact that i was a young boy, like Ender, when i read it, but something about this book is unforgettable. I can pick it up still today and just read random pages of it, and ill enjoy it. The story is so touching, and even though Ender is a genius, i think he has an every-man quality that is undescribable. A previous reviewer mentioned that the queen as weakness idea was a drawback to the book. He obviously didnt read the whole book, or maybe hes just ignorant. The weakness he speaks of was actually the alien homeplanet. The queen turned out to be the very opposite, giving Ender a new hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"Intriguing idea, a bunch of child geniuses with potty mouths being trusted to save the world. Somehow it doesn't shock me. Anyway, great book. Ender is abused by the International Fleet because in order for him to save the world they have to give him not only the proper training but the proper attitude. He thinks he's a killer throughout the book, and he must deal with that while continuing to face the challenges the IF sets for him at the Battle School. Great story, good characters, theme-heavy, humorous, and with some good yet comprehensible sci-fi concepts, this book is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Science Fiction Novel","review":"I do not read science fiction often, but this title was recommended to me by a friend. It was definately worth reading. It had an interesting plot and you can closely identify with Enders very human feelings. The basic plot line is the smartest young children go to a cadet academy that trains them to save the world. The book describes Enders story through this sometimes cruel way of life, and ultimately there is a great end which I thought was powerful. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in something suspenseful and satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a rush","review":"ENDER'S GAME STARTS OFF WITH SO MUCH DETAIL IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE HOW IT ENDS.

I ACTUALLY LIKED THE BOOK, AND I'M NOT THAT MUCH OF A READER. THE ONLY WARNING THAT I'LL GIVE YOU IS THAT YOU MIGHT END UP READING THE SEQUAL TO IT BECAUSE THE ENDING KIND OF LEAVES YOU HANGING."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work of Art","review":"Ender's Game, one of Orson Scott Card's most magnificent works, should be read by anyone interested in sci-fi.

My father also lent me Ender's Game. As coincidence would have it, I had taken out all 3 sequels to Ender's Game, so I got to read all 4. Ender's Game provided the most memorable characters and events I have ever read. I hope that Orson Scott Card continutes to right Parallel books (ie Ender's Shadow)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sci-Fi Action book i've read","review":"I have read a lot of sci-fi books that had action in them because I am a huge Star wars fan. So I know what Sci-Fi with action should be like.This book went into a lot of depth about being taken from family at such a young age and relationships growing or worsening overtime. Ender Wiggen goes through the hardships of life in the course of 10 years. Many people don't go through what he goes through in their entire lifetime.Ender learns how to deal with many problems including isolation and the bugger threat. Throughout the book the topic of his family comes up and many interesting characters are introduced. All the characters end up teaching Ender a lesson about himself.The book shows strong character bonds not just with main characters but other characters too. If you are interested in Sci-Fi or not this book is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Morality Play","review":"This novel is one of the most intriguing examinations of the use of military force and its ethical ramifications. What is the appropriate level violence to apply to one's enemies? Is OK to manipulate your own soldiers for the good of the people? The SF plot of the novel allows Card to use the canvass of an intergalactic ware to tell his tale.Beyond that, Ender makes for a fascinating character. The boy genius is a tortured, sympathetic hero like no other. Upon conclusion of the novel I rushed out and purchased Speaker For the Dead to follow Ender's further adventures.Often categorized as \\"young adult,\\" this is a wonderful read for any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda fun, interesting ending","review":"Maybe something is wrong with me but I had a really hard time relating to this child savior or any of the other characters. But it was kind of a fun story with a pretty cool ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do I explain this book?","review":"I read Ender's Game all at once the week before Christmas of eighth grade. It's one of those books where by the end you're reading so fast you can't absorb everything and when you're finished you're exhausted. Ender himself is amazing. The end just blows your mind. The book also raises a lot of philosophical quesions, although the sequel does that more. I think Orson Scott Card's style is fabulous, for the Ender series at least. In fact, after I read some of his other books and found them too be slightly patronizing and immature, I came back and read Ender's Game again, expecting to be disappointed. I wasn't, in any sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt, the epitome of contemporary SF","review":"Card places himself among the ranks of Heinlein, Tolkein, and Herbert with this amazing work and its sequels. It was recommended to me by my seventh-grade algebra teacher, and I am forever grateful to him. It is the best book I have ever read (along with the other three sequels). Never have I read a book of equal caliber. If you are looking for a book with endearing, remarkably real characters, pick this up now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ender's Game is an exciting and engaging novel","review":"I feel that Ender's Game is a wonderful novel.

If you read at that level (test: do you like Piers Anthony?) then you might enjoy this book. Adults should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on the publisher for not proofing the Kindle edition!","review":"It is OBVIOUS no one has proofread this edition - even a simple spell check would catch many of the OCR/transcription errors.I expect better from Amazon. And from Card's publisher.This is the first book I read on my iPad. I'd love to get the rest of Card's works, but if this rendition of a major classic is any indication, I will STAY AWAY from any Tor editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY overrated","review":"I was looking foward to reading this based on reviews. At least it was short and easy to read. Ender keeps going through the same fights, same promotions, same earnings of respect, same feelings of remorse, fighting the same mock battles, etc. Even his sister had to give him a pep-talk.....TWICE. That's a lot of repetition for such a short book.I had known about the ending already so I didn't even enjoy that so much. I may read the second. I doubt it even though I bought them together."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book, I finished it three days after I started","review":"This was an awsome book. Card was very, very imaginative and I just couldn't stop reading it. If you don't mind that it has a little bit of crude parts in it, GO BUY IT RIGHT NOW. When I got to around the last hundred pages or so, I was afraid Card would write some bad ending which it seemed like he was going to, and I was afraid it would spoil the whole book...but it turned around and really surprised me...The ending made it even better! I really recomend it to anyone, AS LONG AS THE READER IS MATURE ENOUGH. The reader should probably be at least over 12."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting Africa","review":"So, \\"I Dreamed of Africa\\" was panned, but it awakened my soul so I purchased \\"African Nights\\". Disregarding the typos, etc., the abilities to read \\"sound bites\\" of the Africa that Kuki knew gave me a greater insight into life there. Each story provided images of fun events and sad memories. Pick up the book, each chapter provoke thoughts and concerns. I found the \\"A Masaai Woman\\" hilarious - how do you rate yourself? The book contains short vignettes that appeal to the interests of many. If you don't like it all, you will definitely like many of the stories. Well worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This Book","review":"If there is such a thing as \\"the ugly American abroad,\\" then this book is proof that there is also an \\"ugly Italian abroad.\\" The book is poorly written and the author has no cultural sensitivity whatsoever.

This particular story has been reprinted TWICE since the day it first appeared in Eagle. The First time was in 1981 as the third book in a three part series published by Dragon's Dream. The pages are reduced in size and the Eagle masthead has been removed and replaced with some new artwork by Frank Hampson. The Second time it was published was in 1993 as book 7 in a 12 book series published by Hawk Books. It appears with another story, the ship that lived in the Hawk Book, which is a full size reprint of the original strip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back to the Source....","review":"As a conservative, I am baffled by this book's attempts to categorize certain arguments as being \\"liberal\\" and repsonses to them as being \\"conservative.\\" It is possible for true conservatives to hold many positions that this book attributes to liberals. The \\"facts\\" presented on both sides are grounded in distortions and misperceotions. A better title would have been \\"Partisan Reponses to Partisan Arguments.\\"Want to know what a real conservative response is based on? Go to the source: Barry Goldwater's principled, elegant, high-minded, venom-free \\"Conscience of a Conservative.\\" Read that, get the FACTS, and you'll have more than enough material to engage in a good argument with a real liberal, as opposed to an apologist or a partisan. And after you're done, you can probably share a joke or two, as Senator Goldwater (and Orrin Hatch, today, for that matter) frequently did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a comedy book?","review":"Book is nothing more than the usual drivel you get from Fake News or drug addict Rush Limpballs.

Cutting spending will reduce the deficit - lie - it transfers wealth to the upper 1% and cuts programs that increases unemployment and poverty thereby decreasing the amount that can decrease the deficit2. Tax cuts help create jobs -- and the evidence is -- the last 30 years. Tax cuts transfer more wealth to the top 1%. Demand creates jobs, and U.S. Demand is way down because American households lost around $15 trillion dollars in wealth during the downturn. So it's important to note that research has shown that when you give a tax break to high-earners, they bank it, and when you give relief to working people, they spend it, increasing demand.3.

The writing is weak, poorly organized and the \\"issues\\" are twisted out of context. Jackson is another of those rightwing ideological plutocrats who think they know what \\"liberalism\\" is when they really are only out to demonize the word and not discuss issues honestly. No one is completely \\"conservative\\" or \\"liberal\\", but Jackson isn't at a point in his ridgid rightwing ideology where he is willing to listen to reason, or logic. If he were to let go of the unsupportable position of his agenda and looked at the issues for what they really represent he might understand why his is so wrong about so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Garbage","review":"This is yet another book in a long line of books from either the far right or the far left that do nothing but try to divide the country.

It is a repetition of the same conservative arguments that have been going back and forth on the blogs for years, although it is nice to have them all in one volume. Each comeback is only a few sentences long, and most are easily countered and don't contribute anything new to the discussion. If you're a progressive and want something that will be a challenge to your beliefs, but not too much of a challenge, then get this book (used, of course). If nothing else, it'll be good for a laugh.

And because I get my information from a variety of sources from Limbaugh to Air America, I have very little respect for Gregg Jackson's \\"Conservative Comebacks to Liberal Lies\\". The book is little more than a repetition of conservative talking points, with misleading statistics and half-truths that conveniently omit vital information. Mr. Jackson has an obvious contempt for the intelligence of his readers, as evidenced by the numerous false analogies, \\"facts\\" about the Clinton Administration that are nothing more than pure conjecture, spin on religion and affirmative action, historical inaccuracies, and outright \\"whoppers\\" that would make Burger King proud. Overall, a good book for right wingers who want to reconfirm their preconceptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"HA HA HA HA HA!","review":"I only gave this book one star because it was not initially made clear that it was intended as a satirical comedy the likes of which Stephen Colbert would be proud of.

Each chapter addresses a different issue, which is broken down into many aspects. Each \\"liberal lie\\" and \\"conservative comeback\\" is followed by a lengthier explanation. With my busy schedule, this easy layout makes it convenient to reach the information I need, and allows me to read for as long or short a time as I am able.This book will not go out of date, as it addresses both modern issues and those that have been in existence since the founding of our country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a review, but a question to the reviewers...","review":"Why do we need a \\"comeback\\" book?

Once you think outside christianity and dare to think for yourself using logic and reason, once you move beyond the democrats, this book is useless. Why? Because everything this talk radio author discusses is based on the false premises that all liberals are democrats and the bible is everyone's authority.

Conservatives who are enemies of conservatives is probably the most peculiar type among them. Gregory Jackson shows his true colors - a conservative who is an enemy of conservativism - in his articulated blend of facts, pseudofacts and myths so flawlessly presented as to cheer up any liberal who has become so amused by the tacky supermarket tabloidism of contemporary conservative literature.

And for good reason. The sentiments expressed by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7)-- and in particular the Beatitudes of Matthew 5-- Mr Jackson finds repugnant.The book can best be understood as a determined rebuttal of the Sermon, a single-minded attack on the very core of Jesus' teachings, dressed up as a diatribe on current American politics. The errors of fact and syllogism are myriad, but-- in the end-- of only minor consequence. It is his unrelenting hatred of the message of Jesus that should give us all for pause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time","review":"Way too much negative commenting for me. if you like getting angry for no apparent reason, or because it\\"is the thing to do\\" go ahead with this.

Napalm Death having a song like \\"Cursed To Crawl\\" that resembles Faith No More's genious and may have been a foreshadowing of the Nu-Metal trend of today? This is by no means their most brutal work, but it still remains a great example that Grindcore and other forms of Extreme Music can be open-minded and able to be played on a more Mainstream scale.

The speakphone is not full diplex...i.e., you'll miss the other party if you're both speaking at the same time.

It rasies serious questions about the influence of Eastern thought and metaphysics in modern Christianity, and some of his points are quite valid.

To be blunt, his reasoning goes like this:A: Eastern mystics chant mantras (\\"om\\")B: Contemplative prayer sometimes involves repeating a word or phrase (\\"Jesus\\")C: A=B, therefore contemplative prayer is un-ChristianAnother form of his reasoning:A: Eastern religion influenced the Desert FathersB: the Desert Fathers influenced Thomas MertonC: Thomas Merton influenced Richard FosterD: Richard Foster influenced Rick WarrenE: therefore Rick Warren believes in Eastern religionPlease read this book critically if you read it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your own research!!!","review":"This book is fine if you don't have a bible handy to confirm quotes that Yungen uses to contradict his opponents.

I would encourage anyone who is interested in this book to FIRST check out the publisher's website [...] and read through some of the material there. I have done so and found that the quotes I researched were taken out of context and twisted to change the meaning of what the author originally intended.

This is true of every genre, sci-fi, western, mystery, romance.... Elizabeth Peters does an absolutely remarkable job of that in this novel. Granted, I have a positive predisposition for books set along the Nile; nonetheless this one is outstanding.The plot and mystery might be described as so-so, but the characters and the ambience of Egyption archaeology in Victorian times are perfect. The strange romance between Peabody and Emerson is certainly not of the standard variety. The tombs, the sand, the pyramids, the terrace at Shepheard's...they are enough to carry one away.I've now read the first four in this Amelia Peabody series and so far have found them all to be most convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the mystery in this mystery?!","review":"I can't wait to finish this book . . .

Not all protagonists are meant to be likeable.But where is the mystery in this mystery novel? I'm half-way through the book, and the only \\"mystery\\" so far is that someone has made an appearance as a phantom mummy. There's more mystery in an old episode of Scooby-Doo!Without a compelling plot to move things forward, the characters have become more grating than interesting.

This is an exciting well written mystery with a marvellous heroine who constantly kicks against the social conventions of the late nineteenth century in order to do what she wants. I enjoyed reading this well written mystery and for anyone interested in archaeology the background is fascinating.The book is the first in a series of adventures featuring Amelia Peabody and the first one I have read so far but I shall definitely be looking out for the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Peabody!","review":"I have read this book so many times I've lost count! Elizabeth Peters has now written several books in the Amelia Peabody series, but none I love as well as this one. Amelia is a stong, out-spoken, self-reliant feminist in a era when such behavior was stifled in women. She and her companion, Evelyn Barton-Forbes meet Walter Emerson and his brother Radcliffe, an intelligent but belligerent archeologist who soon realizes he's met his match in Amelia. These are characters I wish I could meet in real life, which is why I continue to revisit them from time to time,both in this book and the sequels. A very fun read with characters that grab you from the get-go! Thank you Ms. Peters, for all the great hours of entertainment you've given me with your books!

Since I obtained them from the library I was never able to read the first two novels. I finally broke down and purchased this book from Amazon---what a great beginning to the series!! It was interesting to learn how both sets of Emersons \\"got together\\", and to see both Walter and Evelyn as young and adventurous, though younger, they always seemed much older than Amelia and Emerson. This series of books is fun, interesting, educational and definitely adictive.

Peters' knowledge of Egyptology is indeed impressive and definitely the only enjoyable part of this book.

The characters aren't perfect, but possess so much personality it's hard not to laugh out loud frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crocodile on the Sandbank","review":"The Amelia Peabody mysteries are so good I couldn't help becoming addicted. The vivid, colorful characters, moving plot, and details about Victorian archeology in Egypt make quite a combination. There's grumpy, sexy Radcliffe (although he prefers to not be called by this) Emerson, social barrier braking spinster of a woman Amelia Peabody, beautiful self sacrificing Evelyn, and sweet tempered Walter. The information surrounding the plot about archology really makes the story. It is definately well written, adventurous, and down-right fun!I'd say that once you have read these books, you'll definately want to read another! Barbara Mertz (Elizabeth Peter's real name) also writes by another name, Barbara Michaels, so there is plenty to keep you buisy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amelia to the rescue!","review":"I loved reading the book, but the audio is great for times when you can't pick up a book.

If it is a great book, I may read it all in one sitting, but I downloaded this book over 2 months ago and have yet to get more than halfway through. I don't want to be a spoiler(though thus far, there is not much to spoil) so I won't comment on the \\"mystery\\" which seems to be discussed very little anyway in this book. I saw this had very high rankings so I had high hopes, but it has done nothing but disappoint. I enjoy flowery language and writers who are descriptive but Ms. Peters takes it to the extreme, as not every inanimate object needs to be described to the lengths she takes. It becomes quite tedious to wade through it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuffy, predictable and annoying!","review":"I borrowed this book a while ago, hoping for an enjoyable light read. Unfortunately not.The main character of this series, Amelia Peabody, is supposedly interesting. Unfortunately not. Obsessed that men are the evil of every age, her rants occupy almost every page. Her \\"supposed insights\\" and commentary were so long that I found myself speed-reading through the pages, scanning as many as 20 pages every few minutes.The sidekick is just as annoying. While she isn't complaining about the weather, she is busy fainting.Anyone who has read a handful of mystery books would already know who the \\"Mummy\\" was. What little intrigue there was, was ruined by the predictability.Although the writing was quite enjoyable, it was ruined by many of the characters. I'd take one of the case studies of Sherlock Holmes over this any day. Or any book by PD James or JD Robb."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE of 'Library Binding'","review":"This is nothing but the paperback except worse: smaller print, newsprint paper. you're paying $16.99 for a pasteboard cover and the worst paper possible.

The plastic pieces that snap together to hold the bag open are not secure and come apart if you even touch it, let alone take things in and out of the basket. I was going to buy a wire basket for Mom, but the maintenance man at her facility finally crammed it on backwards and while it is still always collapsed (we don't even bother trying to fix anymore) it is at least stable and collapsed which allows her to carry around her few small items. Can't imagine this ever passed any quality inspections - what were they thinking with such a poor design?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basic basket","review":"Light weight so doesn't cause walker to tilt forward too much, depending on what is put in it. Good space for carrying, especially the elastic bands on one side to keep things in their place. Wish it were done in a lighter color so one could actually see what is in it - especially remotes, which tend to be black as well.This is the second of this variety I have had as the first one broke (oddly the metal rim separated at the joint a month or two after one of the braces came out of its grommet.

Holds your interest. Mangold's people are real, human, three dimensional,and to this viewer, that pretty much sums up what most films lack. Why? Because most filmmakers are either shallow or just plain don't get it--or both.Loved the cast, especially Liv Tyler.My one and only gripe (if you can call it that) is that I just wish the Victor character could have summoned the courage (somehow) to snap out of his blues (that kept pulling him down and keeping him trapped there.)Like I say, it's a minor beef.

Whether it's a weight problem, a balding problem, whatever makes you feel insecure about yourself, I think almost everyone can relate to his pain of being stuck inside himself. He wants to reach out desperately but the fear of rejection holds him back. The actor conveys so much emotion without words, you can almost feel it thru the screen.Victor enjoys some companionship for a short while with a guy he meets in the hospital cafeteria. The guy kinda tells him (my paraphrase :-) ), \\"I have baggage too, we all have baggage. We're all a lot a like.\\"This is a down-to-earth kind of movie with people we can relate to.

Since then viruses started penetrating their software. On two occasions I had to pony up $90 to Symantec tech support to eradicate viruses.The final blow came when an employee who surfs the web like crazy contracted massive viruses and spyware, one of which kept the desktop black and would not let the user change to another screen. I did a complete scan and Symantec came up with about 3 viruses and 10 spywares. I then deleted Symantec, downloaded the Security Suite from our internet provider and did another scan which now came up with 4 viruses and 5 more spywares. (Nice job Symantec.)When Symantec comes up for renewal on each workstation we are replacing them our internet provider Security Suite.The problem with large companies like Symantec and Microsoft is that the jerks out there who write viruses target the most common software."},{"rating":"1","title":"2007 Norton Internet Security","review":"Norton is the \\"top\\" of the line for security but this version has really slowed my computer down compared with the last three versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this version","review":"In order to download 07 I had to uninstall 06, but first I had to download the uninstaller from symantec.

Symantec says it's an IE problem, however when I uninstalled NIS 2007, IE works just fine. I am having other issues where the LUCallBackProxy will not register properly in Windows XP.

I had to use online chat with tech to find out where the download is. The download is free.2.This version of parental control does not have the feature to create/map Norton users to your Windows XP users. The parental control of 2007 is global per computer and cannot map out a different URL access list for each individual computer user. I have two kids and their URL access list is different from mine and my wife's.

In fact it caused a fatal error that almost destroyed my OS.So I had to call HP for support cause it would only boot to a blue screen, pull memory cards and cables, use Registry Mechanic and The Ultimate Troubleshooter to pull some more Norton out manually and remove some startup files.Today I downloaded a Norton Removal tool from their site, and hopefull this will actually remove their bugware, and 2007 will install.

I didn't need to uninstall my 2006 version and I wasn't prompted to do so. I'm not sure why all of the comments from IT professionals are so negative. Their comments almost made me seek another vendor but I decided to try to Norton Antivirus 2007 because I have many years worth of favorable experiences with Norton and I simply couldn't believe what I've read. As it turned out, I made wise decision. I'm completely satisfied with the program and I like the new screen structure (but it did take a bit to shift to the new way of doing things).

The Vista version is still running after almost 8 hours and has managed only about 233,000 items. The Vista PC is normally a fast machine. It seems that Norton has some work to do to take advantage of dual core technology. Had I known it was going to be this slow (not the first time, either), I'd have opted for ZoneLabs. Zonelabs also found spamware that was not detected by Norton.

Fact, is certain viruses are less annoying than this software. As has been noted, Norton Internet Security is annoying in that it reminds you every day to \\"renew now or later\\". I have a thirty day free subscription and feel that I'm bugged to death or being Blackmailed. In addition, I often receive MORE popups with their \\"matters needing attention\\" which includes subscribing again. They make the box to click off the popup really small. Today this box became a zombie process and it couldn't be clicked off. Thanks, Norton. In addition, I'm not sure why paying for a piece of software shouldn't get me the same results as free anti-viruses such as AVG and Spyware doctor. Both of them have found viruses that Norton has missed on my system. Norton does more than anti-virus, but they also charge more.

Still said my subscription was expired. On line chat went through all my t/s steps again and finally sent me a new NIS program (I think it may be NIS 2008) and this fixed my problem.

I had also emailed tech support and got a response the next day, but after following their instructions I finally got back to the download process and again it crashed AFTER taking my credit card information. Assuming that I may have made an error I tried the process again. I later got two emails and had been charged for two download purchases, even though neither went through.

That one must purchase 2008 software in the last quarter of 2007 is a travesty. This only shows the greed of software manufacturers like Norton to boost their sales by requiring more money spent to use the next year's software in order to accomodate a platform that has been on the market for an entire year.

If you want to renew your other PC's it's loaded on, you have to pay for each individual PC. It's $50 to renew, so it would cost me $150 for coverage on all my PC's!

I was a longtime, dedicated user of Norton, but that has changed. Try something else and avoid reduction of speed, adding an addtional bar to screen your screen, additional clutter and other deficiencies. If Amazon had a rating for less than one star, I would have given one of those negative ratings.Amazon should not sell an item with such poor quality.

But I suspect Norton is as bad as what it guards against in terms of its effect on computer performance. A quick startup to check on weather, say, or check on e-mail, no longer is possible: the hard drive buzzes, time goes by, the hard drive buzzes some more. Microsoft's Task Manager makes it clear that Norton is the culprit. And whenever Norton decides, as it often does, to update, or check for updates, Internet performance drops well into the SERIOUS frustration zone. Can Norton be temporarily disabled? Elements of the program can be turned off, but then Norton finds other things to do, and the frustration in unabated.

The history was very interesting but because there was so much of it, there wasn't as much coverage of suitable plants as other books. On the plus side of that, the author also didn't go into \\"information overload\\" and provide umteen-zillion varieties of every possible rose that could be planted. He did discuss some rarely used plants that I definitely want in my garden and he knows how to grow them, too, which is a plus. He also included some recipes for some of the unusual vegetables.

I managed to run my thumb drive on it, but it got louder when it was reading or writing data. Sometimes my thumb drive didn't get enough power and it would malfunction and get too hot to touch.

Far More Bizarre Than Fiction or Who Were Those Masked Men?","review":"Start out with a true story of a shocking crime and then, add a couple of young men who thrive in the shadow enshrowded areas floating between real life and real madness.More than simply connecting facts cronologically, this fascinating accounting of elevating violence is an in-depth study of criminal minds sinking further into depravity and madness. Their sexual preferences are highlighted, but not essential to the development of the main characters.The production will offend some in the audience, mainly because of dramatic changes in public morality. The very stylized visuals are complimentary to the era represented (the 1920's) and the perceived level of \\"bored sophistication.\\"Not overwhelming with plot twists and/or dozens of unnecessary characters marching through the film; the story is easy to follow despite its bazarre nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing film that everyone should see","review":"This is an amazing black and white film based on the lives of Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold Jr.. Loeb and Leopold were lovers, as well as partners in crime. The film is based on their decision to kidnapp and murder a little boy and the results of that action. This film displays how Leopold and Loeb acted as lovers, how they were discovered by the police, and how they were saved from the death penalty by their attorney's proposition.The use of black and white makes me feel as if I am actually in the 1920's. The actors are great and they really capture the emotion roller coaster that these two men must have experienced.I would recommend this movie to any one looking to see a great film about crime, love, and how the United States court system dealt with homosexual criminals.

I loved the punk sendups of \\"This was a real nice clambake\\" and \\"Do you love me,\\" the do-it-yourself hit record, and a couple of other bits. The musical quality and the mimicking of artist styles is dead-on throughout. But pervading the whole thing was a sensation that its creators thought that everything was way funnier than I found much of it. Parodies of things already parodies themselves, like the Prarie Home Companion bit and the WB cartoon bit, added nothing to the wit of the originals.

Just as the federal government uses earthquake-ravaged St. Louis for its experiments in controlling and containing civilian populations, look at the disaster that continues in New Orleans to see how on the mark Steele was in this book written long before the levees were breached. Ten months after Katrina hit and the public schools are closed, the city government is trumped by federal agencies, and the local population slides into despair rather than action. While the sfnel element of a networked AI stands out from today's nightmare, Steele has always had an excellent eye toward political extrapolation. Give this one a read, or a re-read if you glossed over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book by a great author","review":"I have read almost everything Allen Steele has written, and I like all of it. The Jericho Iteration is no exception. An imaginative story line combines a disturbingly realistic political environment and government cover-ups with what could be the potential fall of the United States. A fun and easy read, I would assign a PG-13 rating because of language and some innuendoes.The book, like most paperbacks by the same author is a quick read. An avid reader could get through the novel in just two or three days.

Out of all the games in this age range, it's not one of her favorites but she does like it and play it regularly. I purchased the v smile for her for Christmas along with about 7 games. My only mistake was to give them all to her at once. As with any 4 year old, who is having their first game system experience, she would play a game for a minute or two and then get discouraged and put in another. I had to take them all away and let her choose one game to play per day. Whichever game she chose for that day was the only one she got no matter how hard she found it. That did the trick, she learned how to play all of them in this manner and now I let her choose as she pleases. These are great games for the age group, like I said this one is good for beginners, she's had it for about 6 months but i'm not sure if she will continue to be interested in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Preschool Favorite","review":"No preschooler can resist this game.

This game keeps my 3 year old interested for hours. He can play all of the short learning games by himself but he still needs help with the adventure game.

Like Anne Perry, Barbara Hambly writes about another era with such skill that one can almost believe that he or she is there--smell the fetid swamps, feel the moist heat...

The Orwellian logic is the most startling. \\"Freedom\\" is defined as serving only God. Islamic freedom does not include the freedom to dissent or live in anyway contrary to the norms of Sharia, which Qutb defines in all-encompassing terms, controlling \\"political, relationship, social, and economic\\" matters. One is \\"free from coercion\\" in terms of belief, but clearly one would not be permitted to act upon one's belief if it in any way contradicts Islamic norms. In theory Qutb is describing a kind of Islamic anarchism in which imperfect human authority disappears and is replaced by the direct, perfect rule of God.

You can not read the caller ID screen, even at the highest contrast level. Another annoying part of this phone is that when you returned the phone to its cradle, it gave a loud speaker feedback squeak. We returned the phone immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst piece of junk EVER!","review":"Was not allowed to give this zero stars-so I begrudgingly gave it one. Here's why:I have owned several of these types of phones over the years. This phone is by far the worst of them all.I figured that being a Sony product, there should be some quality there. Especially at the higher pricecompared to other brands of this type of phone. Well I was totally wrong. I got past the fact that the caller ID display is miniscule.Even when you are right on top of the phone it is difficult to read. When the phone started giving me pager types rings for no reason when no one was calling, I contacted Sony and they had me do a reset function. Well this worked for a couple of weeks and then it started happening again. The final straw was the constant static that started happening. I contacted the company, they were useless, so I'm am throwing the phone in the trash. Do yourself a favor- DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this phone","review":"I bought this phone over a year ago, and I've been very happy with it. The only thing that's a bit annoying is that you have to use the key lock switch if you want to rest the phone on your shoulder, because of where the buttons are on the handset.

Laurent Martres was able to lead me to the places I ever dreamed of, \\"behind the tourists\\".Planning your next trip? Best buy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware false idols.","review":"Some theatre students and teachers take this book for a theatre history bible of sorts. Unfortunately, this results in readers switching off their critical thinking skills and accepting Dr. Brockett's values and opinions as facts. The scholar makes history and Brockett's history privileges debated concepts such as ritual-origin theory and drastically undervalues accomplishments of othered groups such as 17th century English actresses. (They get a whopping two sentences!) While this book is good for pedestrian and generalized descriptions of major figures and events (from a 20th century perspective), it is far from exhaustive. Alternative historical theories are not given much thought and the author presents opinion and theory as empirical fact regularly throughout the text.God is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quilty and No HDMI Cable","review":"This DVD player has poor picture quality, pauses multiple times while playing all DVD's and does not include an HDMI cable like the description on this webpage states (INCLUDES FULL FUNCTION REMOTE, HDMI and A/V CABLES).

Some of the special effects are nice (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of only 1), but if you're interested in this film just get the original and draw your own conclusions.

However, if you are looking for food that tastes good, this is not the book for you. All of the recipes I have tried from this book are bland, boring, and very \\"diet\\" tasting.

Clarke was a true master of science fiction, and hist short stories is where his genius shines best"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good collection at a low price","review":"I picked this book up at a Half-Price bookstore for like $10, and it was completely worth it. Any fan of Clarke or any SF fan should pick it up. There are many grammatical errors and a few omissions, but all in all it is a very good compilation of Arthur C. Clarke's work. It has all the short stories that eventually evolved into novels(i.e.The Sentinal, Songs of a Distant Earth, Guardian Angel, etc.), as well as many of the amusing White Hart tales. It's big and bulky but if you can find it at a good price then grab it."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting for history of sci-fi, but otherwise out-of-date","review":"Clarke was a prolific writer. Some would say that qualifies as being a great writer, but I would say that putting out a high quantity of stories just fills the bell curve as far as quality of stories. Maybe it is because of the span of time over which these were written, but many of them read like episodes of \\"The Twilight Zone\\" or \\"Outer Limits\\" - and many more read like bad episodes of such.Reading these stories, you get a feel for where the seeds of other sci-fi stories came from, but often times, you are simply left confused (like the ending of \\"The Star\\"), wanting a better ending (his endings definitely tend to be pessimistic), or simply laughing at the infantile writing while asking yourself, \\"This is one of the greats of sci-fi?\\"Again, maybe it is just because sci-fi was in its infancy when he wrote most of these, but his prejudices and pessimistic elitist style too often cloud what could have been a decent story."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOUCHA TOUCHA TOUCH herself","review":"YIKES!

Her distain towards pet owners in general is an attitude likely to be unpalatable to most readers. The author believes that positive training, such as using treats in training a dog, will cause the dog to feel insulted and to 'lose respect' for the human. In lieu of positive training, she promotes borderline-abusive training, such as shoving a dog's head in a hole to reduce the dog's digging behavior. Don't waste your time with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Academic","review":"I purchased this book in hopes that it could help me train my dog to stop certain bad behavior.

You can find a training book to give you permission to do the most horrid things imaginable to dogs (and other animals), if that's what floats your boat. Some trainers recommend hanging bossy dogs until they pass out! If, on the other hand, you are a humane person, skip this and go read Pryor's _Don't Shoot the Dog_. Train your dogs through reinforcement and behavior modification (operant conditioning). Love them, listen to them, observe them, challenge them. It's timimg, consistency and patience. My dogs stop digging if I calmly say \\"don't dig there.\\" And no near-drowning experience was necessary teach them that. Just a smile and a \\"good dog\\" when they stop the offendng behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"cruel and useless","review":"I have read dozens of books on animal behavior, communication, training and the like, and usually take away a useful lesson or two from even the less impressive ones. Not this time, this book mainly seems to serve the purpose of boosting the author's ego and her determination to display her own intelligence, education and supposed insights are longwinded and off-putting.However, the above would still not have moved me to leave a negative review if at times all this psycho-babble seems nothing more than a thin veil covering excuses for cruel training methods. Not a book for animal lovers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more common sense, less philosophy","review":"Anyone who lives with animals knows they have emotions - no need to make a big philosophical thing about it. Just plain common sense would do it.

It's one of my favorite books. Like many reviewers, I was initially put off by the complex language of this book, but I was also entranced by how Hearne applied complex philosophical ideas to the practical situation of dog training. For the reviewers who find her methods cruel - she spoke of this reaction with the sections on \\"humaniacs\\"! I have also found it instructive to compare this book to the TV show \\"Dog Whisperer.\\" I think Cesar Milan demonstrates the same approach to dog training as Hearne, but without the high falutin' verbiage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dead Dodo","review":"Sony Online Entertainment pulled the plug on The Matrix Online in 2009.

Even though the photo shows a wooden base AND the description describes the \\"Wooden bases...\\", I received the ones with a metal base. Yes, part of the title says metal hanger, but to me that meant the part the violin hangs on - not the base (especially since both the photo and the description indicate that it would be a wooden base).

I can't roll it without getting compost juice all over my hands. Plus Black Widows like to live in the bottom of it, so if I don't touch it for a week or more, they will definitely come out when I roll it. Gloves are a must. I much prefer our other compost bin, which is a standard square black plastic bin. I can use a pitch fork to mix everything together without gloves and black widows. I find the rolling bin difficult to empty as well, it is awkward to roll across the yard and the smaller opening doesn't allow for a shovel to fit in easily or for the contents to come out easily simply by rolling it. Again I prefer to load up the wheel barrow from the square composter. The compost juice in the bottom is nice, but I won't touch it because of the Black widows...so my husband empties it. But as far as I can tell the compost comes out fine in both types."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of handle makes turning very messy","review":"I've had those composter for 2 years now. I did find that it produced a smell, so I moved it to the back of my property instead of near my house. This resulted in me not spinning it as much. But when I did spin it, it was seriously gross. The goo drips out of the bottom (like its supposed to), but when you spin it, the goo gets all over the composter and its very hard to avoid getting the hands dirty. Eventually animals chewed off the lock, so now I can't spin it at all. I still use it to throw out rotten food, and then dump it eventually in the woods.I'd recommend getting a composter that has a handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"We bought two as recommended.

For everyone who talks about his lyrics, what are you comparing him too? His lyrics are weak, the beats are weak, and to top it off he raps so quietly, you can barely hear what he says except for his name(Viktor) which he must say 30 times a song. If you want something non mainstream buy Deltron 3030(a great \\"underground\\" album). If you want a \\"persona\\" album, buy any of Kool Keith's.

This is probably my favorite release of his though, with Operation Doomsday only a sliver behind. The beats on Vaudeville are the dark and grimy beats I'm really into, so that's probably why its so different than OD. Vik is his usual self, but he startled me on this lp several times. Sometimes it seems as though he's just spewing random thoughts from his conscience, but after awhile you piece it all together and it becomes mad science, which just makes you wanna keep listening to see if you missed something. Odd.

I enjoyed this CD very well and find it almost impossible to skip a track. Vik's lyrics are as clever as usual, and he stays on point when he steps up to the mic. I would recommend this CD to any fan of DOOM and newcomers to the real hip-hop. The only flaws in this CD(from my point of view) is some of the beats. The beats that I find annoying are A \\"Dead Mouse\\" and \\"Pop Snot\\". But Vik's genius rhymes carries us through the song,no problemo.

The packaging for this set matches the music. Inclosed in a hard case with two hard cover booklets inside. One houses the five discs, the other is a 200 page book with track by track notation, filled photos and song info and intro by Emmylou herself. A beautiful set and well worth the price of admission.Note: The packaging is top notch, however the discs are very difficult to remove from the sleeves. You do have to be careful or risk tearing the sleeve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set - Semi-Terrible Packaging","review":"My God, I've loved Emmylou since I first heard her at the Chancery in Washington, DC, back in the early '70's - way before Pieces of the Sky. I have everything she's done either on LP or CD. I think this is an amazing collection and love it, with one exception - the package. While 90% of the box set package is first class, Rhino has made it extremely hard to get the discs out of their sleeves. I just tore the case trying to get disc 4 out. I am over 60 years old and my hands don't work as well as they once did.As a side note, I wish all the CD/DVD manufacturers would give us old farts a break. We love music and movies just like the young ones they're aiming at. Is it really necessary to have all the shrink-wrap and adhesive strips all over every package? My God, if it's shrink-wrapped why do I have to face that damn adhesive strip on the jewel case? At least it's better than the old dog-bone that you couldn't completely get off but it's still unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"PACKAGING","review":"I do agree with people who are complaining about the packaging; why does Rhino--which CATERS to the collector--put together such shoddy packaging?Hip-O Select has SLEEVES, which keep the surface of the cd pristine. That said, I'm obsessive compulsive, and also PRACTICAL...take the cds out ONCE, and put them in slim-line jewel cases. I do that with all cds that come in cardboard; I even do it with cds and dvd that overlap in cramped box sets. THAT WAY YOU'RE NOT TAKING THEM IN AND OUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN...practical, right? That said, Emmylou Harris is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emmylou's gems.","review":"A beautiful collection of music from this prolific and gifted Americana artist. The songs are a delight and the booklet is revealing and informative. The only complaint I have with the set is that the cds are much too hard to remove from their sleeves."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Class!","review":"Despite the package is a disaster - because it's very difficult to remove the cd's from the sleeves - we love this album, It's absolute master class!! Listening to Emmylou and you are in heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Song bird","review":"The sound quality is not good and two songs on disk 4 don't play.

I thought that, if I was careful, I wouldn't have a problem. I was wrong: the cardboard sleeves are so tight that removing and reinserting the disks will cause scratches on their surfaces that will eventually grow so deep that you will no longer be able to play the disks. Unfortunately, I discovered this problem after it was too late to return the cds.I'm a big fan of Emmmylou Harris. However, because of the destructive packaging, this collection is a big ripoff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Journey","review":"When the package containing this album arrived this afternoon, I intended to give it a quick once through; it is now eight hours later and I am listening to \\"Waltz Across Texas Tonight\\" for the third time. There is so much about Emmylou to discover here - I have never heard of many of these songs before. My loss until now.The packaging is beautiful but challenging to we seasoned citizens with arthritis from picking up wet change from bars for 40 years. All in all, well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic EmmyLou","review":"Even though many of the songs were on earlier albums it is a wonderful collection.

Had the 1st generation Melitta and was not impressed. Then got the SimpleHuman pod maker, which I really liked, but it started leaking like crazy after about a year. This new Melitta is very nice. Well built and has more brewing options than others I have seen. Can choose from 3 brewing sizes: 5oz, 8oz, or 14 oz. Dual brewing spout allows you to make 2 cups at once if you like. Also, this is the only brewer so far where the brewing spout is high up enough to fit a travel mug underneath. And most important, coffee tastes great! Only flaw is that it does not sit perfectly square on it's four bottom pads. Rocks a bit, but it is a minor inconvenience. Had mine for almost 3 months, and am very happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still misses the mark","review":"I recently purchased this model for my daughter as a replacement for the original model which was leaking. We have a couple of the melitta javapod coffees but you can get much better coffee from other sources. At first we were very happy with this machine as it is much easier to fill, it is not as noisy, and seems to heat up more quickly. However, after only 3 months of normal use it no longer makes a decent cup of coffee. It comes out watery and she is using the strong 5oz setting.The manufacturer claims that only the javapods will work in this - but that is not true - even the melitta pods are malfunctioning. Several other pods are identical in size and shape and are much better in quality.Overall I have to say that although this is a fantastic idea, Melitta has missed the mark AGAIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Works fine with pods or plain tea bags.

It will now only eat tapes instead of playing them.I realize $69 is little money to spend and five years is a while, but please, it was too lightly used to fail already.

It was a real pain to operate and had severe limitations, but at least it lasted an acceptable time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie","review":"I am so excited to find out that this movie is now on DVD. I had recorded this myself about 12 years ago on VCRS. It is wonderful! I love Armand Assante, he is so masterful in this, and a perfect Napoleon. I was a member of the board of the Napoleonic Society of America, so I am in a position to know how well he was depicted. and.it is very accurate. Also loved Jacqueline Bisset in this...she was a perfect Josephine. I went to Malmaison on a Napoleonic tour which is beautifully depicted in this movie.Even if you didn't love Napoleon, this is a passionate story of love, seduction, and some betrayals. Armande Assante brings Napoleon to life.This movie is a MUST for Napoleonic fans, and also for those who are into love stories...this is the best ever! I highly recommend it..and thanks to someone for putting it on DVD's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Footage","review":"I have been waiting and waiting for this release. My excitement at seeing this finally for sale was that of a 5-year old when the first streaks of dawn hit the window pains on Christmas morning. As soon as I saw this was by Warner Brothers, my excitement dwindled to despair. And yes, in checking IMDB, this miniseries is missing 10 minutes of footage.How can it be that movies are being released and there is no note that they are not complete? Shouldn't this be (dare I say it) ILLEGAL. Why does Warner Brothers keep doing this to beloved miniseries that we wait and wait for? The prices are set high enought that they shouldn't have to scrimp. Does everyone realize that the cost is less than $1 per DVD?How is is that the UK can receive complete discs but we can't in the US? It just doesn't seem right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Napoleon and Josephine","review":"The series is great, and recommend this to all history students. I also believe the series is accurate and the best part are the battle scenes. I like the one in the Egypt Campaign.The ending is also great, but it did not explain the main reasons why Napoleon was exile to St. Helena, after the loss in Waterloo. The end is not really the complete saga, its just the beginning of the myth, Napoleon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good love story","review":"I watched this as a mini series a long time ago and I have been looking for it since.

The humor is upfront and center; sample some of the songs on-line (or just read the song titles) and you'll have a very good idea of where this album is going. It's lively material and there's some good word play. I suspect that most listeners will either want to listen and sing-along, or leave the room.Of course, with songs like these, one worries the act will be a one-trick pony. Call it the Weird Al Syndrome: You listen to a funny song, it's funny, you're done. Time to sell the CD.But if you save mini-classics like \\"They Tried to Kill Us (We Survived, Let's Eat\\") for annual events like Passover, the songs will stay fresh and may even take on the hallowed sheen of other annual holiday tunes like \\"White Christmas.\\" (Okay, bad comparison.

Recently, I had it happen again. I took the Clear Tract as directed and the problem cleared up in a few days. Sometimes when I feel the UTI symptoms coming on, I take 3 capsules of Clear Tract & it clears right up. This product is a miracle drug to me.

I think the product is great, but mine arrived severely bent because of how it was packed.The long mounting bolt ships installed and in this case over-tightened. The over-tightening pushed the sides quite far toward the middle, giving the entire base a pronounced curve. Installing the truing stand into the base straightened the curve substantially, but for a long time the stand would rock significantly.After a month the stand is much flatter - the plastic seems to be very slowly losing its bend. While not perfect, it is much more stable now, and I am hoping that eventually the bend will be lost entirely.The ability to tilt the truing stand is very nice and the tool/parts bins are very handy.I use this base with a TS-2.2 truing stand.

The writing is spare, full of menace, and wonderfully evocative of Africa. The description of oversexed and overprivileged expatriates battening on \\"development\\" contracts is deadly accurate. The story has a lot of Rwandan history and politics, but it never feels didactic or weighted down with scholarly detail. Overall, the book is a minor gem, and I took off one star only because of occasional scenes where the author overreaches in an effort to achieve grotesque comic or melodramatic effect.

It is weighed down with terrible dialogue and schmaltzy prose: ex: \\"Gentille let a few salty little pearls run down her satiny cheeks.\\" The characters are all good or all bad and there is no depth to their mental struggles. Courtemanche gets credit for resisting the trap of letting savages take care of savages, and he does point fingers in the right direction (France, Belgium). But in the end, he has saddled this story with a shallow, falsely-poetic protagonist, and I was left wondering what Greene would have done had he lived long enough into the 1990s to serve as witness to the horrible Rwandan genocide."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is purient garbage, don't waste your money","review":"I was in Kigali before and during the war.

I personally recommend getting the plastic one, because you'll also have solved the problem of not having the tweezers or toothpick.

This is the same blade that was standard issue for the Swiss Army until the 2008 redesign. The awl is also very sturdy, and features an L-shape for more rigidity during use. The alox scales have held up well to daily carry, and don't scratch nearly as easily as the classic red plastic handles. The only drawback about the handles is that they don't have a toothpick or tweezers in them.

I think there may actually be something wrong with my particular cuff. The first thing I noticed was that even with the valve on the bulb completely closed, air still steadily releases from the cuff, making it impossible to properly control the air release. Because of this I can't properly pinpoint the systolic BP and the diastolic measurements I've been getting are so high they can't possibly accurate.

The text waffles on interminably about \\"the horror\\" and \\"the inhumanity\\" etc etc, and detail is sacrificed for hyperbole. Few if any good points - some of the photos at least are new and worth seeing - but on the whole, this theatre of the war has been well-described in many other, much more worthy books, Alan Clark's \\"Barbarossa\\", for one.

The review that stood out to me was that the marble had \\"cheap\\" stickers on it - they are not cheap stickers at all! They are printed on the marble with great quality and do not have any sign of peeling off at any time at all. They are not overlapped in any way! The continents have great color and detail - every small island is printed! The marble is also a sparkling deep turquoise that shines in the light. I am completely amazed with this product & I am so glad that I ignored the few bad reviews! I will love with product for the rest of my life for sure.

Obviously, the examples and case studies are the most interesting parts of the book and the science behind the theory is easily broken down to make this an entertaining non-fiction book. I do wonder if in the nine years between this book's publication and my discovery of it, if the outlined experiments for further study took place. And what the results were... maybe a follow-up or an updated version will be published at some pointEither way, I heartily enjoyed this book (though I don't think my dog is terribly psychic) and would most definitely recommend it to anyone at all interested in this fascinating subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dogs Who Don't Know When They're Owners Come Home","review":"I recently saw the 20/20 episode concerning this book. While doctors agree that animals have some senses about their owners, a test they aired proved that most dogs do not know when they're owners are coming home. The episode showed one camera on a pet, and the other camera with the pet's owners. This particular dog waited by the window for hours, so , of course, when the owner got home, the dog was already by the window. I will agree that dogs have certain senses about things, but the \\"super human\\" abilities, come on! That is ridiculous.

Sheldrake does a fine job of documenting cases where dogs and cats show their sixth sense abilities with humans. The idea of experimenting with animals is a touchy subject, but there was nothing cruel about the way the experiments were carried out.

If you already know a Swedish person it won't tell you much you don't already know. It might be useful if you knew absolutely nothing about Sweden other than that there was such a country.

Based on the reviews here, I watched it again. I'm Japanese and proud of it, but I've got to say this is just not a good movie. It's not as good as the Matrix (sci fi); nor is it as good as Shrek (animation). It is for anime geeks, which until I saw this movie, I thought I might be one. But for you anime geeks, can you honestly tell us this movie -- which most claim to be the standard in anime -- has better animation than the Incredibles? better effects than Spiderman 2? better story line than Terminator? Not even close. With all due respect to the work put into this film, the animation is reminiscent of the Speed Racer cartoon, and it makes the \\"adult plot\\" hard to appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, boring, a huge disappointment","review":"Ghost in the Shell: it's been called the next Akira, and one of the best anime films of all time.

(It was hard to follow, that's what I could gather from it.)My thoughts: The plot was very hard to follow, the dub of the main character's voice is horrible, didn't give me any care for what happens to the characters.

It's all about philosophy and lots of boring chitty-chat questioning life. The thing is, you can not relate yourself to the characters because their all cyborgs, and the world they live in is so dark and unrealistic. There are only two action scenes, but aren't very exciting and has exploding heads! When you reach the end you can't believe you paid the kind of money you did to get the film, expecting something groundbreaking, instead you get something reasonably scary, but absolute rubbish. The only reason why it got two, instead of one, is because the quality of the animation with the use of computer graphics is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh... Interesting","review":"I haven't seen a whole huge ammount of anime, but to me this movie just seemed to drag on.

Sure, you'll see very interesting weaponry and a quasi-futuristic city (the detail in the backgrounds is arguably the most enjoyable aspect of this film).

Particularly enjoyable are the beautiful and incredibly detailed music-accompanied sequences of scenes within the city; the dozens of intricately painted backgrounds alone are incredible.

Both of them start off the same and both of them end the same (sort of) but still it doesn't excuse the fact of what was done to the series. The magna contained humor and plot combined perfectly. This tape while having some humor still can't compare to the magna. Some people say that since I'm into humorous anime I won't like any serious show. This is not true. I love Record of Lodoss war and that is serious. This show just didn't have enough plot to get me into it. They also tried to combine a pretty hefty magna into a 90 minute movie. As such they had to sacrifice plot, comedy, and the funniest robots of all time. If you want Ghost in the Shell go get the full issue magna from Dark Horse Comics this just isn't worth it. So unlike almost all the other reviewers I don't love this movie. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Along with Akira, this ranks as my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation is incredible. Very detailed with excellent use of CG. Also, the character design is also very good, not quite like any other anime I've seen.

I knew that to write a good review I would have to sit through all of it. I did manage to sit through all of it and I still have almost nothing good to say about it.

This, Ninja Scroll and Akira. I have yet to check out the Ninja Scroll DVD, Hopefully its not as big of a disappointment. The DVD I received of this movie is not even the version advertised here on the site not even the same cover work. It seems to me to be some lame Americanized production with the lame 3-D effect graphics that pretty much dates it's reproduction. I couldn't even stand to sit thru the first five minutes.

The first time I saw this movie I didnt understand a few things(like what a \\"ghost\\" was). But then i checked out the definitions of everthing that they mention in the movie from the DVD extras. Then i figured out that a ghost is suppose to be the thing that makes you human no madder what.So the movie is kind of confusing if your not smart(which im not)but other than that the movie is a good one. The animation is one of the best I have ever seen. I especialy like how the blood squirts all over the place when someone gets shot and how when someone shoots a gun whatever the bullets hit it makes craters in it and the object just gets blown away.This is definitly the movie to buy if your looking for a good anime movie and i think this is one you will watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"Ghost in the Shell is one of my favorite movies.

The characters are full and human. They have massive internal struggles while defending themselves and others. Ghost is not your standard Sci Fi flick but perhaps does the best job of entertaining and making you think. I would classify Ghost as pure Cyberpunk, as William Gibson originally wrote it.The graphics are the best that I have ever seen out of Japan or Disney; however, the \\"Ghost\\" world is VERY dark and brooding.If you buy one Anime title to start, make it Ghost in the Shell. I originally picked up this title on a whim before collecting Anime and now I have over 50 titles. Ghost is still my favorite, although I am also partial to Dirty Pair, Slayers, Evangelion, and Ninja Scroll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shell Shock","review":"This is an absolute must-have for ANY anime fan. The DVD format makes the best cyberpunk anime film ever, even better! The visual quality is stunning. If you thought DVD could not do anything to animation, think again!

The future of Japanese animation is here!: DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Both DVDs are missing the original ending song...","review":"FYI, both the original DVD and the Special Edition are missing the original ending song. Also, I have seen pictures comparing these two version. They look exactly the same, and I mean exactly.So in the end, I would recommend buying the Special Edition over the original if you dont already own this film, otherwise the original DVD is just fine.The movie itself is great. Short and sweet with some beautiful visuals and gun battles. Defintely not for young kids though as there is pervasive nudity, but absolutely no sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animation visuals are excellent, but...","review":"I think that Ghost in the Shell was simply over rated. I can see why people liked it, but I simply didn't. I found that the animation visuals were awsome, best I've ever seen, but I just found that the story was just slow and really boring. I read the comic that dark horse comics imported and I found it much better than the anime. I still think that Akira was the best anime movie ever made (followed by the Evangelion movies, but thats mostly because I'm a big Evangelion fan). So I guess if you're a visual arts student and are studying animation or whatever (my uncle did that and he bought this dvd as a \\"study\\")you'll find this movie great, but if you're looking for action, comedy, or fast moving animation, expect slow boat rides through a beautifully animated city and long talks about life or something. Still, this is a good anime. I'd give it 5 stars for the animation, but 3 for the overall story...so I'll give it a 4. Still really worth checking out though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a lot of narrative but no plot","review":"I get the weak attempt at explaining consciousness and life in artificial intelligence. But this movie outside of being visually interesting is rather lame in plot and character development. There are a few interesting parts but as a whole it misses badly. Others have compared this to the Matrix and Bladerunner but those were real movies. This is a sad attempt at metaphysics. Don't waste your money. There much better anime movies, i.e. Cowboy Bebop and Metropolis. Its unfortunate that a lot of talented people worked on such a poor script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as hell","review":"With much excited anticipation I watched this on Netflix instant-play and man was it boring.

While the concept is good, albeit unoriginal, the payoff just is not there. Comparing this movie to the Matrix is doing the Matrix a grave injustice. The technobabble in this anime, while necessary, often times gets a bit excessive and hokey. The segments of \\"characterization\\" come off as shallow and unfulfilling. Perhaps my reason for disliking this so much is because I expected much more action, of which there isn't that much(although the opening sequence is beautiful). The plot seems fragmented and disjointed at times, coming together to form what I felt was a completely contrived conclusion. To put it bluntly, there are MUCH better movies to blow your money on than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See","review":"Great on VHS and even better on DVD wit all the unique features.

The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor. Not so for the anime. The character Batou was especially funny in the manga, but for reasons unknown he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version.Expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking. These really make the movie crawl. One minute there's action, next you're listening to Matoko or Batou go on and on about existentialism. Seriously, these little talks take up 3/4 of the movie.The visuals are awesome, no question about that. Even so, they do not fulfill the need for SOME kind of thread of a story. Altogether, not much actually HAPPENS during the movie.If you must see it, rent it first to be sure you want it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, horrible characters","review":"Ghost in a Shell has everything going for it; unique plot, engrossing story, excellent animation, and a decent soundtrack. However it's greatest shortfall is the characters. These people seem to have no emotion whatsoever. Making it impossible to form even the slightest attachment to them, which is essential in any successful movie. The bottom line is that when the big finale happens, you could care less what happens to the characters as they are about as lifeless as the bricks on my patio outside. If your looking for something with plot, story, and characters that can get you involved in a movie I'd recommend putting this back on the shelf and getting Princess Mononoke, or Record of Lodoss war(OAV)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money- see the Matrix instead","review":"This was a poor movie, not even saved by two, or should I say one and a half action scenes- one where the major fights an Uzi toting baddie and the end fight, with a bug-like tank. The music and environment shots were too long and horrible- as boring as Blade Runner. There are a lot of incomprehensible technotalk scenes AND lots of philosophical psycho-babble scenes. Plus, the animation is UGLY. The major looks ugly, the men look poor, and there's a lot of black. While I didn't LOVE the MAtrix, it too was confusing, it made alot more sense than Ghost in the Shell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"The most boring anime I've seen! Confusing plot that never gets together. The great animation is what saves this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior visual, tolerable story.","review":"Insofar as the technical aspects, that is to say animation, sound, and music, this film achieves a level of excellence in the highest rank. The drawback to me is the story.It seems that in the attempt to be metaphysically challenging, the creator conjured up a somewhat ambiguous plot which resulted in characters that feels cold and distant to the audience. The sentimental content is hollow and one does not come away with any sense of inspiration or emotional impact that are found in many other classics of Japanimations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually Incredible . . .","review":"\\"Ghost in the shell\\" is a very thought provoking anime. The story line seems rather complex at first, but after watching the movie twice it has proved to be very intriguing. I really love this movie on a visual level. The blend of computer animation and 2d animation techniques has created many incredible moments. Even though I enjoy the deeply cerebral themes running through \\"Ghost in the shell\\", its visual splendor is what provides me with the most sustenance and inspiration. If you are looking for pure entertainment, look elsewhere, but if your are looking for an anime that proves to be extremely satisfying on many levels, \\"Ghost in the shell\\" is sure to please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome anime.","review":"I saw this for the first time a few days ago when I bought it. I'm new into the world of anime and after buying all the Studio Ghibli stuff, this was recommended to me when I stated I wabted to branch out more. I like the animation style, and the fact that there's gore where the second movie didn't have much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the most pointless anime I've ever seen","review":"The first half of this was so boring I nearly turned it off -- no real science fiction, just one scene after another of gunfire and profanity with no visual impact or dramatic tension. The second half was a little better, once it started dealing with the science fiction aspects, but then it got bogged down in a confusing plot, obvious exposition, and heavy-handed philosophy that still lacked dramatic tension. Action without humor, nudity that didn't manage to be artistic OR sexy, characters that gave you no reason to care about them -- not even as eye candy. If you want an action anime OR one exploring the cyborg/human question, you'd be better off with Armitage III."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"Ghost in the Shell is a very profound anime, its definitely not for everyone. The action comes in bits and pieces, so action fans will be disappointed, the technology in the anime is mind-boggling, and will no doubt wow techies. But the ending would probably register a \\"HUH?!\\" to most entry-level viewers, since the main theme of the story is not really what you'd think it is watching the whole show(don't wanna spoil it for u :P). I'd personally reccommend it to someone who can sit through the whole movie, and at the end of it still ponder about the issues the movie brought up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a Good One","review":"I consider myself a good fan of anime and I can safely say that this is a good one. The story is confusing the first time you watch it, but the more you watch it, the more you can appreciate it. The animation is great. Great details and buildings. This is one to add to your collection if your an anime fan. Get the subtitled one though. So if your a fan and you liked Akira, Princess Mononoke, Vampire Hunter D or Cowboy Beebop, Its a good bet you'll like this. This is one of the first anime's that really made me think. It has a good plot full of deep and developed characters. So go pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"an animated masterpiece...","review":"Ghost in the Shell is extremely impressive on two fronts. First, outstanding technical expertise reveals itself in the animation. In a strictly aesthetic level, this film is awesome. There are some parts that you will be forced to rewind. These are the beautifully sequenced scenes of the metropolis, candid pictures of the everyday, with ambient music that is well-fitting. This is, perhaps, one of the most absorbing animated films I've seen in awhile.The second aspect of this film I enjoyed was the sophisticated science fiction story. Though the dialog is sometimes cumbersome, the subjects touch upon are all very modern. The idea of an all-encompassing computer network is within grasp, though still fantastic... definitely not childish in anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"great animation movie - poetic sci-fi","review":"The original manga from Masamune Shiro was somewhat a great experience. But instead of just trying to render the manga to the screen, Mamoru Oshi (patlabor 1&2, Jinro...) created a real piece of art! Both the design, story, rythm, animation, drawing and music are absolutly astounding! This is not just a sci-fi movie. It avoids all the \\"clichés\\" and is more poetic than violent. If I had to keep only one movie, this will be the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, but terrible storyline","review":"This is one of those anime \\"classics\\" which puts domestic animation to shame, and rightfully so. The technical presentation is amazing. The reason I can't recommend this to anyone is the storyline bites big time. If you like waxing poetically (or not so poetically) about the inner-workings of human and machine psyches _ad_nauseum_, then get it, but I felt it all got old really quickly. Many movies have done the whole man/machine dichotomy so much better. I think the writers thought that if they kept overloading your brain with techno-mumbo-jumbo you'd think it was amazing (and apparently they were right for a majority of viewers), but for anyone who has any technical sense about them, it was just dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"S-VHS","review":"I just wanted a vcr to replace the one that died, I wanted this brand because of the direct drive which is great for everything you do with a vcr. S-VHS tapes are hard to find now but I only wanted a vcr to record my soap \\"One Life to Live\\". I am a 60 year old man and love that show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very solid stuff","review":"I'd disagree that Dub War's debut album is any worse than its successor \\"Wrong Side of Beautiful\\". Both albums are very solid works of musical art and must be percieved as unalienable parts of the band's very small legacy (and you can really do without \\"Enemy Maker\\", which is a collection of demo versions and remixes). At the same time, the first album is probably less complex in musical texture than the second and more agressive and raw -- no ballads here like Silencer and Cry Dignity. But really go for it -- it's really worthy stuff. And yeah, some parallels can be made with Fishbone and Living Colour (not so much with Bad Brains) but it has its own distinctive style and sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for pirate lovers","review":"We rented this for my five-year old and he loved every minute- we watched it three times in three days It is funny and action-packed without being overly violent.

I am a cut to the chase and feed me information type of guy, not one for long drag out stories or side tracks stories to get to the bigger picture. It is very unfortunate but that's the way I felt about this book by Huston Smith. I tried to read various chapters, each one starts out fresh with great promissing adventure with question popping in here and there and again eventually you find your self in a side story or a drugout story which lead no where. I eventually became bored and frustrated and put the book down, not gaining anything from what I just read. Sorry not my cup of tea, Huston."},{"rating":"2","title":"People should open their hearts !","review":"This book breifly touches on many of the Worlds established religions. It illustrates that most are quite similar and based upon the same 'universal truths'.It is interesting to look at the common threads between peoples belief systems. It is also interesting to note that pure religous ideas that promote good are later corrupted and changed as the religious movement develops and the power base shifts from the people/believers to the establishment/church. The focus then becomes wealth and market share - as opposed to the search for truth and respect for your fellow man.My view is read this book take the best from each and discard the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"this was a used product, but it was in extremely good condition. there were some markings in the book, but other than that it was in top shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huston is good but..","review":"I liked reading this book and found it educational and yet an easy read. I was truly disapointed though at how Huston after describing every religion with such impartiality crashes so heavily (and writes so glowingly) when writing about jewism.

It is the most badly written book I have ever read in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is hard to comprehend and is not a beginner book.","review":"I did not find any kind of learning value in this book.

I went to a Catholic grade school, a Jeauit High School and graduated from a Jesuit University so I feel I know something about Christianity though I am a jump-away Catholic today. Half way through the section I had to put the book down, terribly disappointed after concluding he must have been a member of the Vatican's committee on faith and morals and wrote the book while locked in the confines of the Ivory Tower of some monastery (all monasteries have Ivory Towers) while stoned on pot.This book may have been acceptable 40 or so years ago, but in this day and age when reality is paramount---forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS IF POSSIBLE","review":"BOOK IS JUNK!

Needless to say, I was dissappointed. This book addresses that all religions get people to the right spot, which is not true. Being religious is being in some kind of fantasy world, away from reality. Being a Christian is taking refuge in Christ and learning to FACE REALITY, not hide from it.

However, the book is poorly organized. It does not give you a clear outline in each chapter, and instead bounces around a little too much. The most frustrating part of the book is Smith's clear intention to make all the religions seem as similar as possible. Therefore, I think he sometimes does not give a clear picture, but instead describes the lowest common denominator.Finally, some knowledge of Christianity will be helpful in reading this book. He uses allusions from the Bible in every chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all what I expected","review":"The book, while being a good attempt at presenting a concise overview of the main religions of the world, fails to be more than an attempt.The book tries to place itself on a very philosophical plane, thus undermining the beauty traditions and practices add to all religions. It does not even try to explain key rites in any relgion and their meaning, and instead of giving an objective overiview, came with the author's own biases and preferences.It went tooo long in parts (the asian religions) and abrupt in others (Islam, Judaism and Christianity)It did not keep momentum and was thoroughly boring towards the end. Is very repetitive and in many cases outright redundant.If you were hoping for a colourful lively depiction of the world's religions this is not for you.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World's Religions","review":"Insightful, thought provoking, and concise.

Well-balanced description between historic events that fostered the creation of each religion and the wisdom-rational that each one of them heralds.

This book is a great contribution to a more open and tolerant environment in our already turbulent world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magnificent, inspiring, and moving introduction","review":"This book was more than I could ever have asked or expected. I first picked it up rather desultorily, not expecting to be impressed. However, in five minutes I was gripped and remained that way for the very few days it took me to finish it, so fascinated was I. Smith captures beautifully and with great insight the heart of each faith, revealing the centre of each belief and demonstrating simply and humbly the beauty contained at its heart. From start to finish I was overflowing with admiration, both for its wise and inspired author who opened untold doors to my wondering eyes, and for the people of the world who follow these paths. I am a devoted and unashamed admirer of Huston Smith and I cannot praise his work enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start here","review":"Smith does a good job providing an overview of the \\"essentials\\" of each religion, focusing on the positive elements of each religion.

For a comprehensive study of world religions, supplement with other resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done","review":"Despite this book's old age, it might still be the best book of its kind.

Surely there should be a general section about how to use arrays somewhere? -- You search for file, what do you find? - 2 different file accessing modules at opposite ends of the book that really do the same, only 1 accesses basic information about the file.In a way, it's a bad book for a bad scripting language. When you create files, you have modes 1,2,5,7. What ever happened to 'r' or 'rw'... For something advertised as a visual and easy to use scripting language it isn't visual at all, the syntax is inconsistent and you just end up memorising what appears to be randomised information in this book before you can do anything useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little help for login scripts","review":"Everyone of these script examples start out with the ADsPath of the object to be queried or changed.

This book is a significant achievement. The authors explain Windows scripting concepts and operations in clear, practical terms with examples that are immediately useful. Even more importantly, they knit together the underlying structures that support scripting in a way that no other publication on the market can match.Each chapter is logically structured with just the right mix of theory and implementation. Each major concept builds on the preceding topics to build a clear, cogent picture of how scripts interact with the various elements of the system. The editorial quality is excellent throughout. I have not encountered proofing errors or other production flaws.I highly recommend this book to any system administrator who wants to use VB scripting to simplify daily operations. It is the best in its class, bar none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most used book","review":"This is far and away the most used book in my library.

It tastes like the most backwater pond scum sitting next to a poultry plant. There is no way that my son would ever eat these, and I certainly can't!I searched some other Amazon reviews, and apparently what has happened is that NOW used to source their spirulina from Hawaii, but now gets it from India.

Unfortunately our experience was very different than the other reviewers. In particular the cage broke--some stitching came unraveled--after only 1 use. For what it is worth, our washer is a front loader, though we did use the cage on a \\"delicate\\" setting. Probably the cage could have been fixed and, equally probably, I could have returned it. But for the $10 it cost, I figured it was easier simply to discard it. Based on the other reviews, my guess is that we got a lemon.

It is such great escapism!They all play good roles and although not the most refined screenplay ever written, it has all the stuff that a feel good movie needs. I especially love when Bette sings that beautiful song in the restaurant; 'Somewhere Along the Way'. I adore her voice and what a great all-rounder she is.

Not a terrible movie but not a good one either. Not recommended. 2 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?!?!?!?","review":"Okay, my wife and I just watched this yesterday and I have to say I'm shocked to see all the good reviews. I was almost in tears I was so bored. It was like a really bad 'made-for-TV' movie! I swear if it weren't for the chemistry between Bette Midler and Dennis Farina it would have been a complete waste of time...At least they were funny and natural and believable. Their daughter, played by Paula Marshall was terrible. The whole story was ruined by horrid acting (the two leads aside) and crappy dialog. When we saw the movie at the library we were excited for the plot (about a divorced couple played by Midler and Farina who hate each other rekindling their passion for each other and starting up an affair during their daughters wedding) seemed like it would be funny and enjoyable. Boy were we wrong. This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

Midler and Farina, playing the divorced parents of Molly De Mora, (played by Paula Marshall) rekindle their romance at her wedding and selfishly ruin her honeymoon. Aw, but they love their daughter, so it's OK. All the characters except for Midler, Farina and Donna are stuck with thankless two-dimensional roles where they're forced to riff on their most pathological personality traits every time the camera is pointed at them. And though this is allegedly a \\"comedy,\\" director Carl Reiner appears to have a political ax to grind, inserting partisan jabs at odd moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Funny!!","review":"Loved this movie.

There I was, holding this cool-looking book in my hands, so full of excitement and anticipation that I got suckered into buying it. Sadly, the text is so hackneyed, so cheesy, so boring that it takes all the magic out of the subject. Such a shame! In his acknowledgments, Blaine credits some guy named Larry \\"Ratso\\" Sloman as a ghost writer of some sort---if this is the case, Blaine should have made Monsieur Ratso disappear. Now there would have been a worthwhile trick! But seriously, in my humble opinion, this book did not amaze or thrill or wow me, even in the last chapters discussing Blaine's own fabulous tricks. The darn writing was so poor that it didn't describe things to create an image of the tricks or evoke any emotion for what is supposed to be Mystery.

No. But what I didn't expect was a history of magic (which was boring), a Houdini biography (which someone else, has probably done better), nor a bunch of self-congratulatory chapters. All one really gets out of this as far as his life is concerned, is that he really loved and still misses his mother. I already knew that he jagged around in Europe and practiced magic, had a bunch of oddball friends (duh, they are magicians after all), he planned and trained really hard for his stunts, and network TV paid him bunch of money to go to exotic places to do magic and witness different cultures. I recommend spending 20 minutes in a bookstore, reading the couple of chapters that have any relevance, and letting someone else buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Excellent book, highly recommended.

The book is easy to read and offers a lot of ideas on street riding issues that I haven't seen discussed in any other books on motorcycling. The book is a good mixture of racer proven techniques that are directed in a way that applies to riding in the hills and ideas on how to improve the chances of survival while doing it. It rains a lot here in Seattle and the tips I've read (and plan on trying soon) in the special Rain Riding section will come in handy. The short stories that recount riding experiences in each skill segment area were helpful for me to see how applying them would work.

This is kind of a driving manual you should read about once a month until it becomes second nature.

I really hope that his next attmept is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book to be utter drivel.","review":"OTHERLAND is the first book by Tad Willaims that I have had the misfortune to read. On the other hand, if it is his best, then I shall count myself lucky to have been saved from reading any of his other works. I found the book both boring and disjointed. To give the author his due, howvever, one must marvel at how he was able to fabricate 770 pages of meaningless claptrap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"I'm a huge fan of Tad Williams. I loved his Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn Series. But this book is a long boring thing.Please Mr. Williams, go back to writing fantasy novels rather than this drab science fiction with characters that mean nothing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long and slow","review":"This book had so many characters and subplots that it became very bogged down. It took me over a month to read the whole thing, and that's only because I was stubborn to finish it. Plot had promise, but the characters were very uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"We know the players ,now on with the show","review":"I read otherland first,then while waiting for vol.2 read memory,sorrow,thorn books and tailchaser.I think it is evident to anyone who doesn't put their books on a scale before reading them that if you want to create a new world it takes more than 7 days or 7 pages. Williams is brilliant at creating a world that the reader can live in even when they are not reading the page.I have no problem exploring the world in a first vol. and waiting for more. This first book promises more and from past books, I'm sure we'll get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE!!!!!!!!!","review":"A very intriging book. The posibility of a VR world, WOW. I wanted to strangle the person who gave it to me when I got to the last page, I want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, long, cut","review":"The book is very good, imaginative and shows a very interesting future. I only regret that it ends exactly when things start rolling. If you don't like long descriptions don't buy it, but I can tell you that I'm buying the second part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Start","review":"This book is very similar in pace to the Memory, Sorrow and Thorn trilogy. It starts kind of slow and changes focus from one character group to another. If you liked Tad Williams' other works you will like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novel!","review":"Tad Williams is an amazing writer. I loved his Dragonbone fantasy series, but I love his Otherland series even more! Creative writing is a hobby of mine, and I can truly appreciate Williams' writing style and the amazing amount of time he must have put into the Otherland series. His characters have a great deal of depth, but perhaps even more impressive is the way in which he weaves the various threads of the story together. I don't know how Williams managed to keep all the details straight, but his creation is exceptional! I highly recommend this book. Excellent, excellent, excellent! Thank you, Tad Williams, for the wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SLOW RIDE, BUT WITH A GREAT VIEW","review":"i expected it to have more actual action to it. but that is just what i was expecting. but in the end i got a lot more than that. man, this tad williams guy is increadable. some parts of the book you just have to go back and read parts of it over again. it really is more of a drama. i like how tad williams has pages and pages of stuff that really has not a lot to do with the plot but it really is satasfying and enjoyable. i also like the way tad has set up multiple plots in totaly diffrent surroundings. from midevil adventure, to world war one stuff, to totaly virtual reality awesomeness.... etc etc etc. the whole book is great. the book has a lot of bad language that really isn't needed but i guess it adds to the seriousness of the plot.truly a great book. i am reading the sequel right now and enjoying it, the plots really kind of merge together in the second one. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't imagine anything better!","review":"Although I have not yet read MS&T I find it hard to believe that it could possibly be better than this. William's masterfully meshed the story together: futuristic setting w/classic human conflicts, aboriginal man vs. modern man (or woman), mysterious and eluding puzzle that slowly yet surely comes together. The only \\"problem\\" I could possibly think of was that he changed characters and stories too often, but I sense that those to will inevitabley come together. I am all too anxious to read the rest the OTHERLAND series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems long, but flies by","review":"Last summer, I bought this book in late May, intending to read it over the entire course of the summer after school let out. Bored the next day, I began the first chapter in the early morning.Two days later, I had finished the book.I've always been a big fantasy fan, but I've never read anything of Tad Williams' before this--I began the Dragonsbone Chair last year, but I had a new Mercedes Lackey book to work on and never got around to finishing it. This series so far is amazing. Having read this book and River of Blue Ice, I can say that the characters are well-crafted, the plot is exhilarating, and the writing is amazing. I especially love the character of Thangor--he's a nice touch, and after I had the book finished, I'd skip back the chapters involving him and just reread them.This book is definitely worth as long as it takes for you to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat belittling to call it mere \\"cyberpunk\\"","review":"This was one of the most enjoyable popular novels I've read in years. Although it was daunting in the beginning to consider reading such a huge tome, once I started I couldn't stop and ended up doing a weekend Williams-marathon. I am a little confused by the reviews which berate the book for being the first of a series - my copy at any rate clearly indicated \\"Book I\\" on the front cover. Yes, by the time I finished it I too was desperate for the next volume and was crushed to discover it wasn't due out until June of this year. But the fact that it takes only a year to crank out such an intricately carved and well-constructed \\"world,\\" is more of a tribute to the author than a criticism, in my opinion. This is the first book I've read which has ever led me to write a letter of thanks to the author and the first to lead me to review it. I, for one, will be buying the next volume as soon as it hits the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Where are the good editors??? It seems we are being innundated with a sea of thick, overly long books that have decent thin books inside them struggling to get out. Unfortunately, Tad loses this struggle. I'll probably read (skim) the sequel but only because there's not enough good stuff out there to keep me going for long.It's really too bad because I loved his Memory Sorrow and Thorn series. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just because I don't like cyberpunk...","review":"I picked this book up with high hopes, because I loved the Memory, Sorrow and Thorn Trilogy. I made it through about 1/3 of this one before I gave up from intense boredom. I didn't care about ANYBODY. I'm holding out for another trilogy in the MS&T world, but I'm not holding my breath, since I guess Williams is finishing this one first."},{"rating":"1","title":"All those memories","review":"I picked this book up after being wowed by the MS&T trilogy; but seriously doubted, correctly, if Williams could pull it off again. Although it would be an OK novel by a new author, it is clear after a couple pages that Williams is just trying to relive his MS&T glory. It has the trademark rambling storylines, flocks of characters, and triumphant conclusions anyone with an IQ of three saw coming 100 pages back. But, where the characters and the incredibly imaginative fantasy world save MS&T, this one falls flat with uncreative, uninteresting plot devices and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"I loved the Memory, Sorrow and Thorn series so much that I read it twice. I also enjoyed Tailchasers Song. So it was with gret enthusiasm that I began Otherworld. Of course the mystery of it engaged my curiosity immediately, but once the novelty wore off, there was little to actually keep the story going. The characters were boring, uninspiring and failed to engage my interest. The story line was haphazard and seemed to attempt suspense, all which led to nothing. Finishing the book was a chore not a pleasure. I really hope that his next attempt is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you value your soul don't buy this book","review":"Maybe the title of this review is a little extreme, but I had to get my point across about what a bad book this was. I usually don't mind reading a long book, but I found as I progressed through this story that goes nowhere, the book was slowly sucking the life out of me. This book revolves about several dull and boring characters who really have no connection with each other. I guess if you like waiting four books for a climax, this series is for you. With vague hints of some far reaching conspirancy that is child-like in its attempt to be suspenseful, this book leaves a lot to be desired. I definately won't be buying the rest of this series, and I'm tempted to ask the publishers to re-imburse me for the hours of my life wasted reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Good But Long","review":"It kind of started off a little slow for me but it got alot better. U do become anxious as to what will happen next. At times u almost feel u are in the story itself. I've actually been having a hard time putting down.The only reason people might not like it is due to him putting alot of cyberspace stuff in it and also ancient myths that some people may not have read up on. If u read Alice in Wonderland and 1984 it will also help as well.And it is long. For the most u are to use ur imagination.Very Very Good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a FAT book!","review":"When I first bought the book, I didn't have the slightest idea of what it was about. It was the first time I judged a book by it's cover. When I started to read the foward I was intrigued, for one thing book's back cover said it was a Si-Fi novel, but the foward described a fantasy like castle. When I reached the middle of the book I finnaly got some answers. All in all it is a well writen book, and makes you think twice about the internet it's power. One thing I would recomend to do is to by both the first and second volumes of this seires, because the end leaves the reader in a little suspence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I'm not quite sure why I picked this book up as I usually don't read futuristic scifi type novels, but I found the story to be intriguing. Although the book does follow the stereotypical good vs. evil plotline, I found the characters to be well developed and likable. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of the virtual reality net of the future. The way in which Williams includes a news excerpt at the beginning of each chapter is also a nice touch. It conveniently allows the reader to get a feel for the world in which his story takes place without him having to work such descriptions into the storyline. Overall, a very interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wicked Tribe, Rooling Tribe!\\"","review":"Otherland is one of those books you fall head over heels in love with, and then go about to all your friends exclaiming that this time you've done it, you've truly done it, and have found the best fantasy book out there that you've been waiting for all these years so-go-read-it-now!... And then they ask you to explain what it's about and you're at a loss for words.\\"It's, um, about a virtual reality world... No wait, no, that's not describing it at all. It /is/ virtual reality, but it's not some silly SF book like you're thinking... Where's it take place? In Africa. Um. In the Otherland system. Err-- in Australia. Wait. Oh, just go read the bloody thing!\\"There is a lot to this book. You've got bushmen, evil aboriginals, net friends, a mesterious AI, a quest for immortality... It goes on. There's no concise explanation I can give. Yes, it's a massive tome, and there are four more just as big, but you'll just wish you could spend more time in this world by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and cliched","review":"This book takes forever to develop. Unfortunately, there is nothing startling or new to reveal. It is the same thing we have seen before. I was thouroughly unimpressed with the plot when the extensive character development allowed for any. I don't need to know every detail about every bit character in the story. Find an editor and cut down on the gibberish."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Williams' best","review":"Truly a superb effort by Tad Williams. A bit slow at the begining as the plot begins to develop, but it kicks itself into a higher gear after 100 pages or so. Can hardly wait for the remainder of the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Otherland. City of Golden Shadow","review":"A disappointing book. I suffered through 700+ pages of the disjointed adventures of a number of principle characters in the expectation that towards the end, the individual stories would be pulled together with some reasonable explanations providing some satisfactory closure to the story.No such luck.What made it more disappointing was that with so many loose ends left dangling at the end of the book, some of the more obvious issues with the storyline become even less acceptable.There was too much \\"filler\\". The book could easily have been half the size with no loss of relevant information.However, even at half the size, the fact remained that as a reader I had been cheated out of a storyline ending.Expecting me to buy the next book in the series and potentially be left \\"hanging\\" yet again at the end, is to presume that I have some masochistic reading disorder.Shame on you Mr. Williams. You could have, at least, provided me with some value for the money I spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but a rehash of Fairy Tales in VR","review":"I could not finish this book. I cared nothing for the characters and was very disapointed with the fact that the whole story seem to be snippets and themes of Alice in Wonderland, Jack and the Beanstalk and Pinnoccio all wrapped up in a VR world that Big Tad seems unable to translate well into text form. This is the first book in 6 years that has interested me so little I didn't care to know the out-come."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"Yet another story rehashed, given a new face, a cover, and thrown on to the shelves. The only imaginative component of the story was the voyage into cyberia, the rest of the \\"who did that and why\\" has been sung, said, and written by all those between the ages of 5 and 65. Disappointed in the book, expected much more from Tad Williams after the triumphant Memory, Sorrow, & Thorn trilogy and the creative Tailchaser's Song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"Does every author think they are Tolkien? No way does this story deserve 2500 pages. \\"Lengthy\\" and \\"epic\\" are not synonyms. \\"Trilogy\\" refers to three self contained stories, NOT one book just cut up into three volumes. Even George Lucas understood that! I have about had it with authors who turn one idea into a career instead of being creative. I will not buy Mr. Williams works again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Waste of My Time - E V E R","review":"I do not understand the rave reviews this author gets for this series - I never even got through this first book, which says something because I love to read and I always give an author the 'space' they need to get the story going. What a snoozer! B-O-R-I-N-G. I can't believe this series is getting such high marks from other readers - do you have NOTHING else to do but sit and collect dust while reading this stuff? I've 'survived' other boring series beginners, such as The Hobbit (come on - its boring 'til you get about half way through!), but I couldn't bring myself to care at all about the main character, let alone anyone or anything else in the book. I wasted money buying all (3) books together - soon to be donated to the local library. Don't waste your time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"This is the second Tad Williams book I've attempted and it will also be the last. It's not that I can't read long books - see my other reviews. Based on all the positive reviews for Tad I thought there must be something worthwhile. I attempted The Dragonbone Chair and just couldn't get through it. I thought that since Otherland was written later, maybe Tad had gotten better. Nope. It's not that he's a bad author, he just isn't good. The storyline is decent enough. Unfortunately the author doesn't offer anything to keep me reading. He doesn't have interesting characters, there's nothing smart, witty, alluring... anything to keep me going. He took a decent premise and didn't add anything to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too boring","review":"A story that essentially could have been told in one book has been stretched out to FOUR!!! I thought book one was bad enough, but book two is even worse. I'm planning on putting all of them up for sale on Amazon. Truly dismal. Such a shame as his 'War of the Flowers' series is marvellous."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Sucks","review":"What kind of jerk writes an 800 page novel without a denoument? Around page 700, I started losing interest in the book... But I figured I'd read that much, I might as well finish it.I'm sorry I did. No resolution to anything anywhere in the book. I understand it's the first of a 4 part series and you want to get me to read the next one... but all it did was guarantee I'll never pick up another book by Tad Williams again."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bloody boring!","review":"I have to admit that I have never read another of Williams works before, but this is horrible! There is no action, no plot to hold the characters together. Occasionally, Williams stumbles across something that could be worthy of a story, but not with these characters. My advice: Don't waste your time, if you want a good read try the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy, not SF","review":"Make no mistake, though the book claims to be cyberpunk, Otherland should be classified as fantasy. My dislike of the book stems from my dislike of fantasy's \\"anthing goes\\" conventions. I rarely fail to finish a book, but given the ponderous pacing of the story, a cast of unlikeable characters, and knowing that I'd have to read another 1800 to 2000 pages to complete the story, I quit this book after about 550 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning- This book is very, very BAD!","review":"I loved Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn (I am currently reading it for the third time), which made me very excited to see that Tad Williams had wrote another series. Unfortunately, City of Golden Shadows was awful. It was one of the most boring books I have every read and I will definitely not be reading the sequels. I felt no connection to the characters and even started to hope for their demise just so the book would end. Which is a shame because I think the development of characters was Williams' strength in Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn. I cannot understand how so many people wrote such good reviews of this book, do they not know what a good book is? Although it is definitely, more science and computer oriented then I like, which may account for why I hated the book and others really loved it. I would recommend not reading this book, actually I would recommend reading my statistics textbook before reading Otherland."},{"rating":"1","title":"A talking breakfast","review":"I plodded (forced) my way thru 3/4 of this book, but when I got to the scene with the TALKING PLATE OF BACON n' EGGS, that was when I put the book down and never picked it up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"The plot of this book is decent, the story well-crafted and well planned out. Unfortunately, Williams takes so long to get to the point, I found myself yawning through this slow-moving piece of rubbish.Williams is a decent writer in some respects, but he rambles. He goes on and on about irrelevant things, causing the reader to lose interest in what he is saying.The whole series is fairly dull because of Williams' lack of ability. I'm sorry, but I cannot reccomend this book to anyone who doesn't want to daydream as they read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly Bizzare","review":"I lik the science fiction genre bu this was bad, and i'm a tolerant reader. This book was recomended to me and i began it with gusto. I hated it after page 150. It was so bizzare i had to force myself to read it. Dont even pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucked!","review":"First chapter was good. The rest of the book sucked. Annoying characters, boring filler, and an extremely unsatisfying ending. Why would I buy the second book to find out what happens if the first book was such crap. Waste your money if you are looking for a all around bad book. I just tore my copy to shreds. 770 paged of crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written Sci-Fi/Fantasy mix.","review":"Tad Williams, one of the leading fantasy authors of today, has written a very good, well-written, compelling novel with Otherland:City of Golden Shadow. The characters are well developed, and the story line always leaves you wondering what will happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ashtonishing idea of what could become of the net","review":"Williams sets down good characters wich start living in your imagination. It is very difficult to put the book down. It is dangerous; sleeplessness will overcome you. Even for me, and english is not my mother language, it is hard to stop reading. The only stupid thing was, that the ending was too sudden. Look, I know about open endings, but I have never seen an open ending like this; all the questions were left unanswered! So I have to read part two now; Luckily I have already purchased it. (Luckily for Mr. Williams) But I would reccomment it to anyone who likes to get swept away in a world you cannot imagine but is so close at hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading","review":"It's important for the reader to know that this isn't a normal series; it is as Tad said one very very long volume. He didn't feel like ending a book with a conclusive ending, then having to start up on another thread all over again; he wanted to just have people go on from the ending even if it means an inconclusive cliffhanger-like ending. It's a very good book though, a wonderful mixture of fantasy, science fiction, and cyberpunk; I myself am a fantasy buff, and this had just enough to definitely catch my attention. It's also like reading a very entertaining history book; he's researched it so well I'm totally in awe. I have the second book now, signed by him, am and hoping that it's as good or better than book 1. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling despite slow character development","review":"This novel compelled me to read. The plots were engaging, drawing me deeper with each page. There are a buffet of persepectives, antagonist, protagonist, innocent bystander, etc. Character development was slow and in many cases shallow but was more than compensated for by the concepts that form the foundation of this novel. I can't judge it against other cyberpunk novels but this does stand on it's own weight. TW is great at conveying rich textures and steeping you in the plot. A great transcontinental read if you fly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time! Tad Williams writing is so descriptive you often forget that you are actually curled up on your couch reading and not running around caught up in the adventures that Renie and !Xabbu are going through. Make time to read this entire series, even if you don't spend much time reading. Fans of any genre will enjoy the detail and depth that this story has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the ONLINE generation","review":"This is the best SF book that I've read in a long time. Tad Williams keeps you wanting to know more and more about the people(Irene and !Xabbu). For me it was alittle confusing when I started reading , but after about 2 chapters I couldn't put the book down and when I did I was very upset that I had finished.. All I can do is hope that the next book is just as good. You don't even really need to like sf that much to like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Williams is a masterwriter...","review":"Wow. This book (and series) is definately just as good as, if not better than, Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I first picked up on Tad Williams while I was waiting for a WoT sequel and was amazed at how well written and imaginatively created this story was. It's a bit more science fiction than most fantasy books and expands on the internet world that we know today into something incredible. Then Williams creates world within that world. The characters are exquisitely developed. A must read for all book lovers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A deceptive ending","review":"I was furious to discover that this was only the first of a series of books. While at times it was entertaining, at others it was ridiculous. Some of the story threads were so disjointed and convoluted that it was difficult to keep them straight during the several weeks that it took me to slog my way through it. Many of the storylines were imaginative and creative, however I can't get out of my mouth the bad taste created when I got to the last page only to discover that it was \\"to be continued\\". What a cheap marketing tool. At least be honest and put on the front cover that it is the first book in an ongoing series. I will not buy the sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"If the whole set of 4 books had been 770 pages long, it would probably still have been too long. We can hardly be expected to chase 2800 pages after such a scrawny carrot. The Memory, Sorrow and Thorn trilogy was beyond a doubt my favorite serious of books in any genre. It's unfortunate that Tad couldn't pull this off, even with such a fascinating premise. There's a 30% chance I'll buy the second volume, only to give him a chance to redeem himself -- and because I've invested too much time in volume one not to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible ending.","review":"This book kept me interested enough to read through to the end, but I think that was a mistake. The ending cut the story line short of its conclusion, and offered a pedantic observation of the obvious instead. I feel cheated, like I have wasted my time reading this rather large volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting concept, but a tedious read","review":"Very interesting concept, but as I slogged through page after page of seemingly irrelevant paragraphs and pages I found that the book ceased to be enjoyment and relaxation but rather a work in endurance. The story takes forever to develop; 3/4 of the way through I bagan to doubt that a good quantity of what I what reading was important to the overall story, and therefore I began to just skim through pages. It can be easy to get lost as well, given the many rabbit trails throughout the story. Of course they say when you reach the mountain top you can clearly see the path it took to get there - perhaps by the 4th book it all becomes clear. I don't think I have what it takes - patience, endurance - to challenge the other 3 books. The 1st one defeated me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Major Talent!","review":"Incredible Plot, incredible characters, incredible writing! Williams makes you get into the story so much you cannot put the book down. Williams has a definate success in writing, and he has more then proven it with this masterpeice. A must read if you enjoy Sci-Fi. It even makes you wonder about the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Couldn't Put It Down and Nearly Died of Starvation","review":"This is one large book, but it is most certaintly worth the treck. It is my first Tad Williams novel, and I was blown away by this guy's attention to detail. If your into SF or Cyberpunk or mysteries in general this is a titanic must read. Williams weaves an astonishing web of characters who come together in a chilling tapestry. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This novel does have interesting characters. The various settings and the world of the near future that Williams imagines are very creative and well done. But the premise of a \\"Grail Brotherhood\\" spending billions of dollars on a secret project spanning decades of time with only one man apparently noticing is ludicrous. And he does not know what their objective is? Gimme a break. Lets see. The bad guys are all so old they can hardly function. They have an unhealthy interest in children. They already control the world. I am not going to read the second book but will go out on a limb and predict they want IMMORTALITY! I read 770 pages just so I could guess the objective? Never again with this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great adventure from the man who brought you MS&T","review":"Well, I had heard a lot about the Otherland series and on one particular rainy afternoon I bought the book and took it home to read. Two days later and I had finished. \\"City of Golden Shadow\\" is an excellent story, set in the near future. It shows us a plethora of believable technology, as well as equally believable characters. Just like Tad's famed series \\"Memory, Sorrow and Thorn\\", Otherland has many interesting plots and subplots, all twined around the same tree...Otherland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mix of Fantasy and Science Fiction","review":"I recommend this book to those who enjoy realistic science fiction AND fantasy. Williams did a great job of believably mixing the two genres--the best I've seen so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible story.","review":"This four-book series remains the best I have ever read. The complexity of the plot and how it is handled by Tad Williams speaks volumes about his literary talent. It is engaging from the first chapter to the wholly satisfying conclusion several thousand pages later (oh yes, this is one series you can really get your teeth into!) If you want quality and quantity for your money and you are a fan of fantasy fiction then you must give this series a trial run. I guarantee you'll be hooked in no time. (The only regret is that the series is still not available on Kindle for those of us living in Australia.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smartest fantasy around!","review":"I am on my third reading of this series, and I still find it fascinating. The central thread holding the story together is the idea of \\"story\\" itself. Williams creates worlds based on individual myths, stories, and poetry without becoming stuffy. The multiple story lines make for an intricate series of novels that explore the human condition and the very human need for love and acceptance. I highly recommend this book, this series, and this author. FYI: I teach English at a community college, so I have pretty high standards for this type of fiction. READ IT NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Tad Williams has managed to surpass his not inconsiderable Memory, Sorrow and Thorn series. A novel of epic proportions City of Golden Shadow kept me unable to stop reading right up until the end. The characters, while not, for the most part, exceptionally interesting, were never the less well done and believable (and perhaps even more so for their mundanity; Tad makes sure that you know these are real people, not heroic constructs). The plot is also very well done, believable and keeping Deus Ex Machina to a bare minimum. The future presented is both possible and believable. What immediately grabbed me about this book was it's cover; beautiful. Anyways, this is an amazing read, and well worth whatever you choose to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chapters slow to a crawl...","review":"The book has enough \\"a-ha!\\" moments throughout its chapters to keep you trudging through. Unfortunately, this was literally the only book I've ever seen where reading 400 pages yielded about a paragraph of information. The titular \\"Otherland\\" isn't even mentioned until after the halfway point of the book.The book as a whole is just a dense block of text - all mass and no volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think of all those trees....","review":"Picking up this book should have been the first hint when I decdied to buy it. The binding is two freakin' inches. But no, I decided I didn't care about length, after finishing a few Terry Goodkind books, an 800-page book just doesn't matter.Boy, was I wrong. I tried, I really tried to read it. I gave it a valient effort, but I just died in the process and trying to read this book nearly killed my interest in fantasy epics (my only saving grace was the prospect of reading Song of Fire and Ice). I only got 350pgs into it. NOTH-ING HAPPENS. Nothing, end of story. Yes I know it had great description and the characters are deep and blah, blah. But honestly don't waste your precious life trying to read something that needs 500 pgs or so to get into the real plot line.I recommend Robin Hobb's works, but that's just me :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, I also found this a difficult read...","review":"I wanted to like this - it is my kind of story with the matrix-like theme and clever premise.

I picked this one up with high expectations, and was utterly disappointed. The plot was very slow to develop, and never really got going. There was virtually no action or suspense in over 700 pages of text. It never held my attention for more than an hour or so, and it seemed like it would never end.The only positive I can give Williams is his concept of a virtual reality system was well thought out and realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total sleeper","review":"You know that book you keep hoping will get better but it never does. This is that book. NOTHING EVER HAPPENS!!! This book realistically should have been about 300 pages, not the over 700 it was.

He borrows already created worlds (like Alice's wonderland, Jack and the beanstalk, etc) and spins a compelling story around them, at the same time creating his own mult-faceted universe which will amaze and stretch the imagination. The characters are created with great care and sensibility such that there are no stereotypes or cliches, each retaining a strong personality.The only thing to be careful about is that this story actually comprises of four books and this one ends in a fashion that will only make sense if one goes on with the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Series","review":"This is the first in a series of books blending virtual reality with real life. Many different kinds of people head to Otherland and it's accompanying worlds including a teacher and the computer novice she tutors, her brother and his friends who play games in VR but can't get out, and a fourteen year old computer genius who gets in over his head when he tries finding out what Otherland really is. There is also a person who may be real but then agan may not be.The books are told in third person but feel like each person is talking about the same experience each from a different point of view. Every chapter has a different personal viewpoint so in order to keep track of all five stories readers may want to tackle each viewpoint as it's own book or one chapter a day if they are reading from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"More metal","review":"This one is more of a metal album than other ENT albums.

However, this CD of unreleased tracks from the so called golden age of Rock , only issued in the last couple of years, is weak, very weak, especially when played alongside any of their other albums. The main reasons are the extremely cliche lyrics and the music lacks the intensity I was expecting in anticipation. I can honestly say that this album will only satisfy die-hard T.M.A. fans. If you are unfamiliar with the music of T.M.A. then start with Three Many Army TWO or failing that, A Third of a Lifetime. You won't be disappointed with either of those."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece","review":"Les Liaisons Dangereuses have a special place in French Litterature. This book offer a perfect view on the libertinage during the 18th century, as well as the way of life of this period (school with cecile de Volange, Marriage with both cecile and Mme De Merteuil, the situation of men : Valmont and St Preux). What makes this book unique : its style, made of letters, you can recognise all characters by his own style. Laclos really gives life to all its characters, each of them having its own voice.

This book is wonderful and provides an interesting view into the sociology and psycology of Germany before and during WWII. It is hard to believe that this amazing story is about a real person and not a fictional one. I highly recommend this book to not only people who love history, but also those who are interested in stories about life changing events and triumph over adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars for history that must be remembered","review":"This book gave me courage to live my own life more fully. It is a vivid portrayal of breathtaking anxiety lived, day-by-day, in a nightmare world. It wasn't easy to get into, hard to put down once I did.

I recommend this book for high schoolers and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, interesting story from a different viewpoint","review":"This was an interesting story of a Jewish woman survived the Holocaust and lived through the war married to a Nazi officer. I found this book to be informative and the author paints a clear picture of her dreams as well as her fears during that time. She details the life that was \\"normal\\" during WWII and how she managed to survive by reinventing her life to hide. The story tells of her life living with her Nazi husband, as well as the birth of their daughter and their survival during the years after the war.

A deep and beautifully told tale of a life that was all too real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"I picked this biography up at Perl Mack Library on Saturday and had read the entire book by Sunday evening.This writing was the personal account of how one woman survived the Holocaust. The book is well written and compelling. The book being a complete and total success and valuable as a Holocaust account,is a book to be read again and again, understood and accepted for the truth of a woman's survival as well as the survival of many others she knew during that time be they Jewish or not. It is a read that should be noted for it's honesty and it's information.This book should be in every library, public, school and personal home library of all people who are concerned about the world today in that they will learn from the past.There is absolutely no way anyone could have any right whatsoever to judge anyone by the choices they made during that horrible time in the world's history.This book is honest and a tribute to the human spirit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life!","review":"This book will remain in my mind and heart forever.

It gives insight into the everyday daily life of Nazi Germany that ordinarily no one would describe due to fear of prosecution for having been a Nazi. The clothing coupon, the racial documentation required before getting married, etc. Since Edith was never in a camp, the book does not detail the atrocities that most WWII literature describes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"A captivating story of not only survival but thriving in the heart of hell.

It tells the story of Edith Hahn, a well-educated Viennese Jewish woman who managed to survive working in a slave labor camp, avoided being deported, and lived as an Aryan Christian woman married to a Nazi officer through the use of false papers. The story is as completely improbable as it sounds, yet, it really happened. There were many insights into the causes and thinking behind the tremendous anti-semitism in Austria during that time, as well as the sheer terror she must have felt trying to live un-noticed and under the radar during that horrible time in history. It was impossible to put this book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story of hiding in the open","review":"Edith Hahn of Vienna has several family members depart for Palestine and England shortly after the Anschluss. For love, of her mother (Klothilde) and boyfriend (Pepi) she stays until it's too late (and they are too poor) to depart themselves.Through amazing luck and friendship she manages to obtain falsified documents and live as an Aryan housewife during the Holocaust.I've read many stories of Holocaust survivors, but, this is the first I've read of a \\"U-Boat\\" someone hiding in plain sight. It gives you a picture (from a Jewish point of view) into why 'average' citizens of the Reich so easily followed the path led by the Nazi party. (Some shockingly trivial) While reinforcing your belief in humanity as many of those same people helped Ms. Hahn at great risk to themselves.A truly touching story that I find myself mentally revisiting many days after finishing the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great women's history book!

Gearing is cheap and not sealed (well, I guess the back of the headstock would 'enclose' them) and the plating I'm sure will crack off in no time. Even the screws are cheap.I would seriously reconsider getting these if you like quality, even for playable crappy guitars(which is what I wanted them for). I just couldn't put them on any instrument, unless it's a free, horrible sounding guitar that you wanted to sell.

My little son goes to a Little Gym once a week, and has been participating in over 20 sessions that does similar stuff as the Move N Groove video, he has never once thrown a fit at the Little Gym. But for some reason, he didn't respond to the Move N Groove video. He loves watching Brainy Baby DVD's and Baby Rodenburg and has never cried about them being on, but for some reason he did not like Move N Groove.

We used Kettlebells quite a bit and I really liked using them. When the month was over, I decided to continue on my own at home. I bought Kettlebells from Amazon and this DVD. There are less expensive DVD's but I couldn't be more pleased with this one. I think Lauren is a wonderful coach. She reminds us how to breath and she's comfortable to listen to. I can't handle a 'Cheerleader-type' DVD instructor! Others have reviewed the format of the DVD, so I won't repeat that. I am 55 years old and have never enjoyed working out until being introduced to Kettlebells. I started out 40 pounds overweight, and have lost 20 so far through working out and eating quite healthy. I use Lauren and Kettlebells every-other day and do something else, like walking or another work-out DVD, on the in-between days. I think the best part is how fast the Kettlebell work-out gets the heart rate up. A 12 minute work-out probably equals a half hour of other exercises!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a workout","review":"I've really enjoyed using this kettlebell workout DVD. It's a tough workout but fortunately there is a short form (~12 minutes) which can be repeated for a little longer workout. There is also a much longer (~40 minute) workout which I haven't quite been able to get all the way through yet. I love the exercise demonstration and the introduction to kettlebells that is accessible from the menu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Because of one glowing rating in particular, and because I thought the DVD expense surely reflected a superior product, I expected something amazing! I was very disappointed. I understand interval training, but the pattern of 2 minutes at medium intensity, followed by 1 full minute of recovery, for the entire routine, feels like a very inadequate workout. Had I rated only the trainer, I would have given it 3 stars. This DVD isn't nearly as good as another trainer's that I bought on sale at Target for 1/4 the price... I'm irritated at myself for spending my money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"A couple of months ago I became interested in Kettlebell workouts in addition to my weekly routines of Body Pump, cycling, and yoga. \\"The Ultimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning with Kettlebells\\" was the second DVD I purchased for home use.

But the quality of the video is poor and the instructor is rather dull and lacks personality. Additionally, the background music is repetitive and boring. The exercises are fine to do, but between each one there is about 60 seconds to rest, which is fine, but fun music to move in place or something would be so much better than what's there, which is basically nothing. This is a good DVD to learn some exercises from, but it is way to boring to use more than a couple of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underestimated this Video","review":"I underestimated this video because i did the first 12 min video with a 18lb weight and i barely broke a sweat so i thought the 40 min video would be a breeze. Mind you i do insanity and Jillian Micheal's DVDs so after the first minute of the 40 min video i thought i could be bad azz and adjust my kettle bell to 20lbs! how WRONG i was... lol. I had to go right back to 18lbs because this video is a bit difficult if you have a heavy kettle bell. And 40 min swinging a heavy weight is a LONG time i couldn't get through the whole thing which made me rethink this whole work out. All in all its a good workout and the only reason im giving it 4 stars is because i think after each exercise a 60 second break is unnecessary you kinda got to fast forward the video to make it consistent which can be annoying. Another thing is the price. Its pretty pricey but i guess your paying for a Certified Kettle bell instructor. But a good workout overall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cream of the Crop Lauren!","review":"Kettlebells is the ONLY type of weight training I can stick with, and I started with this DVD. Only doing it 3-4 times a week, I had people asking me what I did to be so fit. I highly recommend starting with this DVD. It is beginner friendly and safety comes first! Ladies, do yourself and your body, mind, and confidence (and your booty!) a favor and please skip those other fluffy kettlebell dvds. This is the real deal!!Also, I love the breaks in this video. I can even manage to sweep or stir something on the stove - all while working out. LIFE saver. Lauren, you are so awesome!If I can do it, so can you. I even trained through a little over half of my first pregnancy with her dvds (she has one called Baby Bells). Just put it in your cart and proceeeeeed to checkout! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauren Brooks DVD","review":"I just started using a kettlebell and wanted a workout video to go along with it so I ordered this DVD. I workout on my eliptical about 15 to 20 minutes a day and wanted something different to try. I honestly didn't think the 12 minute workout would do anything but I was wrong within the first few minutes you can feel that your heart rate is up and you are getting a good workout sweat and all. If you lift heavy things ( me my two 35 pound children)I wouldn't get anything smaller than a 15lb bell but do what you feel would be best for you. The only down thing I have to say about this video is the cost other than that I think it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"I love the way this DVD is put together. It has both a quick 12 minute fat-blast and a 40 minute total body workout. Even the 12 minute workout leaves you sweating and out of breath. I believe this workout would be great for beginners as well as the more advanced. I also love the hour glass time countdown on the screen that helps you see exactly how much time you have left on each exercise and the countdown for the rests shown on the screen too. I remember thinking 2 mins of work and a min of rest didn't sound that bad. Wow! It's an awesome workout!! Just seeing Lauren is motivating as well. Thank you Lauren!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Instruction and Great Results!","review":"This DVD has great instruction on how to do each move so that you don't risk injury. Its a great video for beginners or intermediate excercisers. You just adjust the weight of the kettlebell to your fitness level. I started out with a 10lb kettlebell and I grew out of that pretty fast as my strength increased rapidly within the first couple weeks.I then switched to a 15lb kettlebell and wow what a difference 5lbs makes. I still cant get through the entire 40 minute workout with the 15lb ball. I can do about 30 minutes. Its challenging. I've only been doing this for a month and I definitely notice more muscle tone in my arms and legs. I plan to keep using this a few days a week and am looking forward to even better results with longtime use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective","review":"I will admit that this DVD is not the most professionally mastered workout that I have ever bought. It seems like she filmed it with a standing camera on her balcony. However, the DVD is so well designed. There is a 12 minute workout, a 40 minute workout and instructions for each move that you can click on individually if you need a refresher. I actually like that Lauren doesn't talk more than necessary. She also doesn't have a fake smile plastered on her face. This makes it much easier to handle with repeated viewings. Other DVDs I have used became so irritating after a while (ahem, Jillian Michaels). This one can be viewed again and again. I noticed that another review said the workout is too easy. I have been using a 15 lb kettlebell for about 6 months and have used other kettlebell workouts and I still found this challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"This is a good workout DVD.

She finds herself rooming in a house with 7 other outcasts. She ends up helping them run for school council against the people that she didnt fit in with and who humiliated her.

In a room full of people, not a single chuckle was heard as this movie played. I have seen people have more fun at funerals.The movie goes into the whole \\"Mean Girls\\" territory, a subject really needing no more exploration, with nothing clever to add. It had something of the Snow White twist on it, but that really made it no more interesting and became a one-trick pony quickly. If you are an obsessed fan of Snow White, you may get a little more out of it. For the rest of us, you know how it's all going to play out from the first few minutes and it just drags on. There's no energy, nothing clever.Whether or not you are an Amanda Bynes fan, the script is so bland, not much can save it. If you are a 12 to 14 year old female, you may be the target audience and really enjoy it, but otherwise few will see this whole movie all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Are You Kidding Me?!\\"","review":"What are you people smoking here?! This must have been Amanda Bynes last role in fulfillment of a contract; either that, or she's got a really bad director, because this movie is as unfocused as she is. I was going to say untalented as well, but in the right part she actually has a two-dimensional appeal; only this isn't it.It's billed as a re-telling of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, but that's an insult to the Brothers Grimm. This \\"D\\" list movie doesn't even have the class of Kathy Griffin. Like Danny Strong's \\"Gurkin\\" says at the end of Act Two \\"Things are looking grim brothers,\\" and a truer word was never spoken.

Contributions to the current lexicon not only include 150 years of coining terms and identifying syndromes, but also the modern world of functional neuroimaging, weekly changes in psychopharmacology, wet lab neuroscience finding application in the clinic, and the development of new tests and new constructs. With such diversity of science and scientific terms, it is with relief that this book has finally gotten to press. It should be as useful to students and academics as well as clinicians. Actually, neurologists and psychiatrists should also be intrested. Nearly every obscure diagnosis is included, some with remarks about the scientific proof that the disorder exists added. It is not a DSM-IV for neuropsychology, but it does not pretend to be. An added thought, if you read only 2 pages per day you will be done in 90 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Military sci-fi with a twist: real characters","review":"I am a great fan of military science fiction, despite the fact that most of it is - to be blunt - simplistic mind candy. In this series, Williams has managed to combine an interesting read on space war and interplanetary politics in the far future with a real rarity in military sci-fi: characters who might actually pass for human beings. Having just finished several volumes of a puzzlingly popular military sci-fi series by another author I found the transition to Williams' trilogy to be the literary equivalent of diving into a big juicy steak after spending a week living on salsa and chips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space opera Las Vegas style","review":"I love SF and just read the whole series over the course of a week. To sum up:Harmless, unimaginative, going-through-the-motions pulp fiction, which happens to be located in a space future.A recap of the semi-fascistic voice in the stories of Heinlein wrapped around a B-rated classic western story, only with the gender roles swapped and with the Naxids in the role of unusually lame indians.This is exactly the kind of SF that Paul Verhooven ridiculed in the movie \\"Starship Troopers\\".To me Walter Jon Williams has established himself as the Barbara Cartland of Science Fiction.Contemporary british SF writer Peter F. Hamilton does this infinitely much better, and there simply is no comparison to the grandaddy of all space opera, Asimovs Foundation-series (written around 1950)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting and Exciting !","review":"Pretty good for a end to a trilogy, the space combat wasthrilling and places you as if you were there.As for the planet campaign , cool and precise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Series Closer","review":"Convetions of Dread isn't anything new to the series but it provides a good final chapter and wraps up all the loose ends from the previous 2 books.

The main characters are likable so their individual stories are somewhat engrossing but many of the plot elements could have been dispensed with. The entire tale was very predictable with nameless hordes of people been bloodily dispensed with to provide some well needed excitement. I realise this novel is intended to be different in tone from some of Mr. William's previous work but I expected the same level of competence and flair in the story itself...to be frank this was a boring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNCONFORTABLE","review":"The low feature on the back of the shoe make it uneasy to wear, due to the fact that it does not hold the ankle properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived in a trash bag","review":"The shoes arrived in what looked like a trash bag with some postal information on it, not a box. Normally I don't judge based on the packaging, but in this case it was somewhat fitting.The shoes themselves seemed to be of halfway decent quality for as cheep as they where. When I put them on, I noticed that one was incredibly loose. So loose it felt like it was going to fall off after a couple of steps. The elastic section was almost twice the size as the other, preventing the shoe from fitting snugly. I tried several ways of tightening the shoe enough to match the other one without any success.These could possibly be worth the money if they didn't have what I am going to assume is quality control issues.

If you're thinking about buying this CD, save your money and buy a Cat Stevens album.

My daughter can get pretty worked up at times and I have always enjoyed using books as a quiet, peaceful and relaxing time for us to share. GOD'S QUIET THINGS is just the book to do this with.The illustrations include a boy and his cat and are somewhat muted and soft--a beautiful, well executed technique with pastels to heighten the idea of being quiet. To listen for God's quiet things is a good way to open up your heart to God, for He is in them and all things beautiful. \\"Be still and know that I am God.\\" Psalm 46:10aGOD'S QUIET THINGS isn't a \\"story\\" per se, but a journey.

It's an attempt by an English redbrick university psychology professor to use Tolkien's popularity as an awkward kicking-off point for a rather woo-woo account of the civilization and worldview of late first-millennium Celtic and Germanic Europe. His constant reference to these peoples as \\"the real Middle-earth\\" grates, and correlations with Tolkien's creation are only cursory."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish there were more books like this...","review":"As a practitioner of the Old Ways, this book is far more informative than many titles out there today. It helps to reconstruct the spiritual ways of our pre-Christian European ancestors as well as give a better understanding of what Germanic Heathens and Celts believed.They were very deeply spiritual people who were quite connected to the Otherworld. The Divine, including magic, was an integral part of everyday life.I have LOVED Tolkien since I was a child, not only because he was such a magnificent writer, but because of the genuine Pagan/Heathen beliefs he incorporated into his works. For instance, it is amazing how much Gandalf is like the god Woden/Odin. (\\"Gandalf\\" means \\"magic wand/staff elf\\" in Old Norse, by the way.)This book reveals much about what these people believed and has much excellent information contained within. A gem!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Real","review":"This book never claims to be about Tolkein - it is about the Real Middle Earth that Tolkein uses as a background for his fantasy work.This book is engaging and filled with lots of wonderful information that leads us to the truth about the time in which our ancestors lived. It communicates to us how they viewed the world.If one looks at Brian Bates other book \\"THe Way of The Wyrd\\" you begin to realize this is fundamental to his life work not a rip off of Tolkein.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to understand our indigenous backgrounds - or just likes a good book to read for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This book examines the dark years of Anglo-Saxon settlement in the area abandoned by the retreating Roman Empire.

There are thumbnail sketches of SF authors that Robson has encountered in person such as Harry Harrison and Joe Halderman, there are musings on the effect that Lord of the Rings has had on the Fantasy genre and many other essays on SF topics.The book was also illustrated by a number of NZ fanzine artists including James Bronson and Dan McCarthy.There is a second volume in print, Trimmings from the Triffid's Beard volume two, which contains all the book review columns that Alan has written for NZ fanzines.

As my wife of 35 years and I were watching I was thinking \\"sure is a familiar plot\\", then it hit me about the book.The plot is very similar (book to movie) and very deserving of the actors who play the parts. I wish they would have developed the early life of Chloe's character a little more, but that probably would have made the move too long.It is a story about love (the fleeting infatuations as well as the long term slow burn of which I know both) and all of it's manifestation, the traps, the joys, the sex, the glory, the heartbreak, the triumphs, the loss.Lots of discreet nudity, powerful acting, lots of emotion.We liked it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!

Young and old, gay and straight, married, monogamous and not. Have always loved Greg Kinnear, he never over-acts, but sells it. And of course Morgan Freeman, never too much of a good thing. It will make you cry and unless you are dead, it will make you think. Love is the key theme here, and it takes you on. Maybe too much skin for the older or more conservative, but just enough to keep it real. Not sure who plays the young girl in this, but she is beautiful and a great blossoming actress. Her scenes with Mr. Freeman are especially moving. Probably more of a chick flick-but since it has such a powerful message I hope that men will watch it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting mess","review":"Mr. Conrad has a fascinating idea here, but his execution is crazy.

It also is a pain to set up and doesn't fit back in the box. The idea is cool, and the pieces are cool looking, but the game is not exciting and it sits on our shelf collecting dust. You would do better to invest in Cadoo, the Family Fun Cranium or Balloon Lagoon.

I then decided to replace the original NiCd battery with this one from Amazon.com (supposed to be exactly like the original one in my Norelco shaver). The battery turns out to last at most 14 shaves (ie two week) rather than the over 20 shaves I used to get from the original battery. After several charges I am getting only 10 shaves per charge.

The Lasko Tangent was pretty good, although I thought Degree of Guilt was much better.

They said it gives a very accurate portrayal of what it's like on this massive peak. I'm extremely glad I bought it. I feel much more prepared for the climb. Although Aconcagua isn't a technical climb, in that it doesn't require rock or ice climbing, it is extremely challenging based on its size alone.The reviewer from Columbus, OH seems to think it's not a serious mountain, but I beg to differ.

It's great to see the trip unfold from the moment they land and to hear their live, first-hand accounts of how they feel and what they think. I was surprised to read that a previous reviewer thought the video was a bit amateurish. The crew managed to film during horrible weather, winds, and sickness all the way to the summit -- an impressive feat.

Since I'm a real estate appraiser, I take lots and lots of pictures and have found this camera to be less than reliable. During the first year the \\"zoom\\" assembly failed and had to be repaired. Fortunatly it was still under warranty. On damp days the camera often would not operate properly. The battery compartment is flimsy and most everyone I know has theirs secured with rubber bands. Often times when I got back to my office, pictures which showed up on the LCD as takes, just weren't there. The best feature of this camera is it's metal body, light weight and good picture quality. Maybe just for home use, this would be a good camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"The camera feels solid and it is, quite easy to use.

The performance isn't bad, but one problem I had (I owned 2 - not because I liked it so much but my company uses them) and I had the same problem on both of them - the battery compartment won't stay closed and you have to hold it closed with tape. Also, sometimes it will have a brain fart and the screen will go all snowy, and you will be snapping pictures but they aren't taking, even though it appears that they are. But when you go back to review them, they aren't there. I also had this problem on both cameras but it wasn't as common - it only happened about 3-4 times over a year period (and I use the camera almost daily). The battery life is pretty good - I can usually get 75 or so pics out of it before I have to recharge the batteries. But I would not really recommend it since there are definitely other models out there that are much better for this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would never buy another Kodak","review":"I have this camera. It has been fine. However, knowing what I know now I would never buy another Kodak camera. Ever. I dropped this camera, and a little plastic piece broke off which keeps the battery pack in the camera. Not a big deal. But NOONE repairs Kodak cameras. Instead you HAVE to send it into their corporate repair center and they instead sell you on trading it in for a refurbished camera. So, I can send this one in and for $250 get a new refurbished camera. But it only sells for $50 more on amazon.com - and thats a new, non-refurbished one! Its a total crock. Just be forwarned.

Now it does this all the time.* It tends to scramble the order of the pictures in its memory. Occasionally I've had pictures disappear.* The viewfinder doesn't accurately represent the picture that is taken, so if you rely on the outlines in the viewfinder, you tend to cut people's heads off.Overall, it's a semi-decent camera, but I'd recommend choosing something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kodak DC215 Battery compartment","review":"Yes, i really have thought this camera has been great for the two years I have owned it...until my battery compartment wont stay in the camera any more after the tiny plastic clip holding it in has snapped!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought Kodak would be higher quality","review":"Admittedly this is the low end of the Kodak line, but even keeping this in mind I was disappointed with the picture quality with my DC215.

Whatever and whoever the bread companies have hired to make their bread now should all be fired. So, having said that, we purchased these containers to hold our new bread. The container measurements are of the lid, not the container. The mouth of the container is much smaller. So, any bread machine loaves over a pound and a half will not fit. And the lid and container fit is very poor. The lids inside ribs often fold instead of sealing tightly to the container, making the seal useless. I expected higher quality from rubbermaid then this. VERY UNSATISFIED with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rubbermaid Bread Storage Container","review":"The container itself is great.

Hers is big enough to allow the bread to be dropped in but small enough so that you can turn the bag inside out over the lip. This way you can leave the bread in the container and pull it up to the top of the container by pulling the bag over the outside of the container thus reducing the amount of air that is around the bread. But this container is much larger than a standard loaf of bread and you cannot pull the bag inside out over the outside of the container...

Watt-Evans' book, the Misenchanted Sword, is a welcome, fun, light, and intelligent exception. Its a joy to read. He creates a great protagonist - Valder, an ordinary, run of the mill ex-soldier. In many ways, he is an antithesis of most fantasy heroes: not exceptionally brave nor intelligent nor wise nor bloodthirsty. Nonetheless, he's thrust into an extraordinary situation (possessing a sword that gives him immortality until he has killed 100 people... at which point the sword turns on him...oh yeah, the sword does not protect him from aging or being wounded).

Everything went on beautifully but nothing stayed on. We let everything dry and the second time she opened it the skirt started falling off, then jewels started popping off, even the glitter flue peeled off! I would say affix everything with craft glue but there wasn't enough to do that so you would have to have your own. We also had trouble with the musical workings at first. Dad was thankfully able to fiddle with it enough to get it moving and after a day or two of on/off working it finally works correctly every time.

It's redundant and slow. The scenes of torture and rape, aside from the glasses of semen the girls were obliged to drink, were uninspired. Each victim went through the same ordeal, and apparently all shopped at the same department store since all of them wore the same clothes, and come to think of it, the captors must have hired the same wardrobe consultants, too.The girls typically wore white shirts, blue jeans and white briefs before being raped (only sodomy, no red-blooded he-man's sex here) and then the bad guys would adorne the poor damsels in white shifts. I don't recall a brassiere one in the whole story.As you can tell, if I'm discussing wardrobe...in an erotic book!...then I must have been very bored as well as trapped in a dank, smelly French chateau over the weekend with no other manuscript to peruse than this marvelous little puppy.Leave sleeping dogs lie, and read something else.Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a practical guide to the transport pricing of electricity","review":"This book is a collection of papers by academics on the transport pricing of electricity networks. I think this book would be mainly of interest to academics working in the same field. Certainly you would probably need a graduate level of education or equivalent in economics to make sense of the work. This is not really a book for those looking for practical guidance on the transmission or distribution pricing of electricity. Also the book isn't good value for money. I might expand this review later with more detailed comments, but in short my feeling is that only academics would get much value out of it, everyone else should look elsewhere for guidance in this area."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great camera! But ...","review":"Rather than saying what I like about this camera, I'll just say the one thing I don't like about it - it creates AVI files for videos which I can play using the EXIF viewer, and also (surprisingly) using netscape on linux, but *not* on many other platforms. Why not create mpeg movies? AVI is not a standard format, it's a cruel joke from Microsoft - some files play on one installation of windows but not another and who knows why ...

It has three different DPI modes, as well as three different modes within each DPI mode.

I was able to get it to work with Win 98 SE without a hitch. It worked great for a few weeks before I began noticing streaks in scans run at more than 1200 dpi. I contacted Tamarack and they acted like they had never seen this problem before. They sent me a replacement scanner that, once again, began streaking after a week or so. I think I was able to figure out what is going on: dust on the optical sensor. When I blast the sensor with canned air, the streaking is reduced, but not completely eliminated. Unless you live in a clean room, you will probably have dust streaking with this machine. I'd recommend this scanner for folks looking to do scans of less than 600 dpi where dust isn't as much of a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"multiple problems","review":"The scanner came with a bad power supply, so I don't know ifthe scanner itself actually works.

This book covers a lot of material, and puts it into a format and language which is conversational and easy to read with children without too much simplification. I also appreciated the thought that went into the order in which the subjects are presented. There is a good progression from one topic to the next. The author writes in a natural conversational style, so this book is perfect for quiet time with a child or even to share at bedtime. There is a short explanation of the topic, then related bible verses, hymns, and prayers to reinforce each topic. I used this book with my 8 and 10 year old boys, and they really enjoyed it. I think this would be suitable to share with kids from age 6 through 13. My older son is now 13 and we still occasionally use this as a resource and a conversation starter!

If you have very little ones listening along with your school age children, it can be a a lot for them to try to grasp. (Our daughter (3) has gleaned some *interesting* ideas because she didn't fully understand the language.) The version of the bible used is full of thees and thous, and the discussion of sin is pretty heavy.

Initially, it was hard to sympathize with Minty--she seems to be whining about being the second wife and how unfairly Nathan's friends & family treat her through the first few chapters. As the story progresses, she begins to grow and mature & I found myself actually rooting for her. I thought the ending was a good one in that she gets the family that she wanted so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs editing....","review":"How many seven year olds would say 'naughty,naughty daddy ???'

She irritated me so much that I stopped reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than One Star","review":"No, this book wasn't as good as \\"Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman\\" but what I think this book has too is a true connection to the way people really act and are - it is definitely not a part of the \\"chick-lit\\" that is popular and which the title may suggest. As a woman long married and about the age of Rose (the wronged wife), I felt that her reactions to the younger woman who stole her husband are realistic - I think she and the second wife behave like real people might - the dialogue seems natural and heart breaking at times - all factors that made me like the book.In the second half of the book when the young wife begins to question her actions of taking a man away from his wife and children, I became fully engaged in reading the book. If you want to read something different from any other book you've read, then give this book a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read.","review":"I enjoyed this book. It is not a Desperate Housewives sort of book. It gives you much more to think about. When a husband cheats and leaves his wife there are many complications that go on forever.

The \\"white\\" background is not, it is a dingy, off-white and does not match my other German-made pieces, nor is it as strong. The \\"French Garden Charm\\" title does not mean it is a \\"French Garden\\" quality porcelain piece, but a cheaper version.

That was a few months ago--I just listened to it again while driving and I am much more impressed! This is a fun album when you are in the right mood and I don't mind the one techno track (Paranoid, Ultraviolence) and I really like the INTENSE black metal treatment given to \\"Who Are You?\\" by OLD and \\"The Wizard\\" by Scorn. Most of the other tracks are pretty straight forward Death Metal treatments, but Sabbath sounds good this way to my ears. Since I am a fan of the old/vintage Sabbath sound, I appreciate Brutal Truth's very heavy and straight forward kick ass take on \\"Lord of This World\\"--NICE AND HEAVY, and Cathedral does an awsome job of remaking Solitude very close to the original, which helps me appreciate the original song even more. Overall this is a cool album and I am now glad I own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laborious and Disjointed","review":"In reading the book, I found it laborious. Cornwell uses figurative language and metaphorical elements in her telling of the story. It also seems choppy and disjointed throughout. As an adult, I found myself rereading several pages to clarify what exactly the meaning was. I also lost interest in the book. I think that the elements of children flying and being unbound by gravity will be appealing to children, but I think the way that she delivers the story would confuse most elementary age children. The illustrations are beautiful, but I don't really see them portraying this magical world that Cornwell created. To me it looks as though the \\"land of the pond\\" is exactly like our world. Over all I would have to say, that the book was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Cornwell's children's book is a dissappointing","review":"While she gives it a good college try, I was very disappointed in this book. I had trouble reading it to myself and can not imagine reading it out loud to a group (which I do often as a librarian). The words did not flow smoothly as they really need to in a children's book. I was also disinterested in the story completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Vague to Follow","review":"I am very well-versed in Children's Literature and find this book a huge disappointment. While the art work is lovely, the story line is so vague and abstract, an adult can barely follow what the meaning of it is, let alone children. There is really no understanding of what takes place, the purpose of the crocodile, or the pond for that matter, or what the whole point of the story is. The meaning of all the implications in the story never come through. Cornwell is outstanding with her Scarpetta stories and I can't get enough of them! But to be so unclear in a children's book means that children don't get anything from the story, and that's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to mysteries","review":"I am a huge Patricia Cornwell fan, but I did not enjoy this book at all.

When I found out that she had wrote a childrens book I ordered it straight away and it was one of the best things I did. Rhys loves it, has included it in his top ten all time favourite books, and reads it all the time. We both love the story, the fact that it is actually a poem, the way it almost sings to you and that Jarrord realises that things are OK where he is and doesn't need to know what is on the other side or anything else. Truly a wonderful, delightful and enchanting sotry. By the way my little boy is now eight years old and as I said, still loves the book.

It has optical (as well as digital) zoom, a USB connection (essential since I use the Macintosh), a LCD preview that you don't have to use (which saves batteries), and a relatively small size. Given the price, it was definitely the way to go.Took the camera to Europe, and came back and viewed the pictures on-screen, as well as had them printed by Ofoto (\\"trusted partner\\"). The results are at about the same as with the film camera I brought. Since it was much smaller than the film camera, we used this one almost exclusively. My only real complaint is that there's no audible indication of when you're switching from optical zoon (better quality) to digital zoom (less quality). Given the price range and picture quality, I think this is the best camera to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refurbished Fuji - Works Great.","review":"I purchased a refurb unit which took me along time to decide on, being a refurb. My decission to purchase it stemmed from the fact that the manfacture Refurbished units are tested more than once and if parts are in need of change, it is replaced and retested. I received mine a month ago and I am very happy with its fetures and picture quality, and it looked brand new, not a scatch.

Can't have everything i guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Construction","review":"I purchased this camera based on the glowing reviews. The picture quality is good but the quality is sub par and shoddy. The lens cover jammed. Once that was resolved, the focus jammed and the lens will no longer focus.As far as I am concerned, Fuji Digital products are not value for money and cheap construction that are in the same category as similar sub par cameras made in China.Very disappointing and did not live up to the Made in Japan reputation. Sorry, I am disappointed. Just my two cents. If you are looking for a disposable camera good for about a year maybe, Fuji Digicams fit the bill, otherwise stay awayl"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent camera!!","review":"This camera is super easy to use and operate.

It worked great until the on/off function switch developed an intermittent problem. Also, the USB cable connector on the body has worn and must be clamped to download pictures.

The camera works fine, but I could not take advantage of the USB connection since the drivers included for Win 98 and Win 2000 are not supported by Win ME. The Fuji website was not helpful either and I ended up having to buy a Smartmedia card reader in order to really evaluate the performance of the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little camera","review":"I got this camera, for christmas and found my self taking pictures of everything i could find. I would have this camera a five except that it sucks batteries so get rechangeable ones. Other problems is it only comes with a 4mb memory card, so if you want to take more pictures i'd suggest getting a bigger mermory card. Now for the good points, it's really easy to work, the pictures turn out great. The Usb port works wonders because you can get your pictures in a matter of secords.

I had hoped to have purchased a factual, and unbiased piece of non-fiction. And I soon found out that this book fulfils none of the above. After about 90 pages I got the opinion that the author was trying to persuade me to think that every Muslim was a gun-trotting fanatic ready to blow himself to pieces. His \\"free\\" interpretations of some parts of the Koran or his explanation of what a jihad is are \\"interesting\\" to say the least. Also the author's attempts to create hypothetical cases of future terrorist threats are amusing at most. There are definitely better books on Islamic Fundamentalism, but there are also worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERSIMPLIFICATION","review":"In the wake of the 11 September tragedies in New York and Washington, it is no surprise that Americans would want to know more about Islamic terrorism.But it would be wrong to oversimplify a complex issue. This book is such an oversimplification. It draws heavily on two previous books: one is Anthony J. Dennis's \\" The Rise of the Islamic Empire and the threat to the West\\" which came out six years ago and the other is Amir Taheri's \\" Holy Terror: Inside the World of Islamic Terrorrism\\" which appeared 12 years ago.Both those books offer a far deeper, and fairer, analysis of the phenomenon. They are also free of the obvious hatred that Norval has for all Arabs and Muslims.

Okay tracks, but not any kind of must haves--a Trying Day comes closest to being worth it if there had been a full studio recording done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"This book gives an overall view of bandwidth, and how it relates to a every communications field. I especially like the historical background and how the author presents relevant examples so that the information and and specific bandwidth applications will be etched in your memory. One of the examples that I particulary like is how the author explains how video bandwidth is measured, and he then goes on to explain the advantages and disadvantages of how video transmitted on the different types of networks. This is an important aspect as the world of technology inches closer to implementing converged networks.

However, it must be noted that the book is not an original work. It is a compilation of excerpts from Max Lucado's other books organized on the framework of Psalm 23. Most of the time it works, but occasionally a passage may have only a tenuous connection to Psalm 23. That doesn't make the book bad, but an avid reader of Max Lucado will have read these things before.

The book is presented in a form that makes it great for the person looking to become a druid, the person who is alread and just whant's to read more, or the person who is just looking for a well writen tale of Arthor. This is definitely a must buy for anyone with any intrest in the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Male Positive book on Paganism","review":"So many books on contemporary Paganism focus on the feminist aspects of Nature Religions. This one, however historically inacurate it may be, presents a very Male positive approach to Pagan Spirituality. I feel that it addresses a need left unacknowledged by the many wonderful books directed at women and girls.That said, the historical inacuracies and the insistance on one-true-way-isms, are points out of favor and, to be honest, I'm not sure that the world really needs more books which favor gender segregated Paganism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"to everyone who is doing the well it's not historically acurate I say, \\"get a life\\". this book is a great resource and is one that makes a point through great stories.

Each chapter is part of an on-going story about the education of Arthur, with assignments inserted between them, allowing the reader to journey along with the student. These aren't just static activities and I enjoyed the chance to make the objects described.However, as an adult I see that a lot of the sources Monroe lists are questionable at best. His main book of reference was actually authored by himself! It is a fun book, but should not be taken for more than fiction as far as the history and culture of Druids."},{"rating":"1","title":"False but inspiring","review":"This was the second book I read on the Celts and Druidism in particular. In hindsight, I am a bit angry at the lies it fed my eager mind, but also still thankful for the imaginative inspiration it fostered within me. I think that most will agree that the book has a good story (albeit fiction) and overall \\"magical\\" feel to it, and this is where I think that we should pay the most attention. The format and \\"feel\\" of the book should be a sort of guide post/model for future authors in this genre. I have been on many mailing lists that attest to the great number of young pagans/druids that this book inspired to further their knowledge. Yes, it can and has done harm, but as a source of inspiration to those looking for an introduction, etc it has done its job. An eclectic view of mixing and matching the good of the book with the good of quality scholarship could be a good thing indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book for learning calligraphy I have seen.","review":"I found this book to be very comprehensive, easy to follow and will recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn calligraphy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content needs updating...","review":"I have this workbook and I feel that the content needs to be updated.

(See my review of Christmas, Vol.1 -- the same things apply to this album.)Please do yourself a favor and buy a Christmas album with musical integrity, instead of this one. If you really, really like this kind of musical arranging, you can save yourself some money.

First of, Gilles Cachemailles was a great Don in this- the nastiest ever, I think, especially since I'm used to Thomas Allen, Benjamin Luxon, or Cesare Siepi, who are much more likable in a way. The rest of the cast is great- most notably Julian Banse's lovely Zerlina and Steven Page's comical Leporello. However, there are practically no sets- just a bridge and a platform that goes up and down. The costumes (modern) are totally blah. How scary is a Commendatore that doesn't look like a statue, but a businessman? Ugh. Still, the singing is so good that it makes up for the lack of creativity or fanciness in the sets or costumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good First Choice","review":"The singing and acting in this video are very good--sometimes excellent. The video quality is also good, and the opera house, orchestra, and conductor do a fine job interpreting the score of this great opera. I have two major reservations in recommending this video wholeheartedly, and they are as follows:First, the modern costumes/props really detract from the opera production as a whole (the Don drinking Coke from a can is but one example). The costumes are somewhat plain and appear very low budget.Second, the sets are very minimal.I believe in accurate, full-bodied sets and elegant period costumes for this opera, and I guess these two major reservations made me dissatisfied with this production. I realize these issues may not detract from others' enjoyment, but at least you'll know what you're purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and enjoyable.","review":"This video is excellent and superb, in music, in the accoustic and the range of shooting. The performance itself is really excellent, the singers are divine in their singing as well as performance. However, only one disappointment, that is the costumes which take the contemporary costume, which left no imagination to us of the period of story and the background are too static. Nevertheless, I enjoy watching and listening to this video and feel very much entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"opera","review":"Glad to have bought.

Now that my child is on solids, it does nothing to contain the smell. By the end of the day the pail smells and so does the nursery. What's the use?

The diaper genie does not completely take the stink away once your little one starts to eat solid foods (This includes the \\"toddler\\" diaper genie refills too). Also, I found the diaper genie refills to be expensive over the long run and most grocery stores carry a low inventory or are often out. Myth: There exists a diaper system where the stink will be completely hidden. Moms, Dads, don't let the expensive \\"diaper systems\\" fool you. Save yourself some money. Buy a regular diaper pail (I got one for $16) that uses cheap scented trash bags and change the diaper pail every night before your little one goes to sleep.

It requires you to buy special bags, it is cheaply constructed, it is virtually impossible to operate while keeping one hand on a squirming baby on the changing table, and the bags make a loud rustling sound when disposing a diaper. (That may not sound like a bad thing, but it is when it wakes a sleeping baby at 4AM!) Check out the Diaper Champ. MUCH more user friendly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Diaper Champ instead!","review":"The Diaper Genie was a gift 2 years ago when I had my son, and we thought it was the way to go. It's pretty good at holding in odors, I'll give it that. But it's difficult to use: open this, push that, shove the diaper down (without having it leak on your hand!), twist the thingie, close the lid..... Family and babysitters can never figure it out, so the diapers are left sitting on top of the lid. The mechanism that cuts the \\"sausage\\" of a bag with the dirty diapers in it warped almost right away, making cutting and changing the refill cartridges difficult. The refill cartridges get expensive, $4-$6 each depending on where you shop, and you have to change it about every 2 - 3 weeks based on single toddler use. We bought a Diaper Champ last week on a friend's recommendation (because the lid of the Genie snapped backwards, and baby #2 is due next month!!), and we LOVE it. Check it out instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else!","review":"Ugh. Great idea. But it is a pain in the *** to use! Doesn't work right - you twist and twist and it gets jammed in the top, or doesn't twist the diaper. You have to stick your hands in the diaper mess to get the diaper down low enough to twist off. I got this as a gift - good thing I didn't buy it myself or I'd be back at the store raising hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Genie is a scam","review":"I was able to figure out how to work Diaper Genie, but it's a lot of work and it doesn't work well. The device basically attempts to make little dirty diaper sausages. You put the diaper into the bag that has one end tied off, turn the head to slice the bag at the other end and tie that end off.All this happens while your baby is sitting on the changing table or, in the best situation, running around or lying on the floor, and you're futzing with the stupid bags.After just a few days we switched over to Diaper Champ, which uses straight tall kitchen garbage bags and has a rotating top that keeps the basic stink out. It works much more simply and quickly than Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this item","review":"This product was a gift and it is more trouble then its worth. I only used it for about a month and it was such a pain. I would rather just empty the trash can once a day then mess with this thing.

The entire system seems like a huge waste of bags - which are expensive, time and energy. I find it crazy go out and buy expensive refills when there are other alternatives. It was hard to put together and hard to use. It regardless of how many times you 'twist and seal' it really never stays. The smell was not that bad, however I literally used Lysol on it every time it was emptied. Overall huge waste of money and I eventually threw it away and started saving the bags the paper comes in everyday and threw the dirty ones away in those."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Don't bother purchasing this product, in order for it to come close to working you have to push the diaper down 18 inches. The problem with this is that you know you shouldn't have to waste that much plastic to secure each diaper . . . but it sure does work towards making you have to purchase more refills. I plan on using the remainder of my refill then returning or chucking the device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily complicated","review":"It does control the smell as well as other diaper pails, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this thing. It uses special cartridges to turn your dirty diapers into a giant string of sausage links, however, the refills are relatively expensive ($6/per) and we needed a refill about every 3 - 4 weeks.It was difficult to replace the cartridge, and the performance was spotty once you actually got it refilled, often resulting in diapers not being twisted into a neat package like they were supposed to be, but rather, being dropped into a large, open sack.I could never remember if it was 3 twists or 4 twists to wind it up, and in general, got really irritated any time I had to deal with the Diaper Genie (which was about 10x/day at first). We junked this thing after 2 months and bought a Diaper Champ, which I love as much as one can love a diaper pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not as good as the Diaper Champ","review":"The Diaper Genie does do what it claims. It helps keep the odors in and looks much better than an overflowing trash can. I originally bought it thinking that it would do a better job of keeping odor trapped than diaper pails that did not use the twist and tie system and just used ordinary trash bags. But just to compare, I also bought a Diaper Champ....MUCH better. It did just as good of a job with the odor, was much easier to use, and I can use ordinary kitchen trash bags instead of expensive diaper genie refills. I got rid of the diaper genie and bought 2 diaper champs instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"SMELLY>>>","review":"I used mine for about a month. Getting the bags in is a pain and the SMELL.

I thought it would help keep the 'diaper smell' out of the room and most importantly, would be convenient. It works fine if you have a 3rd arm. I didn't like not having a foot petal to open the can while attending to my daughter, or needing to turn the bag by hand after having to smash the diaper into the its little holding section (it scraped my fingers). Not to mention, the blade that was supposed to cut the bag free to dispose of it never worked. I had to get scissors to cut the bag away. The whole time I was trying to fiddle with the can the diaper smell would come out and tended to linger for longer than I would have liked. I'm currently looking for a better replacement.

The smell goes away after a little bit but every time you open the diaper genie the smell comes out. And I have a bit of a problem every time I reset the genie.

I wish I had listened! It does, in its defense, contain odors. However, you have to PUSH or STUFF the diaper and its contents which could possibly squish out when the diaper is forced into the Genie. This alone was enough to discourage my husband from even using the Genie. Then you have to twist to seal, which sometimes doesn't work because you have the correct ratio of bag to diaper for it to actually twist off and not open again when the next diaper is added. Also, it doesn't hold very many diapers, even for little guys. The refills are also a drawback, as they are expensive and you can't ever find coupons for them.

The refills are very easy to change and last about 2-3 weeks so that equals about $8 a month which in our opinion is well worth it. I am able to change it without the help of my husband with no problems and it only takes a minute or two.

Even the \\"new and improved\\" Diaper Genie can't compare to the Diaper Champ. The Diaper Champ uses regular size trash bags where the Diaper Genie requires special refills. I can't speak for anyone else, but personally, the idea of having to constantly buy expensive refills for my diaper pail, when we already have trash bags in the house, is nuts.As for the \\"smell\\" issue. Let's face it - diapers stink. And regardless of brand, ANY diaper pail still needs to be emptied on a regular basis. As for the Diaper Genie vs the Diaper Champ, I have seen no difference in odor control between the two brands - both work pretty well to contain and control odor better than a regular trash barrel, but neither are odor proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product! But don't use it their way.","review":"This thing is really good at eliminating odors in the house. How to conserve the specialty plastic: First:tie a really tight knot when you start, otherwise it can leak. Second, you twist the inner lid after each diaper, but instead of just adding another diaper to make a sausage-link-like chain, untwist and add the next diaper, then twist again. The odors are controlled. All the diapers wind up in a single \\"bag\\" you use a LOT less plastic than if you make a chain of diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells putrid even with deligent cleaning","review":"I've had the diaper genie for a year now and I'm ready to review. The first 5 months the genie did well. I found it easy to use and it did contain the stink from my daughter's diapers. Then, well, she started solids and the genie started smelling REALLY bad. Like port-o-john on a hot day bad. I used Lysol to clean it twice a week and let it airdry, but it didn't help. The lid also broke off. I wouldn't suggest anyone purchase this unless they plan on buying another one every 2-3 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"I am flabbergasted at all the bad reviews for this product. I have the old diaper genie, and just bought my sister the new one, and we both love them! They are not hard to use, the new one is even easier than mine, and do contain the smell. I don't understand the frustration folks are having, especially the \\"lady with the master's degree.\\" This product does what it claims - it contains the smell, is not hard to empty, and makes our nursery a more pleasant place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for older kids","review":"The Diaper Genie worked well for the first year of our son's life but lately (he is 16 months now) it has been really stinking. I washed it out and sprayed it with Lysol and it still stinks. I have stopped using it and am looking at other brands to use for our second baby- due in a month. The Wall Street Journal just ran a review of diaper disposal systems and they really liked the Diaper Dekor Plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick A Different Diaper Pale.","review":"We bought the diaper genie on a recommendation from a friend, but even word-of-mouth suggestions only go so far. My daughter was breast-fed so when she was a newborn her poopy diapers didn't smell much. But the moment she started on solids, and we really needed the diaper genie to work, it FAILED MISERABLY. Her room started to smell almost right away. Even though the bags are scented it doesn't help. We used this item properly, and truly hoped that it would've worked, but it didn't and it was simply a waste of money. I recommend you choose another diaper pale instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross","review":"I hate the NEW diaper genie. The refills are very hard to cut when the pail fills up. Also when it is emptied it smells sooo bad....take it outside before you even open it. Lastly....I had olny had about 5 diapers in there and they were all pee diapers and I opened it and there were bugs inside!!! Do not get this. I would reccommend the Diaper Champ or simply a small can with a doedorizer or air freshener, Safety 1st has a nice one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"It keeps the stink away and is easy to use.

Personally, I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best in diaper pails","review":"I didn't know too much about diaper pails so when we got this, we thought it would work wonders. Wrong! The pail still has smells and you have to buy special containers to refill. My daughter goes though about one bundle a week and then we have to change it. We still however use it. It's been with us for about a year but I am defentially looking for a new one. Just make sure you have an air freshener near buy when you're changing the pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Spring for the extra $10 and get the Genie II or the Champ. Once your baby starts to eat foods (cereal, purees etc..)her/his BMs are going to make a much bigger stink than they do 0-4 months.I find that the twisting system is imperfect- for one thing, when starting a new \\"bag,\\" you can twist one diaper in there but once you get a second or even third diaper in there, the bag unwinds (so you end up having several diapers to a single \\"pod\\"). It is not until you have so many diapers in there does it finally begin to twist them individually.Secondly, independent of the first issue, the ribs on the lid don't always catch the bag so it often takes time before your twisting becomes effective in order to \\"close off\\" the bag.Third, too often after using the razor, it continues to cut the bag even after you've released it. So if you start a new sleeve, it's still in cutting mode. Too wasteful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Threw Mine Out","review":"I used one of these for the first 8 months after my baby was born. It made me mad because it wouldn't twist properly, I had to press the top down and twist at the same time (using both hands). It was pretty frustrating as a new parent, just one more thing to make you feel inadequate, not being able to figure out the silly diaper pail. When we started solids it could not contain the smell (yes I used the #2 refills). And the plastic that the Genie is made from soaks up smells. I sprayed the inside with Lysol and let it air out between emptyings, and it still stank! Finally I soaked the darn thing in the bathtub in bleach. That finally got the smell away, but after a few more weeks of use it soaked up smell again. I threw the freakin' thing in the trash and now just use grocery bags for poopy diapers. I'm looking for a new decent diaper pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Chore!","review":"This was one of three diaper pails I tried while my daughter was in diapers, and my least favorite of the three. Sure, the idea of twisting the diapers into their own little sausage-like casings seems appealing, but all that twisting led to some real issues with my elbow - very painful. And the hefty price you have to pay for the replacement bags...what a rip-off! I ended up using the Diaper Champ and was really happy with that diaper pail - no special bags required and all you do is drop the diaper in and flip the handle over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Genie = Your nursery will smell like a sewage plant","review":"We HAD a Diaper Genie, it's a total waste of money and plastic. The Diaper Genie was so hard to use and didn't do anything to stop odors. My son's room smelled as if we threw the dirty diapers in an open garbage. And the fact that you have to buy their \\"special bags\\" added insult to injury.We replaced it with THE FIRST YEARS CLEAN AIR DIAPER DISPOSAL SYSTEM. It's so much more effective and easy to use than the Diaper Genie, and you use your own tall kitchen garbage bags.The greatest thing about The First Years Clean Air Systen is that it can store about 6-7 days of my son's diapers without NO yucky odors. WOW!! We love this product so much. Our son's room smells clean with no poopy odors, and we save money by using our own tall kitchen bags. It's also very easy to change--no confusing bag twisting.STAY AWAY FROM THE DIAPER GENIE. You'll just end up having to replace it because your baby's room will stink terribly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best out of the rest","review":"I have tried almost every diaper pail out there and I always come back to the Diaper Genie. It just does the best job out of all the diaper pails available. I also didn't like having to buy expensive refills, but they last along time for me. I only use the Genie in the baby's bedroom (upstairs), when downstairs in the living room, I just use the regular kitchen trash can. I like the locking top feature, b/c my 2 yr old was trying to open all the other diaper pails we have tried. The sausage linking of the diapers is what keeps the odor locked into the bag, so you get no odor when the can is opened. It is pretty easy to cut the bag, open the bottom, and discard of the trash. I really like Playtex products, so it didn't surprise me that I have always stuck with the Diaper Genie,especially the new and improved one...it is MUCH better than the older models, just drop in the the new refill and tie the end of the bag. Keeps our nursey smelling diaper odor free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth anything!","review":"I registered for, and received the diaper genie at my baby shower. The diaper genie works for the first month or two at keeping the room odorless. Once my son was two months old, his room, where the genie was located, began to smell!!!!

My sister-in-law got the diaper champ and has not had any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say No to the Diaper Genie","review":"We have had the diaper genie for 6 months with our first born. The lid (hinges in the back) just recently broke, I would have thought this was a one time thing, but our friends who have used the diaper genie for 6 months as well, had just purchased another diaper genie due to the same reason.Also as stated in previous reviews. The twisting and cutting mechanism on the lid does not always work on the first couple of tries. We will be trying out a different diaper pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish it would work","review":"We registered for the diaper genie because it was recommended by others. We've had trouble with it ever since. Sometimes the entire bag twists instead of sealing off the diaper. Our biggest problem is cutting the bag when the genie is full. Usually it will cut half the bag but no more no matter how much you try. We usually have to get scissors and cut it this way. It's more trouble than it's worth and I would not recommend the genie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME essential","review":"When I found out I was pregnant, I had to have a diaper genie to keep my dog out of all the diapers!!!! I received the diaper genie as a shower gift and absolutley love it. It's easy to use and keeps odor out of the bedroom. The only feature it is lacking is a handle that I could step on to open the lid. It's hard to open the lid with a dirty diaper and baby in hand. Other than that, it's just what every mom needs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The \\"new and improved\\" version is a complete waste of money. We bought a new diaper genie to replace the two year old version we used with our first child. The \\"new and improved\\" version is poorly designed and releases the wonderful diaper smell into the room every time you open the lid to put a new diaper in. You would think the product development folks at Playtex would have discovered this before fielding the new version, but alas we are stuck with the smelly genie. After seeing our friend's Diaper champ in action this weekend, our diaper genie is going to the curb and getting replaced by the diaper champ! Don't waste your money with the genie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New & Improved.......what a joke!","review":"If this is considered a new & improved product, I would sure hate to see what the older version was like. This is my first experience with the diaper genie and DEFINITELY my last. In a matter of 6 months, I purchased 3 diaper genies as they have all broken.After reading all the rave reviews on the Diaper Genie, I expected more. I gave in to the idea of living with the continual odor that escapes everytime you open the lid. Yet at a friends house I realized there is bigger & better out there, not just life with the diaper genie. I finally came to my senses and switched to a BETTER diaper system (the diaper champ) and am much happier!!!I have several friends that are expecting their first child and I am steering them AWAY from the diaper genie as best as I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for older babies/toddlers!","review":"I poo-poo'd the diaper genie from the time I had my son until he started eating real food. I have a changing station downstairs for convenience, and there's just no way I could leave one of his newly-stinky poopy diapers in a pail in my living area.

The worst thing is that when you empty it (every other day!)the next few diapers you put in go straight to the bottom.

I am sorry I didn't register for another brand with better design and less expensive refills."},{"rating":"1","title":"!!This \\"Genie\\" should have never been let out of the lamp!!","review":"Good concept, bad execution. This pail has the specific liner insert that you HAVE to buy to make it work. One more trip to the store you shouldn't put yourself through! The \\"spin\\" mechanism (to twist the liner and block the smell) does NOT always engage and just spins for its own sake. The cutting mechanism has worked as advertised 1 out of 10 times. That's 10% in my book, that's not good enough when you are tired, the wife has asked you to empty the pail in the dark of night and your fumbling with a knife or scissors to cut the bag off.

This makes the WORST list! No matter what, no diaper pail is worth the hassle. If you really really want the mess/smell out of your room/house, keep a supply of recycled grocery plastic bags on hand; tie that nasty thing up and throw it out in the garage/garbage can. PLEASE resist the urge to buy a diaper pail - use that registry list for a few sets of high quality white twin sheets and mattress pads; because in a few years when that baby goes in a bed, you'll be so happy to move to twin sheets and white matches everything through the years no matter the room theme :)trust me :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smell gone!","review":"My mother insisted that she got along fine without any diaper disposal system. But after about 6 weeks with my first child, I begged to differ. At first my daugher's diapers didn't smell, and then all of a sudden I walked into her room and walked right back out. I hadn't planned on getting the Diaper Genie necessarily, but it was the only disposal system in the smaller-scale local baby store I went to. I quickly got used to the mechanics of it and her room smells fresh and clean now. I empty it about once a week, and to make it easier, instead of dumping the heavy pail over the big garbage, I sit on the floor and empty it into a shopping bag, which is easier to throw out into the main garbage. Everyone laughs how the diapers look like a string of sausage with all the twists. I didn't give it 5 stars because having to push it through the clamps isn't the most desirable thing, and the stage 2 refills are 9 bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Genie STINKS","review":"The Diaper Genie stinks.

We received it for a gift and were ecstatic. However, by the time our son was 9 months we could not take the frustration of broken clips, stuck diapers (the turning mechanism is a good idea, but does not work well) and smell any longer so one day I took it for a walk out to our dumpster and waved goodbye forever.Shortly afterwards we purchased the Neat system that had been advertised on TV. What an improvement! Our son just turned two and it's still going strong! It doesn't have a turning mechanism so it's simple to use, it's larger so it holds more diapers, the thick plastic contains most odours (nothing is perfect!) and it is easy to empty (just plug your nose).The only downside that we have found is that refills are not available everywhere. So far we have only found them at Wal-mart and online at www.sears.ca. Hopefully more Canadian stores will catch on soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Diaper Champ is far superior","review":"The diaper genie was a waste of money. People on a limited budget cannot afford the refills. The \\"sausaging\\" kept coming undone every time I changed the genie. The worst of it was when my baby started using larger diapers the genie needed to be changed at least once a day. The Diaper Champ is about the same cost initially and saves you money because you can use any type of garbage bag, even generic and it eliminates the smell just as well as the genie. The bonus of the Diaper Champ is that is so simple to use. I disposed of the genie when my son was 6 months old and have been using the Champ for 3 years. Lets face it, until your children are potty trained you will be dealing with stinky diapers which are costly anyway, why waste extra money on something that does not work as well as they say it does."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has fallen apart","review":"The second that I opened this thing over two years ago it was a problem. It was complicated to put together and still after many refills a mystery to reload. The plastic bags never seemed to stay twisted, so the diapers would all be in one big section. I guess I'm lazy but, it just seems to hard. When you have a two year old and a new born diaper disposal should not be so difficult. After my second child was born I bought some refills (which makes me crazy, seems like a waste of money!) and tried to get the thing up and running. Well some small plastic thing fell out (still can't find where it belongs) and the cutting ring is warped and a ragged at the edge. The ring no longer fits.

The bag cutter is also less than desirable. My husband and I find we have more fustrations with the thing than relief. Our second child is due at the end of July and lets just say that we have registered for a different (aka BETTER) diaper disposal system.

My second complaint is that the cutter doesnt work! It will cut about an inch or two and then stop and every time i try to do it again it just doesnt work, so i end up cutting it with scissors.. This thing is WAY too much work for a diaper pail! ANd its a pain to get the diaper down in there when trying to hold onto a wriggling baby too. In my opionion its NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL!!!!

As someone else pointed out, most of the time you end up with what my husband and I refer to as \\"the giant poo-poo sack\\" because no matter how many times you twist that first diaper, the next one you put in just falls on top of it. What I've had to do is lay the thing across my lap, push in the second diaper with my right hand while my left hand is holding the first already twisted diaper in the bottom of the pale.

Perhaps it was because it was the only one I had heard of in use. It was not a pleasant experience. First, it holds very few diapers and needs to be emptied frequently. The liners are expensive and when you are spending your money on diapers is the last thing you think to buy. I still like the concept of twisting the diapers though I am not sure why, but it did not always work until a load of diapers hit the bottom of the pail.

Others had told me it was great. It does a good job of trapping the odor. Make sure to put the next diaper in quickly and push the lid down all the way or the smell will seep into the room. As for the individual wrapping of the diapers, they untwist until you fill it with enough diapers to hit the bottom of the pail and hold the twist in place. In other words, it takes 7-10 diapers before you get the twist to stay put. Then about another 7-10 diapers and the thing is full. So I will have to go with the other reviewers and say that buying the expensive refill bags seems like a waste when the thing is really just one big bag of diapers anyway. And for the cutter...mine doesn't work worth a darn. I have to do the cutter 3 or 4 times and then finish off the cut by ripping the last bit of the bag. Don't waste your money on this.

It is easy to use and keeps the nursery smelling fresh. As for the cost of the bags, we only use it for \\"dirties\\" and our daughter is 2 1/2 months old and we are still on the first canister. We empty it once a week on garbage day and never deal with the smell of dirty diapers. It is definitely worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of garbage - no pun intended!","review":"This is a very cheap product. After less than one month of use, the cutting function broke. Shortly there after, the \\"twisting\\" feature also broke. Now I have a glorified garbage can. Wish I had read the other reviews before buying this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky","review":"After our Diaper Champ started to stink, we decided to get another diaper system. We went to the store and debated between the Diaper Genie and the Neat. We went with the Genie and were very sorry. It smelled just as bad as the Champ and was so much harder to use. We went back and got the Neat system. We love it! No stink and pretty easy to use! Don't waste your money on the Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handles odors, but there are better ways to do that","review":"The Diaper Genie system has you drop in a dirty diaper, then twist the plastic liner to seal off odors. You end up with sort of a daisy chain of diapers wrapped in a long, twisted-up plastic bag. It uses a LOT of plastic. Those diapers surely won't decompose until eons after all the other diapers in the landfill.I used the Diaper Genie with my first child. I hope the new version takes care of the many, many problems mine had, including the lid that breaks off. But it still uses that twisted-bag system. I have the Diaper Dekor for my second child. It uses a lot less plastic and I haven't noticed any odor problem. Plus, I can use it with one hand, which is a huge benefit. I don't have to let go of my baby while I drop the diaper into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't work.","review":"I recieved this as a gift for my first child. I was so excited, but threw it away not long after I recieved it. I found that the first 2-4 diapers you put in there didn't stay wrapped. They untwisted as there was nothing to hold the diaper still when you pushed the next one through. And it only held like 10-15 diapers when my daughter was a newborn. Well, they go through 8-10 a day. I was changing this every other day, and it's definately not easy to change. Then you throw in the refills that cost a fortune and this is just not practical. So I just started wrapping the diapers up in grocery bags and throwing them in my kitchen trash. Those are free and just as effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money on this!!!","review":"Do not waste your money on the genie. Never mind it being a pain to use, the bag untwists itself, when you open the pail to put a diaper in the smell knocks you out and you have to put your hand into the pail and push it down in order to turn the pail....YUCK..... The champ takes regular garbage bags, you simply flip the lid over and you don't have to push down dirty diapers. It holds a good amount of diapers and is very easy to use. Save your money and start out with the champ. Hope this was helpful and good luck.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Champ!!!","review":"I used the Diaper Genie for 15 months and cursed it daily- not as much as my husband though :) The mechanism that cuts the plastic broke after only a month so we had to use scissors instead. The refills are expensive and smell funny. I think they added to the odor problem instead of masking it. Also, the lid was sometimes hard to open. We finally broke down and bought the Champ. My daughter's room doesn't smell like diapers any more! It's so easy to refill with just any plasic bag-trash, grocery or shopping bags work fine. One reviewer stated that she had to clean it regularly because of smearing- (ewww) Just make sure the contents of the diaper is wrapped up tight and it won't be a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still awful...0 stars","review":"I used the diaper genie with my first two children and hated how hard it was to use and how expensive it was to refill. The diaper champ is now out and I have used it with my third baby. It is wonderful...so much easier and more cost efficient. Don't waste money on the diaper genie. One $10 box of trashbags will fill the diaper champ us as long as your baby is in diapers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw mine out at 1 year!","review":"All of my family members who bought this product threw it in the trash after 9mo to a year. (We discovered this at a party having the wasted money on baby products conversation) We are all clean people, but even changing the thing everyday, the smell was unbearable. Once the stink is there, it's there. We used every product known to man to clean it. Nothing worked. If we have another baby I will just get a pail or take them to the regular garbage. Don't register for this... your friends money will be spent better else where."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Genie","review":"I got the diaper genie as a shower gift and I love it. The only downside is that you have to shove the diaper so far down into the pail. So far odor has not been a problem at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The old Diaper Genie was better...","review":"I honestly hate the new Diaper Genie. Yes, it was a pain to replace the older version's refills but at least it kept the odor out. We finally decided to replace our old one with a fresh one. (The other was not so \\"fresh\\" anymore.) What a waste. We don't even use it because you put two diapers in and the room stinks. We never had this problem with the older version. I say go for the diaper champ or the one that uses just regular diapers. We've had success with both of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good in the long run","review":"I received the Diaper Genie as a shower gift. In the beginning, I loved it. There was no diaper smell in the nursery and it was easy to use. However, after each refill the plastic ring would bend a little and make it increasingly difficult to change. I have now had the Diaper Genie for almost fifteen months. The hinge on the back has broken and I can no longer use it with one hand. I am currently searching for a diaper pail that will last through at least one kid in diapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"This is a great product. I have never smelled that diaper smell at all in my house. I also love that it's small enough that you have to change it regularly because i forget my keys at least 3 days a week let alone can i remember to change the diaper pail unless something is reminding me to (such as a diaper pail you can no longer put diapers in)The only problem I have had with this product is that the first 2 or 3 diapers you twist in the pail if you only twist them 2 times like the directions say, they will untiwist when you put the next diaper in. What i do to prevent this from happening is to twist the first 2 or 3 daipers 4 times instead of the recomended 2 times. That totally fixes the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too much trouble","review":"This product is WAY too much trouble for the sake of stinky diapers. I used it for about two weeks. At first I didn't even understand how to use it. I even kept the instructions on my changing table. My husband, being the man that he is, gave up and wouldn't use it because it was too complicated. The inside liner kept ripping, I couldn't get the diapers down into it without takeing off the ring thing on top. Then I had to put it back together in order to twist the diaper down into it. Then, trying to change the liner was IMPOSSIBLE!!! Anyways, I should have asked my friends. They all had the same complaints. I ended up with a normal Safety First diaper pail, and though it doesn't mask odors completely, it works with out any trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate the Genie","review":"Im surprised to see ANY positive reviews on the diaper genie. Unfortunately I've been using it for 9 months now and I have to say not a day goes by that I dont think about running it over with my husband's truck. You need 2 hands to use it, (difficult while holding a baby on a changing table) It fills up in 2 days, (less as baby and diapers get bigger) does not stop diaper odor, and is such a pain to refill. New moms- I know this seems like a must have but trust me, the last thing any mom needs is a frustrating diaper pail. Im going to check out the Dekor.. I heard good things about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"no genie in this bottle","review":"At first I was thrilled when my mother-in-law got this for me. It looked so nifty!! When I brought my little baby home, my father set up the system, and I happily started using it. I lost patience very soon. The second and third diapers seem to drop through to the first one, no matter how much I twist the bag, a foul smell escapes every time I lift the lid, and I hate the hassle of trying to slip a long heavy \\"snake\\" of dirty diapers into another trash bag, to take down to the trash. I seem to forever be needing to empty it, and though the refills do last a while, I could do without the expense. We are going out this weekend to buy the diaper champ. My 2 girlfriends have it, and say it is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a better solution - cheaper, too!","review":"We have a four-year-old and a just one-year-old and we are selling our Genie in a yard sale this weekend. The Genie, and others like it, I'm sure, gets smelly before it's \\"full\\" and emptying it before a full chamber is more costly than the already overpriced refills. A better solution? Take the dirty diaper down to your kitchen, take a plastic grocery store bag (what do you know, about the same material and weight as the refills!), put the diaper in, twist, fold the diaper in again, tie off and put in the kitchen trash. Yes, the trash fills up more quickly, but then the diapers make it out of the house faster, too - no more smell. And the \\"refills\\" are free! Don't bother with these overpriced systems!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New and Improved piece of GARBAGE","review":"Don't even think about wasting your money on this piece of junk! I used the prior model of the diaper genie for nearly two years and had no complaints. We only had to get a new one because after 2 years, they naturally retain the smelly odor. So we head to Target to buy the \\"New and Improved\\" diaper genie. I am not sure who was responsible for the creation of the \\"New and Improved\\", but they should all be fired. I walked into my kid's room a few days after putting the new one up and I just about puked when I walked into my kid's room it stunk so bad. Never in two years did the other one smell. The \\"new and improved\\" does not have a good seal and the smell seeps out.Biggest waste of money!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until you have to refil it.","review":"It was a little hard to figure out at first, and not something to do one handed, but seemed to keep in the smell of the newborn diapers. We were happy with it (bought it used...with the bag in it).Then we had to refil it. Very tricky. Each time got trickier--there's this ring that's supposed to fit into the diaper refill. Well, it doesn't--every time I've had to force it. Forcing it caused little bends in the ring that made it fit worst. The time before last that I changed it I actually cut my hand on it (and it's plastic). Then this last time trying to force the dang thing on I finally broke the Genie--it won't close now.It doesn't keep the stench in on older baby diapers that well anyways. Every time you twist it a little cloud of stench comes up, and when you change it better take it outside first. I'm sick of it. I'm going to try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a great product","review":"It takes two hands to dispose of a diaper when using the Diaper Genie. This makes it impossible to dispose of a diaper when holding an infant. Additionally, this system doesn't have a very large capacity. We'd end up needing to change it every one to two days! Do yourself a favor--buy the Diaper Champ. It's easy to use and holds many more diapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great Diaper Pail!","review":"We received this diaper pail as a shower gift and absolutely LOVE it. The system is SO easy to use, and, unlike what some reviewers say, can be done one-handed. We use about 10 diapers a day for our 3 month old daughter and have to empty the pail about once a week (usually on trash day!). It is a cinch to empty - when the last one is dropped in, turn the knob several times, push the cut button and turn several more times. Then, just open the bottom of the pail and pull out the \\"string\\" of individually wrapped diapers. To start a new string all you have to do is tie a knot and you are ready to go! Since we have brought our daughter home, we have used 6 of the refills, which costs about $30 total, bringing the monthly cost to around $10 so far. I'm sure it will go up slightly when she starts on solids. We have not had problems with the smell - there isn't any. The little bit of extra money is well worth the ease to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This product was a major dissapointment. As far as masking smell, it was alright. But as far as practicality, the last thing I had time to do was make it work. A trash can with a bag and a lid has been so much easier to clean and maintain. Don't waste your money, just take out the trash. With all of the other purchases necessary I wouldn't even consider it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not convenient","review":"I thought this was a must have for my shower, but now that my baby is 3 months old, I just find it inconvenient. You have to push the little button to open the top, stick your diaper down far enought close the lid and turn 2 times. (Hopefully the diaper was down far enough or you will have to start all over!)You are doing all of this while one hand is on the baby so she doesn't roll off the changing table.I have friends how have the diaper champ and it is so much easier. Drop diaper in, flip handle and you are done. Will be buying one this weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"After about 1 month, the lid quit closing tightly and it no longer twisted. I returned the Diaper Genie and exchanged it for a new one. After 1.5 months, the same thing happened. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Mother of 3","review":"I've had a diaper Genie since I was pregnant with my first son. We had the older style wide mouth genie and it lasted through both my boys. Finally the hinge on the back of the lid broke so we purchased one of the newer models when we had our third child. The hinge on the lid of the new models is totally useless. I've already gone through one of them and the second one is breaking as well. My daughter is 15 months and I'm getting ready to have to purchase my 3rd diaper system since she was born. I'm really disappointed in the new design. The plastic is cheap. I hate to try something new or buy a completely new system when my 3rd and last child is so near the potty training age, but it looks like it will be inevitable that I have to. I don't have a system to recommend over the Genie, but I can't give the genie high reviews either. Keep looking is all I can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the effort","review":"I admit that the Diaper Genie takes getting used to but in the end it is well worth it. If you read the instructions first, you shouldn't have any trouble. The refills last several weeks to a couple of months. We have one for up stairs and downstairs and it has made life very easy. It totally keeps odor out and it also has a safety lid that keeps your little one from opening the lid.sometimes it a bit hard to get a new sausage link started when you've emptied it. It's just a matter of not pushing the diaper in too far and then twisting 2-3 times. I think its an affordable and effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pain in the ***","review":"This diaper pail practically requires a Ph.d. to operate.... press the latch, lift the lid, push the diaper down into the clamps (but not too shallow and not too deep), close the lid, latch, twist the knob two, three, or four times (I haven't figured out which is best). You need two hands to operate it... not good when your 10 month old is practically trying to launch herself off the table. To empty, you have to push the cutter button (not too hard and not too soft) while turning the knob two, three, or four times (again, not sure which is best). Then, sit on the ground, lay the pail on it's side, pull out the sausages, knot them up.... then stand back up, open the lid AGAIN, tie a new knot....and start all over. Personally I have other things in my life to worry about that having to read a MANUAL to operate a diaper pail. Do yourself a favor and get the Diaper Dekor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not handle twins","review":"We had received a diaper champ that uses regular trash bags but needed another diaper pail for downstairs and bought a diaper genie.....we ended up throwing it away. With twins boys the diaper genie just could not handle the volume of diapers. Not only that but it was too complicated for my technically challenged mother-in-law so I'd come home to diapers sitting on the bathroom counter because she couldn't figure out how to throw them away (even after a demonstration). Neither my husband or I wanted to empty it because it was quite a process compared to the Diaper champ. We ended up buying another diaper champ it uses regular trash bags so no running out of refills, and I add a little bit of baking soda in the bottom of every new bag and it controls the odor better than the diaper genie did."},{"rating":"1","title":"good, then bad","review":"I used the Diaper Genie since my son was born. It worked great the first year or so, while he was mainly breastfed, but once he started eating different foods it sucked. At 16 months, the Genie seems to have developed it's own poop smell when it is EMPTY! Even a thorough disinfecting doesn't make a dent in it's stench. We had to throw it away because of the smell, eventhough it is in good working condition. A friend of mine had the stinky smell problem ever since she got it. I would NOT buy another one. I just bought a Safety 1st Neat system because it boasts to be truly odor free. We'll see..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a must have item!","review":"When having our first child I had the impression that this was a MUST have item for the nursery. I would have to say I gave in and bought it and wish I would have spent my money on another item that was needed. I ended up using grocery bags that were in our home already instead of buying expensive refill. Another complaint is that when you start the \\"string of sausage\\" it is rather difficult and doesn't always start off well. I would just suggest putting your money on a better item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, if you like touching dirty diapers....","review":"I thought the diaper genie was a wonderful idea. But I realized later how yucky it really was to use. You need to push (not drop) the diaper through the clamps. Have you ever tried pushing on a full dirty dity? YUCK!! Emptying the bags is no picnic either. It does cut the bag, but you still have to slide the mound of diapers out of the pail, which start untwisting the minute you pull it out. It is just awkward!The product is great at keeping the smell down. The refills also add up after a while.I recently bought the CHAMP and it is a drastic improvement. I use any bag (grocery/trash etc) that I have in the house. I place (not push) the diaper and use the clean handle to rotate it to the bag. I LOVE IT!!

And yet we still could not figure out how to get this thing to work. Out of depseration, we took the genie to the local baby store and after 45 minutes even the staff could not figure this product out.

It's not worth the extra money for the expensive refills, so we've just been plopping diapers in the regular trash can which goes out a few times a week. I have noticed no particular odor since we started doing this. However, once she starts solids, I'm going to get the diaper genie back out and use it again.My other complaint is that the cutting mechanism doesn't work properly.

In addition to having to buy the expensive special \\"film\\" to use with it, you need to have an additional pair of hands to use it. A poopy diaper needs to be stuffed WAY DOWN DEEP inside the thing, after unlocking the latch lid (takes two hands) and stuffing it down (while poop is leaking out) WHO IS HOLDING THE BABY ON THE TABLE? I have to take off the diaper and put it on the floor (still poop leaking sometimes), finish with the baby, put her somewhere safe, then tend to the task of stuffing this thing down and spinning the top thingey. If it is not stuffed down far enough, even after turning the diaper is still in there. My friend has the Diaper Champ and it is much easier to use!!!! I could probably buy it and still save money over having to buy the special film for the Genie over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why???","review":"I can't say I've used any other brand but the Diaper Genie but I really don't get the concept. It was a pain to use even more of a pain to empty and for what? Why not just toss them in the garbage and bring them outside at the end of the day? (or sooner if you have an especially stinky one) The thought of leaving soiled diapers (or any other trash, food, or heigene item)in a semi sealed container in your house for weeks (or longer) is kinda grose??!

The Genie was tried several times throughout the year and each time was stuck back in the closet. I read several reviews and help guides and just couldn't get the thing to work without the bags tearing. It was a lot of work, basically, to get it to function. When I got it to function, it was satisfactory in stopping diaper smell. But it was a ton of trouble to function.In contrast, the Diaper Champ was simple to use and simple to clean. It could be done with 1 hand (so you can hold on to the baby at the same time), whereas the Genie needs 2. It needs to have its bags changed out less often than the Genie because it stops the smell very well.So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store. Save yourself a step and just get the Diaper Champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink, stank, stunk...","review":"When we first started using the diaper genie there was little to no diaper odor from our breast fed baby.

Opening up the lid really lets the funk out.The refills are also too expensive.The cutter is difficult to use and does not cut the bag as easily as suggested.Don't waste your time or money.I think it's more cost effective to use a diaper pail with bags from the grocery store with a stick up or odor disk in the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I work in a baby store and work with this product a lot.

The replacement diaper genie that we bought has not worked properly since we got it. Sometimes it twists the diaper and other times you have to open the lid and manually twist the diaper. If you use the cutter it gets stuck in the down position no matter how many times you try to unlock it and cuts holes in the plastic when you try to twist the diaper. It does not hold that many diapers and there is still a faint smell of baby poop in the air. Maybe because the cutter keeps cutting into the plastic. For something that is suppose to be so easy to use it sure is frustrating. Now I know why I see a ton of them in the consignment stores.

And, PLAYTEX, if you are reading this, take the Genie off the market until it is truly \\"new and improved\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a 9 month old","review":"I hate my \\"new and improved\\" Diaper Genie, I wish I never bought it. We thought we should get some kind of diaper disposal system for our new son but boy am I sorry we got this one. Sometimes the \\"neat little sausages\\" come undone and you end up with one great big bag of stinky diapers. We didn't use the darn Genie long enough to merit getting the Stage Two refills becuase we found that most of the diapers (pee only) can go straight in the regular trash and the poopy one's go in the regular trash fine if they're put in their own bag first. There are a lot of little disposable make-your-own poop bags out now. We empty the house trash once a day so odor is not a problem. (We don't create tons of trash, we just use a small bag for the house take it out often)My advice, save the money you were gonna use on any kind of diaper pail and buy more diapers! They use 'em up fast!Aloha!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself the frustration, smell and filthy hands.....go with Neat","review":"As a new mom, I bought this and have regretted it daily ever since. I am ashamed to say I decided to put up with it for the last year and half. Besides being nasty to use (you have to push the dirty diaper down into the thing and all kinds if icky things seep out on your hands) once you move to stage 2 it does very little to prevent the dirty diaper smell. I now only use it for wet diapers when absolutely necessary. The rest go right out to the trash. I suggest you look at the Neat Diaper Disposal unit before wasting your money on this. Neat is no muss, no fuss."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a better buggy whip","review":"This is a fine product. But it's also a silly one. Once upon a time, the Diaper Genie's approach was the best idea out there -- a better mousetrap, no question. But the Diaper Champ is simply a better design...because it's simpler.The basics have been brought in several reviews here: diapers stink, you can't change that. These devices are just ways to store and eventually throw them out with minimal odor. Both devices do a decent job of that. But the Diaper Genie requires expensive, proprietary refills to do so.Simple is better. Get a Diaper Champ: any bag works & the flip-lever design is really really easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nursery still smells like poo...","review":"I have not used any other diaper pails so I am no expert on this. I am used to the operation of Diaper Genie and do not find it that difficult to use \\"butt\\" I don't think this pail contains the smell really well. Before Katie was born I bought a plug in wall freshener unit in a pretty rose smell and her room always smelled so nice. Now it smells like a diaper and she only makes #2 every other day and I empty the Genie at least one a week. I am thinking of trying the level 2 refills before I buy a whole different unit though so maybe that will help. Wiping the Genie out with disinfecting wipes and spraying with Lysol helps a little. I can change a poopie diaper like a pro but everytime I empty out the \\"strand of pearls\\" I gag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad","review":"Difficult to use: you have to bend down to operate this machinery while your baby is wiggling on the changing table. Emptying it requiers two people (one holds the genie, another garbage bag under it) and PHD. My mother in law who is babysitting my daughter still can't learn to do it. And to add to all its good features, after 7 months of use, its lid broke off. That's it. I'm buying DiaperChamp."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this thing!","review":"Well, I put it on my registry and got it, and I wish I didn't! The handle does not twist the bag, so it DOESN'T lock in the smell. It just doesn't twist. It doesn't cut through the bags, you have to use scissors to do it. The refills are really expensive. And it doesn't have a foot peddle for no hands disposing. My son's room always smells like you know what. And it doesn't hold a lot of diapers. I feel like I'm constantly emptying it, which isn't the simplest procedure. I down right hate it, don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This STINKS!","review":"The genie works great prior to a baby eating solid foods. Shortly thereafter the pail really starts to stink. My daughter is 13 months old and I have already thrown out 2 genies. Find an alternative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"complicated and expensive refills","review":"I found that it was more trouble than it was worth to set up the Diaper Genie and do the refills. A garbage can with a tight lid works great and the garbage bags are way cheaper than the diaper genie refills. I change the garbage bag every day anyway and haven't had problems with odor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"Yes, I agree, dirty diapers stink. However, this product is no magical genie that eradicates the unpleasant odors of a diaper overflowing with poo. In fact, the diaper genie is more trouble than what it's worth. Refilling the liner is always a pain. I never knew a surefire way to tell me the genie was full and would always seem to overfill it, thus allowing for more stink to penetrate the babies room...then, once your child reaches the toddler stage, there becomes the natural curiosity to see what the genie is all about.There are other ways to dispose of poo-filled diapers. What did man do before the diaper genie? I'm sure there were ways. With all the plastic grocery bags cluttering up our kitchen, we decided to double wrap each poo-filled diaper with 2 plastic bags and toss in the trash...it works, and we were able to throw out another senseless item from our over-crowded house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not even wait for baby's birth ...","review":"I got this for my shower as I thought it was the best out there (from now on I'll take more time to read reviews PRIOR to registering or buying!) and when I started putting baby's room together, I set up the New and Improved Diaper Genie... Well putting it together is not that difficult - just read directions... But mine never sealed the bags like sausage links, the way it's supposed to do. I placed a diaper will a little water on it (just like a newborn's one would be) and never got the hang of the stupid twist twice and click cut...It sounds simple enough, but it never worked...The plastic was torn here and there, but was never twisted together - if it was real pee or poo in that diaper the bedroom would smell like hell by now...So off I go to BabiesRUs to exchange ot for a Diaper Champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I found it to be complicated to use (as did my husband).

I should have returned it and listened..."},{"rating":"1","title":"EWWW","review":"As a first time mom, I thought I needed everything, well this is one item you can do without. First off the refills are to expensive for plastic bags, with a little baby powder smell to it. Second, it doesn't cut throw the bag, half the time I would have to use a knife, you can't really turn it and when you can turn it, well it just doesn't cut. Last, THE SMELL DOES NOT COME OUT!!!!, I tried everything, and it has this lasting smell of well you know. I found that just empting the trash everyday keeps the smell out. I would not recomend this Item to any one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still smells","review":"I use this product, and when you open it to put another diaper in it, it smells real bad. Then it takes a few minutes for the smell to go away. It is not very pleasant when you have to change and empty all of the old diapers. The smell does not seam to leave the genie, even after you empty it. Plastic holds smells and germs, don't waste you money on this product, just buy some little bags and dispose of the diapers in a garbage can. I think someone needs to try making this product out of metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE!!!","review":"This thing is horrible! The bag tears and is difficult to put it in. It does a bit to help the smell, but it doesn't eliminate it like it claims. A big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I found this to be a huge waste of money. The bags were difficult to put in and the larger the diapers the harder to twist them in the pail. The worst part was the odor. It smelled disgusting no matter what I did to eliminate it. I finally threw it away and for my newest baby I bought a Diaper Champ which I love and find to be a cheaper, better option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought the diaper genie for my twins and used it for 3 months. My biggest complaint is, that it is hard to open (you often need two hands) and it is incredibly loud. You have to shove the diaper down and the bags really crinkle loudly, then you close the lid, which is heavy and if you are not careful will slam down. Then you turn the dial, which makes loud clicking sounds. My babies startle every single time. I just purchased the Decor plus diaper pail - so much better. It uses a similar cartridge system for the bags AND you can get them biodegradable now, so if you are using biodegradable diapers it makes all the more sense. Plus, once you are done with diapers, you can use this as a regular trash can, whereas the genie becomes useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Champ is better","review":"We had this product less than a year before we switched to the diaper champ. It was fine at first before we fed our baby to solids. The smell would leak out. We clean the diaper genie every week. Maybe the reason the smell was quite strong was becuase we just use it for the BM diapers and regulars trash can for the other diapers that way we would not have to constanly buy refills.It's not a bad prouduct, I suggest emptying it out daily. I would strongly reccommend buying the diaper champ keeps out the smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget it","review":"Okay - the positive is that the customer service is great. My first one was broken and they immed. sent me a new one.Bad news is the product isn't worth it. The cutter doesn't really work and I hated changing it so much that I only used it for poop diapers. Well after 5 months it stunk anyway. I say use those little blue powdery diaper bags you can get a Walmart, BabiesRUs or wherever. This is a piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"The diaper genie stinks, literally. There is nothing new or improved about it, it's as bad as the original. The only ways to prevent this thing from stinking up your house is to only put wet diapers in it and take the poopy diapers into an outdoor trash can, invest in a case-load of Ozium because you'll have to spray it every time you open the pail to put in another diaper, or tie each diaper in a plastic grocery bag BEFORE you put it into the diaper genie. Plus you have to buy the 'special' bags for it that don't work either.Don't waste your time or money on this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"We hate the diaper genie - what a waste of money. Besides the stink problem, the bags are very expensive. My biggest complaint of all -- refilling the new bags.

I think we're done with the diaper genie....."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Have 2 Words For You...Diaper Champ","review":"RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY....There are only 2 reasons to buy the diaper genie...you like the smell of poo or you like wasting money for refills.As a nanny I dislike the Diaper Genie and I always will. Every home I have ever worked in has had this stinky, hard to use, smelly device. The only way I can see a parent liking it is if they change the bag after every use or have nanny who changes it so the parents don't know it stinks.When I was pregnant, instead of following the flock, I did my research. I went with the Diaper Champ. You use your own bags, it is as easy as throwing it into a regular trash can, and no smell!I cannot say enough good things about Diaper Champ.But don't take my word for it, do your research:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very improved!","review":"I got the diaper genie because my friend had one and really liked it.

Not only was the refill extremely difficult to install- and very pricey-the lid broke off of its hinges in a matter of days. Also, the plastic protector piece broke off the inside of the lid exposing a sharp razor on the inside of the lid, which of course my son found and cut his finger on. This is a terrible product and we were very dissapointed. It did not stand up to normal everyday wear and tear. I am going to go out and buy a diaper champ today. It can't be any worse! I would absolutely advise against buying this product. It is not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly over rated product","review":"This product has been difficult to use from day one. The Diaper Genie was hard to work every time we tried to cut the bag to dispose of the diapers. I also thought the bagging system was really wasteful and another extra expense.

We are getting ready to purchase the diaper champ I sure hope it works better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck - do not buy","review":"I have a two year old son and I used the diaper genie and I could not get the smell to go away even after I cleaned it.

Do you know how many diapers a baby goes through between the time this thing breaks and the time a replacement part arrives? We didn't even do anything to hurt the ring, sometimes if you just open the unit too roughly it will shear the edges and then it won't fit back in the top.

I've heard rumors that it was butchered in the editing room and studio people toyed with it. I believe it. It seems like there was more there than the final product we got to see. James Marsden stars as a kid who's family moves to Cradle Bay. He soon realizes the good students at school, called the Blue Ribbons, are not what they seem. Think of it as \\"The Stepford Students\\". The cast is all pretty decent, especially Nick Stahl. James Marsden is too much of a jock to feel that he would be much of an outsider. It's always nice to see Bill Sadler too. But, if all else fails, there's Katie Holmes. Sweet, lovely, adorable Katie. Bestill my beating heart. Sorry. Where was I?. This is an okay film that doesn't exactly make you think you wasted your time. It could of been so much better. There was so much promise to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A laughing stock.","review":"Disturbing Behavior is pretty much awful. The plot has promise, but is brought down by downright horrible acting (most notably from Katie Holmes, who provides nothing more than something to look at in this film), and pitiful dialogue.The one saving grace of the movie is Nick Stahl who plays Gavin. He portrays two different roles very well, switching from one to the other halfway through the film. Other than his performance, everything else about Disturbing Behavior is laughable. Need I even mention the ending, which is so dull it makes Al Gore seem like Jim Carrey. This film might please teenagers eager to catch a flick about other teenagers, and maybe catch a glimpse of partial nudity.But I would not recommend this film to anybody else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"This is a good movie, I really enjoyed the concept.

This time, it's been cleverly reworked for the WB set, and it often succeeds in being downright creepy, especially in a genuinely unnerving scene which takes place inside a mental asylum. Especially noteworthy is the film's take on \\"The Pied Piper of Hemmelein\\". Not quite as frightening as the third filmed version of this story, \\"Body Snatchers\\", but not a bad remake at all. In fact, all four film versions have been surprisingly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining movie","review":"I thought that this was a good movie that relied more on suspense than on gore- even though there was some of that to in the film. I always wondered what made teenagers act the way they do and now I know- they have a mind control chip planted in their eyes! This film was an entertaining joyride with a surprise ending. I would have given this movie only 3 stars but Katie Holmes' performance added another star. I recommended this movie for anyone who wants to see what can happen when good kids go bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly disturbing","review":"After seeing the trailer for Disturbing Behavior, I was really looking forward to seeing it. Even though I work in a movie theater and had the advantage of seeing it for free, I was disturbed and disappointed by this so-called horror film. Despite the fact that the acting was good, and it starred the very easy-on-the-eyes Katie Holmes, I thought this 80-minute opus left a lot to be desired. There were a few parts where I wondered what was going to happen, but I think the filmmakers could have done a lot more with the intriguing story line. If you're a fan of Katie Holmes, or cheesy horror movies, then go rent it. Otherwise, stick to the Scream franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Waste of Money!","review":"This movie was B-O-R-I-N-G!Don't get me wrong, I think Katie Holmes is DA BOMB but seeing her in this movie was well, disturbing!

It held my interest (to a degree) for just about an hour, but after that my attention faded almost completely. This film was unoriginal and the plot was weak and quite vague. I can't say that the acting was poor, it was okay. This movie wasn't completely bad, but it was below average though. The most impressive thing about Disturbing Behavior was the opening scene with the night sky.

NO CGI or special effects, this is acting driven... but off the cliff, its sudden appearance in 1998 as a shelf space filler does not do it any more credit now.

But, the 1970's movie was more interesting, and more scary than this flick.

I was really disappointed with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie far surpasses it \\"teen horror\\" counterparts","review":"Disturbing behavior, is an amazing flick with one flaw, it did not get enough publicity.

It was completly and utterly dumb. The acting wasn't great, and the characters were too dumb to care about. It's basically just a bad version of a much better movie of this sort, \\"The Faculty\\". If you want to see a movie about a bunch of brain washed teens, rent \\"The Faculty\\" instead. Skip this one. The two good things about it were the musical score, and the last few minutes of the movie, which were creepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKED!!!!!!","review":"When I saw the commercials for it, I really wanted to see it because Katie Holmes:) was in it. But it sucked. It was boring. The only creepy part it had was when they were in the nut house and they ran into the room with the guy flossing his teeth. There was blood every where. It was disgusting. But enough with these stupid horror films with all this blood. Blood isn't scary anymore. Grow up. If you want to see a real horror film, amd be creaped out, see THE SHINING.

I mean, where do they come up with this stuff? Plot holes you could drive a mack truck through, really bad acting (That's an understatement), and a really terrible ending all combine to make this the movie that you should all miss. I didn't even pay to see it in the theatre, and I STILL felt ripped off- I can never have those two hours of my life back. Spare yourself the exposure to this drivel and buy something that's worth your hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Marsden-Disturbingly Awsome","review":"James Marsden did an outstanding job in playing Steve Clark as a detached and aloof outsider. He is the most talented and versatile actor in the history of Hollywood, besides being of course so alluring, appealing, breathtaking ...Since so many scenes were deleted from the VHS version, it is sometimes hard to follow the transitions in between scenes. The dvd version includes all the 11 deleted scenes, which makes it much much better. James Marsden is truly fascinating and outstanding in all of his movies (X-Men, Sugar & Spice, Gossip, Bella Mafia, On the Edge of Innocence, Gone in a Heartbeat, Public Enemies, Second Noah ...) They should release \\"On the Edge of Innocence\\" and \\"Gone in a Heartbeat\\" in vhs and dvd. And look for James in upcoming \\"Interstate 60\\" and \\"X-Men 2\\" and currently in \\"Ally McBeal\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing Behavior","review":"James Marsden is by far my favorite. He is the best of the best. Even Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt cannot compare to him. I am collecting his videos. I wish Hollywood will recognize him as the best. I watched this video five times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak laugh inducing effort","review":"This film is a strange attempt that rips off too many decent horror films to count. Katie Holmes can't be faulted for this turkey, she tries her best. The premise is weak, and the horror is virtually nonexistent. I think maybe it would play out better for a young audience however, all others stay away. The janitor is extremely amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason it's bad.","review":"Contrary to what some people may say, the reason this movie's bad is simply because it's dumber than a doorbell, is extremely dull, and features far better ideas than it deserves. For a better film of this plot, go to the original Stepford Wives. For a better young-adult oriented horror film, go with Dean Koontz's Phantoms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain DISTURBING!","review":"Excuse me, was this really supposed to be scary?! It was just stupid. If there was a scary part in the movie, I must have missed it. If I could have given the movie 0 stars, I would have. Katie Holmes was GREAT.

The beginning looked like a comet-searching science tv-show and you couldn't even see the actors' names! And what did Katie Holmes there? Did she have a some kind of main role? NO!!! She was there only to make the movie a bit more beautiful. I have seen thousands of movies like this. This is an old movie clichee. I have seen many more bad movies which end like this one.

In the book, Gulliver is superior to all of his adventures. He possesses a perspective on the whims and eccentricities of kings in a writing meant as a criticism of all who hold themselves superior. The movie Gulliver enjoys his status at court. His sincere explanations/justifications of England's political practices seem even more ridiculous in the telling than in the reading. What movie Gulliver finally focuses on are the relationships between himself and his wife and son. They remained faithfull to him despite his having abandoned them. The wife's defense for her husband is that Gulliver has harmed no one. The son's providing the critical piece of evidence deflects the prosecution. Gulliver discovers that everything that he left home to find was already there. The book Gulliver remains aloof from everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unnecessarily Long","review":"I would have rated this 5 stars, but it was made unnecessarily long by the introduction of an \\"insanity\\" plot which detracted from the story and was never part of the book. Good special effects, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original story was changed","review":"The pro-Socialist propaganda in the movie ruined it for me.The film is loaded with Liberal White Guilt and I noticed this especially when Gulliver visits the one kingdom where they have a Black Queen and most of the citizens there are also Black. They were portrayed as the only group of people who are living the right way and this is highly offensive.I don't think a movie based on an 18th century novel should have modern race propaganda in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sign of What Could Have Been","review":"I had had this DVD of Gullivers Travels for a couple of years and finally got around to watching it and I was really, really disappointed. Why on Earth did they have two plots running thru it . A couldn't tell what part of the story I was watching half of the time. And I'm really not a stupid man. It was a great beautiful production. Wonderful cast. I have seen films that weren;t as half richly produced as this one. But the story kept going 'in & out' of realty & fantasy too much. I had to go back to scenes to 'try to understand the damn thing. Ted Danson was a perfect Choice to play Gullever, but it should have been played straight as the original \\"Gullivers Travels\\" was written by Jonathen Swift wrote it.

It was originally shown in full screen. It's completely possible that the director didn't even authorize this change. The composition of the scenes is [messed] up by this, as tops of heads push the top black bar throughout. Also, there is no feature to watch the movie from beginning to end. The DVD producers were so incompetent that they put a break in between the first part and second instead of combining them. Oh, and they also make you sit through opening credits on the second part. How stupid is that? How about actually using the space which DVD affords you and put the whole thing as 1 movie, instead of part 1 and part 2? The only reason it was split into two was because it was shown on two different nights. But it is *one* movie. There is a nice \\"making of\\", but for all the reasons I've listed, I can't recommend this DVD. Stick with the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"great acting, different perspective of Dr. Gulliver","review":"When I was little I read Gulliver's travels, I guess because I was so young I didn't realized about all the situation and how troubled Dr. Gulliver was.

It is a good story and I like how the author details the events of the expedition. I was disappointed at the romance of the story. The characters were not detailed very much and the romance between them was lacking in details both physically and mentally. The book did not describe any passion between the two main characters. What little bit of description of their relationship was very weak. One of the main characters was heterosexual and was attracted to and fell in love with a woman so I would think there could have been more details of their physical contact and relationship.

Many products including those bought from your local big-box retailer, use cheap hardware and the metal is softer than it should be.

It is a chronology of a young man as he proceeds through four years of medical school and four more years of post-graduate training in Internal Medicine. The hectic, often chaotic, life these eight years encompass is described in vivid (some might think too vivid) detail and with a mixture of dark and light humor, sex and pathos. Many interesting characters, probably drawn from real-life, pop in and out of the pages, which can be read briskly with a chuckle and occasionally a tear. The book begins in a cynical tone and ends with a strong sense of hope and humanism. This transformation faithfully reproduces the actual experience of physicians-to-be and those moving thru the often-grueling life of post-graduate training. Altogether, I found this to be a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable book.

So I have to be a little more careful now instead of just pulling my camera out to take a quick photo.Also, I thought I could just use the cap, take a picture of the subject like the real picture, then use that photo as the white-balance source image. But NO... You need to remember that if you do this, that any subject item that is colored will affect the white balance.

The success of movies of this \\"evil matriarch\\" ilk seems to depend upon evoking a feeling of hatred for the mother figure and, eventually, the urge to strangle Jessica Lange is almost irrepressible, but it all takes too long to happen.

The script - about a jealous horse-breeder who intends to kill her daughter-in-law after she gives birth to a grandchild - is clearly a hack job: you'd have to be stupid not to see Lange's character as a one-dimensional tyrannical witch after her first scene. Let's just say, the director doesn't exactly expend much effort (or much talent, if he has any) to transform this material. There's no pacing, suspense, humor, or narrative drive here - just one dull rote scene after another. One of the worst movies of 1998."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"A predictable narrative and soap-opera-quality encouneters dominate this drama of familial jealousy and intrigue.

Jessica Lange (in a campy Blanche DuBois-meets-Baby Jane performance that is not to be believed) plays the psycho mother from hell who slowly begins to terrorize her son's emotionally fragile wife. As the pretty young young thing in question, Gwyneth Paltrow gives her latest one-note performance, but at least here she's terrorized for a good 90 minuites as punishment. Oedipal overtones notwithstanding, the plot (such as it is) is full of holes you could drive a Haddad's truck through, and large portions of the story seem to have mysteriously disappeared. But if bad cinema is your guilty pleasure, you won't care; pick this up and prepare to howl yourself into oblivion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wannabe that Never Makes It There","review":"This movie is a wannabe. It wants to be a shocking, spine-tingling thriller...instead it stops at just plain shocking -- how could Gwynnie and Jessie make such a horrid movie together!!??The plot could've been well-done, but it goes in a completely unbelievable direction before the first act ends. The beginning is o.k., the middle flounders terribly and the end is just sheer torture. What were these people thinking?After seeing it on HBO, I was so glad I never spent money to see it. I *almost* rented in on Pay-Per-View and before that I *really almost* saw it in the theater. I'm so glad I saved that seven bucks!!And it's a shame because the trailers for this film made it look *so* good.

The payoff at the end is a huge disappointment. Jessica Lange tries hard to bring the material up to her level but the script does her in. Gwyneth Paltrow is unbelievably bad. But I think this is not their fault. The screenplay and direction could have been better. This could have been a very good movie along the lines of \\"Misery\\" or \\"Fatal Attraction\\" but it fails in every department. As I said, the payoff at the end is a real disappointment.

Anna Comnena, daughter of the Emperor Alexius I, recalls in her old age the days of her father. Surely she is biased, but we can factor out the bias. She is also a surprisingly literary woman, more often quoting Homer than the Bible (though she quotes both, and her everyday language must have been much like the Greek of her quotations, by then 1000 to 2000 years old). She's also a great character. (She apparently tried to have her brother, the heir apparent, assassinated---well, where does one think the term \\"Byzantine\\" came from?)

It tells about a zillion little stories, some parallel, some crossing. All along, you feel the craftmanship of the author, in designing the characters and giving them depth and interest.Still, to me it was too post-modern to be considered a real sweeping read. If you're into a bit of experimental literature but won't give up concepts like narrative and characters, Perec is the author for you and this book (preferably in the original French) a good selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen Elizabeth's coronation","review":"I was very disappointed in the quality of this film.

There's a lot of tension between the characters and you find yourself constantly changing your mind about who you think the killer is (and I'm pretty good at this stuff).

With the world on the brink of disaster, the USS Alabama sets sail, patrolling Russian waters with enough nuclear firepower to start World War III. As the crisis escalates, the unthinkable occurs: the Alabama is given an order to launch its nuclear missles. In the resulting chaos, two dedicated naval officers--the Alabama's seasoned commander, Captain Frank Ramsey, and his brilliant executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter--clash over the validity of their orders and vie for control of the sub. This movie has everything you could want from an action thriller and a few other things you usually can't hope to expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denzel + Hackman + a submarine","review":"Does it get any better than this? Two of the finest actors of our age in a white-knuckle, bruised-forearm thinkfest!Any film that can bring the world to the edge of nuclear holocaust, present a mutiny on an SSBN, and still take time to discuss a) Lipizzaner horses, their origins and color; b) Von Clausewitz' view of war; and c) which Silver Surfer was the best, must be seen.The mutiny aspect is particularly well-played.You want subtlety in a naval movie? Watch The Caine Mutiny.This film is rock-'em, sock-'em, far-from-subtle Tony Scott filmmaking at its best. Script sweetening by Robert Towne and Quentin Tarantino only increase the movie's importance.The \\"unrated, extended\\" parts are merely snippets here and there that add something but change nothing of the theatrical release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great soundtrack, insult to submarine veterans everywhere.","review":"I can understand the inaccuracies on the technical side, and the dramatised story.

Their sub receives a garbled and incomplete order to launch nuclear missles with the crew taking sides for commander Hackman and executive officer Washington, which results in mutiny. Cat-and-mouse manuevers with a Russian sub, several tense moments among the USS Alabama's crew and highly-charged animosity between Hackman and Washington make this film a rewarding experience.

With fine talent like Hackman and Washington (not to mention the intriguing quality of Hackman's character) and an initial plot premise loaded with potential, this could have been a top-notch drama along the lines of but much better than Seven Days in May or The Bedford Incident. Instead the writers developed a plot so attenuated in its relationship to reality (no boomer sailor can sit through this film without feeling the urgent need to howl bulls--- with ever increasing frequency as it \\"progresses\\") that all you're left with is a very low grade 'B' adolescent shoot 'em up picture. What a shame.

This movie is a prime example of that. The captain vs soldier confrontaion cliche has been done many times before - and better too. Hackman vs Washington is a pale imitation of the terrific Gable vs Lancaster confrontation of \\"Run Silent Run Deep\\". I was extremely offended by a scene in the movie which depicts Hackman letting his dog urinate on the sub. Perhaps, the director thought this would add drama to the movie, and add further shades of arrogance to Hackman's character. Instead, it exposes the movie for what it is: a hyped-up farce which fritters away a believable and extremely significant movie premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Training Day","review":"This movie was the training ground for Denzel Washington's \\"Training Day\\". He breaks away from \\"Pelican Brief\\" (calm, cool, collected but fast acting) and bares his emotional side -- to great effect. Gene Hackman does equally well, but that can be expected from an excellent seasoned professional.

Gene Hackman, as always shows again that he can fit into any role with seamless precision and kick out a top performance. In a crisis situation, involving a coup d'etar in Russia, a nuclear threat looms over continental United States.How the Captain (Hackman) and the Executive Officer (Washington) of a powerful US Nuclear Sub deal with the crisis at hand in addition to their own little misunderstandings is shot impressively with Tony Scott's inimitable direction.The theme of a Captain and First Officer, coming from two different schools of thought in a crisis situation isn't exactly original, however Crimson Tide contextualizes it in a very modern and realistic scenario."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Acting","review":"I have watched this movie several times. I feel the movie is veryentertaining and thought provoking. Many ex-servicemen have pointedout the movies inaccuracies, \\"I concur sir\\".

I would order it in blu-ray if that would solve the problem, but I don't want to spend another $8 and have the same result. It didn't give any option for full screen, so I guess I'm stuck with it.

But it's the same old story--a trigger-happy, mentally unstable skipper (Gene Hackman) and a loyal, level-headed, sensible executive officer who takes a lot of guff and abuse from the boss man without turning the least bit mean himself. Glenn Ford and Ernie Borgnine played those roles in Torpedo Run and Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster did it too. As did countless others for that matter. There's the usual disasters on board, menacing torpedos being shot at them from an enemy sub, the treat of nuclear war, a mutiny, guys smoking like chimneys--how do they get away with smoking on a nuclear submarine anyhow? But it's great entertainment and I'll view this little beauty at least once a year probably. Hackman's facial expressions are wonderful! Watch how he turns instantly from a grinning, apparently congenial chuckle to a sinister glare. I'd have given him an academy award for this performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLENTY OF MACHO ACTION","review":"Great action and suspense is delivered under the water here. Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman play the antongonists in this thriller about two suberine comanders who square off aginsant one another over the apparent attention to do some unautorized damage to the enemy. Tension soon follows when the crew attempts to take matters in their own hands. This film is sort of reminds me Of the classic film RUN SILENT RUN DEEP with the same storyline. Chracters may be somewhat flawed in this film but it still remain highly enjoyable throught."},{"rating":"2","title":"Randomly Good","review":"I can't quite make sense of this CD, as the song selections are random and unfocused, making for a confused piece of work.

I thoroughly enjoyed this look at army life in the great Roman army stationed in Germany, corruption, graft and incompetence included; I liked the view of what civilian life was like in both Germanies (Romanized and free), with all that implied to how the every day person lived. The subplots were amusing. The relationship between Marcus and Helena continues to develop.

Teri Hein clearly loves the land on which she was raised. The personal stories she tells, as well as the extensive research she seems to have conducted into the region's history, do show as much.But the information is jumbled and formless. The book has no shape; the chapters tumble along, one after the other, with no apparent thought to how they're ordered.We're subjected to pages and pages of the Chief Qualchan story and other historical information, and then even more pages and pages of mildly cute stories about Hein's childhood, and there's not enough language or skill present here to tie it all together to make an interesting whole.A really good editor and a lot of rewriting might have made this an actual book.

It gently guides you to competency as you alternate between reading the book with watery hands and grappling with your increasingly less burdomsome rig. The book's attention to details helps develop your competence/confidence. As you become more advanced, necessary details, unfortunately, become smeared together driving you for outside help. The humor is fantastic and helps bolt the ideas into your mind so that under the pressure of angry winds and slap happy seas, you can automatically think of those necessary passages."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book for learning beginner and intermediate sailing","review":"this book is easy to understand, and has lots of good pictures"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"this review is just based on my personal opinions and preferences.1.no paints included, it's just a pale car...

THE LIFE OF CHESTY PULLER","review":"This is a really good book on Chesty's life. Sure glad it was available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read for all Marines","review":"I had heard all the stories when I was in the Corps about Chesty Puller, winner of the Navy Cross 5 times, but knew little else. I saw this book and read it in one night. It was an interesting read about a man who went from a Private to a General Officer.It dealt with his years fighting the \\"Banana Wars\\" in the Caribbean and Central America and dealt heavily with his actions during the Second World War. I have met veterans who served under Puller who were divided on him. But there is no doubt of the impact he has had on the Corps.If you are a Marine or are no longer on active duty, read this book as a primer. Read his son's book, Fortunate Son and Eugene Sledge's With the Old Breed. They both will give you an insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great account of a Great Leader!!","review":"I heartily recommend this book as required reading for anyone who has leadership ambitions. Chesty was revered and admired by those who served under him. He was not always in favor with those whom he served under, due to the fact that he sometimes upstaged them with his service and performance. Not being politically correct cost him personally, but as was pointed out clearly in the book, he cared more for his men.Although this book is somewhat dated, the author appears to have gotten many details from those who served with, and knew Chesty Puller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly readable","review":"This isn't just a biography of Chesty Puller, it's also a wonderful overview of those campaigns from the 20s to the 50s. Being a biography ties everything together and keeps you engaged in the story. If you want the basic layout of the Marine involvement in Haiti, the pacific campaign of WWII, the landing at Inchon, and Chosin reservoir, you will probably be able to read this book much faster than any dry history on those subjects. The other reviews already say enough about this book as a biography of this fascinating man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for someone interested in military.","review":"As a United States Marine myself I am honored to have served in the same service as Lt General Lewis Puller. Reading this book will give you an appreciation of the hardships Marines endured in the wars. Chesty Puller was an exceptional Marine, he led by example. The book examines his 37 years in the Corps. It goes into great detail and the author definitely used many resources to put this together. It's a must read.

It is not a deptiction of real life but what real life can be. I feel sory for the person who did not enjoy it because it did not show acurately the life of a person with ALS. This is a movie that can give someone with ALS wings. I got this idea by reading the coments from the widow of a someone who watched the movie with her late husband who had ALS and died from it. I believe her opinion is the only one that counts. But remember, this is a movie not a documentary. If you are going to pick on it for lack of acuracy than have at for a mountain of other movies who share its lack of acuracy, why stop with this one. There are some movies that show the beauty and the power of friendship, it transends the necsesity for real life acuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"damn good movie","review":"this is a very good movie. if you like Helena Bonham Carter, you will see her at her best in a difficult role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to PALS","review":"The premise of the story trivializes the struggle for a meaningful existance that people diagnosed with this awful disease go through.

Someone should have spent more time in research before making this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching, compassionate story.","review":"Based on a true story of a young woman dying of ALS and a man whose personal & professional life is falling apart. This is an excellent film with two very good performances by veteran actors Kenneth Branaugh and Helena Bonham-Carter.

While it is sad I also found it very uplifting and quite humorous at times. It gives you hope that anyone can pursue a dream and love truly conquers all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"This is a delightful little book to brouse and enjoy.

We could see how to sew it back on, but we were going to wait until my mom, a seamstress, could look at it on their visit (so hopefully the full range of motion would be there). Well, so, the armless Angelina was played with. Today, however, something dangerous occured. The tail of the doll has a wire insert to make it pliable and posable. The wire had broken (we didn't know it) and poked through the fabric and into my daughter's hand.Long story short, get the book, skip the dangerous toy! She's seven- and very careful.

For whatever reason the title slipped my mind. When I was browsing at the book store I came across it again. I'm so glad I did.The emotions in this book are so raw and intense. I loved every second of it. Nine was merely a girl with little experience in the love department who was taken advantage of by an older man. As she begins seeking revenge, she gets a bit...immature and crazy. She's a very intelligent 18 year old, but we all know love can make a person crazy.I can't believe it's taken me this long to pick up this book.

It features 80 duotone (black and white) photographs by Isabel Munoz of dancers in various stages of tango. On the facing pages there are lyrics of popular tango songs, displayed like poetry, in both Spanish and English. A short story by French author Evelyne Pieiller prefaces and introduces us to the photographs and lyrics. Many of the photographs are erotic, and some are semi-nude, so this book may not be to everyone's taste. But \\"Tango\\" beautifully captures the drama and eroticism of this dance that was born of competition in the bordellos of Buenos Aires and has achieved -just enough, but not too much- respectability as it continues to capture the imagination of couples around the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!","review":"I am a fan of both versions of The Hasty Heart.

The honcho who thought of casting Benicio Del Toro and Alicia Silverstone as potential lovers is either a genius or ready for the asylum. Regardless there is palpable chemistry between the two that produces kinetic sparks. A bonus is Christopher Walken as Silverstone's ambiguous Uncle Ray. You didn't really think a mere band of bikers could intimidate the Walkenator, did you? If there's a gripe to made is that the story is kind of thin, trite, and predictable. That said I'm not going to complain about a movie that has the gumption, for the most part to go the beat of its own quirky rhythms. It recalled to me films like \\"Something Wild\\" and \\"True Romance\\" that defied romance film convention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad movie. Bad movie. Bad.","review":"This movie was not only far-fetched and pathetically scripted, Alicia Silverstone's performance was awful. She was in the movie for one purpose: to show the audience that the set was cold. Very cold. (And if anyone doesn't know what I mean by this, watch about 16 seconds of the movie. Remember, only 16 seconds. Longer exposure could cause permanent damage). Bluntly put (as if the rest of this was tactful) Excess Baggage was very, very bad. Granted, that is my opinion.

The poor little rich girl thing is really beginning to wear thin. (I mean, it was over in the 30s, guys!) The movie is just painful to sit through. The comedy is lame, the \\"darkness\\" has been done better before, any good actors are wasted on a nothing script, the action makes no sense, the characters are obnoxious...But why go on. Try it and don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for Love?","review":"Benicio Del Toro is a magnet in this movie, a strong acting force drawing you into that deep, hypnotic voice until you're head over heels in love. There are a handful of male characters that I could easily spend the rest of my life with, and Vincent Roche is one of them. He's a guy that will make you laugh, that you can talk to about anything, that you'd feel safe with, and that you'll lust after as well. Benicio is a leading actor who is too often cast in only supporting roles. Lead the way Benicio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately a sexy romance","review":"People who don't enjoy romance flicks are not going to like this film.

If you just want to listen to the music, you cannot. You are not buying music, you're buying spyware. You cannot listen without installing crap-ware all over your machine.

It covers many different subjects relating to your Yoga practice from introductions to different types of yogic traditions to breathing, meditation, and actual yoga postures and routines. There is a section on Hatha Yoga cleansing techniques and even eye yoga. Swami Janakananda also discusses the chakras and kundalini. The last section really gets into meditation and how yoga can fit into your daily life.Out of all the instructional yoga books I've seen this is by far the best! This is a very comprehensive book and I continually pick it up a read different sections.Swami Janakanada is the founder of the Scandinanvian Yoga and Meditation School and you can read more about him at http://www.scand-yoga.org/english/om/janakananda.html.Swami Janakananda also has a lovely CD out for the practice of Yoga Nidra which I highly recommend. Please see my other reviews on Amazon for more information.

It is a comprehensive introduction to kundalini yoga, and covers basic asanas, pranayama, and various meditation and concentration techniques. It is a very practical book, written in a clear, direct style. Swami J. offers his instruction without necessarily advocating a radical change in lifestyle (e.g., vegetarianism is not required). If I could keep only one yoga book, this would probably be the one. It presents more than enough information and exercises to keep one working for years and years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yoga Primer","review":"Swami Janakananda is a truly fine yoga teacher, devoted to preserving the Tantric traditions of his teacher, Satyananda.

The tossed-salad approach to the vocals is frustrating and irritating. They should have stuck with Augeri on all tracks and maintained a consistent sound and musical profile. The songs are o.k. for the most part. No real standouts and a few clunkers. I listened to this one all the way through only once and haven't gone back but once or twice to sample. Very ill-conceived and mediocre at best. \\"Arrival\\" was superior in every way, too bad it wasn't promoted properly.

I grew up with them. But just because they once were great doesn't mean that they are incapable of doing wrong, just like any other human beings are - especially re-formed version of veteran bands. And I'm sorry, but this new version of the band is a mere shadow of the band I loved and grew up with. The first album with new vocalist Steve Augeri sounded too much like the work of a Journey cover band, with a few decent moments thrown in. This second release with Augeri does not sound like a cover band anymore, but that doesn't mean it's great - and you'd have to be the most self-deceived type of \\"fanboy\\" out there to think it is. It tries too hard to sound relevant and it's just not. It actually embarrases me to listen to this new stuff because it sounds so desparate. I'd much rather listen to Neil Schon's solo work than this - or old, classic, Steve Perry-era Journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as...","review":"First I have to correct something that Michael D. Millum said in his review. Track 4 is not the first one fronted by someone else than Augeri. Deen Castronovo actually sings lead vocals on track 3. And he is GOOD !!! I can understand if someone thinks it's Augeri singing. Cain, Schon and Valory could have passed the singing duties to someone else. They really can't sing. Period. Personally I think tracks 2,3 and 5 are the best.Those songs would fit easily on some other Journey album. The other ones are good too but not quite up there...But it is safe to buy this album without listening to it first.It is Journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Perry, No Journey","review":"They should have changed the name of the band. Steve Perry made journey the success it was. They can hire all the new singers they want, but they will never be as great as Steve Perry. There's just no comparison!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds more like a B-side compilation","review":"I'm not sure what a couple of these glowing reviewers were listening to, but this CD doesn't sound like the Journey I'm used to hearing. The Arrival had some decent tracks intermixed with so-so ones, but this CD is just riddled with bad soundalikes that might as well as be on the 4th CD of a 3-CD box set somewhere. I like Steve Augeri, but there's nothing on here anywhere close to \\"Remember Me,\\" \\"Higher Place\\" or \\"We Will Meet Again\\". Save your money and download the first 4 songs. \\"Better Life\\" is by far the best track... and it's not even Augeri singing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many Lead Vocalists!!","review":"This is a step down from Arrival. That was a true Journey record with a major label backing it up. This one lacks the backing and the band had too much \\"freedom\\" to do as they wanted as far as writing and recording. Some of the songs are pretty good like \\"Faith In The Heartland\\". Others songs could have been good except someone came up with the worst decision to let each member take a turn at lead vocals. Not just a few lines but ENTIRE songs!!! That is the biggest turn off for a listener. I hate it so much! If Steve would have sang all of the songs on this record I think as a whole it would have come off better. It's just all over the place as it stands now. Maybe they should re-release it with Steve Augeri vocals only, not that they will. If you want a good listen check out Soul Sirkus featuring some intense guitar playing from Neil Schon and great vocals from Jeff Scott Soto. Skip the Generations cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst Journey album worse than trial by fire","review":"I was wrong when I wrote my earlier review that Trial By Fire was the worst album of Journey. This one definitely wins hands down. The music is not pleasant to listen to save for a few songs like A Better Life and Never Too Late. Deen Castronovo has quite a good voice for a drummer but Steve Perry he definitely is not. This album was a bit self-indulgent with each band member taking shot at lead vocals. They should realize there is a reason why there is only one lead singer in a band and that is because they can sing. The guys sound great singing backup vocals but when you take the lead you should have a great voice not a so-so voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD !!","review":"This CD proves that Journey just keeps getting better and better. They have proven their talent by having each member sing lead vocals. This band is much better now that Steve Perry is not in the line up. Just listen to NEVER TOO LATE which is now my favorite Journey song of all time. Deen Castronovo's vocals are incredible. He sounds even more like Steve Perry then Steve Augeri!For those Steve Perry fans who can't accept the current Journey line up, GET OVER IT ALREADY! Just listen to this CD and other CD's from the current band to realize just how incredibly talented they are. On their latest tour they played for three hours! It was amazing to hear their songs from the beginning. Keep up the good work Journey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd sucks","review":"journeys new album is the worst ive heard from them in yrs i think its about time they bring back steve perry and record the real journey music fans have loved for yrs this new lead singer steve augeri is a steve perry wannabe it makes me sick to know that the group would release horrible music and label it under journey the should label it trash cause thats where my cd is going. journey fan 4 ever"},{"rating":"1","title":"Journey needs Steve Perry!!!","review":"This could have been a great album, with Steve Perry on the lead vocals, but instead, we have more of a Journey tribute album. This band would be ok, if it were called, The Neil Schon Band. The real Journey started with Infinity, and ended with a Trial By Fire. Look alikes, sound alikes, and name alikes. Neil schon is just dreaming about the glory days of the band, and can't let go of the fact, that it is over, unless, the real Steve is put back in the place he belongs, as the real frontman of this dead band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this generation","review":"This is by far the worst Journey CD. Having multiple vocalists is not a good idea, especially when 3/5 of them are not good singers. There are only four songs I still listen to today. The first two tracks sung by Augeri, \\"Faith In The Heartland\\" and \\"Place In Your Heart\\". Faith in The Heartland has gotten a second life since it was re-recorded with new vocalist Arnel Pineda for the 2008 Revelations disc. The other two decent tracks were both sung by drummer Dean Castronovo, \\"Better Life\\" and \\"Never To Late.\\" The rest of the songs are terrible. I heard that The U.S. government has replaced waterboarding with forcing suspected terrorists to listen to the Ross Valory sung \\"Gone Crazy\\" over and over. I don't know if this is true, but I literally would go crazy after listening to that song more than once. I really like Arrival and Revelations, but my advice is to skip Generations."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just ain't the same","review":"Really great? Better than Arrival? Best since Frontiers? I must have been listening to a different c.d. I could barely get through this. I thought Arrival was pretty good, and I liked it better the more I listened to it. But Generations doesn't sound like Journey is on the upswing. It might be new, but it's not great Journey music. I've been a fan since Steve Perry just joined and I even liked Raised on Radio. I've seem them twice since they re-formed and they put on a great Journey-like show. But as far as creativity, let's be honest: Journey's best music was written by Perry and Cain. Sans Perry, it sounds like Journey, but it lacks the creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Generation","review":"I have listened to this cd and I disagree with many of the reviewers of this cd. I do not think this cd is good. It is not an easy listen because their are too many vocalists. I have been a fan of Journey since I first saw them in 1978 and own all of their cds. This cd will be filed and probably never played again. I saw Journey open up for Def Leppard this year and I was dissappoined by the songs they played on this tour. I would not recommend this cd but if you want to hear Journey at their best check out Infinity or Captured. Another good buy are the two Journey DVDs, \\"Greatest Hits 1978 - 1997\\" and \\"Live In Houston 1981\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journey is now a gig band!","review":"The new Journey is a GOOD gig band. Steve Augeri does a good job covering Steve Perry's vocals and singing the classic songs. But new material is a different story! Steve Augeri does not have the power in his voice to pull off these songs. He does pretty good on some of the ballads, but on the up beat songs, it just sounds like a generic 80's group. This band would have NEVER made it, not even in the 70's or 80's with Steve Augeri. Anyway, dont hesitate to see them live, as a replacement singer Journey couldnt have done better. But there's a big difference between live and making NEW CD's. You need some catchy songs, some airplay, and a SOLID overall CD to gain new fans. Journey could never do that with this singer and these songs, not at any point in history!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the Band..not fans!","review":"This release is obviously for the band's egos not for the fans. Does anyone want to heat Ross, Neal, Jonathon and Dean sing? Think of the Yankees benching Randy Johnson and piching the 1st, 2nd, 3rd baseman and shortstop. The fans are cheated. I'm not paying for that. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleasing","review":"I don't feel like writing a long review right now, so I'll just say this is the best Journey album to come along in a long time. If you are any kind of a Journey fan, this is definitely a worthy add to your collection. Other than a few weaker songs in the middle, this album kicks out some great rockers reminiscent of the band in their prime, as well some good new stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new version!","review":"This new release of this movie has really been improved to enable the Blu-ray technology.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - Cheap Price Because you only get 1/2 the movie","review":"BEWARE No wonder it's so low priced. At aspect ratio 1.33:1 it's only 1/2 the film. While the accuracy of the story line is in question to only see 1/2 is just not right. The film was origionally widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio. I have it in that widescreen and without it, you miss a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst War Movies Ever","review":"The other customers are WAY too kind in their reviews of this turkey. The multitude of inaccuracies and exaggerations in this movie might be forgiven if they weren't further compounded by more drawbacks: wooden, cliched characters (Henry Fonda's); worn-out storylines (James MacAruthur's); corny dialogue . . . For the incredible all-star cast, the acting is, well, OVERacting.I liked this thing as a kid but it's almost unwatchable for me now. It looks even worse compared to more modern productions, especially Saving Priate Ryan.For a far more realistic, gripping, and intelligent film on the Battle of the Bulge, watch the 1949 classic, Battleground. One of the most underrated war films ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action-packed, but lacking historic fact","review":"If you want action, this movie has it. Sherman tanks (M24 Chafees) go up against the mightier German Tigers (M47 Pattons)during the December 1944 Ardennes Offensive. Filmed near Segovia, Spain in March 1965 (Spain was a popular and economic venue for filmakers in the 1960's, until they discovered Yugoslavia), the film lacks the authenticity of Belgian or Luxembourgian terrain. The characters are stereotyped and the script is loaded with cliches. Still, the movie is a decent attempt by director Ken Annakin to surpass THE LONGEST DAY by use of color, spectacular battle sequences, musical soundtrack, and focus on a handful of characters instead of an endless all-star cast. Unfortunately, the full original cut of THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE has yet to become available VHS or DVD. Approximately 20 minutes of the theatrical film is still missing from the re-release of the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray has exclusive commentary","review":"If you're a fan of director Ken Annakin's entertaining-- albeit fact-eschewing-- war epic 'Battle of the Bulge' and looking for a reason to upgrade to HD beyond picture/audio quality (which is impressive), note that the Blu-ray edition features an insightful commentary track by Annakin ('Across the Bridge,' Disney's 'Swiss Family Robinson') and actor James MacArthur (Disney's 'Swiss Family Robinson,' TV's original 'Hawaii Five-O') that doesn't appear on the Warner DVD. And though it may not assuage military-history purists, Annakin does make an effort to explain certain choices that led to some of the film's inauthenticities.

The objects in the front of the screen seem to be presented in an almost 3D effect. The 5.1 dolby audio makes the tanks sound like they are in your house!.Strong dizzying visual effects like the train hauling two howitzers speeding down a mountainside are especially excellent!.The story line in this film detracts some from the real Battle of the Bulge story, but emphasized the way the enemy was defeated by choking off their fuel supply.

I can understand the equipment that had to be used to film this picture, but the dialogue could of been much more based on military reality. I feel that all the sides protrayed in this picture were not done proper justice. They were protrayed as a bunch of amatuers, fighting a war, like hollywood amatuers playing at war.

I was only 13, so I really enjoyed it and still have the booklet that was handed out. However, as an adult, the only thing about this movie I can say is worthwhile MAY be the German military singing by Panzergruppe Pieper. I also still enjoy the cynicism of Pieper's aide-de-camp toward the whole attempt. If you pretend that this has absolutely nothing to do with the actual Battle of the Bulge (because it really doesn't), it can be considered an enjoyable WWII fiction flick. As far as grinding on the producers about not using Tiger tanks, well, we can even complain about Spielberg's Tigers made from T-34 mockups in SPR, can't we? Tanks are hard to do right in a flick. Perhaps Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic will be able to come up with good animations of them for future movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"battle of the bulge","review":"Product came in excellent condition.

With a decent cast, but terrible writing and effects. Usually you can at least say, \\"well the special effects were good\\", but this dreck doesn't even reach the level of 1960's Japanese monster movie quality. The tank battles are laughable with American tanks standing in for German (which is understandable), but WHY didn't they use Shermans to represent Shermans??? It's not like There weren't M4 tanks available in Europe. Others here have already said that sunny Spain is hardly a suitable venue to represent the snow and forests of Belgium.

Although the Germans speak english, the entire cast act superbly and its barely noticeable as your more involved with the script than enything else. For some reason, the fictitious content of the film does not degrade its value for the simple reason that Ken Annikan was not trying to potrait the great 'battle of the bulge' rather he was focusing on the different roles of several characters over the course of one particular battle. youd have to say he did a brilliant job.

Plus some good candid shots of him making the movie and an interview he gives at the end.As for the movie itself, Henry Fonda doesn't get much of a chance to shine, even though he's the main character. Telly Savalas is always a trip. He has the only good role besides Robert Shaw. And the only role with any romance.I'm having trouble playing this movie. It pauses in parts and won't skip to different topics on the main menu. I'm playing it on my computer, so that could be causing those problems. If you're not a big fan of one of the actors, or you're not a war buff, I would say this movie doesn't offer much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good war movie, But:","review":"It is not exactly how it happened. I will let you read some of the other reviews that will give better historic information. But at least Warner had the good sense to restore it to its original length. They had cut out many important scenes from the VHS version that were restored to this DVD. For that reason I gave it 4 stars. There are not many extra features, only two brief featurettes on the making of the film, and a theatrical trailer. If you just want to watch a war movie, make some popcorn and enjoy. If you want a history lesson, watch the History Channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"See a documentary or read a book on the subject","review":"Wide-screen is the only way to see this movie, but you better have a front projector or a really big TV as the 2.76 aspect ratio of this ponderous production will look like a band-aid on your television. Not much good history and the staging is so old fashioned that you may want to just run this film in the background while you do something else. The real Battle of the Bulge is exciting history, but you would not know it from this film. Unless you are older or just like looking at a few older movie stars (that most young people will not recognize), I would check out a good documentary or watch the Bulge episode of BAND OF BROTHERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"a fondly remembered movie from childhood,it doesn't stand the test of time","review":"i loved this one as a kid but now it shows it's age and it really gets the history wrong. part of the problem is that other than robert shaw's part the rest of the movies follows far to many people into far to many subplots and gets lost. the locations used don't show us the real winter conditions that were faced and even at the running time it has it moves far to slow and then just ends quickly. see battleground for a better take on this battle."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Worst Blu-Ray Transfer Ever!\\"","review":"I was really excited to watch this one on Blu-Ray, hoping that it would be a clear and excellent presentation. About 15 minutes into the film, I could see a white haze on both sides of the picture.

But the Germans have other plans. In a desperate attempt to buy time to fill the skys with their invincible new jets, they launch one more fast furious offensive: the Battle of the Bulge.Battle of the Bulge is a great epic war drama to watch on a rainy summer day. Awsome battle scenes with the tanks, awsome cinematography, excellent acting, great actors, like Henry Fonda, Robert Shaw, Robert Ryan, Dana Andrews, James MacArthur, Werner Peters, Charles Bronson, Ty Hardin and Telly Savalas.If Warner Bros. is looking at this review, I have only one favor to ask:Please release the full uncut version of Battle of the Bulge on DVD with the movie trailer and a 'making of featurette'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lump of coal in your stocking...","review":"Big names + poor history + cartoon characters + pathetic dialogue = world war 2 garbage time.

This is Hollywood! Couldn't they have worked their paper mache magic?); Mostly made-up story-line (uh, Elsenborn Ridge, Bastogne etc. weren't exciting enough?); Lame script (Fonda's is the only role that goes beyond two dimensional characterization); Ridiculous ending (Just in case you do decide to get this tape I won't ruin it for you).

In this case, they missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly bad.","review":"You want to learn about the Battle of the Bulge, the largest land battle of WWII, the bloodiest battle in the history of the U.S. Army? Then PLEASE stay away from this pathetic movie.According to same, the battle was primarily a duel between a fictional American intelligence officer played by Henry Fonda -- who figured out all by his lonesome that the attack was coming -- and a half-crazed Nazi tank commander played by Robert Shaw. You do get perfunctory glimpes of the \\"Nuts!\\" incident at Bastogne, the Malmedy Massacre, and Skorzeny's commandos infiltrating in GI uniforms; but mostly we get Fonda, Shaw, and even a ridiculously overplayed \\"humorous\\" subplot involving Telly Savalas as a black-marketeering tank driver.

Such an important chapter in military history deserves, far, far better than this hooey."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst WWII Movies","review":"I agree with all the bad reviews. This is a terrible movie and does not honor those that won this battle. In the 80s I worked for a man that joined Patton's army on Dec 19th and was thrown into this battle and eventually wounded.

I had not seen it since I was a kid; what a shock. I never realized how bad it was. How did they get Fonda, Savalas, and Bronson to sign on to this? Ryan? Lord, the cowboy actor never took his gloves off!! And when he called for \\"Plan A\\", I about fell out of my chair. The artillery train scence was obviously shot in Spain, and didn't have a thing to do with the plot. Regardless of what the producer said about \\"scouring Europe for WWII equipment for the movie\\", they didn't. The tanks are all modern American tanks with German markings. The main tank battle scene was shot in a training area in the USA by the looks of it. There is not an \\"Ardennes\\" tree in sight!! Save your money!!! The only neat thing in the movie was the Panzerlied song. I went to Youtube and downloaded it after watching the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!!","review":"I have three DVD players, one less than three months old and this piece of junk won't play on any of them.

I have hundreds of DVD's and have never had this problem before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottle of the Bilge","review":"While Robert Shaw does a workmanlike job as a Waffen SS Battalion Commander, the writing and other actors are subpar. The historical accuracy of this movie leaves much to be desired although the Germans did desperately need to reach Allied fuel dumps to continue their offensive and this was a focal point of the plot buildup and climax. The special effects are worse than ordinary as the usual American tanks are used (M-48's to represent Tiger tanks) and M-41's to represent Shermans. The budget would not allow for realism. All in all, this movie is bilge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Patton, the 3rd Army, the 101st and 82 Airborne among others","review":"If you buy this to learn about the Battle of the Bulge, forget it?

Yeah, right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical tripe from Hollywood","review":"I recently had the honor to attend a reunion of certain veterans of the Battle of the Bulge. After talking to some of them and actually doing some READING on the subject, I feel insulted to have been charged admission to this one when I saw it as a kid in 1966 or so. Charles Bronson did a decent job of playing an American Major captured by the Germans, but the \\"Fuel Dump\\" scene where \\"Hessler\\", a very loose composite of Jurgen Pieper and certain other German officers, gets roasted by a rolling fuel drum is pure (...), and it misrepresents the scale of the battle. It wasn't just a little shootout over some gas, as the movie would have you believe. Throw in a wooden performance from Henry Fonda and you've got a grade C production from Hollywood. Unfortunately typical, and insulting as hell to the guys who really WERE out east of Bastogne in December of '44."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cast","review":"Henry Fonda, Telly Savalas, Robert Ryan, the list goes on.

From the all star cast to the realism, this is a great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The war that never was","review":"This is one of the silliest war movies that I have ever seen.It's almost pure fiction, and has little or nothing to do with the actual Battle that took place during the Winter of 1944-45.The only thing accurate about the film is that Germany was at war with the United States, and Allied Forces were stalled near Bastogne. After that, the story seems to take off in a direction that has very little to do with what actually took place.Better films would be \\"Battleground\\" with Van Johnson, the \\"Band of Brothers\\" series, or even \\"Kelly's Heroes\\" (which has more to do with the Hammelburg raid, but it's still better than \\"The Battle of the Bulge\\").I would suggest that anyone who has anything good to say about this stupid piece of trash is either financially connected to it or otherwise stands to gain some benefit from promoting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try but no cigar","review":"This true story of very heroic men deserves better. Compaired with other pictures of this same epic battle this one left me with a very cheap, hollow, immitation feeling. Henry Fonda is very believable as an American officer. The american troops are largely portraied as poorly lead bafoons. The german troops are played by actual german actors. Their english is much to good and they lack an authentic feel. The battle scenes leave you with a hollow imatation feeling.John W."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movies screams \\"Re-make!\\"","review":"In a day in which outstanding classics are needlessly being re-made, this is one movie that could truly use one. As a kid I thought it was great, but as I got older, it seemed so silly that a part of this winter battle took place in a desert, the GIs were all dark haired/complected (Spaniards), and the tanks were U.S.Surely someone can take this movie, use the modern techniques for building accuracy and turn out a true picture of the battle?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Contrived to be Believable","review":"Henry Fonda, Robert Shaw and Robert Ryan are the only redeeming values of this loosely fact based story of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944. While the overall story line is somewhat related to the real facts, the plot in this one is difficult to digest when compared to what really happened. What makes this hard to accept is the filming done at what had to be Fort Hood in Texas with all of its wide open spaces totally unlike the forests and mountains where the real battle was fought.The three actors mentioned did their best to salvage this thing with their legendary acting skills, but it was all wasted on the blown apart turret on a Sherman tank where the crew was intact and rushing to save the day.I find it much more believable to watch accounts of warfare replicated on film such as \\"Band of Brothers\\" and \\"The Pacific\\".

Both The Face and The Book of Dreams are a little more elaborate than the three prior books.

This arrangement, though, turns it into a true work of art. It undertakes to replicate the pioneer odyssey, with all its griefs and triumphs, through a subtle alternation within verses of minor and major keys. My one criticism might be that the minor-key \\"And should we die\\" passage is a little strong, with the male voices drowning everything else out.There are some other solid performances on this album.

As a bluetooth mouse, it falls asleep when not used to conserve battery life. That's all well and good if you're away from your computer for hours at a time. When the mouse falls asleep within a minute or less of not being touched though, you have a problem. I'll be doing Photoshop work or browsing the internet or what have you, and I'll go to the mouse, only to have it 'wake up' for a second until it responds. It is very aggravating. There is no support from Logitech on OSX so you can't really get into any of the configuration settings. Even under Windows XP in Bootcamp, I was unable to find a way to turn off this 'sleep mode.'

Okay, I'd give it the benefit of the doubt and say that the music isn't too bad, it's reminiscent of latter-day Cure, but the lyrics are really awful and Murphy replaces his unmistakable vocalistic stylings with monotone flavorless crooning that sounds similar to an inebriated Andrew Eldritch (see Sisters of Mercy).

Mark Pillow WAS one bad actor! I say \\"WAS\\" because the man has not acted in a movie since, and just watching him in Superman IV is reason enough to understand why. Pillow's performance combined with the cheesy special effects, a heavy-handed plot full of holes, and a cast that just seems to be going through the motions helped make Superman IV one of the WORST movies of the '80s.

I loved Superman I and II, Blade, and even X Men, and I rush out to see every new comic book adaptation even if it's gotten bad reviews.I wish I'd stayed home when this one came out, though... The plot, while not awful, is not terribly original. I can cope. It's a comic book movie. I don't demand much in terms of plot. What I can't accept is when a movie is filmed and edited like a series of loosely connected comic book panels, without even the Wonder Woman-style captions to say \\"hey, we did this on pourpose\\". It looks like the director went to the storyboard meetings, then filmed exactly what was on the storyboard panels and not one single frame more.The result is an extremely choppy, disjointed mess, with performances that might as well have been done by the actors' stunt doubles, for all you can see of their personalities.

I agree with the reviewers who would like to see the missing 35 minutes inserted into the film again. The owners of this film should put the footage back and somebody should fix up the FX and put out a special edition box set of the Superman movies. I'd even sit through Superman 3 again if it was in such a box set with quality extras. Superman IV needs to recieve the quality treatment it never got.

The message of peace and the end of nuclear proliferation is both heavy-handed and obvious, qualities which tend to diminish any impact it might have intended.

After leaving the theater I had the distinct feeling that the movie had been cut by about 30 minutes. Of course, a 120 minute film is not that unusual so I suspected that the film was even worse so they had no choice but to cut it up.

But the new Deluxe Edition, released by Warner Bros. on Nov. 28, 2006, is worth a rent: watch it with the audio commentary by co-screenwriter Mark Rosenthal, who is very forthright regarding the production problems this movie faced, that ultimately contributed to its failure. Also interesting to look at are the deleted scenes, if only as a curiosity. Most of them certainly deserved to be cut but there are two or three that aren't too bad. The two deleted scenes involving the \\"first\\" Nuclear Man (who was completely absent from the final cut) are worth a chuckle - or a groan - for the completely cheesy electronic music that plays whenever he's on screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for the \\"Director's Cut\\"...","review":"C'mon folks, where is the rest of this flic?

Although I do have an imagination, and I like all four films, the last installment was done by 'Cannon' films, which in large was the king of the \\"B\\" rated trash of the 1980s... Why on earth Christopher Reeve would allow this to happen is beyond me. Anyway, part 4 is barely 90 minutes long and its overall budget had to be fairly cheap... As for the cast, well, Gene Hackman is a great actor, but in this movie his acting talents are truly wasted. As for Jon Cryer, he was terrible... Personally, the script had potential, but it really needed to be worked out better....MR.BILL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warner Brothers please release the uncut version 134 min.","review":"The film has been bashed to long. Even though Cannon Films used most of the film's budget for their other projects at the time like Masters Of The Universe, etc. and messed with Warner Brothers. The true fans shouldn't pay the price, for Cannon Films fault.It is over already and it is about time Warner Brothers restores the deleted footage back into the film already. Let the film redeem it self for what it trully was going to be. With the extended and new scenes, it trully would be an incredible motion picture despite the poor special effects.The orignial 134 minute Superman IVs time has come to see the light of day. Please don't punish the fans by not releasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superman is better than ever!!!!","review":"Superman does his bit for world peace by ridding the world of nuclear weapons so earth will not suffer Krypton's destruction. This inspires Lex Luthor to create a NuclearMan from Superman's DNA. This results in an exciting, well done battle and a surprising conclusion. Wonderful special effects and a good cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superman IV: The Quest for Quality","review":"The quest for quality should be the title of this mediocre sequel. It's straight out of a bad comic book plot and belongs in the bargain bin at your local video store. It's sad that the franchise has not learned it's lesson from their last failure, Superman 3. Instead of producing a human and believable picture, the film shoots strictly for the kiddies with the lamest villain yet- Nuclear Man (don't even ask about Lex Luther's nephew and his reject knight rider car). The film would be a total washout if not for the heartfelt performances of the series' veterans including Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, and Gene Hackman (as the diabolical Lex Luther). Their noble effort can't save this horribly contrived film. It's sad that this is the last Christopher Reeve/Superman movie that we will see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superman IV: The Craps for Pee","review":"I found 3 reasons to hate this movie3. You can't watch Superman Returns if you watch this.2. Nuclear Man, they had Bizzaro in the movie but they replaced him with a blond haired weirdo that never even appered in the comic adaption.and 1. Weak plot, it sounded like a good plot for a 60's Batman movie sequal (I still want a DVD release of the TV show though) but not for a Superman movie. Sorry Christopher Reeve (He made the Plot) it's just too campy for even Adam West's Batman.Though I can't wait until the NEW Superman Movie for 2009, do NOT watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Simply...awful.","review":"You would be better off to watch two hours of someone clipping their toenails than to lay down money for this stinking excuse for entertainment. Get a load of the special effects -- hoo ha! I've seen better in 50's sci-fi movies. You won't believe a man can fly after sitting through this Super-mistake. Even Christopher Reeve distances himself from this in interviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariel Hemming way can breathe in space","review":"Ok, where do I begin.The story is weak and stupid. The villian is laughably ridiculous.You could feel the budget cut is was that bad.The fight on the moon scene, black curtains where used. Wires sticking out to make hero and villian fly exposed.Superman rebiulds the wall of China with his eyes, just simple camera work for budget costs.My fav part, nuclear man takes Mariel Hemmingway's character into space.Yup, past the thin air, the intensly hot atmosphere and she is ok.I don't mind good \\"bad\\" movies, but this is just BAD bad.Not even worth watching for free.Avoid this clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"SILLY, SHODDY AND UNNECESSARY! 1 3/4 STARS!","review":"'SUPERMAN IV THE QUEST FOR PEACE' is entertaining on a pure camp level. The film is bad, the FX run from good to laughable(flying wires clearly visible)and some truly stupid decisions. I don't know what they paid Hackman to be in this unnecessary retread, but I hope he had fun spending the money. Everything in this film has a \\"been there done that\\" feel to it. The film is the shortest one in the series by at least 30 minutes but, I found myself dozing off a few time only to awaken with Mariel Hemingway breathing in outer space! LOL! It's sort of fun to watch if you know what to expect. I have heard there is a longer version.......I hope not! ....and I hope Spider-Man 4 doesn't come out this bad! I rated it 1 3/4 stars for a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chernobyl and Other Nuclear Disasters","review":"'Superman IV - The Quest for Peace' released in '87 was an absolute bomb (yes, pun intended).

By far the best horror masterpiece ever contrived. I am still suffering the after affects. This straightjacket is bloody tight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely atrocious","review":"Well the've done it again, made a great comic book story into a pile... This movie is about as bad as Karate Kid Three. Lets see, whats wrong with it--well EVERYTHING! I don't know where to begin, with Lex's far-fetched escape out of prison, normal people flying in space, getting rid of all the nuclear missles by putting them into the sun, and of course our villian, thats right, where did they find this guy, some... solar senisitve villian that came from the sun--brilliant! First of all, don't cast John Cryer for anything, yeah, I'm sure his performance as Lex's son was probably the finest in his short an completely unknown career. Hackman, what were you thinking, this movie should have ended your career. For future refenece, when you get a script like this, DON'T TAKE IT!!! ... Well, this is by far the worst flick(I won't even call it a movie, let alone a film) I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This film disgraced the first two films like Phantom Menace did to Star Wars. Good for insomniacs or an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super-Disappointment","review":"Let's face it: while it was great seeing Chris Reeve as Superman, Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, et. al. once again, nothing they did could save this movie from its awful production standards, crummy dialogue and disjointed plot. The subplot of Superman ridding the world of nuclear bombs was terrific, but it was downhill after that. Plus the movie isn't original: the sequences between Clark and Lois essentially are a repeat from \\"Superman I\\"; Luthor's super-villian is reminiscent of the Phantom Zone escapees from \\"Superman II\\". The definitely cheesy special effects make this a sad farewell to Chris Reeve as The Man of Steel. One thing, though: there is an incredible flying & landing sequence near the end, where Superman speaks to the Press near the U.N. This is one of the few special effects that make it look like Superman is really doing his thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love all things \\"Superman\\" - except for this junk movie...","review":"Simply put, this is a horrible movie. Superman's desire to destroy the world's nuclear missiles is juvenile at best, grand theft larceny at worst. Little touches such as Superman actually talking in the vacuum of space and Superman repairing the Great Wall of China simply by looking at it made me want to sue the makers of this film. Other things such as Jon Cryer's vicious attack on the art of acting and Gene Hackman's absence of even one good line made me want to turn it off midway through, even though I'm a huge Superman fan. And don't even bring up Clark Kent's lurid implication toward the end that Mariel Hemmingway's character healed him with sex - what bad taste! Do yourself a favor and rent or buy the first Superman movie (which is a masterpiece) and pretend that no sequels to it - let alone this one - were ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad way to finish it up","review":"To close the Superman series out with this movie was a very sad testamony to the Superman movies. Christopher Reeve insisted on doing these ultra-liberal themes (anti-nuke, anti-strong military, anti-development, anti-corporation development, etc.). It made for a bad story. Add to that the INCREDIBLY BAD editing, this movie was horrible. I remember seeing it in the theaters and thinking - How did we get to this scene? Was that badly edited or is it me?Skip this movie all together. If you have Superman and Superman II, you have the two Superman movies worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sucks & Rocks All In One Film","review":"Superman IV is the end of the Superman franchise, but still, no one can play a better Superman since Christopher Reeve. The crappy second half of the storyline turns me off. Even though it may not worth the buy, who cares. Got it for the sake of Christopher Reeve's Superman."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would have been better had the cuts been kept","review":"What I said in the title says it all. I would rather see this in a edition where all of the cut scenes are put back into the film in their proper order. About the only thing good about this is Reeve as Superman. Although the film itself is not as good as it should have been, he was still endearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad ending to the Reeve Superman","review":"I think the most frustrating thing about this movie is that it could have been so much better. If you look at the movie in the context of the time in which it was created, late 80's when their really was a nuclear arms race, this movie could have really done a lot to help children understand the desperate need to handle this nuclear problem. Instead all Writers for this movie could come up with was, \\"lets have every country that has nuclear weapons shoot them into the air so Superman can get them and throw them into the sun.\\"As usual I did like the cast which is what saved the movie from 1 star. Gene Hackman was great as Luthor, Christopher REeve is Superman! I love his portrayal of Clark. Mariel Hemingway makes a great female lead in this movie. I wish that she had been cast Lois instead of Kidder.Unless you just have to complete the Superman series in your collection I would leave this Superman alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"SuperBomb - The Quest for More Money - Half Star","review":"Amazon should really seriously consider the ability to give half stars because this one needs it.Nuclear man - created from Superman's DNA yet he has Lex Luthor's voice and all the intelligence of a crab? What was John Cryer doing in this film? Chris Reeve has writing credit here and considering he didn't want to be labeled the S-guy forever I think he tried to kill the franchise. Golan-Globus should be ashamed. Do what I do buy the first two films and pretend III and IV don't exist. That's what they're doing for Superman Returns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The series is COMPLETELY redesigned- for the worse","review":"unlike the other films, he flys like an X-wing, has visible wires, makes stereotyped remarks to other nations, has a green costume that doesn't clash with the blue-screen he 'flys' against, has NO muscles, defys the laws of physics by having a flapping cape in outer-space, and overall, NOTHING in this film relates to the rest of the series. This lacks it's predessesors gradiose-scale expensiveness. If they'd left it at 3, the series could have been left flying reasonably high, and it could have been remembered as being special. But why have something special when it's so easy to ruin it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Super-Turkey","review":"Sadly, Christopher Reeve's final go-around as the Man of Steel is a disaster from start to finish. Despite a good cast, \\"Superman IV\\" (1987) takes an appalling nosedive in terms of story, direction and production values. The \\"special effects\\" are laughably bad for a film of this caliber. In response to previous reviews, the additional footage shown on television also appeared in the original European version. It didn't help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever!","review":"This movie is horrid! As it stinks so bad, my friends and I in college would find it on some bad cable channel all the time.

It is truly one of the worst movies ever made. The special effects look dated compared to the movie in 78! There is something wrong here. Even Gene Hackman, who probably was bore so he decided to do this movie, cannot save this horrible film.Christopher Reeve, who had a major hand in developing this movie, probably meant well, but good intentions do not make a good movie - good filmaking does.Even the 1970s Spider-man TV show looks good in comparison.

With this book and its predecessor, INFERNO, Barlowe gives illustration to that most dreaded place still to linger in the minds and consciences of many a man and woman: Hell.Barlowe's literally tortured landscape is one of the few truly original and imaginative renderings of the Demonic realm that I've seen or read in quite a while.Barlowe's Inferno with its demonic overlords, ruling from citadels built with the crushed souls of condemned humanity over a dimension of pain and humiliation is repugnant yet fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, But Way Too Short","review":"The artwork is fanomenal, and the descriptions of the portraits portrayed are equally as effective as they shed some dark light as to what was going on at the time of construct. It's safe to say that if the descriptions are this vivid than Barlowe should be an author. But upon hearing that he has indeed made a story, entitled God's Demon, inspired by Paradise Lost, that'll be my next purchase.

The jewelry it shows you how to make (7 items you could supposedly sell) would really be ideal for an 8 year old. And, requires about the same skill level. It shows you how to string beads(duh), how to bend some wire for an earring loop, how to curl wire on a bead string so the beads are separated by curls of wire, then something about sewing a piece of cloth that was so far from jewelry making I didn't bother to read it. The last half of the book is about going into business (Hopefully not selling the crap this book shows you how to make!).

I found it literary, witty, and darkly fascinating. The people and places Mantel brings to life here evoked my own Catholic upbringing and school years. I bought the book because of the review Margaret Atwood gave it (printed on the cover), and it well deserved her lavish praise.That said, I wanted there to be more. It felt like reading the beginning of a book, or like listening to someone tell me the first part of a history, and then suffering an interruption that leaves the story hanging.

Superbly talented in creating relentless, razor sharp images of lower middleclass family life, of personally thwarted parents with bigger goals for their children, and of striving and desperately motivated young people, Mantel will, for many readers, succeed in conjuring up some of their own nightmares of youth and school life.

But in this case it wasn't. I'm used to a Dr. Who with cheesy monsters, maybe a few chills and surprises and certainly, bad things do happen. A few of the Dr. Who books have been quite graphic but this takes the cake.What bothers me most is that the author did this to the Third Doctor and Jo - my favorite combination.

We have NO clear idea why Emily falls for the man she kills or why she kills him. And the scene that shows him bathing publicly with his male friends is hilarious, but inintentionally so. Whoever adapted this has no sense of what to do with the characters--they just stare at each other. Dialogue has to be invented--it was not. So much could have been done, but so little was.

Yes, it is simple but that is the appeal and this could be made at home very easily but for those who don't have the time or imagination then it is worth buying. Will be buying for additional children this Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Grandchildren love this game","review":"Our grandchildren (all 9) have loved this game. Most children's board games are competitive, and while that is also fun, this one can be played in a non-competitive mode and our grandchildren seem to welcome the opportunity just to play without having to compete. They all cheer for the snail in last place! The three year old will get the game out on her own and if no one is around to play (child or adult) she will set it up and amuse herself. Unlike some other games the children play once or twice and forget, they keep coming back to this one. We bought it on Amazon because our local toy store can not keep them in stock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly fun for such a simple game","review":"Well, this went over well. I've played with three of my kids, the 6-year-old, the 4-year-old, and the 2-year-old. My 4-year-old really adores it. The game couldn't be simpler, but it's still plenty of fun. It gets frequent us. The pieces are quite durable. It's easy to set up and easy to clean up. Really, I couldn't ask for much more.Now, in the future, we'll start talking about probability and statistics; then we'll be having some fun =)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Snail's Pace Race","review":"This game is great. My teaching partner had it when she worked with me, she moved and I felt I had to replace it for my own classroom. The children can work on matching colors, taking turns, predicting a winner, as well as how to \\"run\\" the game themselves. The game is great for turn-taking, as well as learning the feeling of teamwork, since they predict which snail will win!! Everyone wins in this game, they have a great time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible life lesson - life is not fair","review":"What a horrible game. Everyone comes out a winner. There is no competition among players, Kids and especially young males need outlets for competitive expression. What a loser game.Kids get some imaginary idea that everything will be fine. All I have to do is show up. Well they need to understand....SOMEONE WILL LOSE. Just as they will when they grow up.What utter PC clap trap. Likely thought up by an academic that really believes this stuff.This is the nonsense being taught at the University level in all these \\"...Studies\\" departments. Anything with the word \\"...Studies\\" at the end is to be avoided. Things like \\"cultural STUDIES\\", \\"Womyns Studies\\"They are all the sort that espouses \\"Everything comes up roses\\" school of thought. Does terrible things to human thought and perseverance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to the Bard for kids - but it's tough to decide what age it's for or how you'd use it.","review":"Shakespeare for Kids - 21 activities is a combination of an illustrated biography of William Shakespeare and a book of activities for kids to get them in the mood and spirit. There are a host of photos and illustrations of Shakespeare's home, school, period London etc... This illustrated biography part is the most effective part of the book. It brings the period to life. The activities - making a quill; learning to juggle; staging a scene from Julius Caesar; staging a sword fight - are more of a mixed bag. I have trouble imagining do most of these things one on one with a kid. Perhaps they work better as part of a classroom activity? All in all the book is well executed and written - but I have some problems with the conception of the activities that form the real meat of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly unfunny!","review":"I was extremely excited to receive my copy of Barrel Fever. After having read \\"Naked\\" and \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" I was thoroughly looking forward to another laugh out loud event. I was severely disappointed however when I finally got to read \\"Barrel Fever\\" strikingly not funny and dark to a fault, I had to force myself to read the whole collection. The stories that were the first and main part of the book were depressing and twisted. It was easy to tell that it was attempting to be humor but was falling drastically short. Three of the four essays that concluded the book were flat and boring and made me regret buying the book at all. The final essay however, \\"Santaland Diaries\\" was the diamond among all of the coal. Wonderfully funny, this last essay reminded me that, yes, I was still reading David Sedaris. If you are thinking about buying the book, borrow it from a friend and read \\"Santaland Diaries\\", but skip the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"false advertising","review":"Purchased a hardback book from vendor as represented and advertised site.

Sedaris shines when regaling us with the autobiographical stories of his family, his boyfriend, or his experiences...just about everywhere.His fictional offerings are a bit useless. The charm of his dark, sardonic wit is in his skewed perspective of reality. When this translates to fiction it loses its validity. There's nothing funny about fake cynnicism. Barrel Fever is mostly fictional short stories, so there's not much here that will captivate you.The same could be said of Holidays On Ice but that book retains a fairly steady degree of humor and themes that redeem the fiction. Go read \\"Naked\\" or \\"Dress Your Family in Cordury and Denim\\". His later works are far superior to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peculiar And Wickedly So.","review":"Wasn't sure what to make of this collection. It's not the standard form or flow of Sedaris. And most of it is just rambling made-up characters and disjointed stories that serve no particular purpose.The quotes from the jacket [\\"shrewd, wickedly funny...\\"] must be freely peppered across the cover based on other works - because nothing in this collection truly merits the praise printed.Some here have said this book shows Sedaris seeking his voice - and as such could be the case, move on to other selections where Sedaris has clearly found that voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange...","review":"I have read several of David Sedaris's books. I absolutely loved Naked, but Barrel Fever was just so...strange!! I found it a little more disturbing than funny. Yes, there were funny parts, but mostly, I just kept hoping that the next stories would be better; they weren't. I still think he is a great writer, but this is not at all along the same lines as Naked, Me Talk Pretty One Day, When Engulfed in Flames or Dress Your Family In Corduroy and Denim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written and, at times, laugh-out-loud funny","review":"I couldn't put this book down! I didn't find all of the stories to be as good as some of the clear winners of the bunch, but they were all engaging and very entertaining. Wonderfully written in prose that could easily be studied by aspiring writers. I plan to begin reading the author's next book, \\"Naked,\\" right away. While this book contains a collection of (mostly) short stories and (some) non-fiction essays, I felt the essays were the best. It's good to see that his other books seem to contain (all?) essays. A truly enjoyable read!As a side note, I read the Kindle edition of this book. It was well formatted and contained the entire text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the meek!","review":"Boy, David Sedaris can write! But don't expect an uproarious read. What you'll find here is warped, stinging satire of life's underbelly, sometimes sad, sometimes shocking, sometimes funny. Always true to life though. Sedaris kicks us through life's meanness with his tongue in his cheek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sedaris's best!","review":"I adored \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" and thought \\"Naked\\" was quite good, too. But I was very disappointed in \\"Barrel Fever\\". In fact, I don't think I even bothered to finish it, because so many of the stories were just plain outrageously disgusting and weird and not funny at all. PLEASE don't judge Sedaris on this book alone -- try \\"Me Talk Pretty\\"! I laughed so hard while reading it that my husband sent me out of the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"I enjoyed his other titles, and picked this out based on a story I randomly read at the store. I thought it would be a great gift for a relative. Wrong! I will be returning the because there are so many other Sedaris books out there that I feel are more entertaining and lighthearted. Honestly I might have enjoyed it more if there were an introduction or forward from the author, explaining his frame of mind while writing some of these stories. They are macabre, bizarre, and at some points shocking, which on the whole are not bad things. But, having read Naked, and Me Talk Pretty One Day, the 'voice' in Barrel Fever just doesn't match up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn funny","review":"David Sedaris has a caustic painful witty sense of humor. His book is a quickie, a comic book in its attention span. This is good because to linger in the world of these bitter, self-absorbed people would be degrading if prolonged. Sedaris can evoke the paranoia and mania of teenagehood in a convincing way."},{"rating":"2","title":"An often misinterpreted book.","review":"I'm not sure that most people really know what to expect when they read Sedaris' work, but it seems to me that most of them just want cheap, simple humor. I feel to truly admire and understand his work you must look at the dark side of yourself, the ability to laugh at other's misfortune, a person's nature to hate someone based on a very small part of their persona, and to know that all people really care about is themselves. To read this book and laugh is to laugh at human nature, so embrace, and enjoy, how devilishly cruel it can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just horrible!","review":"I have read all of David Sedaris's books and I was looking so forward to this one...it is THE WORST! The stories are not only NOT funny, but many times just very base and crass...I felt disgusted when I read some of them. It was like someone completely different had written them. I was extremely disappointed with this book, I would highly recommend avoiding it at all costs. If you want to see great writing with insight and humor, get any other Sedaris book. This one was just horrendous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"I was given a copy of BARRELL FEVER as reading material while i recuperated in the hospital after an operation. I'd never heard of David Sedaris before so my decision to read this collection of essays was reluctant at best. I read \\"The Last You'll Hear from Me\\" first and was immediately hooked. This collection is deliciously wicked and absolutely hillarious. I literally screamed as I read (due in part to pain but primarly from amusement and delight). If there is healing power in humor, this was the perfect medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could talk to everyone....","review":"...You don't have to be, \\"a rabid homophobe\\" not to enjoy a fair portion of this book. The sexual content (especially early on) borders on graphic and offensive and is entirely too pervasive to be ignored....I would say to people who have bought this, but haven't yet read it(especially Sedaris fans), it gets better after the first few stories. I was pretty sure after two stories I would never make it through. But it picked up enough to make me finish it. And, having done so, I'm not terribly disappointed....I would say to people who haven't read any Sedaris, not to start on this one. \\"Naked\\" and \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" are much more engaging, insightful, and entertaining. Had I started on this book, I doubt I would have ever picked up another. And I can honestly say, that would have been a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"How come I can't give it ZERO stars?!?","review":"After reading Naked I was sure this book would live up to my high expectations. It definitely did not. I am a fan of Sedaris' caustic, sardonic, and slightly poignant sarcasm, this book was sadly lacking. You don't have to be \\"timid of heart\\" as another reader/reviewer indicated, to be offended and disgusted by some of these stories. Vulgarity and depravity is scrumptious if it's witty and funny...this was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sends you to sleep","review":"Maybe I have to read more books of Sedaris to discover where all the laughter is but, from my experience, I can tell you that this guy is a master in keeping it out of your reach.There was not even one chapter or essay that could twist my mouth into the most subtle smile, and that is an achievement 'cause I'm the sort of guy who can laugh at the most stupid gags.If you liked American Pie, The Naked Gun series, and that kind of movies, then you're probably feel very dissapointed by this book. If you are a fan of Sedaris, sorry, you read the wrong review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I rate it less than one star?","review":"Barrel Fever is a lame attempt at \\"cutting edge\\" humor. The collection consists of stories that are mostly one note ideas with little insight or compassion.The writing is sophmoric, as are the attempts at outrageousness which fail to obscure that Barrel Fever is not funny"},{"rating":"2","title":"bitterly funny","review":"Some of the stories in this book are merely entertaining while some of them have you laughing out loud no matter where you may be. But all of them are darkly bizarre, with a twist of bitterness that doesn't wholly overshadow the optimistic resignation. These things might happen, you might know these characters, but no matter how bad it is, you can't fail to see the humor in it all. David Sedaris has a biting wit and shows that, even in the worst of all possible things, you can still make fun of others and yourself"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the usual Sedaris standards","review":"Another bestseller from the humorist; I bought this in blind faith because it was a Sedaris. However, I admit I was a tad disappointed. In some of the essays, it felt like he was trying too hard to be funny; the stories seemed to lack the polish found in \\"Naked,\\" \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" or \\"Holidays on Ice.\\"If you must read this, borrow it from a library or buy it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, go elsewhere","review":"Surely one of his lesser appreciated works, but with good reason. \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" and \\"Naked\\" are eons ahead in terms of style, wit, and humor. \\"Barrel Fever\\" is much darker and lacks the polish and playful tone that won him Time magazine's 2001 Humorist of the Year award and the Thurber Prize for American Humor. If you're an audio-book enthusiast Sedaris has no equal for delivery and punch. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as funny as his recent stuff.","review":"This collection is unlike his others because it's all fantasy.

He definitely does real life better than fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great intro to a talented writer","review":"I admit that I first read Naked and Me Talk Pretty before I picked up this collection of Sedaris' early stories and essays. Since Naked and Me Talk Pretty were written in the first person like a warped memoir from Sedaris' life, and were at times more designed to create laughter than to savage human nature, it took a few chapters for me to adapt to Sedaris taking on the voice of various crackpots and losers rather than himself.Sedaris' stuff that is displayed in Barrel Fever takes a sharper aim at the shallowness, self-importance and bitterness contained in his characters than Naked and Me Talk Pretty, but the sidesplitting humor in his later works only rears its head from time to time in Barrel Fever, most notably during the near-legendary \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" story.Sedaris is a talented writer who lets his characters grind an axe or two now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I must agree with many of the reviewers, after reading \\"Naked\\" and \\"Dress Your Family...\\" I expected this book to have me laughing out loud. I am now on page 79 and have smiled once - I don't remember at what.In other books that Sedaris wrote, he turns ordinary real-life events into hilarious encounters. I read his other books and found myself rereading lines to friends as we both laughed out loud. Instead of writing about his life (and the lives of others around him), Barrel Fever is a collection of mostly fiction stories (12) with four essays at the end of the book. I found none of the fictional stories to be funny, nor any of the essays.If you want to laugh out loud, read \\"Naked\\" and \\"Dress Your Family in...\\" If you must read \\"Barrel Fever,\\" borrow a friends copy so you won't feel guilty about wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This and Re-Read Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"What a tremendously disappointing read. If it weren't for the final story, Santaland Diaries, I would have only given this book one star, and only then because I couldn't give it less. I was not looking for a re-tread of \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" but I was looking for something of comparable quality (which in \\"Pretty\\" was stellar), and this was NOT it. Meandering, pointless, humorless ramblings from someone who is capable of much better writing.Only in Santaland Diaries do we get to see the Sedaris that crackles with dark humor and hilarious cynicism. I loved every word of this story and couldn't help but wish that the rest of the book had been this wonderful. My heartfelt advice is that you borrow Barrel Fever from the library, memorize Santaland Diaries, and ignore the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"His other books are better...","review":"I bought all his books thinking they are the same.
