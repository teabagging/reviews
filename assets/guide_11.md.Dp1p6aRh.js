I love fiction from India, but this was pathetic. The main character was such a spinless, witless woman that I had no respect for her. Her main goal in life was to find a husband and keep her parents happy by finding a husband. Nice goals if this was hundred years ago. If you want to read a good about contemporary India, arranged marriage and Indians, read \\"The Mango Season\\" by Amulya Malladi. Now that was a good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful, fun, and enjoyable","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Throughout the story she was able to show how conflicted life can be for women who know enough to be \\"modern\\", but still would like to honor the family and be \\"traditional\\". Through her descriptions of color, food, jewelery, and clothing I was able to immerse myself into her culture. Read this book for a light, entertaining insight into traditional Indian ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildy amusing at best, trite at worst","review":"Overall this was a read-it-while-you're-at-the-gym novel. It's more like watching a mindless sitcom than reading a book. The story was painfully cliched, both in terms of the Indianisms and Americanisms. Fashion industry in New York? Puhleaze. Visiting a swami in Bombay? Whatever. As an Indian, I found it rather alienating reading about an Indian lifestyle I have never personally encountered. As an American, I felt much the same.There are a few amusing scenes in the book, but not enough to make it a \\"must read\\" as other reviewers have recommended. If you're bored and have nothing better to do, pick up this novel. Just don't expect to be wowed."},{"rating":"1","title":"here we go again","review":"this book is ok written but i am sick of seeing novels that make out that Indian parents don't care if their kids are happy or not as long as they are married.

I know that there are still \\"arranged marriages\\" in some countries. \\"For Matrimonial Purposes\\" is funny, sad, educating, and ultimately happy. I recommend this book as a good summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I read that this book was sold for a lot of money and was a great story, great writing et cetera. I was disappointed on all counts. The story was boring and I had no sympathy for Anju. She was a rich, spoilt girl who was constantly looking for a husband, allowing her parents to run her life until magically she decides that she wants to go to America. I couldn't see how the transformation took place. How Anju turned from being an insecure woman to all of a sudden wanting to go to a foreign country all on her own. And ultimately, when she meets the love of her life it is all too easy.The writing was plain, boring and insipid. Sentences like, \\"Bold and the Beautiful was my favorite show, so I sat down to watch who Ridge would sleep with tonight\\" filled the book. I wish the writer had infused some flavor into her writing because this was quite bland. This felt like a Harlequin romance novel packaged as a literary novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"A sparkling book about upper class Indian lifestyle. I identified completely with the light hearted style. It is meant to be a superficial look at the duties between Indian parents and daughters. You have to be Indian to understand that the character is not spineless or gutless as considered by western standards. An Indian parents duty is to get their daughter married, hence the arranged marriage and it is the duty of the daughter not to hurt her parents emotionally or socially. This book is about the attempts of both of them to achieve that goal through an arranged marriage. A simple story line, well written, never boring. Good job, Kavita!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Disappointed","review":"Anju, the protagonist, is searching for a husband. The practical side of husband searching can be appreciated, as Anju is not altogether pre occupied with love. Anyone who enjoys a degree of personal freedom from their parents stands to be utterly frustrated by Anju's overbearing, overprotective parents. As an American I enjoyed reading about all the different aspects of a culture with which I've had limited experience. However, I just couldn't help but wonder the whole time if Bombay parents truly act as Anju's had or if hers was an isolated case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful insight into arranged marriage","review":"I read this novel in one gulp. It is delightful. When you consider that you can get this at the used prices quoted above, why deny yourself the pleasure of a delicious summer read?

It is not entirely a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"To read or not to read...","review":"If you are a single female, 30-ish, of Indian origin, born/living outside India and have a good sense of humor about the trappings of the traditional arranged-marriage process that is practiced to this day, this book is a keeper! ...By the way, if you don't have a good sense of humor about the traditional arranged-marriage process, you'll have one by the end of the book.:-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"A non-resident Indian \\"Successful\\" woman living in USA does not a good writer make. This book is a clear example of this. The novel revolves around very trite and caricaturish characters. There are no original thoughts or ideas which would be even mildly amusing or thought-provoking. The language and the formation of sentences is amateurish, the characters uni-dimensional. Even the main protagonist - Anju is a character whom you couldn't care less for. The book can at best be viewed as a weblog on any of the numerous expatriot Indian diaspora websites. AVOID IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"all dressed up and goes no where.","review":"maggie Z saidit all. Just when you thik the heroine has come into her own.

However, this one was boring. You will be skipping pages just to get to the end. The character of Anju was too conflicting: she acts as though she's this totally cool, hip New Yorker, but she is also perfectly content to marry whomever her parents wish. The ending was terrible! What a pathetic cop-out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"All Putamayo CDs I've heard have been pretty good, but this one is terrific. I especially like the Awaz (sp?) track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic, funky and really cool","review":"Fanciful combinations of Celtic and other world music styles from African, Continental, Celtic and Scandinavian artists. The back cover of this album sums it up well: \\"African, Gypsy, Latin, Arabic, Indian, Scandinavian and Reggae elements are combined with Celtic music to create a unique, cross-cultural musical feast.\\" Some of the more familiar musicians featured are Capercaillie, Kila, Aine Minogue, Alan Stivell, Baka Beyond and Cheb Mami. All of the selections are striking, but I particularly enjoy Monogue's slinky, spooky, tabla-punctuated \\"O Boro Braindi Braindi\\", and Mami's track \\"Azwaw2\\" which combines rai with the pipes, fiddles and flutes of the Breton group Bagad de Kemper. It is fascinating to listen to works like these and hear how seamlessly the music of different cultures, old and new, can flow together. \\"All are one\\", and yet individuality is not only maintained but celebrated.

This book describes masculine violence within the realms of military policy, criminal behavior, and boyhood. It details how boys are being raised violent and are not necessarily born with more violent tendencies than girls. This is a must read for anyone interested in gender studies or childcare."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best tribute albums out there","review":"If you're a fan of European power metal then this album is for you.Excellent choice of bands and songs to be covered.I wish there were more songs from Michael Kiske era but it's good nevertheless.couple of criticisms..1) I am a fan of Sonata Arctica but I felt Hammerfall did a better job covering \\"I want out\\".2)Hammerfall were unjustly excluded from this album.3)Why isn't Stratovarius on this one?If you got Luca you might as well have Timo doing Hansen's riffs.However,female vocals on \\"Helloween\\" is something not to be missed.Dark Moor added a nice symphonic touch to the song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"It's true that a covers album doesn't mean that every band has to sound exactly like the original, but they should capture the spirit and essence of the original songs while adding their own unique sound. Unfortunately, the only tracks I really liked are Luca Turilli's \\"I'm Alive\\", and Dark Moor's very ambitious cover of \\"Halloween\\" (enjoyable if you don't mind the Spanish-accented female voice).The covers by Rhapsody, Sonata Arctica, and Secret Sphere sounded decent, but the rest of the CD is just bland or plain awful (e.g. \\"A Little Time\\" by Heaven's Gate is atrocious). Even Labyrinth's \\"Future World\\" was disappointing. And everyone in Cydonia should be turned into big, fat, half-priced pumpkins for creating such an insipid version of \\"Save Us\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up to the metal band!","review":"If you thrive on metal, then this is a cd worth listening to.

I have given away several copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stout's somewhat snobbish bypath","review":"In this book Stout presents his other notable character besides Nero Wolfe: Tecumseh Fox, a self-made man who is quite a benefactor for a detective. Double for Death does not quite match the well-balanced rhythm and urban atmosphere of his better known Wolfe series. This book underlines a little bit too much how its plot relies on the nuances of the English language. The solution is obvious if the reader happens to have an eye for spellathlons; if not, too bad. Still, the story is readable, and definitely a must for any serious Stout fan just in order to help appreciate the discreetly designed Wolfe-Goodwin setup in most of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Wonder They're Sold in Combination","review":"The almonds are slightly seasoned with a 'barbecue' kind of flavoring, which is subtle but nice.

It does not pick up dog hair out of area rugs or carpets. It worked well on hardwoods, but don't waste your money on this machine. The \\"turbo\\" nozzle is anything but \\"turbo\\". It needs electricity going to it to be effective, the suction just isn't enough as is.Beware of who you buy from and what their return policies are. Vacuums of America charged me a restocking fee of 15% even though it doesn't state that anywhere on their Amazon pages. They were even aware that it doesn't state that and were willing to not charge me 15% restocking fee if I purchased a different vacuum from them. Shady operation. Now I am going through the Amazon A-Z return guarantee to get the rest of my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive toy vacuum","review":"This vacuum is not much more than an expensive pile of plastic. It is quiet, but it has very little suction. The parquet brush has an odd tooth-like brush desgn that is short and stiff, and it doesn't pick up dust and hair from low-pile rugs at all. Also, the head tilts backwards when you pull back on it which is just bad design, period. The tools are dinky and awkward. If you have hard-surface floors only, live in a small place, and don't mind making a poor investment, well, maybe this vacuum would suit you. I returned the vacuum the same day it arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST vacuum I have ever owned","review":"I bought this Miele vacuum almost a year ago, after my electolux burst into flame and melted down! I did a lot of research before purchasing, since I wasn't thrilled to spend so much on a vacuum cleaner. But I have to admit, this one was worth every penny.The suction is tremendous; you don't have to roll over and over the carpets to get them clean. It is lightwieght, easy to manoever around furniture and has a great cord rewinder mechanism. Even my husband was impressed with this vacuum. It came with the power nozzle for carpets and brush for hardwood and tile floors.The only downsides are the small size bags (although they are such nice quality--no dirt \\"leaks out\\" of them) and the cord could be longer. But these are minor inconveniences at best. This vaccuum is terrific, I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"After coveting my sister's, my mother's and my sister-in-law's Meile, I received one for a gift. It has changed the way I approach cleaning! Not only is it extremely lightweight but it is very powerful and will clean anything! It comes with 3 extra attachments that are very useful and the bags/filters are very easy to replace. They redesigned my vacuum and took out the \\"unnecessary extras\\" as my mom would say. This makes it much more compact and even lighter than the previous models. They honestly did not forget anything on this model! The handle extends based on your height and can also be attached/placed in one of two positions when not in use. There is a little switch that makes the suction less intense if you are vacuuming throw rugs, etc. The brush has a bare floor and a carpet setting. It alerts you when the bag is full. What more can I say! It's worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michele","review":"This is a wonderful vacuum. It is robust, does an amazing job, never losses suction but its best part is that it is EXTREMELY light weight. You can stow it away anywhere. You Can run up & down stairs vacuuming with ease. I've tried the Dyson and hated it. The inside can is disgusting to look at and I felt like I was throwing my back out hauling that thing around. The Meile uses a bag attachment inside that seals automatically which mean no dirt,dust,grit,kitty litter etc. gets leftover in your vacuum cleaner when you change a full bag. I have two cats and I vacuum every day. The Miele makes it too easy not to.Thanks,MH Thousand Oaks, CA 91362"},{"rating":"1","title":"forget carpeting","review":"I really want to love this vacuum based on reviews and the price I paid for it. Yes, it's lightweigh. Yes, the bags are small but you can find very good knock off ones sold here on Amazon. But honestly, it's just ok. I have some area rugs and wall to wall carpeting on the stairs and it is just the pits. Forget about anything with any pile on it.

We have all hardwood floors but even area rugs are cleaned well with this. It is light enough to carry while vacuuming stairs. I love the retracting wand. I only use the one attachment for hard surfaces so can't really comment on the different attachments.

It works well on hard floors only. Even with the turbo carpet attachment, it picks up only the little surface pieces on the very top of the carpet but will NOT pull anything up out of the carpet like an upright. If you have hard floors, tile, hardwood, etc., this vacuum works as well as anything else, but for the cost, not worth it if it won't give you any suction on any carpet of any depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I'm very satisfied with the vacuum, very quiet, good suction. The reason I gave it a 4 star is because its a bit hard to attach the turbohead...it almost like the nob on the turbohead attachment is too big for the hole on the vacuum rod.

His talent stands on its own. I hesitate to buy these types of CDs, but there are some songs on this CD that were not remixed. I think people need to have the choice of which to buy, the original recordings or the remixes. I would be willing to bet that the original recordings would far outsell the remixed versions. Let's preserve Freddie's music exactly as he recorded and intended it to be. He had the most incredible and beautiful voice and his music was so very unique.

That is just one example of things working out too neatly to be satisfying. Half the book reads like poor journalism, the other half like an adolescent attempt at literature.

This is just another tool of the enemy to keep people away from the real Jesus of the bible.NWT can actually be used by the believer to help witness to the JW cult members when they come to your door. Do your homework and highlight some of the key scriptures that have been changed. Get an accurate translation of the bible (NASB, Young's Literal, etc) and get a Greek and Hebrew Interlinear.

When you write to the Watchtower Society to get a list of the translators and their professional qualifications, guess what you get? NO RESPONSE! It is the only bible in the world that won't identify its translators.

Look at it this way, Charles Russell(the founder) had his crazy ideas when he started his cult in the late 1800s. After many, many false prophecies of impending Armageddon, the Watchtower needed a way to prove some of its lunatic proclamations because they were losing so many followers from year to year. Enter the New World Translation. Translated by a handful of people, which only one of them had 2 years worth of college in Greek and Hebrew - hardly enough to understand the ancient scriptures.

The use of Jehovah in the new testament is founded on Hebrew translations of the Bible beginning in the 14th century. Why ignore the reliable Greek scriptures that are from the 1st to 4th centuries that do not use Jehovah? Very biased with no real support.

It takes only a small amount of knowledge of the Greek to find problems here.

One thing is true, decent speakers have much longer lifetime than any other components, so if you are considering an all-in-one surround system, I'd recommend spending a little extra and getting decent speakers and a separate component receiver. These speakers are very solid and weighty with metal body construction - you can feel the quality. Some of the all-in-one surround systems have cheap plastic-body speakers - not so good from a resonance standpoint. These speakers are nice size, and have built-in removable wall-mount hooks. My home theater receiver is 7.1 capable, but I live in a condo and don't have space for all of those speakers - but the cool thing about these is that you can buy additional identical speakers as single units - so I can expand later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, But Boring","review":"I was only able to get through approximately 200 pages of this book.

I was almost scared because the price was lower then most of the digital camcorders out there. I have been searching for so long for the right camera. And I found it. I constantly use my camera both video and stills. On average I have used my camera about 2-3x's a week since I bought it in April of 02. I have used Sony & Panosonic cass. and have had no problem. The quality of the videos are amazing I have had friends amazed at the quality of the zoom especially for the price I paid. The stills are a grainy quality in the dark areas but in full day light a great quality. And upload to computer really fast with no problems at all.I am not fully aware of all the technical garble but as for what I wanted it to do which is to tape family and friends get togethers and special events so I don't miss a moment and have tapes to send back east to family and friends in great quality, and it does all that and more with no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Camara that does not work","review":"I do not recomend buying this camcorder.

After 6 months, all I got is 50% broken pictures, and I only playback 3 times. The quality isn't as good as VHS (go figure). I planned to make Dvd discs of my video and it's not worth the VHS tape. It only gets 3 months coverage on labor so I don't think it's worth anything to fix.

The manual says, \\"avoid magnetic sources\\". Later that day I tried the camera again and it worked fine and haven't had a problem since. Hopefully that was the problem...the manual says if you use the LP (long playing mode) with tapes not designed for LP, it will cause playback problems...I hope this helps anyone having the playback problems.

The first remote was replaced by warranty (I bought it from another site).Filing a warranty claim was relatively easy and the replacement was sent within a week.

Yes, its flying faster, but its lighter, so the impact is EXACTLY THE SAME as a heavier, and therefore slower, round. (Some simple physics will prove this if you doubt me)I personally recommend .20g precision (seamless) BBs or heavier. You get much greater accuracy, with the same impact, altho, yes, you lose some range. But what good is range without accuracy?

Another problem is that these are .12 BB's. you should NEVER fire anything less than a .2 through any airsoft gun, as the lower weight not only makes it less accurate but can break the air seal on your gun, making it just about completely useless if you're planning on shooting things 15+ feet away or have any speed behind the BB.. .12g bb's will also put a lot more stress on your gun's internals, as there's not much weight to transfer energy to.

It allows you to make up new aircraft and pilots and print out the aircraft sheets (even better than the ones that come with the game).My biggest complaint is that the publisher (FASA) does not provide aircraft counters with any of the add on modules.

And the story has to be one of the better ones I've seen on screen. Just when it seems everything is miraculously (ar ar) settled, a new complication arises - which makes it all the more realistic, no easy answers or easy believism promoted here!

This piece was produced by amateur filmmakers from a church. I think they actually did quite well. But beyond that, the message is literally life-altering.

The cinematography is a bit rough (think a college film project) but in some ways it added to the \\"real world\\" feel of life in middle America, dealing with profound questions of business ethics, morality, parenting, and how faith, specifically Christianity, intersects with life. I actually thought this film was a whole lot better than \\"Facing the Giants\\", produced by the same outfit (with a much larger budget)."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good movie","review":"This movie has a great moral story behind it.

This is the moving (and sometimes funny) story of a cheating, morally bankrupt car dealer who is behind on his bills. A spiritual experience leads him to re-evaluate his dealings in surprisingly different ways. Like \\"Giants,\\" this film is better than you would expect considering the budget and is proof you don't need millions to entertain or move people. Film was run at Georgia area movie theater and shocked the church with the attendance, which prompted longer and wider play in the theater's chain. Obviously, success of \\"Giants\\" appears to be prompting a national release of this film by Sony, but that's a good move.

He is dishonest in his business, and that's exactly how he conducts his personal life as well. He is dishonest in all of his relationships even his wife and son know they can't trust him. However, as Jay works on restoring a classic 1958 Triumph TR3A convertible, he comes face-to-face with the reality that his life is spinning out of control because of the choices he has made and the way he has conducted himself in his business and in his relationships. He resolves to give his life and his business over to God and make God the \\"Boss,\\" and begins the ride of his life. Alex Kendrick's convincing, no-nonsense performance as an amoral businessmen and the picture's spartan straightforward approach, with a modicum of humor, is this movie saving graces. \\"Flywheel\\" draws its title from the missing part of an engine in a vintage Triumph convertible. I enjoyed this movie, this is a movie worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"Your opinion of this film may depend on your expectations.

This movie doesn't deserve a star, it deserves a rotting lemon. This movie ranks up there with the Blair Witch Project as being a terrible movie. I got suckered in by this one. Let's see, actors sucked, plot sucked, quality sucked and now my opinion of John Broderick and Gemstone Entertainment has lowered itself into the SUCK relm.

I fell asleep:("},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not woth it!","review":"I bought the video because of a very misleading advertisement for this film. I am a great DeNiro fan, but this was terrible. The picture on the box leads you to believe this movie was made some time in the 1980's - it was made in 1969. The story synopsis is not only wrong, but it names DeNiro's character Johnny (possibly confusing it with his character in Mean Streets), but his name is Sammy, and he dies in the first scene, only to return in flashbacks. The acting is terrible, the story is terrible. If your looking for an old DeNiro movie, get Mean Streets, this one is not worth your time or money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Swap","review":"This film is a re-edited film.

It was that bad. It's old, unclear, and a terrible movie. Deniro is not even the main actor. Stupid plot, lousy acting, and a horrendeous ending. Don't waste your time and/or money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Other than scenes with De Niro, the acting is horrible","review":"The description on the cover of the video box leads you to beleive that this is an action story with De Niro battling the mob to save his brother, except it is De Niro who is killed in the beginning of the movie and the rest is flashbacks with him in different scenes. Then De Niro's older brother gets out of jail and tries to find his killer. The Plot is unoriginal and the acting is absolutely horrible (exept for some of the scenes with De Niro). Unfortunately, even De Niro can't make this film rise above anything but bad, bad, bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"I love de niro, and I love movies from all genres and all time periods but this movie was awful. I bought it because I found it for 5.88 and a lot of places didn't have it in their warehouse so I figured it might be rare. The box of the dvd makes it out to be a de niro film which its not. After the first scene when he is killed within the first 3 minutes I looked at the case to see if De niro was a star. The story line is awful, right from the beginning you know what will happen in the end and if you do watch this movie pay attention to the end it just isn't real. The last 15 minutes is absurd. The dvd case said there was extra features such as a trivia, filmography and biographies there wasn't even a scene selection area. The movie quality looks like it came straight from a vhs and and the sound is awful. If you are a de niro fan and you want to see this movie go for it, but just know what its actually like and don't go by the box cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissatisfied","review":"I had the same experience as Jay. I bought the crummy dvd for $5.88 at freakin' walmart. I don't know what the hell I was thinking. The dvd box was very misleading saying it had certain features. It looked like the dvd had been dubbed and the film quality sucked. Every actor makes a bad choice at least once in their career and this was De Niro's. He's my all-time fave actor but this movie was the pits. The quality of it was comparable to that of a low budget 70's porn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and romantic story","review":"The erlier reviewer were too unfair... What were they expecting?

But I am so glad I stuck with it because it turned out to be a fantastic story that kept me engrossed until the very end. I could not put it down once I started! You really get lost in the lives of these characters, especially Gideon and Sara. Their feelings and emotions just draw you in. I highly recommend this first installment in The Lord Series. I am going to buy the next two as soon as possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so bored","review":"I normally agree with the reviews that books get on Amazon. But this book was so boring the heroine complained too much, I didn't see what could possibly be considered romantic. Also the concept was too bizarre even for a book. I put the book down several times finally I reached the point were I couldn't read one more sentence. Please don't waste your money on this book get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Sara the Perfect","review":"I loved Sabrina Jefferies 'Spinster' books, so I thought I'd give this one a try. Well rated, pirates and the high seas? The premises was too good to be true! And oh sweet merciful God it was. Horn was the epitome of arrogance and condescension, and Sara was one of the most uncoperative females ever. The worst part of the book was how both the heroine and hero invalidated everyone else' feelings and choices. Naturally, Sara is the only one who knows how relationships work, and marriage to a former pirate on an island paradise is SO much worse than a sentence to New South Wales, and of COURSE Horn knows everything about how Sara feels or wants or believes and it's up to him to make her stop lying to herself.It took me almost two months to finish this book, and if I had to do it over again, I would've just thrown the book away, even though it was a library copy. It wasn't worth it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I expected this to be a swashbuckling tale on the high seas with tons of action and plenty of romance. I was sorely disappointed.While Sabrina Jeffries is known as as bestselling author, this was obviously not one of her best. I didn't like Gideon Horn's (our hero) take-over attitude nor did I care for his bitter attitude. He wasn't really a likable character. And while Sara Willis (our heroine) had a great personality--strong, independent, vulnerable--I wasn't buying into her attraction to Gideon. A reformer who falls in love with a pirate? It's a great concept, but the actual plot was a bit lacking. I think Jeffries could have written this with a little more...flair, I think, is the word I'm looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pirate Lord","review":"I enjoyed this story as so many others by Sabrina Jefferies.

It was such a great book, I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpretentious, romantic happily-ever-after.","review":"This story doesn't pretend to be anything other than typical Sabrina Jeffries fare. Man and woman meet under trying circumstances, followed by a battle of wills and growing passion culminating in falling in love. The usual twist of 'love-interrupted' culminates in a nice, neat, touching tie-up of all loose ends.This is a nice book to read if you just want a romance that doesn't involve the typical rakish alpha male and idiotic heroine. Just two individuals who overcome obstacles to find each other and show their true characters without unbelievable leaps of logic or credibility.Several interesting characters are left underdeveloped which is disappointing and I don't know if the other books in the series address this or not.Very little action is involved despite the pirate theme.Recommended if you don't want your emotions taxed by books with deeper themes.4 stars for being good at what it is not for being a riveting, must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intrigue, Suspense, & Boundless Passion!

I would give it 4.5 stars.","review":"This was a fabulous read. The hot pirate on the cover doesn't hurt anything either. ;) This story is great because there is no intrigue, no mystery, and no real subplot. There is a tiny subplot about Gideon's mother, but it's hardly mentioned and Jeffries doesn't waste pages and pages going on about it. The story is 99.9% about the romance.The sex scenes sizzled, although I thought they might be a bit more creative. I mean, after all, the man is a pirate. Didn't he have some fun tricks up his sleeve?! ;) This was definitely sensual and I truly believed the characters loved and cared for each other.Sara was a *bit* too perfect for me. She was forever chastising everyone about their \\"sins.\\" She apparently had none. She never made mistakes and had no personality flaws to speak of. I think giving her a little bit of humanity would have helped the story.Definitely a fun and romantic read.

Get it? city - on - fire. Yes, Disney does think you are that simpleminded) you get the version with English dubbing only. If you get the Tai Seng version (with the faces of three actors and Chinese writing on the cover) you get the vastly superior original version with subtitles. They cost the same but the Tai Seng version is so much better.

THE ENGLISH SUBTITLES ARE AWFUL! Yeah, dubbed versions of Hong Kong crime are bad, but at least you can follow the action. The English subtitles are godawful- broken english, badly timed, often confusing, and it gives me the feeling that I'm missing half of the movie. My recommendation is to rent a dubbed copy of this film before seeing the subtitled version. That way, you'll know what's going on, and be able to enjoy the film as it was intended.

But no one can doubt how blatant a rip off \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" was from this film. Tarantino's film is broken to basics and uses stylistic violence, Lam's films is a police action fare (he's the HK master). What I love about Lam's films are the realism, whereas John Woo (my fave) is highly stylized. All that considered, City On Fire is the tragic story of Ko Chow, A HK undercover cop who blurs the line between right & wrong, and loyalty while working undercover to bring down a jewlery robbing syndicate. A word of note for DVD fans, the picture quality of this DVD and sound quality are a perfect transfer! It looks and sounds fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic early team-up between Chow Yun Fat and Danny Lee","review":"This 1987 Ringo Lam classic reverses the roles of Chow Yun Fat and Danny Lee as later seen in the Killer. The film is dated somewhat, but still shows Hong Kong cinema at the height of its energy and Lam intensifies the action with strong, inventive directing. Chow Yun Fat is as always brilliant in the film, while Lee dutifully portrays the antagonist. As a note, Tarantino used this film as the basis for his first film \\"Resevoir Dogs\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney needs to learn we aren't illiterate","review":"Waited months for this to be released only to be horribly disappointed (although I guess I should have expected it by now) by the fact that its English Dubbed only.

Ah well looks like another one I'll just import."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor dubbing ruins movie","review":"This movie is not like a Jackie Chan flick where the plot and acting are secondary to the action pieces and goofy comedy, so it makes 0 sense for them to dub over the voices in order to make the movie more easily accessable to North American audiences. Besides, Chow Yun-Fat's fame over here is fresh in everyones mind from Crouching Tiger, which was shown subtitled in the theatres, so it's not like people are totally against the idea. There's nothing wrong with release Hong Kong films here to cash in on their recent popularity, just treat them with a little respect ala Time and Tide or Once Upon a Time in China. If you are a fan of Hong Kong movies, or foreign movies in general, please do not support cheesy dubbed versions and skip this DVD, buying it only encourages them to do the same to other films."},{"rating":"2","title":"CITY ON FIRE Review","review":"Best known as the film that inspired Quentin Tarantino's \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", Ringo Lam's Hong Kong cop thriller starring Chow as an undercover that goes in deep with the mob is an excellent tale of trust and honor amongst theives.

Paired with John Woo as a director and I'll watch any film with that combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story is okay, but Chow makes watching it all worth it","review":"Personally, I don't think the story is all that great. It is inconceivable that an undercover cop would be forced to risk his life after he had time and again asked for permission to resign. The performance by the younger, callous cop is especially annoying. However, Chow brings the film to life in his relationship with one of the gang members played by Danny Lee (the cop from \\"The Killer\\").

I had enjoyed a light introduction to opera before this movie, but after feeling the raw emotions this film created in me, I bought a few opera CDs based simply on first hearing the arias in this movie. There is even some VERY funny stuff is one scene.So, in summary, the music, images, and emotions from this movies were all so intense, they've stayed with me for years.

Its a water smoker and has a water pan between the element and the meat - so it cant be for a drip cup. Just an all around aweful thing.

The writing, by the likes of Steven Bochco, and the direction, which includes early efforts from Steven Spielberg were among the best television has produced.

I had to return mine TWICE cos the trays would come unglued because they weren't in the right place for it to stick to the cardboard(guess those automated machines arent too accurate). In the previous seasons, there were 8 places with glue on each tray, this season only has 4. So to anyone who works for warner: MORE GLUE. Take a hint from Columbia/Tri-star(Good times, What's happening, etc)...they do a good job.

The characters are very much like the \\"populars\\" you find in high school. Maybe a little bit smarter. Definitely a little bit funnier. But they're are the same shallow, repulsive folks that--if you had a little on the ball--you tried to avoid. Like the plague. You know the type. The girls who were more attractive than average, usually really skinny, and way too chipper. And then the guys. Kinda clunky. No depth at all. Smug.As you might have guessed, I find it very difficult to watch this show. Far from making me laugh, these characters make me want to leave. And the writing is so flat, so corporate, so uninspired, that it amounts to junk-food humor, with a carefully orchestrated laugh track so numbed viewers know exactly where to laugh.It's because of stuff like this that I've stopped watching TV altogether.

The first part of the book was good, teaching the basics of different electronic componenets (transistors, resistors, transformers), and how to identify them. It also talks about how to calculate current, etc depending on parallel or in sequence circuits. Although I never finished the book, this knowledge became extremely helpful when my geophysics class built a magnetometer in lab. I ended up knowing more about building electonics and interpretting diagrams than the whole class (including a physics major and the teacher). So I'm happy with how the book worked out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"Like many others, I've been self-teaching myself electronics in recent years, and this book beats out the others. I myself found the projects, which mirror the text, very helpful.

Also, in chapter two the description of capacitors (and their markings) makes no sense and the first page of chapter that ends with \\"this is why all common household current is AC\\" also makes no sense because it is preambled by a description of AC and no transformer action.I read chapter two a couple of times but still lack a good understanding because I NEED (as I imagine many do) some connection with the real world. The water pump example is good but it stops there. I dove into this text with an excitement and desire to diagnose and repair some old audio equipment that can see new life.

This is the 3rd Sparks novel I've read (just to see if maybe I've read a couple bad apples) but I have yet to be compelled to stay up all night reading one of his books. My interest was peaked by the movie trailer for Rodanthe, so of course I picked up the book knowing it would be better instead. It was an easy read, which is what I was looking for seeing as how I was flying out of town for 3 days. But I just couldn't get into the characters' heads/shoes so much. I felt for them, but not on a very deep level. I don't find the characters in his novels to be all that dynamic. I feel somewhat teased by the lack of depth & development regarding storylines and characters. I keep giving Sparks the benefit of the doubt, but I'm let down every time. I don't understand how so many people find him to be so moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy and highly predictable","review":"I have to say the beginning of this book gave me a big warning that the writing was going to be very elementary and to top it all of a sappy love story. I like love stories which is why I picked this book up, but the writing was horrible! I can't believe this is a best selling author.

After all the hype I finally purchased a copy in hopes that this time I wouldn't be disappointed. No such luck. The story is incredibly thin. The characters never capture the reader's heart or imagination. And, worst of all, why is Sparks seemingly incapable of writing a love story that lasts beyond a few days? I am sick and tired of woman (who life has treated a bit roughly) meets man (also battered by life); fall madly in love, but need to clean up one more thing before they can be together. Man dies during said clean-up and woman spends rest of life living on memories.

For all those folks, who do not believe in love from the first sight or at least love that develops over the course only several days, this book will be hard to understand. I do believe that love can exist in many forms and shapes and I also believe writing letters full with love endorses the feelings and can sustain the relationship over the period of time so this book was absolutely true and lovable to me.

It was a quick read (even for a slow reader like me!) and very difficult to put down. As with other Sparks books, you'll feel tugs at your heartstrings. This is a good book to read to escape the chaos of life and be part of a good love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying and quick","review":"This satisfying and quick read was just the thing for a rainy day. And be prepared to use more than one box of kleenex for this one--what a tear jerker it is! But aside from that, it is well written and the characters are some of the best to grace a written page. Granted, \\"Three Weeks\\" and \\"The Wedding\\" are my all-time favorite Nicholas Sparks novels, but this one is good too. Of the three books I've recently come across (and all were excellent--Birth of Venus, Bark of the Dogwood, and \\"Nights\\") this one was the best. I did like the other three, but I'm a big Sparks fan from way back and no one does it like him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love found--love lost","review":"Nicholas Sparks is back at doing what he does best--writing about lost love. Adrienne Willis, the divorced mother of three, is looking back on her life and realizing that she needs to tell her love story to her daughter who is grieving over the death of her husband. She surprises her daughter by telling her of her meeting with surgeon Paul Flanner who is seeking solace in an old Inn on the Outer Banks which Adrienne is tending for a friend. Of course a big storm comes and they discover a love for one another which is to change the course of their lives. Some of this is entirably predictable, but Sparks has a way of writing which captures your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have A Box Of Tissues Handy!","review":"This is classic Nicholas Sparks.

Skip this one and reread The Notebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo Disappointed!","review":"I am a longtime fan of Nicholas Sparks, but I am so disappointed by Nights in Rodanthe. I had hoped he would be able to come up with something new this time. I liked the past couple books, but to be honest they have been getting pretty monotonous. And nothing is new with this one. It's the same old story - a man and woman who have painful pasts meeting in some unlikely situation that just seems made up. And of course they fall in love and help each other get over their pain. I felt like I knew what was going to happen before it happened because I have read this same story before, just with different characters. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was hoping Nicholas could have come up with something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is He Too Full of Himself Now?!","review":"The Notebook is my all-time favorite book, but I have had enough of the same, predictable stories! Nights in Rodanthe was the last Sparks book I will read until he comes up with something more original and with that same passion he had early on. I think I found out why so many people are dissatisfied with his latest work. On his own website, he writes: \\"I try to write the type of novel that great numbers of people will enjoy. In other words, the novels I write aren't necessarily what I want to write; instead, they are novels that people want to read.\\" So he is admitting that he doesn't write from a deep inner passion, rather he just uses a formula to create a story for the masses. That explains it. If you want to see ego in action, take a tour through his site. Me, me, me, aren't I great?! I miss the Nicholas of old!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"well below his bar of excellence","review":"It is obtuse to belittle an author for writing in the same style and genre that has been so successful for them in the past. When you buy a Nicholas Sparks novel, this is the kind of literature you will read---it ain't Hemmingway. However, formulaic writing doesn't mean knocking off your own best efforts and that of other successful authors. This book could rightfully be called \\"NOTEBOOK IN A BOTTLE IS FOUND UNDER THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY.\\" The one sin that installment writers must be chastised for is: Predictability. To Mr. Sparks then I must say, \\"Shame; shame,\\" and \\"Tisk-tisk\\" for this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There, Done That...","review":"I told myself that I would give Nicholas one more chance. I have always scoffed at his critics, but maybe they are right after all. How many times have we seen this before? A man and woman trying to escape their past, meeting and finding in each other a way to make a new future (Message, The Rescue, Bend in the Road, and now Rodanthe) set in a small North Carolina town with predictable romantic circumstances (alone at an inn with a storm outside and fire inside - haven't we seen that a few times)...it is enjoyable reading, but it isnt fresh or sharp or original anymore, and I don't think we should settle for that from a writer as good as Nicholas Sparks. I will wait for the paperback next time unless it's different from every other novel he has written.

This book was boring. Typical Sparks. His books are becoming tired. The basic plot of all his stories are two strangers fall in love and one of them dies.

I like to guess which character will die before I even pick up the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Male Danielle Steele","review":"Sappy, shallow romance written by a male. Danielle Steet fans should love this new offering by Nicholas Sparks. Fans who enjoyed earlier works by Sparks may be sadly disappointed, as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete rip-off of Bridges of Madison County","review":"I was looking for something light to listen to while I run, and I was familiar with Sparks's simple writing style, so I put Nights in Rodanthe on my Ipod. It's completely unoriginal, though, aside from the fact that the two main characters are both divorced and since neither is cheating on a spouse as in Bridge of Madison County, the story is less scandalous. Other than that, everything is the same, from the fact that the story of the affair from years ago is now being related to an adult daughter to the outing to dance at a roadside bar. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"I have to say that I am a huge Nicholas Sparks lover. All of his books are extremely moving and keep me hooked until the end. When I bought Nights in Rodanthe I expected it to be just as amazing as the others...lets just say that I have never been so disapointed after reading a book. In the beginning I thought that it was just taking a while to build up the story line, but as the book was drawing to a close I kept thinking, um ok why am I still not hooked? This book all in all was extremely slow, boring, not at all exciting, and left me feeling like I wasted my money. As a great Sparks fan, I felt very let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"The plot seemed to lack direction. I've come to expect really great stuff from Nicholas Sparks but this time I felt disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow...this book isn't good","review":"this was one of the cheesiest books i've ever read. there were times when i thought the book was just folly and making fun of real relationships and as i kept reading and found out they were serious i just wanted to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nights in Rodanthe","review":"I loved this book. Lovely sights and a beautiful story.If you have to be in a hurricane (and I've been in a few) why not be with someone you care about. I cried like a baby at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check out storyline & sample quality of writing before buying!","review":"Oops! Poorly written 'romantic' story-long-drawn out, never reaches any height or denouement. Might have made a reasonable short story. Sadly,not enough time for relationship of any kind to develop,to begin-and end-with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawn-out tearjerker","review":"Never read anything by Mr. Sparks before, and I generally don't read much in the romance genre. Somehow, just picked this up at the library, on impulse. The characters are stereotypes and not realistic ... the surgeon who was too busy to spend time with his children, but has now completely changed his ways; the self-sacrificing, angelic, divorced woman who somehow knows exactly the right words of advice to give others all the time. They fall deeply in love over the course of a few days. Frankly, much of the dialog just sounds awkward; the story is painfully drawn out, as if the author was trying too hard to conceal the ending from the reader, for as long as possible. The mother tells her story to the daughter, and the story magically heals the daughter's depression. It's all a silly fantasy, and the writing is full of cliches and is overly sentimental. Just another sappy tear-jerker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Same Old","review":"One star at best. Predictable, same old story line. I felt like I was reading a bad rewrite of the Bridges of Madison County. I always read every book that I buy, but I almost broke my rule this time. What a struggle to finish the book! This is my first Nicholas Sparks novel, and my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book was a major snooze. I only felt compelled to finish it because I paid for it. The characters had no depth and I found I didn't really care what happened in the end, I just wanted it to be over!! And, worst of all writing sins, the ending was totally predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Is Nicholas too full of himself now? What used to be an exciting event awaiting his books has become too disappointing. This story is predictable. You know what the characters are going to say and do. It seems like he keeps recycling the same sympathetic men and women, just placing them in new situations that are themselves predictable. Yes, I expect more from Nicholas Sparks, especially when he is making millions off his devoted fans and offers us one more disappointing novel after another. Most authors write better over time, Nicholas seems to have gotten worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the author run out of money...","review":"...and needed to turn out something quickly?As others said, the book is written with elementary school emotion and a whole lot of describing what people were thinking. It felt like the author rushed and rushed the story to bang it out in time for a screenplay to be written.Not worth the time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip off.","review":"I picked up this book because I saw the movie advertised and I thought well, it might be worthy of a read if it was worthy of a Richard Gere movie. I finished it but I had to skip ahead several times because, after all, we knew how it was going to end so how did it get there? It is a rip off of The Bridges of Madison County and was very similar to Message in a bottle only shorter and with less story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Spark","review":"This book follows the usual Sparks formula. Man meets woman. Man has sex with woman. And, man usually dies. If you've read one of his books, you've read 'em all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I was not at all impressed with this book, despite many of the positive reviews by other readers. Although it was not completley boring and tedious to read, the main reason I didn't like it was because it was not at all believeable. The whole setup, and the idea that two people can fall so deeply in love in just one short weekend is ridiculous to me. Maybe it was because it only took about 3 or 4 hours to read the entire novel, so I didn't have sufficient time to really make a connection with the characters. Either way, when I was finished, I found myself laughing at the story that was supposed to draw a tear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Unrealistic and Insulting to Middle-Aged Women","review":"This book was not particularly well written or imaginative. It was totally predictable. My major issue with this book is that Nicholas Sparks does not know how to realistically portray middle-aged women. His idea of describing Adrienne is going on in detail about how \\"like most women, she never lost the weight after having children\\". He makes her pathetic, insecure and a door mat to her husband and children and then bitter and stupid about her divorce. Ater her transformation in Rodanthe, she becomes a saint, valued counsel and miracle worker. The transformation is too drastic and without any realism. Don't bother with this book. Like another reviewer, I bought it looking for a good read while traveling. Nicholas Sparks is manipulative of the reader's emotion but can't entertain the reader like a real novelist. It's a shame he makes money from writing such dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much like Bridges Of Madison County","review":"I've like Nicholas Sparks novels since 1999 with Message In A Bottle,but this one as to be the most dissapointing one of them all.I was like \\"Been there,done that.\\"Read The Notebook or his new one The Guardian instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting","review":"Sparks beautiful and haunting tale of a brief but intense love affair between two middle aged strangers proves that it is better to have loved and lost... We are allowed to listen to The story of Adrienne and Paul as Adrienne relates it to her grieving daughter in order to restore her daughter's faith in love and humanity. This short but sweet story is definitely worth a few hours of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please!","review":"I was in a hurry when I flew into the library to find a book to read on a weekend trip. It SAID best -seller. That should have tipped me off. I finished the book because there was nothing else to read....at least I am warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely worth finishing","review":"I read \\"A Walk to Remember\\" and loved it making me want to read more books by this author.Unfortunately, \\"Nights in Rodanthe\\" was the most boring book I've read in a loooong time. Sparks didn't get me involved in the story nor make me care a hoot about the characters. I wish I hadn't even bothered to finish it and am happy I borrowed this from the library so I didn't waste my money on it.I will definitely be bypassing this author's books from now on. There are too many really good books out there to waste time on books that read like bad TV movie-of-the-week ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Nicholas Sparks usually writes beautiful love stories. He blew it with this book. The plot is an inplausible knock-off of Bridges of Madison County. Change the names and occupations and you've got it covered. One weekend of romance transforms into the love of a lifetime that sustains her for the rest of her life? Yeah, right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story but too similar to \\"Bridges of Madison County\\"","review":"I enjoy all of N. Sparks' books, this one as well. Had I not been familiar with the movie \\"Bridges of Madison County\\", I probably would have enjoyed it even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable","review":"I was so excited to read a good love story, only to find I had to FORCE myself to finish this book. We never even get close to having feelings for these characters, I could have cared less about Adrienne, the first words she said to Paul used improper and unladylike language. Like she's not going to be alittle creeped out about staying in a B & B alone with some strange man she doesn't even know!!! How stupid! This was by far one of the sappiest, predictable books I've ever read! Sorry Nicholas, I won't read you again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have been a BIG fan of Nicholas Sparks ever since I read the Notebook. I anxiously await all of his releases. He really disappointed me on this one. I found the story line to be lacking. I kept waiting for the story to \\"get better\\", it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Wanted To Like This Book","review":"I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this book, since I have loved his other books, The story between Adrienne and Paul to me there were not believable as a couple in love, it did not keep my interest. I even feel bad giving it two starsHappy Reading Lisa : ) Smile"},{"rating":"1","title":"We've Read This Before","review":"I am a huge Sparks fan, but this is the last straw. Each of his novels keeps getting more and more predictable, and the writing just doesn't seem sharp anymore. Has success made him lazy? We've seen this story a thousand times. I hope he does something original next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"I feel cheated having pre-ordered this book, spending my hard-earned money, only to find a lackluster story written by the man who is supposed to be the preeminent storyteller of our time. Sure, it's heartwarming, but I could read a few Hallmark Cards and feel the same thing. I feel manipulated now and taken for granted. The characters are predictable, the circumstances contrived and the story so obvious it lacks any power. I think Nicholas has lost his way. Maybe it's time for some new authors who respect their readers to emerge."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER","review":"I ordered from this seller and it is now an month and a half later and still have not recied my book or any contact from the seller that i have emailed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nights in Rodanthe","review":"I was hankering for another good summer read and chose Nights in Rodanthe.

I couldn't put down the book and actually devoured the book within hours!be sure to have youre kleenex near by ....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Love Story","review":"I think this was another great love story by Nicholas Sparks. The beginning was kind of slow and confusing, but by the end I couldn't put it down. This story by Nicholas Sparks is a little bit different than the rest of his stories because it occurs with two older people who believe love is not going to happen for them after they each go through a divorce. This book not only demonstrates the love between a man and a woman but also mother daughter love and father son love. By the end of this book I was bawling for about four different characters in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fresh Voice Needed","review":"I know I will upset many of Nicholas' fans (as I have been for many years), but I think his books have become like recycled sitcoms. The same thing every time. I think he just knows how to manipulate a scene to drum up emotion, but it's become old and tired. I have been with him for many novels, but I think it is time to look once again for a fresh new voice. Anyone have any recommendations??"},{"rating":"1","title":"liked it better when it was called Bridges of Madison County","review":"Just an old story. I think Sparks got tired in writing this story. The book is shorter than most and i felt no connection to the characters. None of the characters were well defined. The story has been told before. I have never been disappointed with a Sparks novel, but this one did. I hope his next one returns to the wonderful work I am used to seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable Story","review":"Can you really imagine meeting this renowned surgeon at a b&B where you are the acting owner and this guest starts chopping vegetables, putting up storm shutters, picking up plates from dinner, making his bed, etc. Get real. Our own husbands would probably not do this at home although we might want them to. I felt this was total fantasy reading, which is great if you want something to read before bedtime. Once you start the first page you can imagine the ending. I know I did. Maybe this story fulfills a need in 40+ women who are searching for that perfect man and, as usual, the hero gets killed so it remains a perfect relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"I enjoyed this one much more than A Bend in the Road and The Rescue. For a great read, check out Sparks' new book, The Guardian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up!","review":"As is the case with all Sparks novels, this love story comes packaged in a small hardcover binding with very few chapters. It's an unbelievably quick read about two middle aged divorcees finding true love when neither was looking or thought it was possible. Sparks writes very beautiful, lyrical prose, filled with descriptions of all around: the landscape, the houses, the people, the heart. I recommend you read this latest title! Also recommended: THE LOSERS CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy sentimental read!","review":"Some of the reviews might say the book lacks \\"spark\\", but I found the book to be sentimental. Anyone out there who has been touched by the death of a loved one, can relate. Nights in Rondanthe, engulfs a world of strength, magnified and tied together by a mom and her daughter. This is a great book if you are sentimental at all. I think it could have been a bit longer. I personally have loved all of the Sparks novels, and will continue to read and look forward to the new ones. I'm sending this one to my mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better","review":"The best description I can give Nights In Rodanthe is 'Good'.I've read far better than this. I must say that as a faithful Nicholas Sparks reader I wasn't as impressed with this book as I was with, 'The Notebook', or 'A Walk to Remember'. Those two books were my absolute favorites by Sparks in terms of love and inspiration, but this one really wasn't all that grand!If you like his writing style read 'The Notebook', and 'A Walk to Remember'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Read","review":"Nights In Rodanthe by Nicholas Sparks was a disappointing novel for me. I usually enjoy Mr. Sparks books. My favorites have been The Notebook, The Rescue and A Walk To Remember. I didn't like the characters, especially the narcissistic surgeon Paul. It's hard to believe that he could change his entire personality in just a few days. Adrienne, the woman who falls in love with Paul during a hurricane, seemed lifeless and bland. I liked her better 15 years later, as she was telling her daughter the story of her love affair. However, it does seem that Adrienne and Paul found redemption in their lives without each other. Not one of Sparks better books. I don't intend to see the movie.Mary J. McCauley"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad","review":"I really wanted to love this book, I wanted to imagine a fairy tale love with all the trimmings. I'll keep looking. This was just bad. The writing was very unappealing, I felt like I was reading a high school student's romantic vision of a love story. My advice: find something else, even a Harlequin Romance would be more satisfying than this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I see alot of people were disappointed.

I've seen the movie version of \\"The Notebook\\" (one of my favorite movies) and \\"Nights in Rodanthe\\", which I enjoyed. I saw this book selling for fifty cents at a used book store and figured I'd give it a try, as usually the book is better than the movie.I was surprised at how quickly I read through this book. I haven't read a fiction book in a long time and found myself inspired to pick it up two nights in a row. I probably finished it in about 4 or 5 hours.Even though it wasn't all that deep, I really enjoyed it. And though I knew the ending before I even picked up the book, tears flowed freely at the end (I did however, like the ending of the movie better. The scene where she sits waiting for him after cooking an amazing meal was so sad and I was really surprised at the ending.)I liked it enough that I want to read more of Spark's novels. I am definitely going to read another one very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I've read every Nicholas Sparks book. Everyone has held me captive until finished.

But not anymore. I was hoping Nights in Rodanthe would be different from the others, but it's basically the same story yet again. I don't feel like he's putting that much work into it to give his fans an original, creative story to read. He's just recycling his characters and settings. This one didn't move me, didn't evoke anything except anger that he keeps extracting my hard earned money for predictable stories. That's wrong, Nicholas, you owe it to your fans, not your editor and publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't I Read This Somewhere Before?","review":"As a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, I pre-ordered this book so I could read it immediately following its release. I was very disappointed! Not only was it lacking in passion and surprise, but it is nearly the same story I read in \\"Message in a Bottle\\". If you're thinking of reading a Nicholas Sparks book, I would definitely recommend skipping this one. \\"A Bend in the Road\\" and \\"The Rescue\\" are far better books, with deeper plots and well-rounded characters. \\"Nights in Rodanthe\\" is very one-dimensional and predictable. It was a big disappointment for this fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already...","review":"same predictable story, circumstances that are forced and contrived, just the names have changed. i fell in love with the notebook, but i feel like nicholas sparks takes his readers for granted now. i never wanted to admit this, but he's just not that good anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finished it before I knew it!","review":"Sparks's writing draws you in.

Well, I did. This story was so sappy-sweet that my eyes watered up due to sugar shock.I had to remind myself that I wasn't reading Bridges of Madison County, the story lines were so similar. The characters, Paul and Adrienne, are likeable enough, but the plot is just too predictable. From the first chapter, this book's plot can be perfectly mapped. There are no sudden twists or turns or anything all that compelling, really.I have had so many people recommend Nicholas Sparks' novels to me, and now, I have to wonder why. I like a good romance as much as the next person, but I also would like a little plot.

Since I recall having been interested in seeing the movie, I decided to start with this one.I found Mr. Sparks to be easy to read, and the story to be immediately engaging. Adrienne was a middle aged woman who was left reeling when her husband of 18 years left her for a younger woman. The experience left her feeling insecure and unattractive. Three years later, while watching an inn for a friend, she meets a man who changes her life. This story was both heartwarming and heartbreaking.All in all, it was not a bad introduction to this author. At some point, I will likely read more by Mr. Sparks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one!","review":"I like romances; I like Richard Gere. I kept reading hoping that the best was coming. Nothing of interest in the characters in the book or the actors in the movie (I rented the dvd afterwards to see if I was mistaken). I didn't read or see any chemistry, passion or sparks. The author didn't draw me in, it wasn't a page-turner, but I kept at it because someone made a movie from it so the book must be good. I didn't pick up on anything to recommend the book or the movie. The book did not paint any pictures or plant any emotions for me. Usually after reading a good book, especially a good romance novel, the author has painted such good scenes that it feels like you have already seen the movie. I saw nothing in the book or the movie. When I got to the end of the book, there was nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors and I was thrilled when I found out he had a new book out.

The two main characters, Adrienne Willis and Paul Flanner were both extremely likable characters and I found myself rooting for them to be together forever. I don't want to give anything away but I will say the ending was predictable and not a complete surprise. I still really enjoyed this book and felt fulfilled when it was over. Nicholas Sparks has such a wonderful way with words and is a true romantic. I can't wait till his next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nights in Rodanthe","review":"I could not finish this book.

Upon finishing the little 212 page novel, I was extremely disappointed. Usually, I think Sparks can do no wrong, but I was wrong. This novel does not live up to the expectations readers have after reading The Notebook or A Walk to Remember. To say the least, don't waste your time with this poorly written book. Sparks lacks to go into as much detail as he usually does. At the end of the book, you feel like you don't know any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, flat, predictable","review":"I had not read a Sparks book before -- I can only say I hope his other efforts are better than this lackluster snoozefest. There was absolutely nothing interesting in the plot and the characters were flat and boring. Neither of the two \\"leads\\" seemed particularly special to me, and the story was so excruciatingly predictable that I found myself almost laughing at it. And, the \\"message\\" that this woman \\"learns to love\\" again, then shuts herself off forever is hardly healthy or positive. These two people are thrown together, exchange a few stories and platitudes, and wham, they are deeply and truly in love. Gag.\\"The Notebook\\" was a good movie, so maybe that book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"I picked up this book wanting to love it but finished it with disappointment. I find it truly unbelievable that the main characters were able to fall in love in such a short time with such superficial conversations and a couple of nights of sex. Life changing? I wasn't feeling it. Obviously something occurred between these two characters that Nicholas Sparks failed to clue the reader in on. Hopefully the screenwriters for the movie were able to fill in the blanks to make it more believable than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"too short of a story","review":"the story was too short and in a way too predictable. the choice was much better than this book.

Rodanthe is a pretty fast read, but I was somewhat disappointed in the story. It just didn't have the same intensity or charm that some of his other books have. It was also similar in some respects to Message in a Bottle but without the passion or longing. Although it's not the worst book I've ever read, I found it to be just \\"ok.\\" In fact, I took it on my vacation to a cabin, and although I usually keep all my good books to re-read again, I left this one there in their guest book stack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, not his best work","review":"I hate saying this, being a big fan of Sparks' and all, but it wasn't good. At all. It's my least favorite novel of his. The storyline was boring, and overall it was just a pain to get read. Nicholas Sparks can do MUCH better than this. If anyone is wanting to read a few of Sparks' novels, put this one at the bottom of your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nights in Rodanthe","review":"Since I'm a senior in high-school and I am out on my own it seems I don't have a lot of extra time to read but if I do find a book I am interested in, I find time to read. The last book I read was \`Nights in Rodanthe' by Nicholas Sparks and it only took me about a week, to read this 300 page romance.This book starts with the story of Adrienne, a woman in her early 40s, whose husband left her for a younger woman. She is having a lot of trouble dealing with it so she volunteers to watch her friend's Bed-and-Breakfast for a weekend since there was a reservation. While watching it the storm of a lifetime rolls through the small town which helps to create a weekend to remember.I believe this book would be good for all age groups of women, older women so they can compare their lives with it and younger women to see what can happen in later years.Overall I give this book a high rating it is a love story with a twist. It is just as good as The Notebook and The Wedding in my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't like it","review":"Sorry, Nick. It's not you. Maybe you had a deadline or something. I have loved every other book you have published, but this was a disappointment. For his fans and collectors of his works--of course you will want to get it anyway.

Nicholas Sparks has a true gift and each one of his novels touches the heart. Nights in Rodanthe is to me an inspirational novel. It takes two characters who seem so different and forces them to come together in a time of need.Recently the theatrical version aired and I must say almost always the book is always better than the movie. Nights in Rodanthe is a really good movie but it is always better to read the words and put yourself in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Night of Disappointment!","review":"By page 7 we know the ending. The romantic scenes are cliches without depth. Nicholas never established a real connection between Paul and Adrienne. So they had a couple nights together at an inn, but that doesn't translate into a life changing relationship. I am a romantic, but I couldn't buy it.

It is a very fast read because you'll find yourself dying to know what comes next. Sparks writing was beautiful. I found myself accidentally staying up until 2:30 am reading because I just could not let it go.I found myself relating to Adrienne even though I am only 17 years old.Sobbing through the final fourty pages of the book, I experienced something I never have before. Believe me, I've had my fair share of tears while reading good novels, but I literally experienced her heartbreak. I almost felt like I was going to have some kind of anxiety attack. It was a beautiful story :)- If you read the book first, I will forwarn you that the movie is a seriously disappointing follow-up, but nevertheless, a tearjerker.I'd recommend it to anyone :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Heartwarming","review":"I am not a person who tends to enjoy a \\"sappy love story\\" novel but I fell in love with this book after reading only about 3 pages!

Most of the time I disregard what the reviewers say. And so I rushed to get Nights in Rodanthe. But I am afraid they got it right this time. I should have listened:\\"Of course, the beach, an impending storm, the fact that there are no other visitors around, a roaring fireplace, and any number of moments that could have been culled from a J. Crew catalogue and a Folgers's commercial make romance just about inevitable. Sparks couldn't be less subtle in this harshly mechanical story that adheres to formula in a way that would make an assembly-line romance writer blush. Short, to the point, and absolutely unremarkable.\\" I hope Nicholas can recapture the magic of his first novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something's In the Water Down There...","review":"I have been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks since The Notebook and read his weekly updates on nicholassparks.com. I was skeptical of other reviewers recommending Shade of the Maple, but then I read an excerpt and more about it at kirkmartinbooks.com. It was amazing. Wow, what are they putting in the water down there in North Carolina! So rare to find guys who understand emotion and relationships. Martin is deep and he gives money to charities (breast cancer research and Make-A-Wish). I loved Nights in Rodanthe - I like the way Sparks explores different kinds of love in each novel the way Martin explores intimacy (between a man and woman in Shade of the Maple and a father and son in The Gravel Drive).

A WALK TO REMEMBER was the first Sparks book i read, and thought it was the most charming and inspirational story i have read in a long time. I had seen MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, but decided to pick up the book and read anyway, and couldnt put it down. But since THE RESCUE, it seems i am reading the same story over and over again.

Maybe it was because I had already seen the movie, but I didn't care about any of the characters. I felt like all they did was talk about the same things that are wrong with them over and over again. When I saw the movie I cried but when I read the book I just read faster, trying to finish it sooner. Also, I didn't really enjoy reading about 40 year olds in love. It may be because I'm a lot younger, but I just didn't care. I would have liked to read more about Adrienne's daughter and the husband she lost than Adrienne herself. It just lacked the chemistry and full-blown romance that I'm used to from Sparks. Nights In Rodanthe is probably Nicholas Sparks's worst book, but I know that I'll never stop reading his stuff.

Oh, Message in a Bottle just kept replaying over & over in my mind as I read it. C'mon, Sparks, I expected more from you than this.

Basically, a start of a story & an end...nothing in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"Sparks is a very good writer. And this book is well written and short.

And the Inn's only guest, Paul Flanner who has just sold his medical practice and has come to Rodanthe to escape his own shattered past.This meeting of the two takes place within the midst of major storm.

I wish that Hrithik's character experienced his friends working magic with his soul and will to live the way he made his mother smile as a child. That would've been great.

Moreso it delivers a quality message about the power of friendship when friends turn out, by way of their physical being or their ethical character, to be less than ideal.Also this film turns away from most 80's films as it openly mocks the objectification of women in cinema as those that attempt such actions in this film often have the tables turned against them.All in all, I recommend this film for anyone who would enjoy a light-hearted look at vampires instead of the gory and gruesome look given to them by modern media."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindless entertainment","review":"There is nothing really great about this movie.Yet I find myself watching it over and over.It is paced perfectly and never gets slow.Overall it is a good teen comedy that does not takevampires seriously.If you were a teen in the 80's it is evenmore funny to watch this movie.I would wait for a dvd version."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO !!!!","review":"I have waited for years for this movie to come out. I love it,....but fullscreen ? Does Lionsgate seriously think that we're that dumb that we'll accept fullscreen ? Even if we don't have a widescreen tv, we can still watch widescreen movies....that is, those of us that have more than two brain cells watch widescreen and hate fullscreen. They only time that fullscreen is acceptable is if it's an old tv show or pre-50s movie when widescreen wasn't invented yet. *blows raspberry*"},{"rating":"1","title":"good story but bad come out","review":"this is an interesting story but it sorta blows out awhile in the run in. Robert Sean Leonard is a great pic as Jeremy Capello but the other supportees like his parents and Rene Auberjoinis(Star Treak DSN fame), that fat guy and David Herman(Ninja Turtles: The Secret Of The Ooze) sorta downwash his performance, but luckily his friend played by Evan Mirand(Fight Club) helps this movie along the way. Cheryl Pollack(Pump Up The Volume) also starts, and what the hell happened to her anyway, I dont see her in movies lately, that is a bummer because she is hot. good 80's music and some good atmosphere also boost it up one star. just dont find some logic in here"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"I bought three W98 Registry books and this one is hands down the best.

I purchased this book looking for something about reinforcing the frame of a unibody vehicle, and found that the first 85 pages and last 36 pages are the same shock, spring, aerodynamic, and weight distribution stuff as every other suspension tuning written in the last 25 years, basically rephrasing everything from Fred Phun's \\"How to Make Your Car Handle\\" (1981) (And Mr. Phun presents the material a lot better). There are only 12 pages about the \\"chassis\\" or non-moving parts of the vehicle, and those really present the subject with such lack of detail and depth that anyone beyond the age of about 10 is going to be disappointed and feel talked down to. I suppose the good news is that it was only $12, which minimizes the waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"good info","review":"It is a good starting point if you are getting started into better handling and racing ,but this book is geared up for racing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Book goes over a lot of information in a very short time, but not much of that information is worth anything unless you're building a circle-track or drag car. Took the hit and ordered Stanforth's Competition Car Suspension."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better options","review":"Despite the title, it's mainly focused on suspension design and tuning. It has some useful stuff, but nothing you can't find in many other books, and there are some basic errors on it.I purchased it together with \\"Race Car Engineering & Mechanics\\", and I'd strongly recommend this one instead. Better written, similarly priced, and a far, far bigger density of useful information in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good balance between theory and practice.","review":"A good book that has an excellent blend of the theory AND practice of the subject. I particularly liked the worked examples and the fact that it gave actual values to the concepts discussed. The diagrams and explanations are clear and easy to understand. The book is not too race oriented but also very applicable to those wanting to make their road cars handle better.Two (small) criticisms: 1. Far too much space is given to the characterisrics and setting up of circle track cars ( left/right turn only ) which cannot be of general interest. 2. Pictures are included that do not add to the content in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can a fake antique rug lead to murder","review":"Ginger Barnes is helping her husband out with a problem student by taking him to a scared straight session with an intimidating judge. While waiting for the interview to end, she sits in on a trial going on in the courthouse. To her dismay, her old babysitter is on trial for fraud. They claim that he aged a rug and sold it as an antique. Ginger doesn't believe a word of it, Uncle Wunk was always pathologicaly honest. Then, all of the prosecution's witnesses start to die off. The defendant is elderly and on a respirator much of the time, not a likely candidate even if he was a stranger. There is also the secret cause of his early retirement, what was it and does it have anything to do with this case.This was a really enjoyable and fast mystery. The information on textiles was very interesting. The mystery has many twists, turns, and red herrings. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"I've really enjoyed this series and was anxious to read the latest installment. What a disappointment.The plot was extremely confusing and uneven. It seemed to flop back and forth between two separate crimes and a totally unrelated situation while attempting to tie all them together...of which the author did a very poor job. And the conclusion was very lame, being we knew nothing about the person and had no reason to care about them. None of the characters were well-developed, including the ones we've met before in previous installments. I finished the book last night, and I'm still trying to put together in my mind all the pieces in this jumbled mess.I do recommend this series, but don't start with this one...and don't worry about skipping it entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waist Your Time!!","review":"This is one of the worst movies ever.

This is without doubt a Jaws WANNABEE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really a 5 Marianas Trench film","review":"This odd apparently joint Bulgarian-US production is quite astonishingly bad. It has all the appearance of being an attempt to cash in on the forthcoming film of the novel \\"Meg\\", also based on the idea of the survival of the very large prehistoric shark Carachodon Megalodon in the deepest depths of the ocean (imagine a semi-trailer full of teeth where the driver usually sits and you have the general idea). Poor plot, bad acting, terrible visual effects and a joke of a shark. What more could one not want?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was cheering for the shark...","review":"This has the typical underwater movie plot. Animal of immense proportions lives relatively undiscovered in the sea. Only one person believes. Chaos ensues. I rented this one along with Dean Cain's 'Dark Descent'. First imagine my shock to find out that they are made by the same people. Not the same company, the exact same people. But that was all they had in common. This movie actually had great graphics as far as the megalodon shark was concerned. It was for the most part believable. The problem was that the story wasn't about the shark. It was about Spencer Northcutt (Antonio Sabato, Jr.) and the vendetta that had ruled his life. Basically, it was like a bad soap. I love creature features, and I love horror, but I don't like drama that pretends to be something it's not. This movie gets one star because of Grand L. Bush's t-shirt. (Well, and there was no lower option.) I would only advise renting this if you're a big fan of one of the actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little different","review":"This is a lot different from Deep Blue Sea or Shark Attack. I sort of liked the way that the shark just floated around the underwater base like a dirgible. The computer effects are better then many similar films but you don't see as much. If you like this kind of movie you should check this out once with the fast forward nearby. It's nice to see a pessimistic ending for a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thx_and_sdds@hotmail.com","review":"Mutch better then the first one! Scream one was good.

Ok, the actors/actresses are good (except for Neve Campbell), but the story is probably the worst you can imagine. The ghostkiller just looks silly running around and there's not even one little suspenseful scene, because all the surprising attacks are so predictable. Yeah, it's cheezy, but in the end.., not as bad as The Mutilator."},{"rating":"1","title":"tacky!","review":"A sequel to a mindless teenage \\"horror\\" \\"suspence\\" cult film.

Pass on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slasher genre is getting tiresome","review":"I watched Scream 2 to waste some time. Now I wish I had watched some other movie except for this one. It seems like the horror genre is again being permeated by the slasher affliction that infected the eighties. At first I thought that Scream 2 did so well in theaters probably because of its handsome cast, but then again, Phantoms, a much much better non-slasher sci-fi horror film, had a more handsome cast (with a lot better performances than in Scream 2) but had a poor outing at the box office. I can only think it's because many teenagers seem to want to enjoy slasher flicks. It's like they like watching some masked killer cut people up whenever he or she feels like. I have really nothing good to say about Scream 2 except for its self-parody but those times come very rare, too. I've only seen one good slasher film and that's Halloween. That film was an example of scaring somebody without using gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth A Sigh","review":"I started watching this psudo-horror flick the other night and turned it off after about 45 minutes. Completely unoriginal (so called) horror courtesy of Hollywood. What ever happened to real horror flicks! This movie was about as dull and prosaic as can be expected from a sequel.

Funny, intense and terrifyingly scary, these elements make up this above average sequel. Away in college, Sidney Prescott tries to escape her shocking past, but, history does repeat itself when a copycat killer comes to town. DVD Picture is good, but a little dark, and the sound is excellent. However, I was very disappointed to see that this was not a Collector's Edition DVD. The only extra is the theatrical trailer. None the less, this is a very entertaining DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed Sequel Lived Up to the First One","review":"I'm amazed at how great this movie was. We know that Billy is dead but another copycat shows up right after the premire of Stab which was about the original Scream. It introduced Cotton Weary the man who went to jail for murdering Sidney's mother. He was to eager to get his fifteen minutes of fame. Also back was Dewey, Gail, and Randy. I was suprised that Dewey didn't bring up the fact that his sister was dead. I liked Randy a lot because he knew a lot about horror movies but sadly he died. Dewey really can take a punch I thought he had died in the first one. Gail really changed and she started caring about other people for a change. This movie was great and it is a must see for all horror fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"a second serving to the ghost masked killer","review":"the second serving is thrilling and great but the badguy or I should say badwoman is a let down. the cast includes Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Jamie Kennedy, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Elise Neal, Timothy Olyphant, Laurie Metcalf, Portia deRossi, Rebecca Gayheart, Duane Martin, Jada Pinkett Smith, Jerry O'Connell, Joshua Jackson, Liev Schrieber, Luke Wilson, Tori Spelling, Heather Graham, Omar Epps and many others star in this successful sequel. Laurie Metcalf as the killer, come on..Timothy Olypahnt was doing just fine until you had to pop in. dont miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a horror movie","review":"Just another slasher flick attempting to be hip. It will probably appeal the most to people who think that talentless 'hotties' from 'Party of Five' or '90210' can act.This is NOT a horror movie. Horror movies have the elements of suspense and the supernatural. Watch movies with Vincent Price or Christopher Lee if you want to see horror movies. Scream2 is devoid of suspense or acting talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"ahahahah","review":"so bad it's funny, no punch at all ahahahahahaha i cant believe it wow. so so so bad it's so so so so so funny"},{"rating":"1","title":"1.99 stars...same as 1st but different wussies for killers.","review":"The movie \\"Scream 2\\" is basically just like \\"Scream\\". Neither movie is very effective because when the killers' identities are revealed, the movie becomes ineffective as a horror film.The killers lack any kind of credibility and are completely unconvincing in their roles. This movie also lacks originality, and in all honesty, really is not much different than the first. In fact, the twist at the ending regarding the first killer's mother is exceptionally bogus.I really, really, really wanted to like this series because it did have potential, but look at these killers? What a bunch of pu$$ees!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good thing about this movie is the MASTER P song","review":"I'm not going to lie, the only reason I saw Scream was because MASTER P was on the Scream 2 soundtrack. I liked it. So I was really anxious to see this movie. I bought it when it came out on video because it was from DIMENSION and all. They make those PHAT Children of the Corn movies. So I saw it, and it reaked. The opening scene was REALLY good and the movie itself was a LITTLE scary, but there wasn't anything else good about it. It wasn't funny at all. It just had this stupid dialogue and some psuedo-gory murders. SKIP IT! Rent Children of the Corn V instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ISN'T WORTHY!","review":"A really bad sequel.

Amazing!! Marvelous!!!","review":"It just doesn't get any better than this! After Safely planting the revival of the horro genre with Scream, Williamson and Craven take the liberty to continue this wonderful saga. Scream 2 is suspenseful because you don't find out who the killer is until the killer reveals that he/she isn't who he/she say they are. You have no way of knowing! That is what makes this film. More blood, as it is put by Randy Meeks, but that is only to be expected by a horror sequel.

Jerry O'Connell tries valiantly, and Courtney and David are fun to watch together, but this sequel forgets that it isn't satire if it's just as bad as the thing it's satirizing (like.. oh.. Friday the 13th Part 5). But worst of all is the ending: beyond stupid, it drags and drags and drags... how can any of the fans of this movie bear to sit through yet another LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG \\"Why I had to do it\\" explanation by the killers? It's not funny, it's just plain BAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequels DO stink, but this ain't too bad","review":"This sequel to the 1997 slasher/thriller has some scares and the end is perfect. However, since the first one was so good, I expected this movie to be a little bit better, but hey! it's good. Campbell is a little less convincing, but Cox is getting more convincing.

From a scale of 1 to 10, a 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Scream 1","review":"This was an amazing sequel that I love more than the first.

You can't help but laugh at Dewey..he's so funny! But it still wasn't as good as the first Scream.

The sorority twits are kind of funny too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally 70s","review":"This is the sequel to the classic 1996 hit that parodied the cliches of slasher horror films. A typical updated slasher film, yet the brilliance lies in parodying that which it is, a chessey slasher film on a low budget. David Arqutte is a Clive Barker look alike. I gave it two stars because my tastes have changed since I was the geek rooting on the killer. At one dollar, you can't go wrong for cheap slasher flicks, except it lacks the drive in aura of Halloween or even the classic icons of Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. As a straight slasher film series, this would be great, instead it's poking fun at the slasher film cliches. A joke it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Only Saw It Once, And....","review":"THAT WAS ENOUGH. I was actually expecting something out of this movie. I guess I was wrong. The final identity of the killer wasn't very surprising at all because it's not noticed that they are revealed somewhere in the middle of the film.

A few scenes were alright, but overall, this just does not make my day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still the same recipe that the public eats blindly...","review":"Scream 2 is the SAME THING than the first one. Same plot, same stupid actors, same boring directing and same conclusion. Frankly, this is one huge mistake of cinema industry. When I say the same thing, it's the SAME THING! Some parts are so unrealistic that I was laughing...the characters are dumb and the worst mistake they made in this sequel is that they killed the only interesting character: Randy. You can still see some not-so graphic bloody images, and the killer wearing the same suit. Watching these cute little teenagers getting stabbed in the back isn't very entertaining, but, maybe it's just me, but they made a lot of money with this film...and that's a mistake. The whole thing is a mistake...and it seems that they don't understand that, because they made a third episode...4/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"I liked Scream 2, but, as Randy said in the movie, sequels are never as good. For one thing, they SHOULD NOT have killed Randy, if they do make a Scream 3, they won't have any funny lines, because Stu and Randy got the best lines in the original. And secondly, the one killer, whatever his name was, didn't have a good motive. Scream was much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Scary as Scream but the suspense is killer.","review":"I thought Scream 2 was an excellent film, though it did lack the scariness of the first but not the suspense.

The sequel to Scream is not really bad, but it is not really great either. It does not equal the originality of its predecessor nor does it really provide the same sense of urgency of the first film. In addition, the characters are not quite as interesting this time. When an original premise is overworked, we are left with what could be considered cinematic leftovers, so to speak.

Well who cares, I want to be scared and watch teenagers die not be entertained with how cool everything is (If I want cool, I'll watch Happy Days). Well the teens do die. Just not very well. As for being scared. Forget it. You'd be just as scared watching Milo and Otis or the Care Bears. I am not a big fan of any one in this film so all the big names don't impress me. The story is o.k. infact it's the best part of the film. It's just that without being scared and/ or entertained then it fails.

First off, I thought Scream1 was a homage movie paying trubute to all the classic slasher films. So why are they already making part 3 then? Because people are stupid enough to buy a ticket to it. Its ironic that it was stated in Scream2 that slasher sequels always must include more blood and more scares. This sequel does neither and is one long \\"who done it\\" bore. This movie seemed more like a parody of the original with the copy cat killers seeing the film based on the original wreak hovak. Whatever. Come up with some new ideas before you steal my money.

What made Scream great was that it knew how bad horror movies are and made fun of it. Scream 2 tries to achieve this with a lame conversation about how sequels suck that deteriorates into a simple list of sequels! They don't even explain the rules of a sequel - Randy is interrupted (and the fact that they kill him only makes it worse - with him died the very essence of Scream). The chases are horribly choreographed - it looks every bit as if what they do is planned.

Yes! Plus, there is a truly scary car sequence and the end was quite the shocker! The killer's were obvious, but nobody suspects them because they're too obvious. The scene with Sarah Michelle Gellar was a tacky time filler, but it scared me a little the first time I saw it. I think that SCREAM 2 was worth the 15.99 on VHS, and the 20 bucks I just paid for the DVD, the movie is good, and although part 1 is better on most levels, it sure is a very good, suspenseful and new sequel that uses it's own witt to seperate it from the 1996 blockbuster original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly the best of the Scream Trilogy...","review":"The second film in the Scream trilogy is by far superior to the first movie and the final sequel.

However, with this and other projects like Dawson's Creek, he's proved himself what he really is ... This movie is just a retread of the first film, except what works there doesn't work here. Williamson's writing has the feeling of an intro creative writing workshop.

The best thing in this film is the opening sequence starring the fabulous Jada Pinkett. From there however, the film goes steadily downhill. Even Rebecca Gayheart can't save this one. One of the main problems I had with the film, was the casting of Sidney's boyfriend. He is completely unlikeable fratish jockish dull, I could go on. His character is completely unlikeable. The killings are more elaborate, yes. But the film goes on TOO long, and the play within the movie really sucked and just detracted from the film. There are a few tense moments, such as when Gail Weathers is being chased by the killer, but overall, not much tension.

Like the original, this is not really scary, as the obvious mortality of the killer(s) makes it more of a murder mystery than a horror. The Scream films tread a fine line by both satirising and conforming to horror movie cliches at the same time, but Scream 2 gets away with it the majority of the time, although certain stupidities still irritate (why not close the campus?). There is also a slight sense of tastelessness about this: the characters' deaths are remarked upon and reacted to, but no remorse seems to been shown. However, it can be argued that this is part of the ironic style of the film, which along with the solid acting and pacey script, conspire to make this a good, enjoyable film.7 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow-up smash hit!","review":"Scream 2 definitely lives up to the success of the original!

We plowed through medical libraries and whatever sources we could find in order to become informed, know what questions to ask, and try to decide where to go for treatment and how to find the best physicians. It was always a frightening, tiring and difficult process. If Dr. Cole Giller's book had been available for us to use, it would have made an unbelievable difference in our ability to make very difficult decisions.

I took it out of the box and started to put it together per the instructions when the wood actually split in half.

The images are not big enough to really see what you're buying. The keyboard is difficult to use, for me at least.

I actually bought it to get The Luck of the Irish, but I got a wonderful surprise with the nine other movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ty Power matinee Box-set","review":"At least Fox give Mr Power his place as their biggest male star of Vintage Hollywood. This box-set may not contain his greatest movies but it is most welcome and does contain some of his rarest performances.Tyrone Power was not the best actor but he was a great movie star and a very competent actor. It is great to see him here alongside Gene Tierney , Loretta Young, Linda Darnell, Joan Fontaine, Dorothy Lamour, Anne Baxter and Ann Blyth + mnay familiar Fox character actors.All the film transfers are good and it is a pleasure watching these films which have not been available before on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyrone Power: the last idol.","review":"Power was the last of an American tradition of handsome leading men whowere quite dashing, romantic and versatile. Only Errol Flynn comes close.Flynn, however, ended his career making low-quality films that were quicklyforgotten, half-completed or lost. Power stayed at the top from the beginning.Twenty-three years of working with high-quality directors, like Billy Wilder,John Ford and Henry King. Valentino is often mentioned as his equal. Power'saffecting charm and smoothness often left an enduring image in the minds ofhis audience long after they left the theater. This box set features hisbest work. Buy it and see a star who shined brightly almost overnight andnever looked back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyrone Power Matinee Idol Collection","review":"Great movies for the fans of Tyrone.

A very good movie. I'm suprised that there are no DVD/s I would give this movie a 5 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little gem that deserves DVD release","review":"If you read the plot line, this may seem like a corny Disney family film, as the American remake was. The original, however, was blessed by sincere honesty, especially in the performances by all, including the director's ten year old son and the aunt & uncle the boy is deposited with for one summer. The eccentric locals are not overdone, the aunt & uncle's gradually revealed nightmare is resolved, and an at times tormenting tomboy girlfriend is humanised, all through the presence of one ten year old outsider. This is a sweet little gem of a movie, as the French do so well. It will remind one of Francois Truffaut and Louis Malle films like Small Change, Murmur of the Heart and Au Revoir Les Enfants. It certainly deserves DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD version is available but...","review":"The DVD version is available but, unfortunately, it is Region 2 only (Europe) so you will need to have a region-free player or software and, perhaps more importantly for non-francophones, it lacks both English subtitles and dubbing (bien sur!). so you may well struggle with the dialogue. The French can be so indifferent... Beautifully photographed and thus greatly benefits from DVD as opposed to VHS.

And I get bored with most of the Cocteau Twins albums. There are two albums by the Cocteau Twins however that I think are a must buy: Milk & Kisses, Blue Bell Knoll. These two albums are so solidly full of intense depth and sound texture.

This is their least inspired work in an extensive catalog of many sublime moments. When you listen to it you get the feeling that they are just going through the motions. Nothing here is *bad* mind you -- just boring and uninspired. When you are used to having their music take you somewhere else you can't help but feeling disappointment. Absolutely unessential twins. If you are a new fan start with Heaven or Las Vegas, Blue Bell Knoll or their best ep Love's Easy Tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"more Cocteau treasure","review":"the Cocteau Twins lost me a little bit on here with the opening songs. they harken back to their darker days. once \\"Half-gifts\\" and \\"Rilkean Heart\\" sunk in, i was more assured in this album. \\"Seekers Who are Lovers\\" is also an outstanding cut. overall, this album has seen alot less play time than \\"Blue Bell Knoll\\" or \\"Heaven or Las Vegas\\", but still a wonderful album from a wonderful band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Au contraire on TH","review":"Not so much a review but a response to the last person. In my opinion, Treasure Hiding is the best song on the album.I love the way it just builds very slowly and majestically and then, bang, its there. And those swirling guitars just get me right here ( there, follow my finger)Have to agree with Seekers who are Lovers. A truly great song and yes, it has elements of eroticism about but then I've always fancied Liz Fraser!! Oooh, that voice.Buy this, this is real music for the soul"},{"rating":"2","title":"i miss the cocteaus!","review":"Although not EVERYONE knocks this album, I think I'm one of a very few lifelong Cocteau Twins worshippers who really, really likes this album. True, it is not as wonderful as \\"Heaven Or Las Vegas\\" or \\"Blue Bell Knoll,\\" but I find it much more enjoyable than a lot of their early work. It certainly didn't break down barriers, but that doesn't make it a bad album at all. I still pull this CD out and listen to it occassionally. \\"Tishbite\\" is a fabulous track."},{"rating":"2","title":"best album ever!","review":"This has to be my favorite album of all times. The beautiful variety of the songs, the music that creates rivers of feelings and joy. And Liz voice, better and more emotional than ever. Truly the best album from the best band. As for the remix version some \\"musicfan\\" mentioned, it is Otherness. Not a remix of M & K, but two tracks from M & K, and two others mixed into ambient versions.

At least two of them have broken off arms. We have tried everything from hot glue to tape and they won't stay on. We just refer to them as her handicapped dolls.

Very disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product Is Awkward to Use","review":"I purchased this product for my 80 year old grandmother with back pain. She couldn't put this on alone, an nearly fell over stepping into the band. I kept the belt for myself post partum, but this product is awkward to use since the white stretchable strap, under the velcro belt, is one solid piece. You have to either step into the circle and pull up, or put it on over your arms (like a tshirt). Unfortunately when contending with back issues, or hip, or anything else the product advertised to help, I can't imagine bending and streching to put it on for the necessary support. Otherwise the velcro design is nice. Two stars because the stretchy band material does procide support and the velcro design with a tightening option on the left and right side works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome on Tiesto in concert","review":"This is defintely a must buy for every Tiesto fan on this planet.Most of the music is just a pyramid of music how i wish he was much more aggressive on his styles though but however i give this a 5 star rating. Also dont miss on Special Guest featuring Andain - Beautiful Things (featuring Mavie Marcos),this concert lacks Tiesto dancing with Andain during her performance ,tiesto was alittle away from the scene i think he should have danced with her though and let the music play on the background.This would have captured more attention because Andain was performing at quite a distance from the crowd.Andain would have a great publicity on this one because her new record is just on the way ....look out real soon !!David from singapore"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spine-Tingling","review":"Okay, so I'm 50 years old.

I bought this because people were giving it 5 stars and I was hoping to get something as entertaining as Paul Van Dyk's DVD. He showed an eclectic collage of scenes and people at the different concerts he played. I would go to these concerts to be with likewise people, but to watch Tiesto grinning at himself in the camera while he made believe he was mixing on the spot was as real as wrestling. The constant angle switching and only seeing a few of the fans faces made me think they didn't want to bother with having to get signed releases. He spent a lot of time hopping, playing with his headset and flipping through LP's. One has to be really stoned to think that's entertainment.At the end of each track he claps for himself as if to say \\"let's hear it for my gravy train\\" (i.e. ticket and DVD sales)Most of the music is good stuff, but this is about the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect DVD for Attention Deficient Disorder suffers","review":"My recommendation, play the DVD and watch something else at the same time, unless you like every 2 seconds a different camera shot of the concert. Note to producer - Just because you have a bunch of cameras it does NOT mean you HAVE to use all of them and show us what they are viewing every 2 seconds! This video is almost unwatchable just because of non stop camera switching. The concert itself was very well done, not just your typical DJ spinning records like Sasha and Digweed (the WORST concert I have ever been too). Plenty of visual affects and lighting, too bad we do not have the opportunity to actually enjoy any of them any longer than 2 seconds. This DVD will now probably end up in my rarely watched pile. In the mean time I'll be watching Paul Van Dyk's \\"Global (Bonus DVD)\\" and Underworld's \\"Everything Everything\\" DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the beef","review":"all this is about is the dj be-bopping around the stage with him at the center poor selection of music no passion poor direction iI watched it once that is all I could handle.A couple of excellent dvd's are Paul van Dyk (2good songs and worth it for these two), Moby,Pet Shop Boys (both live dvds) Underworld Live:everything,everything,Sarah Brightman Harem) and Roxy Music Live at the Apollo are all worth have and multiple viewing especially if you exersice (like treadmill or bike).

As a parent I would suggest that this book only serves to promote feelings of neglect, rather than helping to resolve them. As for the story, there is hardly one here. We read many books to our children---I tried to stick this one out, but it is boring and dull, and by pre-supposing a problem, may even cause one. I couldn't read further having read \\"every night, just before the sun goes down, it reaches out its rays and touches every star in the universe\\". What utter tripe.

(Near Lyndhurst on the Gananoque River system, about 10 km (6 miles) east of Seeleys Bay which is on the Rideau Canal waterway in eastern Ontario.)Also: I had camped on a small rocky island which was surrounded by marshes.

Bear Basics has some decent info in it but the author challenges every controversial point without following through and proving his case.

Example \\"I'd hike in a Scottish kilt and cowboy boots before I wore bear bells or walked with a group of people that talked nonstop for 8 hours straight.\\" The only other bear book I read was Bear Aware and I think it wins - its a quick to read book and has a lot of facts without a political or personal agenda.

ALAS, it took my husband 4 trys to get this border up. Following the directions didn't help, then spray adhesive and then finally roll on wall paper glue. Buy 1-2 extra rolls, you are going to need them. For the price we paid you would think it would go on easier.

We were able to buy a wallpaper paste and get it on the wall the next day. However, my husband had to paint the bottom of the wall again to cover the glue marks left on the wall.We love the way the border looks so I gave it five stars.

I've worn out that copy and I'm so glad to see it again! It's tough sledding at first, but since the designs are logical (over, under, repeat ad infinitum), they're easy to understand. I designed knotwork for several costumes from this book to do in appliqued cord. I'm acquiring other books and some of them are quite good and easier to follow, but no one has his range. I'm replacing this one.BTW, I've got an answer to a question he didn't seem to have an answer to: How could the Kells illuminators see to work some of those tiny, tiny elaborate knots without magnifying glasses? My reply: They were extremely nearsighted without astigmatism. Sometimes myopia is your friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"His techniques are overcomplicated","review":"Bain's techniques are excessively complex.

A valuable part of my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, but Difficult","review":"Ian Bain was perhaps the first to attempt to create a \\"how-to\\" book for the \\"average\\" artist to learn Celtic design. This is a classic treatise, and no Celtic artist's library should be without a copy. That being said, his explanations are not always as clear as he thinks they are, and if this is your only source of instruction, you might walk away feeling frustrated. For the beginner, I find the books by Aidan Meehan to be easier to follow and more likely to produce early successes. I am NOT not recommending this book; there are areas that Bain investigates that cannot be found in Meehan's books, but for a starting place, I recommend the latter's books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great classic in English, but not good in Spanish.","review":"I bought this book because I thought I had found another perfect book for my bilingual son.

All the space footage was stolen straight from battle star galactica, the bridge personnel were dressed in swim suits, jump suits and sleeveless costumes, nothing matched. Now for the interior of the ship it was nothing more than the inside of a factory which they didn't even try to make to look like a ship, I'm surprised they took the time to cover the windows.If you just want to laugh at a bunch of morons, buy this film and get good and toasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"MST3-K Rules!

A bunch of stock footage ripped form other movies, an old industrial building, and lots of railing kills. It has some bald greasy guy for the bad guy, and a huge bulky guy who'd throughout the film, squeal like a little girl which was quit odd. It also doesn't explain what the mutiny was about. It also has some weird people that dance around and worship plasma balls. Oh and the \\"amazing\\" technology looks like a bunch of old apple compuers and some graphics of an atari game system.

Filmed in someone's basement with a heroine who has an embarrassing resemblance to Debbie Reynolds, Space Mutiny has done everything it can to reap the scorn that Mike, Tom, and Crow bestow on it. The only redeeming feature of the movie is John Philip Law's hilariously overdone performance as the evil Calgon"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one deserved to be on MST3k","review":"I can only hope that everyone who gave this movie five stars was joking. Why is it that everyone here reviews the actual movie on the MST3k episode page, and then reviews the MST3k episode on the movie page? Murphy's Law really got into its element here. Everything you could possibly think of to make a movie worse is here. I don't care if Cisse Cameron really is Cameron Mitchell's daughter, she looks like his mother! Many times, the spaceship looks like a factory/boiler room, and sometimes you can even see light coming through the windows! To top it all off, the crew must have had not nearly enough material to make a feature film, so they added the bellarians, who do absolutely nothing yet take up more than half the screen time.

Totally unrealistic, this book is a strong willed grandmother fantasy come true, but utterly irritating for those of us of the younger generations. Let me explain. This grandmother wears leather pants and is a snob in every way towards her very own granddaughter. The grandmother thinks that Manhattan is the center of the world, and that she is the only person that matters because she was once an actress. She cares more about herself than her own child and grandchild. Her granddaughter and her daughter are unrealistically wishy-washy, passive characters, and they accept their (grand)mother's never-ending bossiness without a second thought, without ever angering an iota. And it isn't as if the story were dealing with this problem, as a theme; it's just the 'backdrop'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to the earlier Mackinnon books.","review":"The plot of \\"If You Love Me\\" is basically the same as that of Ms. Coffman's earlier novel \\"Heaven Knows\\". Although I highly recommend \\"Heaven Knows\\", I find \\"If You Love Me\\" incredibly disappointing. In \\"Heaven Knows\\", Coffman explores in great depth the profound love that the heroin, Elizabeth, has for the hero, Tavis, and the resulting pain over Tavis' betrayal. In \\"If You Love Me\\", however, Coffman barely scrapes the surface of the relationship between Margery and William. For this reason, William's abandonment is much less realistic, much more painless, and much less heartfelt. In addition, the characters in \\"If You Love Me\\" remain utterly undeveloped. Read \\"Heaven Knows\\"; skip \\"If You Love Me\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ken Burns!","review":"As mentioned in another review--virtually no Charlie Christian here. No film of him playing, no photos, no music. Very amateur video and audio. Interviews are barely edited and go on ad infinitum. The interview with Les Paul is a highlight, but even Les needs edited. Basically, this a few interviews--mostly with people who have vague memories of Christian--connected by slides of very basic history--plus performances by players including Eldon Shamblin (of Bob Wills/Playboys fame)--but they are performing today, not in their prime--and not putting out the sort of raw juice that must have inspired Christian. This video is not helpful even as a simple primer on Christian's life and music, since the \\"history\\" it provides is very superficial.

I highly recommend this book for after the initial shock of the addiction is out in the open when those involved are ready to take those next difficult steps toward getting better. My husband & I were able to share this book with our committed support team as a guideline for how best to help us reconcile. Though it was only a part of our recovery plan, this book was invaluable.

The second appendix is an interview with Wilson's counselor, who is not a Christian, and is painful to read, but also insightful.Any church looking to use restoration groups to help those wrapped up in sexual immorality should definitely read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It won't go away","review":"These brave authors become transparent to everyone's benefit.

The back cover blurb sounded very promising and I was anticipating an exciting read. What I found was very clunky writing and a plot that seem overly convoluted and clumsy (where was the editor?). Once the main scenario was set up, that the heroine had been drugged and impregnated, there was no clear follow up. The first half of the book seemed to belong to another story. The conclusion was ridiculous! What sane woman would accept that ending? I was frustrated at every turn and only kept reading because I had wasted good money on this thing. I trust Publishers Weekly and couldn't believe an author that had such positive reviews on her other books could have written this story. I give it a one star for the gorgeous face on the cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This is the first review I've written but I find I need to warn readers interested in this book. I have to agree with Suzanne Kelly's review. I can't believe any woman who had been drugged, abducted, impregnated, manipulated, treated as a pawn, and betrayed in every way imaginable by her boss, friend, doctor and protector/lover (4 different people) in order to save a handful of people from a virulent virus would forgive and forget. Even for such an important cause. I guess there would have been no story if they had just asked for her help instead of removing all her free agency and rights. As I was reading the book I just knew the person orchestrating this manipulation couldn't be her love interest. I suffered through the whole book and was thoroughly disgusted by the end.

It is such a chore carrying on reading it and I decided to abandon it totally. Hey did Miss Forster really write this book. I doubt so. It is just not her style. Please enlighten me.

The book begin with a great mystery. The herionwakes up in a hotel alone and married. she does not any memory of the night before. From there it's too much to believe that she is a 30 year virgin who is now pregnant, doesn't remember how, and never goes to the police. When she is referred to Mark for help, she trusts this stranger with her life even though she has doubts about him.

Mark agrees to take on the case after an attempt to kill Temple is almost carried out in Mark's office building. I don't want to spoil this book for anyone that may read it, but the ending was totally unbelievable and I ended up hating both the characters because of the way the story was resolved!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong premise - but an unreadable book","review":"I picked up this book because the opening premise sounded like a winner--a woman wakes up in a swanky hotel room, all evidence pointing to a romantic wedding night, but she can't remember a thing. A great start, but Ms. Forster bungles this from the get-go with implausible plot twist on top of sorry cliche on top of irritating coincidence.As other reviewers have noted, the romance is next to nonexistent--just about the steamiest scene is between the heroine and herself--and so the book relies on \\"Outbreak\\"-style suspense for it's energy. Unfortunately, the plot has holes the size of a Buick, and the ending was pure, unbelievable hokum; a man completely manipulates a woman's life--creating jobs, friends, isolating her in a remote location and messing with her mind, and making her pregnant--and in the end she forgives him everything. Sheesh! A very disappointing read from a fairly good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This was the most inane, assinine, convuluted book I ever had the misfortune to read.

The premise was intriguing, and I wanted to know what had happened to the heroine to put her in such a predicament. However, the second half of the book was an incredible let-down. The plot spun wildly out of control, I completely lost touch with the hero, and I thought the heroine completely unbelieveable - particularly her turnaround regarding the hero at the very end of the book. I'm more than willing to suspend my disbelief if the story is good, but I want it to make sense within the parameters of the world you have to buy into for that to happen. The characters completely lost me, the love-hate thing with the hero's father was completely incomprehensible, as were the hero's motivations regarding his actions toward the heroine. A definite wall-banger."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"I've always loved books by this author in the past....but she missed it BIG TIME with this book! Could barely get through it!

Unfortunately, Suzanne Forster's book does not deliver the promised intrigue, mystery and romance. The book is slow. The reader wanders, bewildered, through the opening events, and understanding comes tediously, at glacial speed. The hero seems to be a strong sexy character, but, in the end, is disappointingly weak. A number of plot elements, tiny clues that seem to have meaning, are not explained. The entire premise of the book, when all is revealed, is unrealistic. The book was a chore to read, and does not make me eager to read more of this author's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissappointment!","review":"The teaser for this book sounded too good to be true. What a horrible story. Totally unrealistic and very frustrating to follow. As usual, when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

It catches your attention from page one and holds you there to the end. I read this book in two days, it was so hard to put down. I just wanted to know who did it and would everything turn out fine.

I really enjoyed her earlier books, and I think that this one surpasses the others! While the book should NOT be classified as a romance, there is enough romance in it to keep a romantic happy. I really enjoyed the plot line and I thought the story was well written and well researched. DON'T MISS THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Economics 101","review":"The book is for the absolute novice with no background in economics. The author explains events that have driven stock prices in the past, but gives little guidance on how an investor can gain an edge by forecasting events going forward. Perfect example: Coffee is at a multi-year low, Brazil has had no rain for months and Starbucks stock is languishing with the rest of the market. There's a lot more to it than just reviewing the weekly economic releases and buying stocks you think will be affected by the CPI number. If you have any experience as an investor, this book will not improve your bottom line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just boring","review":"Quiet Days in Clichy (Claude Chabrol, 1990, 120')American Henry Miller enjoyed a wide variety of sexual escapades while also working hard to establish himself as a serious writer in the Paris of the inter-war years (1919-1939).Jours tranquilles à Clichy is a 1990 film directed by Claude Chabrol. It is based on the autobiographical novel by Henry Miller. The multiple producers already promise trouble: AZ Film Production, Cinecittà, Italfrance Films, Direkt-Film, Istituto Luce, Cofimage 2.The novel was previously adapted into a 1970 Danish film, criticised as pornographic. Whatever it may mean these days (anything from showing nipples to sodomy for the masses), Chabrol's film is not pornographic. A lot of decorative nudity, like the 1980 Caligula, mixed with some acceptable acting.Only highlight is to see Stéphane Audran again, Chabrol's former wife.117us - Quiet Days in Clichy (Claude Chabrol, 1990, 120')'' - 28/7/2012"},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle to easy to break off","review":"We had this item put in our home when we built the house.

Even at this price a 10 pack will only cover a 48\\" x 80\\" space, not even the size of 1 sheet of plywood. A 5/8\\" (19/32\\") thick sheet of plywood, if screwed down properly, is strong enough for an attic floor, and very customizable. No need to worry if your joists are not exactly 24\\" on center, just cut it to fit. The current price at Home Depot is $21.97 for a 4' x 8' sheet. So 4 sheets of 5/8\\" plywood that covers 128 sq ft will cost me $87.88 + tax. 40 panels (24\\" x 16\\" each) of Attic Dek that covers only 106.7 sq ft will cost $444.00 + tax.

I had two of the 4-packs installed in less than an hour. There is an issues with the joists not being 100% evenly spaced, but it caused no issue. The tabs aren't flush with each other in all areas, but I don't see how this would cause any issues. I am buying 2 more packs to expand upon the area I've already installed.The main drawback is the price. 100 bucks for 8 panels is a bit pricey. 4 panels pretty much just gives you enough room to get in the attic and stand. Another 4 gives you a little bit of storage. Luckily I was able to use my credit card reward points to get 2 $100 gift certificates to amazon, so it hasn't cost me hardly anything out of pocket.I highly recommend the product - easy to install and it does what it is supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attic tire review","review":"Simple to use and install. Very effective and light solution for maximizing space in an attic. A little pricey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attic Dek","review":"First, the 24 Inch Attic Dek is not a square panel, as you might think. This fact could be important when you plan your layout. Each panel is 16x24 square inches. I don't know if this constitutes false advertising. So with four units you end up covering 10 square feet, which is not very much considering the cost: $45 plus $10 shipping and handling. On the other hand, the 16 Inch Attic Dek is square and contains 8 units (14.2 square feet) for the same cost.Second, the distance between the joists has to be within a very small tolerance 24 inches. The distance between the joists where I intended to install the Attic Dek is roughly 1/8 inch less than 24 inches (my luck). As a consequence the tabs were not flush to the joist and the installation was impossible. The panels did lie flat between the next pair of joists, but that left a gap between the attic opening and the Attic Dek. Guess how I filled the gap? This raises the another question: Why use Attic Dek?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good idea to use your Attic for Storage","review":"Don't use your attic for storage.

This CD sounds amazing after all these years. Its obvious that when it was first recorded it was done in such a way that the remastering sounds like a CD recorded today--the bass is rich and full. The booklet inside this lovingly presented digipak mentions that the songs were born out of the dissolution of Elizabeth Frasers relationship with Robin Guthrie. Knowing that gives the music a framework that only enriches the whole. Sure there is Heaven or Las Vegas, Treasure, and Blue Bell Knoll, but this latter CT album (along with Milk and Kisses) makes the case for being two of their most enjoyable and listenable releases.

Easy enough to assemble. Kinda cheaply made, but it is a budget unit. I did check out the competition (under a $100) at the Big Box stores and they were cheaply made also. You get what you pay for! I have used this smoker once and it did a fairly good job. The Pulled Pork tasted great,was tender and moist. I did find it difficult to regulate the heat with the vents in the lid of the unit. Could best control in side heat by adding small chunks of lump coal at a time and leaving the top vents wide open. Hopefully with more practice I'll get this part down better. So, if your on a very tight budget this will get the job done with a little bit of babysitting.

There was a huge dent on one side of the smoker. My husband had to knock the dent out with a hammer, since I intended to use it for Thanksgiving and wouldn't have had time to send it back. Although as it turned out, I didn't use it. The material it's made of is very flimsy and the seams didn't match up on one side, making insertion of the screws difficult.

Dear god, if I had to read one more simile I was going to tear my eyes out. Maybe it's just me (after all, I am a northerner), but I find it hard to believe that such phrases as \\" hotter than a june bug in july\\" and \\"happier than pigs in mud\\" are tacked onto nearly EVERY sentence spoken by a southerner.

This scale is not accurate, and it pretends to be precise.It seems that as long as you apply somewhere around the same weight repeatedly within a limited amount of time, you will get the exact same reading. However if you wait about 10 minutes, and apply the same weight you will probably get a wildy different reading and again get that reading over and over until some kind of internal timer resets.Another way to get wild readings is to switch off weighings between two people with large weight differences. We never get the same individual weight twice, with discrepancies swinging over a 6lb range.Although I can see benefit of providing a \\"stable\\" weight to the weight-obsessed, those of us who want the truth are frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk and lack of Customer service","review":"I thought when I bought this that both name brands were good to go with... WRONG. The scale never gives the same weight twice... no matter if you step on the same place or not. I have written two emails to Conair and they don't answer either one. If the cheap dial scale is right then the so called precision scale is 13 pounds lighter... not too PRECISION in my book.Buy something else!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so statisfied","review":"Its a very fickle scale, sometimes I get on the scale and I weigh 32 lbs other times I get on and I am 130 lbs. I am neither of the two. The scale is never consistant, and it varies on the day. I am active, and I wish I can lose 5 lbs in a day, however this scale tells me I can... Sorry weight watchers, I am not too pleased with the scale. I am on the market for a new one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst buy ever","review":"I cant believe it is on the market. One minute I have lost 3 pounds, the next I am up 2 pounds. Try this if you weigh yourself in Kilos , and a second later in Stones/Pnds it doesnt even match up!. This is going back to the shop ASAP"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst scale ever","review":"This is really the worst scale. It is extremely inaccurate. Everytime you stand on it, it gives a different weight.THE WORST THING is that you dont have to tap on it to make it work. You literally have to BANG YOUR FEET on it to make it start. The scale is not stable(one end is higher than the other) and so when you bang it, it makes a really loud sound.I tried keeping the scale on my carpet (in my bedroom) and then tried weighing myself and it showed my weight around 80 pounds less. ALL of the other scales I have used work on carpet AND on floor.this is the worst thing i have ever bought and its not even worth 1/10000th of a cent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not precise at all","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews. The precision is lacking. Repeat weighings show the same weight, unless you give it a few minutes. Also, I do a test involving a glass of water...about 12 ounces plus the weight of the glass is 1 lb. If I weigh myself before holding the glass, then after, I should weigh approximately 1 lb heavier holding the glass. Well, this scale showed the EXACT same weight, before and after. Not even .1 lbs higher. It's going back to the store tomorrow.I would recommend the Health-O-Meter Doctor's Scale...Weight Tracking Scale. I got it at Walmart for less than $30 and it not only gives an accurate reading, but it also is consistent, and when I hold a glass of water that weighs a pound, it shows that my weight is 1 lb higher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The real stuff!","review":"Highly recommended!

I groaned aloud at some of the dialogue and found the characters one-dimensional. The female characters are poorly drawn and the dialogue throughout is weak. I felt like one minor character after another was introduced every few pages or so and had little to do with what there is of a plot. I expected a quirky, refreshingly funny novel but felt like I was stuck at a bar having dull conversations with its regulars. It's Seinfeldesque in that it's much to do about nothing, but lacks the humor that could have ensued. To be fair, the premise did have potential, but the author deserved a better editor perhaps to guide him to cut more. I found myself pausing to read the author's bio and thought \\"A-ha...it's a first novel.\\" I've never written a review before but felt misleaded by the rave reviews on this site and wanted to offer some balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"i think these reviews are written by the author's friends","review":"this book is horrendous. nothing makes sense: the characters make strange decisions( if eric is so smart, sign up at a local college, raise your illegitimate child, and move on), characters are introduced for no particular reasons( grampa jim?), and certain scenarios don't produce the reactions they are meant to produce (the whole town thinks eric is rooting for the home team to win, so what? why is eric angry about that? he should be grateful that they don't think he's a destructive alcholic.my book group read this book based on these over inflated reviews and i'm angry.

Paul Murphy's The Wolves Of Islam: Russia And The Faces Of Chechen Terror deftly examines the disaster and the terrorist group connected to it and other terrorist actions in the region, providing the author's counterterrorist insider's viewpoint in analyzing the faces of Chechen terrorism and Islamic insurgent forces at work in the region. The result is an impressively involving, frightening, informative, and thought provoking survey of immense importance."},{"rating":"1","title":"sensationalistic nonsense","review":"For any one looking for a nuanced analysis of the complex Chechen conflict stay away from this sensationalistic nonsense. The book is an anti-Chechen diatribe with no footnotes that repeats every fiction about the Chechens as 'fact.' For example the author over and over again repeats the Kremlin propaganda that the Chechen highland warriors are fighting for Al Qaeda. This despite the fact that the Chechens have been fighting to expel the Russians from their ancient homeland since the late 1700s (hundreds of years before Bin Laden). This book is dangerous because it reduces the Chechen tragedy to an AL Qaeda subplot. The author deliberately misleads his audience with this shrill work that resembles pro-Kremlin propaganda. Anyone looking for a serious work on the Chechens should read Sebastian Smith's Allah's Mountains or Khasan Baiyev's the Oath and skip this footnoteless tedious dross."},{"rating":"1","title":"propaganda at best","review":"This book seems to be a synthesis of both Pentagon disinformation and Kremlin propaganda. There is no evidence that US forces have ever engaged, killed or captured ethnic Chechens in the War on Terror (though there were other muslims from the Russian Federation in US custody in Guantanamo Bay). There is also no evidence that Chechens were fighting the Pakistani military in Waziristan (though Uzbeks were apparently present). And the most ludicrous one, Chechens in Iraq, it sounds interesting, but I'm not even sure if Fox news would still tout that one.

When I encounter this book, I looked at its content, I thought that I should read it to understand the relation between group theory and physics. But it disappointed me for the following reasons:(1) It lacks of mathematical precision when it is really needed. (There is even a uncomplete definition eg. \\"reducible representation\\" on page 45).(2) The relations between physics and representation theory is not directly presented. I have passed hard days to understand the relations and finally read this topics from other books.Therefore, it is very hard to study this book without a teacher.

His tone is simply gorgeous and it really shines through on every piece. Playing Mozart is not necessarily his strength, but this album does not devote a lot of time to this composer. His interpretations of Beethoven and Stravinsky are very well done.Fleisher is certainly not a minor player on the concert stage even after his extensive layoff. Both this album and \\"Two Hands\\" are excellent even if you have recordings all of these pieces already.

The author obviously has an agenda here, but an intelligent reader will glean arguments from both sides of the abortion issue. Secondly, it is not an easy read. The issues it deals with are complex and the author delves into them in some detail.If you are one who wants to hear a comprehensive discourse on the pros and cons of late term abortion, this book will arm you with both arguments. If you consider yourself a liberal politically, this book will stroke you the right way. If you consider yourself conservative, the author's attitude towards your philosophy will irritate and perhaps anger you. All in all, this book is well written, though opinionated...It is probably great for a political science afficionado, but it is not your typical thriller.

Some of his books are among my all-time favorites. However, Protect And Defend is a a far cry from being among his best. As a matter of fact, this book falls near the bottom of the pack. Instead of being focused on creating an interesting and compelling story line with well-developed characters, for which Patterson had previously been noted, Protect And Defend is much too focused an expounding (ad nauseum, at times) on the issue of abortion, and does so at the expense of a rich plot. Too often I found myself skimming through the pages in order to search for the \\"story.\\" Unfortunately, this task became too tedious and unrewarding, and I had to give up on the book about about two-thirds of the way through. Unless you have a burning desire to read a treatise on the pro-life/pro-choice issue, I'd suggest that you skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG waste of time","review":"This book stinks. It serves as nothing more than a pro-abortion platform, consisting mostly of contrived arguments pro and con, which are always won, you guessed it, buy the much more thoughtful and compassionate pro.

Patterson treats both sides of the issue involved fairly, in my mind (I was as irritated at the anti-abortion characters as other reviewers were at the pro-abortion leanings). The book was suspenseful. The characters were well drawn. The plot was compelling. If you can get by the politics, it is a wonderful novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protect and Defend - Our World Today","review":"As someone who is appalled at the control the Religious Right has over the Republican party, as well as the Supreme Court, this book only intensified my uneasiness as to what this new administration will mean to the balance of 'our' Supreme Court. From the personal attacks to the court battles, I found this book to be realistic and compelling. Definitely a wake up call to anyone who believes that Roe v. Wade will never be overturned.In reference to a previous review, Mr. Patterson was indeed an attorney. Anyone who read the entire book would know that, and that he was also at one time a state attorney general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson's best work ever!","review":"Richard North Patterson has written his most compelling book, which is a significant statement given the incredible body of work which preceded Protect and Defend. He shows that he cannot be pigeonholed only as a writer of great \\"legal thrillers,\\" though he certainly is that as well. This book looks at abortion, politics, the Supreme Court through a complex and interlocking network of fully drawn characters and intriguing scenarios. This is a great writer at the very top of his game. \\"Advise and Consent\\" has been the gold standard of books which seek to protray and analyze politics and the flawed humans who practice it, and \\"Protect and Defend\\" can now be mentioned in the same breath. This is a great and highly readable book which will give the reader the clearest possible picture of how our system works or, sometimes, fails to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional literature","review":"Ric Patterson is such a mature novelist and exceptional court room dramatist that his books are literally \\"too hard to put down.\\" His legal training makes his dialogue realistic, and his skill as a writer captures the reader to keep turning the page.

This book is as good as if not better than No Safe Place and makes you look forward to the next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open your minds -- and your hearts! -- to this story","review":"I'm surprised by how partisan and vitriolic the reaction to this wonderful book have been. The Tierneys and the Palmers seemed to be good, decent families, trying their best to raise happy, healthy daughters to adulthood. If the decisions they made aren't the decisions you would make, that doesn't make them any less loving or concerned. I guess it's a symbol of how divisive abortion is in this country that the mere mention of it makes some people blind to the real message of this book -- which is that we should all follow our hearts and our consciences, regardless of the cost. And that we should be able to enjoy freedom of choice in how we raise our own children. That seems to me to be a very positive, patriotic message!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Preachy","review":"I'm a Richard North Patterson fan and looked forward to this book. What a dissapointment! The subject matter was interesting but the characters preached their views like a pastor on Sunday morning.

I haven't given up on Patterson, but I hope he returns to his terse writing style next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"intolerance speaks","review":"At the end of the book, Patterson writes that the 2 largest pro-life groups did not respond to his request for information. They must have read the manuscript and realized how hopeless it was. Patterson goes to great detail in investigating the pro-choice arguments but litters the opposite side with the standard southern, white, male, close-minded stereotypes. His blame of lack of research on the pro-life groups is lame and without support. He should have spent some time trying to understand the mindset of conservatives and pro-life advocates and he would have been much more successful in articulating this difficult subject. He ends up with the tired liberal picture of being tolerant of anyone who does not believe in absolute truth. And intolerant of anyone who does. He could have done so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong work, excellent research but needed editing","review":"This was my first exposure to Patterson's work and I was very impressed. His knowledge of the dynamic and process of politics makes this a compelling read. His presentation of the contentious debate about Women's Reproductive Rights is very fair. My only quible is that the book is just too long. When a sentence would have worked, he gives us a paragraph. When a paragraph would have sufficed, we get a chapter. A tighter narative would have given greater momentum to the last third of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Protect and Defend What?","review":"I am a loyal Richard North Patterson reader, but he has lost me here. This book is nothing more than a left wing diatribe. He puts forth no effort to show the opposing side in any kind of favorable light. For the same reason, I put aside the new Clancy book because it was a right wing diatribe! Defenders of Patterson will say that he took the extreme view as an artistic tool or was playing devils advocate. The degree to which he goes to paint everything republican and conservative as jaded and sinister belies that argument. It's too bad he didn't take some very intriguing issues and paint them with a broader brush. He could have created a truly evocative work. As it is it's just tripe. One reviewer noted the extensive research and the impressive acknowledgements. Look closely at those acknowledgements and you will see clearly where his point of view is located Sadly he is protecting and defending a one-sided point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"popular fiction at its best","review":"Well crafted, well written, intelligent legal thriller, with intriguing larger-than-life characters (including a noble, heroic Republican who, a la John McCain, survived two years in a POW situation). As a moderate Republican who is pro-choice but very squeamish and conflicted about partial-birth abortions, I do think this novel deserves to be judged on much more than its own politics; right-wingers who condemn the novel without even reading the thing (and I'm sure there will be many) do themselves & us a disservice and waste Amazon space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but VERY biased","review":"I have read most of Richard North Patterson's books and enjoyed them greatly. This one is equally as well written but I can't get past the obvious pro-choice slant, to the point where I can't finish the book. That he voices his opinions is fine, but I feel as though I have been beaten over the head by his villification of the pro-life movement. I feel also that I have been misled, as the previous Kerry Kilcannon book did not have such an obvious slant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!!","review":"Patterson does it again!!

Hollow men and women who seem to be every liberal's ensemble cast for political \\"works of art.\\" From The Contender, to West Wing, to Mr. President, to Protect and Defend, their faces are getting old - worse, predictable. Welcome to the town of left leaning fiction, where all the enlightened are Democrats, where all the evil are Republicans, where the strong are single liberal women, and the misguided are Christian or fathers (or both). This is fireside reading for the NOW gang - for the rest of us it's just kindling. This seems to be something akin to political \\"talking point\\" fiction rather than a unique, refreshing point-of-view. I offer two stars for medical and legal technicalities, which one hopes are accurate. Otherwise, this reads like a party platform."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Patterson","review":"I am now adding Richard North Patterson to my list of authors, headed by Grisham, that I will no longer purchase.

Patterson is off here. His previous books have had good themes and real characters. This book uses a theme and legal detail that he just can't manage to articulate into an interesting book. Save your money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"far left bias","review":"The author's leftist political bias is far too pronunced for an objective reader to enjoy this story. If you're gullible enough to embrace the political left's views on these issues (abortion, constitutional construction, campaign financing, etc.) you will likely find this book to your liking. On the other hand, if you are a conservative and a realist you will quickly become bored and perhaps angered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disclaimer! Amazons scale requires this book to be overrated","review":"A work can be slanted, biased, and intellectually compelling, but not here. Patterson's CONTRIVED PROPAGANDA for the feel-good masses should be a disappointment for all admirers of his early novels.How do you create a book Bill Clinton calls a must read? Lift characters from current events, vilify mainstream opponents of your views, and white wash your own extremist positions. Go to far and you end up with, as an earlier reviewer notes, a Masters and Killcannon... \\"so saintly and self-righteous, they are nauseating.\\"If you're comfortable with the views of gun violence and reproductive rights advocates like Patterson, that to use weapons to defend your family and your life is wrong but killing partially delivered babies is right, buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protect and Defend","review":"If you're a novice and you're interested in politics, this book takes you inside the Senate and explains the behind the scenes bargaining that goes on in simple terms for anyone to understand.

Patterson's stories and was thrilled to start reading this one that obviously laid out his Democrat leanings. The story was intriguing and well connected. It is tough to bring together so many different stories and keep it all straight, so I give him a lot of credit. I also like the pleasant surprise of bringing in characters from other books - it makes you want to read these books to get the explanations of their pasts. My main complaints about this book are that 1) it is a little too long and 2) some parts were kind of boring and not incredibly gripping. If you enjoy RNP, you will enjoy this book, but make sure you have some time on your hands and be prepared for a few slow parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham Who?","review":"Forget John Grisham who's novels have steadily been growing sillier and unbelievable.

That the word pictures he creates describing the characters, however, leave no doubt who wears the white hat. Patterson paints with too broad a brush, falling back on over-used, tired stereotypes...radical right wing, far right, etc. How refreshing it would be to see a writer use equally descriptive phrases as far left or radical left wing describing the other side! Could it be then, that most writers belong to this group?Therefore, I take umbrage with those who claim Patterson portrayed a balanced view of the abortion issue in his book. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Patterson's political agenda shines through and much of the information he portrays as fact, is as fictional as his characters.Overall, the book is as predictable as it is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potboiler","review":"This book sees virtue only on the side of the abortionists and sees demons only on the side of those who oppose abortion. The plot is fine; too bad Richard North Patterson can't write! His characters are cardboard cutouts who speak to each other not as normal people do, but like they were all reading out of encyclopedias. Patterson never lets an ordinary word serve when a six bit word can be used in its place. Instead of showing you, he tells you. Appalling writing! And it's obvious he is not a lawyer (or never practiced law, if he is) because his courtroom scenes are laughably bad: Each character who is a lawyer gets to give long speeches phrased as questions. The witnesses get to give long speeches phrased as answers. Not the way any courtroom I've tried a case in works! Save your money for a good author's books, like Alan Furst's."},{"rating":"1","title":"enoughs enough","review":"I have read almost all Of RNP's books and have enjoyed them very much.

If you want to truly understand just went on with with presendial election - read this now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"See story summary above.I also thought this was an exceptional story that took me right into the fray of the abortion issue. The characters all had their own personal feelings and their own agendas in regards to this issue. It's interesting to see just how this one issue can raise ones emotions to the point of excess. Mr. Patterson has written an engaging novel that involves some touchy subjects. With arguments presented on both sides, he has done an outstanding job. Protect and Defend is a good book with some strong characters. I recommend this book to readers who like to get the insight on how Washington DC works and to readers who like a good argument.Recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Maps!","review":"We found the maps and hiking times listed for destinations very inaccurate.

Professor de Levie has shown how this subject can be made more palatable for students. This is most clearly demonstrated in his discussion of acid-base titrations. By using spead-sheet techniques and treating pH as an independent rather than dependent variable, titration curves are easily generated without making approximations. de Levie's approach is unique. The popular textbooks dealing with this subject still involve the \\"old fashioned\\" approach, which is a pedagogical nightmare. This book is a MUST for all those who teach solution equilibria at the freshman and sophmore levels in colleges and universities. I doubt that it would be a suitable textbook for the students in these courses because of the detail involved.

It took me a while, but I finished Jackal, and it was pretty good, so I was pretty excited to pick up Grand Design, but it just didn't deliver. The book was just too long, building up for this strategic payoff at the end, and here is the worst part: I just don't think it delivers.

I also enjoy the variety of colors in the 24-count set although I would like to see more light colored markers to replace the overwhelming amount of blacks, dark browns, dark blues & purples but that is just a personal preference. The only problem I have with these markers is that they run out of ink too soon. I seem to be replacing them every few weeks. Other than that I would recommend these markers for older children, teenagers and adults that are using them for fun and not for professional reasons.

Granted, they are carefully accurate versions, but with Todd's own little twists along the way. For me, the result is like being at a concert and hearing the performer go into covers of old favorites that everyone likes, but with that performers own fresh treatment of the song. The keyboards on \\"Strawberry Fields\\" are fun to listen to and I love his cover of \\"Rain\\", perhaps my all-time favorite of Beatle songs. The Dylan and Hendrix covers are cool, but the very first song (Yardbirds?) is not a song I had heard before, and it hasn't yet grown on me. Of the original songs, I rate \\"Love of the Common Man\\" the best, but I still like to hear the live version of this song that Todd combines with \\"Eastern Intrigue\\" better from the King Biscuit album. Unlike the other reviewers, however, it is the covers that he does for the first half of the album that makes this worth the purchase price for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"more Todd brilliance","review":"This remains one of my favorite Todd Rundgren albums, one that I can pull out when the mood strikes, and play again and again and never get bored with it.

Some unlikely choices in the covers department, some strike me as tunes that most \\"regular\\" artists would not dare to try, but only Todd has the audacity --- and talent --- to pull off convincing and thrilling versions of classics like \\"Good Vibrations\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" --- those two being the most obvious \\"revered\\" tunes on here.

Luckily, it was short, and at least I have the feeling of satisfaction that I finished a book.Basically, it was this dark, cynical teenager philosophy of life in an unconvincing guise of (meta)fiction.

This thing is absolutely amazing. Although it is really expensive for a single blade it saves me money and a lot of time over cutting with dull blades. It cruises through hardiboard faster than a regular blade through 3/4 plywood.The one concern I have is that because it is so expensive you want to be careful when cutting so you don't bend/ break it, although we have bent it and bent it back a number of times without damage.If you cut plaster, cement board, or anything else that is cuttable but quickly dulls teeth, this blade is a no-brainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I got the movie because I like the actors.

However, neither one of us could sit through it. He was very upset that Rabbit was so angry for the majority of the movie and is too young to understand why.

The story is not linear - it requires understanding that the characters are remembering last Easter at certain times. This caused confusion in for our daughter age 3. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, Rabbit's bitterness disturbed our daughter and required continual reassurance that he would be nice again.The songs were nice, the animation fine. Since this film went right to DVD, I expected lower production values, but standards were well maintained. I think the film works well for older children, but was disappointed in it as a movie for our young kids, particularly since Pooh stories are movies that should be among the most accessible to the youngest audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Easter Carol","review":"\\"Springtime With Roo\\" would be better titled \\"An Easter Carol,\\" seeing as the story is a rip off of the classic Dicken's tale.

So the narrator takes rabbit(Scrooge) back in time to see the way Easter was last year. Then the narrator shows Rabbit the future and what will happen if he dosen't have Easter.Disney usually has an entertaining story that everyone can get interested in, but they failed to do that with this Pooh film. There also aren't any jokes to laugh at. Only small children will have a good time with this film. The two Easter themed episodes from the popular series \\"The Wonderful World of Winnie The Pooh\\" which are extras on the DVD are better than the movie itself.

This movie is almost painful to watch. There aren't any catchy songs, the storyline is stretched thin, and Rabbit's character is downright mean (I might even go as far as to say that he's abusive, while the other characters try to make excuses for him). The only glint of wit in it is when Tigger makes a Dickens reference, as this is an unabashed and abyssmal rip-off of a Dickens classic. Even my children are less than thrilled with it, and at ages 2 and 4 they are usually easy to please, as long as it's animated. The younger child is now afraid of Rabbit.

Unfortunately for him, he won't be watching it again. I don't understand why Disney decided to make an \\"Easter\\" DVD that had nothing to do with Easter. I mean they could have done a \\"springtime\\" DVD (as the show's title would imply) with their own made-up holiday, but that's not the case here. I imagine that non-Christian parents wouldn't want their kids watching anything having to do with Christian holidays, whereas Christian parents will likely be confused and disappointed by how this DVD repeatedly tries to explain \\"the true meaning of Easter\\" without ever even alluding to Christian doctrine. I certainly don't look to Disney for spiritual enlightenment, but neither do I expect from them such pointless and confusing children's fare.

The storyline is hard to follow and the \\"lesson\\" in this story is completely lost on her. I have stopped showing it to her because she has taken to imitating Rabbit's angry and rude behavior - shouting and all.

It reinforced my view of wasteful use of land for housing that takes people a long way from services and does not foster a sense of community. I live in New Zealand and we are big users of fossil fuels."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope the predictions are wrong","review":"I really hope the predictions in this DVD do not come true, however, I just cannot see how they won't.Call me a pessimist, but our entire country is set up as a car friendly suburban culture, so a big increase in oil prices will dramatically change how we live and conduct day to day business. The groups that will be hit the hardest will will suburban dwellers, because the 50 mile commute will become too expensive.Like I said,I hope the predictions are wrong, but I am having trouble finding reasons why they won't come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suburbia, the slums of the future","review":"This documentary examines the history of suburban life and the wisdom of this distinctly American way of life in the context of the peaking of conventional oil. It clarifies the choices we made as a society and the consequences we are facing: drastic reduction of our energy supply, reduced standard of living, increased use of the military in seeking oil, extreme rise in food prices, likely social chaos. The film encourages us to stop our denial and begin moving in a sustainable direction now. As for the suburbs, they are \\"the slums of the future.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The End of Suburbia","review":"I grew-up in the suburbs about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. I had forgotten about those long ago days during the 1950s when almost everything seemed so inexpensive especially gasoline. I started to drive my 56 Chevy in 1964 when gas was 19 cents per gallon and all my friends were buying cars and we drove every where, every day, without ever knowing we were burning up a non-renewable resource. This DVD opened my mind to change my life style and to learn a more green life-style. I'm now sharing this DVD with my friends, many who also grew-up during the fabulous 1950s, urging them to also look at how they live our American life style, and be less wasteful in our pursuit of happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peak Oil - A Turning Point for Mankind...","review":"A well done DVD that includes interviews of many of the leading experts on the issue of peak oil. Once oil demand exceeds supply (which is very close to happening), we will be living in a very different world. The peak in oil discoveries occurred in 1962. We are now using some 84 million barrels of oil per day...Cheap oil is essential to the growth of the American economy. If the US doesn't grow 2% per year, it will no longer be able to service its debt...From plastic, to agriculture, to heating, to transportation, to the medical industry, we live in an oil soaked world...If you are new to this issue, goooogle \\"peak oil\\" and be prepared to be shocked.Showing this video to your friends and family is probably the best way to convince them of the coming emergency..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sobering view of the American Dream","review":"This is an excellent film that depicts America's dependence on fossil fuels and the concept of peak oil that Shell geologist M.

However, I have heard a rumor that a sequel might be released that addresses this very question!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not entertainment. This is required viewing!","review":"Whatever your political leanings, every American needs to see this film. I can't think of anything more important as Americans that we need to be exposed to more than the truth about this subject. I wish this film gave us some hints on how we can reverse the course we are on because it can be overwhelming. If we want to continue the good life, we all need to be responsible with our consumer and lifestyle choices. However you can't fix a problem if you don't acknowledge that there is one, and oh buddy...we have a huge problem on our hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of Surburbia","review":"Very basic program.

King's books don't bring anything new to the table. He simply repeats what was already said by other authors. Where is the research here? And don't even get me started on the factual errors in his books. I will give King this though: his books are easy to ready as his writing is on a very low level and I see how they can appeal to a large audience that does not have much knowledge on the subject. As for the rest of us that actually have acquired significant knowledge on the topic of European royalties, Mr. King's books are a constant source of amusement and laughter. Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it is cracked up to be.","review":"I love reading non-fiction books about historical figures, so I was eager to get my hand on \\"The Court of the Last Tsar\\" by Greg King. All I can say is it was a complete waste of my time and money. One thing I hate is when an author constantly lets readers know his own personal opinion of the person or person he is writng about. It is quite clear that Greg King strongly dislikes the Romanovs, especially Empress Alexandra. For example, he criticizes everything about this woman, including her taste in furniture! If you are just starting to learn about the Romanovs, don't bother with this book. Greg King does not let readers know what is fact and what is his own negative opinion, therefore readers new to this subject will be sadly misguided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but trivial...","review":"This book is strictly for summer beach reading: a lengthy gossip session (that is sometimes endless) about people long dead who appear to have led extravagent lives with no purpose. Not one member of the \\"Court of the Last Tsar\\" comes out of this book with much more than a surface study of behavior. Although there are many \\"tidbits\\" about the lives of those in the court of Nicholas II, there is no depth to any of the material. If you want to read a light \\"history\\" of early 20th century Russia, with heavy emphasis on money, sex and social power, by all means, have a good read. For true history, go elsewhere.

Well, I was pretty much wrong, like I said, I don't read much, but I finished this in two days. The plot isn't what I expected; a boring teen book made for teens by an adult.

I own every SG book in hardcover and read them repeatedly. So why is it that I'm having trouble getting past chapter five--and it was an effort to get that far--in her latest effort, Come Twilight?From the start, there's little there to hold the reader's attention. The characters we've grown to know so well are presented as pasteboard cut-outs, and characters specific to the book have even less dimension. The dialog is stilted and the narrative voice does a great immitation of Charlie Brown's teacher. I find myself skimming even the high action scenes with my brain reading the first three words of each sentence and filling in the rest with \\"blah blah blah.\\"I hope this is just a fluke.

Her characters have more depth, and her sense of place is terrific. Her historical research is impeccable. However, she needs to come up with some different plot lines for the series because the novels have become predictable. The plots all seem to follow the same basic line: Sanct Germain is either already living someplace as a somewhat tolerated/accepted \\"outsider\\" or arrives and becomes a somewhat tolerated/accepted, he becomes involved with a local woman, he runs afoul of the local political hierarchy, he has to escape to somewhere else--sometimes twice in the course of the same novel. As much as I was intrigued by the picture of Iberia and its history that Yarbro presented, I put this book down before I finished a third of it because the story itself lacked something fresh about the characters or their interactions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best Work","review":"I've been a Yarbro fan since the 1970s and have every Saint Germain book in hardback.

I bought it because the average rating was 3 1/2 stars, but shame on me for not reading individual reviews first. I agree with the numerous bad reviews, and I find some of the really short, good reviews suspect.The book reads as if it were written by a high school student with a C- average. The content is pure tabloid, and complete trash.It's obvious that Halperin saw an opportunity to make a fast buck off JT and other beloved, respected artists without doing real research. He should be ashamed and embarrassed, but he's making money so I'm sure he's happy.This book is garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give This Book A Read","review":"Finally! A book about rock's most unsung hero. James Taylor's life could be a made for tv movie. Fire And Rain does justice to one of music's biggest legends. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

I looked forward to Halperin's unauthorized biography of JT, but was ultimately disappointed. It is poorly written, poorly organized, and unbalanced. Halperin writes more about Mr. Taylor's sex life than he does his music. An entire chapter is devoted to his relationship with Joni Mitchell, and over a third discusses in boring detail his marriage to Carly Simon. Three quarters of the book covers Mr. Taylor's life from the age of 18 to 30 with little on the last 20 years of his life!I give Mr. Halperin one star for the obvious work he put into the book and another star for the little bit of insight I gained into Mr. Taylor's life. For true JT fans who want to learn more about him, I would recommend sticking to the numerous interviews he has given over the years, or better yet, just listen to his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Difficult Read","review":"I read this as a casual fan of JT, and a person who enjoys the biography genre. It was a difficult read - Halperin jumps from thought to unrelated thought like a frog hopping from lily pad to lily pad. He considers \\"a fan said\\" to be verification and documentation of his odd suppositions. In the introduction, he lists people interviewed for the book, yet most of these are never mentioned in the text of the book.The sex, drugs and mental illness themes are harrangued constantly throughout the book, with little to no validation (it couldn't be THAT hard to have found SOME, and it's not worth mentioning the rest.) Misspellings of names, of words and poor grammar is rife.This is a poorly written and edited book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Artist, Bad Writing","review":"Positive feelings about James Taylor himself are the only reason I can imagine someone giving a positive review to this book. There is certainly a lot of information presented, but most of it is either rehashes of previously published interviews or \\"friend of a friend\\" stories. The writing style is pedestrian at best, thoroughly graceless and awkward most of the time, and repetitive to an extreme degree, as has been mentioned in many other reviews (so I guess I'm being redundant, too). Even the chapter titles (e.g. \\"Joni Mitchell, The Woman He Loved Too Much\\") are bad.The publisher and \\"editor(s)\\" of this mess must only be out to gouge money out of Mr. Taylor's adoring public by being the first to release his biography, since they obviously didn't make the effort to produce a book worthy of the artist or his fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire and Pain","review":"As a fan of James Taylor for some years, this book was painful to attempt to read. The book is so poorly written and organized that it is difficult to follow. Clearly only a dedicated fan would even try to finish the book. The book is an embarrassment. It is a major disappointment and shame that such a poor effort was published. More emphasis should have been placed on Mr. Taylor's incredible talent and musical growth rather than countless repitition of his sexual exploits. It is of little surprise and less consequence that a music star in the 70s had numerous sexual encounters. It would have been more interesting to hear about experiences that influenced particular songs. My 10 year old son writes better than Mr. Halperin. This book wasted my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love JT","review":"AFter reading Halperin's book, I love JT more than ever. What a caring, compassionate person. Halperin is fair, portraying JT as a musical genius who has had his share of ups and downs throughout the years.

This book is an insult to the man, his family, his friends and his music. It is so poorly researched, it doesn't say much for the Rolling Stone Magazine Award for Investigative Journalism if they gave THIS author their award. Were they on the same dope James used to enjoy! It is so poorly written, does not flow in anything like a sensible order (and is often incorrect for when events actually happened), is repetitive and is based on supposedly suggested comments. The factual errors are laughable. Don't waste your money on this book! To the author, get Sheila Weller's 'Girls Like Us' and learn how to write a well researched biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't give up your day job-Mr. Halperin","review":"I appreciate that someone has attempted to write the Bio of the legendary JT, as he is an amazing, charasmatic artist. No offense, but the writing is terrible. It is repetitive, boring, and Mr. Halperin has interviewed more fans then insiders privy to JT. I can't even finish the last chapter. Readers, wait until the man himself (James Taylor) does his own autobiography instead of a poor \\"guesstimated\\" version of it by someone who obviously hasn't done his homework. He really must have slept through his writing classes in college. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and inaccurate","review":"I was delighted to find a published JT bio, but Halperin's book is a wasted opportunity and a major disappointment. It is trite, rife with errors, and ultimately favors tawdry gossip over analysis of the considerable substance of JT's songs, musicianship and politics. The author (himself clearly not a knowledgeable fan) relies chiefly upon old press reports, speculation and opinions excerpted from JT fan sites, and interviews with peripheral figures. Not surprisingly, this yields little of value, and the result is neither an informative biography nor a critical appraisal of JT's work. JT (& his fans) deserve a professionally crafted biography and an illuminating study of his art. Sorry to say that this doesn't come close; I'm surprised that it was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As an avid reader, I too was very disappointed in this book. Like most people that probably purchased this book, I am a James Taylor fan that was anxious to learn a new perspective on his life and his music. The two stars rating was based only on the subject matter- JT. It is poorly written and organized, the message is unclear, and you must first wade through piles of irrelevant information just to get to the topic at hand- what Shania Twain was wearing to the Billboard awards, for example, has nothing to do with JT's character or life. I forced myself to finish the book, but stopped often to regurgitate my disgust of his writing style to my husband...."},{"rating":"1","title":"JT would HATE it!","review":"Those who liked it must enjoy reading tabloids. After I read it I couldn't wait to get rid of it. I felt guilty because I learned things about JT that I shouldn't know. The folks who are waiting for his autobiography shouldn't hold their breath. One of the reasons I respect him so much is that he guards his privicy."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not bother!","review":"Fire and Rain: The James Taylor Story This book offended me! It is poorly written, out of sequence, and full of grammatical and spelling errors. If it was Ian Halperin's point to show that he is capable of regurgitating tabloid magazine accounts and conducting fifth party interviews, he was successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinko","review":"I'm not sure where to begin in registering my displeasure with this poor excuse for a bio. It is so full of typos and grammatical errors it is difficult to wade through but once you do, you realize it wasn't worth the effort.Almost all the info was just copied from previous articles about JT with the exception of the quotes that the author had to have invented, they just ring so false.And while we're on the subject, the amazon five star reviews by readers who supposedly read the book share a very similar syntax with the author of the book. Coincidentally, none of them have names, only locations. Draw your own conclusions but very suspicious.Other than that, I suppose new JT fans might still want to read this book because there is some interesting stuff in here which most long-time fans already know about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!!","review":"I have only read a couple chapters of \\"fire & Rain\\". I am not sure I'll be able to finish it. It is very poorly written and researched. I was really looking forward to this biography and I am terribly disappointed. I only gave this garbage 1 star because there are no negative star ratings available. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Music World's Bright Side","review":"Nobody serves as a better ambassador to the music industry than James Taylor. After reading this book, it's even more clear how much class and talent Taylor actually has. Well-written and researched, Fire and Rain should be read by every music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book but hate to admit that it wasn't worth the time it took. Any true JT fan already knows at least 90% of the information included and can recognize the inaccuracies included. I also was particularly annoyed by all the errors - I'm no English major but please -- was this proof-read at all? JT, second only to the Beatles in my book, deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to know JT, wait for him to tell it!","review":"I read this book out of curiousity, knowing that James Taylor has claimed that he'd never write an autobiography...as he said, if you want to know about his life listen to his music. Though the book attempts to sound informative, enlightening and true, it's not. I became annoyed at the lack of proofreading by the publishers (all kinds of grammatical errors and typos) and the inconsistant research. Any true fan or followers of JT's work and life would know that Carly was never a blonde when she met JT or during their marriage and the \\"real\\" story behind the writing of \\"Sweet Baby James.\\" After all, JT has said it enough in interviews. I found this book just another one of many books written by an author to make himself look like an authority. There was also a comparison chapter I found unnecessary. The true authority is James Taylor. I'll wait till he decides to end his silence and give us the real story. A very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, loose and unreadable","review":"There is hardly a pleasant moment in this loose, tabloid, second-hand look at James Taylor. No wonder there were problems getting it published. \\"His face was beaming and his heart beating wildly with excitement ...\\", really! For an author who had virtually no contact with his subject, this seems -- well -- a bit \\"subjective.\\" I read the book; it was unreadable. You may think James comes out badly in this book; for sure, it is the Author who fares worst in this shallow tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...for laughs!","review":"There are so many reviews here, and the bad ones pretty much have the topic covered. I'll just add that after I read that Carly Simon was flirting and possibly having an affair with Pablo Picasso in 1980 (when he had been dead for nine years) I lost a lot of faith in any of the other facts the book reported. If you have a slow internet connection, then this book might be worthwhile - it provides about exactly the same content you would find on a James Taylor web board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading the book! - Wait for JT's version","review":"As an avid JT fan, I waited months for the book to be released. What a disappointment! The book was choppy, disorganized, REDUNDANT, and loaded with grammatical and typographical errors. Obviously it was proofread by a 1st grader. The errors were very distracting and took away from the minor message the author was trying to say. What the author did have to say wasn't worth reading. The book contradicted itself throughout and skewed facts.I don't recommend spending money for this book. It left the reader confused. Wait for JT to write his own autobiography."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much truth here","review":"What little I know about James Taylor and his music is misrepresented here by the author. Many stories about songs written by James are not mentioned and others are interpreted by fans from a website chat. This is research? Also, there is no footnotes to tell where the supposed quotes came from. I could write a book this way. Also, the quotes used in the book are attributed to anonymous sources. This makes it easier to write. It doesn't take much to state things you know aren't true to make a point that isn't true. The book's subject is worthy of a look into his lifes work, but this isn't the book. SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JT deserves much better","review":"I've been a fan of James's music for a long time, and always wondered why there wasn't a biography of such a popular performer. One could argue that the songs themselves are so biographical, no book is needed. Too bad one didn't argue that with this author. The other negative reviews hit the nail on the head--James is a great subject to draw a portrait of, but this author has no idea of the talents he lacks. There's much more to biographical writing than names, dates and stories. Maybe now someone worthy will pick up the pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly written, dull, and not proof-read","review":"This was a terribly written book with countless spelling, grammar, tense, and common sense mistakes. There were even words missing from sentences. Clearly no one edited or even proofread this disaster.I learned very little about JT that I didn't already know, despite reading all 261 pages. Thankfully, I borrowed it from the public library and didn't waste a cent on this book.And by the way, I rarely give reviews this negative. But I felt like I needed to warn people before they spent any money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah","review":"I was really curious about this one, and buying it, I thought... \\"Wow. I've always been Curious about him.\\" Well, this book gives you a few answers, but for the most part it's a boring look at an obviously exciting and dramatic life story. And what is up with Halperin's ridiculous over-use of \\"Taylor\\" to describe James. It's almost as if he has no real variance in his writing style. I would also wager that there are quotes attributed to Taylor that weren't actually uttered, such as this gem... \\"It's time for me to express myself with my music now.\\" I mean, come on...Who Says That? No one. Sorry Halperin. Stick to covering Dead Grunge rockers,'cause that's really your forte. Useless Claptrap, and a waste of American Dollareedoos. For Shaaaaame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody Help Halperin!","review":"What I learned by reading this book:1) Ian Halperin has mastered the CUT and PASTE functions on his computer. Much of the material was regurgitation of unoriginal work.2) Unauthorized biographers must get paid by the page. Why else would he stretch so little information into this lengthy work that reads like a high school term paper.This book will satisfy the james taylor superfan, but really only as another piece to add to the collection. In other words if you paid hundreds of dollars to have a bootleg recording of one of his early concerts, you should buy this book. Otherwise, I suggest another source for insight into what JT is all about: James Taylor records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book about a music guru","review":"Learning by doing is always good, especially if you have good role models to follow. This book brings together a culmination of Taylor's life and music, and gives lots of page room to talk about Taylor's work in depth,his inspirations and how he created some of his best music. Some of the best-known artists featured here include Carly Simon, Paul McCartney and Carol King. Following along is easy - the author's writing is lucid and balanced.This is a great addition to anyone's music library. All you have to do is sit back, read, and you will learn about Taylor's life and times. And there are some great interviews through which you can get to know some of the personal motivations and philosophies of this music guru."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeping In soul","review":"With a decline in authentic soul sounds, there just really could've been a lot more to great music. There are very few artists though who have shown a great style that remains as strong as years ago. For a newcomer like Corrine Bailey Rae, she has a soft voice and a great style, and her third single still shows that well. Trouble Sleeping, the third single from her self-titled record shows a soulful uniqueness that hasn't been seen since Sade. I like this song because it is simple and brings out the feeling of her voice very well. Out of all the recent artists that've came out the past few years, I really like her, and I hope she keeps it up.Song: B 1/2+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I'm sure this game is loads of fun...unfortunately, like 80% of the people who bought this game, I cannot play it because my computer's video card is not up to the game's standard. Do not buy this game unless you know for a fact you video card meets the requirements! Though Buena Vista claims it is, this is not clearly stated on the box and it is very misleading. This game should be pulled from the shelves and reprogrammed because there are many, many complaints of it not working! It was a great idea, but some great ideas fail. You will most likely get scammed if you buy this game so I do not recommend purchasing it. It's not worth wasting $20 for a game that won't even load onto most computers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Hype","review":"I was so excited when I saaw this being released that I ordered it right away. Of course, I checked to make sure my computer fit the requirements.

Funny thing is, you then go to another screen for the explanation of what requirements it does not meet and my computer meets them all--and the game still will not install!

Not only can you go through the main storyline, but there are also mini-games for cooking, gardening, and stealing items from your neighbors while they are asleep. Another good thing about it is the \\"choose your own adventure\\" feel the game has. Oftentimes you can pick between two different scenarios to play out. The game is entertaining enough, but not so challenging that it could be frustrating. The only negative part of the game would be the decorating aspect. The game contains a limited number of household upgrades that you can purchase. I wish there were more options for this, and that things in the house could be moved around. Overall though I found it to be really addictive and entertaining! The game is fairly short; I finished the storyline in about four days, but it could be played again to try out the other storylines. I was glad to receive this game and really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this game","review":"My mom bought me this game after I asked for it, and I wish I hadn't.

I tried to install it for a third time. It failed one test but managed to install anyway.I played the game and it was fun but then I went to get off. But oh wait you can't save the game, at least not where you want to. I had two families; one restarted the game at episode six the other started over from the beginning.I looked on the internet to try to fix the problem and after doing what the website suggested it worked. But when I'm on episode 6 the game crashes at the poker game or time gets stuck at 5:00. It turns out the game is incompatible with Windows 7. So save yourself the frustration, don't buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably boring!!","review":"Didn't have any problems with freezing or anything, as mentioned by a previous reviewer.

I called the company that made the game and they did offer to replace the game because I cannot play it. The person was very helpful and walked me through some simple steps to see why the game couldn't play. The reason is, is that it is because I have a Laptop and he told me that you cannot update the video cards on laptops like you can on desktops. So needless to say, I can't play this game, but my husband and I have been wanting to get a desktop for a while now.

Too bad for me, I didn't read these reviews until after the fact. I found a bypass code online and actually installed the DH software, but then when I went to click play, nothing happened.

It seemed to me that he just kept repeating the same thing in every chapter, adding just a bit to it.I think they should re-edit the book and publish again. This edition does not do justice to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cure for Insomnia","review":"I want so badly to know what happens to this family of 6, but I fall into a deep sleep every time I try to read this book.

How can one recall, recount and interpret this moment in history and the lives that it affected without appearing to minimize or trivialize the event or its victims? Mr. Mendelsohn has achieved this in his book, \\"The Lost:The Search for Six of the Six Million.\\" By painstaking research and exhaustive interviewing, he has brought to life, in vivid detail, the 'story' of six of his family members and, in doing so, has given life to each and every one of those who perished. Mr. Mendelsohn is obviously a 'scholar with a heart' who allowed both the curiousity about his family and his passion for great classic literature to guide his formidable gift for writing through this process. Bravo, Mr. Mendelsohn. I look forward to your next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wordy at times but well worth it","review":"Reading this made me feel privileged to be invited into author's family. His writing style takes a little getting used to...a little repetative at times but his empathic approach to searching for his relatives in very touching. This story is so important as the survivors are scarce and their story needs to be documented. I'm not good at reviews..... The scattered black and white pictures seem oddly placed (untitled) but come to life throughout the book. One of the best Holacaust books I have read. And Daniel.....you are as good looking at Matt, Ha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandatory Reading for Humanity","review":"I congratulate you, Mr. Mendelsohn, for your exquisite portrayal of the lives and outrageous annihilation of those who are not only in your family, but in the larger Family, within which each being lives and struggles.

It was hard to follow the thought of the writer in many cases.

The author seems to be trying to do a multitude of things - tell the story, impress readers with his Jewishness, and use all of the words he possibly can. One sentence took up 3/4 of a page! The narrative is difficult to follow as he digresses frequently and it seems that he jumps back and forth between locals, people and stories. The writing is so convoluted one can not keep track of the individuals and events he is talking about as he progresses through his search. I tried to read it all but finally just gave up. He is trying to be James Joyce without the talent to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that interesting...","review":"i read the rave reviews and i bought this book. i did not find it as compelling or as interesting as the reviews led me to believe it would be. disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for about a week.","review":"This helped the hot flashes for about a week.

Not an autobiography in the traditional sense, Portwood instead uses the mechanism of story telling -- practiced over her family for generations -- to tell about her own life and her family in rural Illinois. Her account is touching, often humorous, sometimes sorrowful, and overall inspirational. Although Portwood explicitly addresses the issue of segregation and racial discrimination (as well as black resistance to oppression), her stories will also resonate with anyone interested in everyday life in rural communities in the 20th century. This book would also be appropriate for readers in junior high and high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"This book comprises a compendium of monographs on all aspects of coatings technology.

Or, it can leave out so much context and nuance, that it is simply confusing. I am a history buff, but not a Japan expert attracted by the topic and timeframe of this book. And I cannot say I did not learn anything or that the book was dry and uninteresting. But it was breathtakingly quick...seeming to jump through the decades, introducing and then throwing away topics and characters and leaving one with far more questions than answers.

Iwo Jima as a base for B-29s? Everthing I've read says that was Saipan and Iwo Jima was for emergency landings and fighters that escorted the B-29s.Finally, I would like to mention that to me it seems inappropriate to specifically review other reviewers.

Granted, the descriptions of the various species are above his understanding, but the beautiful illustrations and color photos keep his interest, and make him want to read more.

The filmmakers were obviously passionate about the subject but the film is so obvious with cardboard villains and ridiculous courtroom scenes to make any soap opera writer blush.Director Niki Caro (whose previous film \\"Whale Rider\\" brought her to international attention) seems out of her depth here and it just turns into a simplistic feminist tract.

She confronts sexual harrassment in her new job, which she desperately needs to support her two children after she flees from a marriage plagued by domestic violence.Although this is a straightforward story of a pioneering woman, there are countless understated touches provided by the experienced supporting cast, that give depth to Josey's relationship with her parents, her son, her friends, and the unsympathetic bosses.\\"North Country\\" is well-made, meaningful and absorbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOOOPS","review":"The video was defective as other North Country videos I have purchased.

Rules are explained thoroughly yet not too short and not too long. Not intended for beginners, this reference manual is very convenient for the user because of its modular approach. Modules can be approached in any sequence as they are complete self-contained units independent of eachother. In cases where the grammatical topics of one module influence another, the author was sure to add references for the reader in order to go to the appropriate module for supplementary grammatical guidance. In order to improve this book, I recommend providing answers to exercises so that students can check themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is highly ineffective in helping students.","review":"Hi, This book is very poor in helping students trying to solve its problems.

I am looking for a legal solution manual to this book. I will pay top dollar for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A venerable and excellent graduate quantum theory textbook.","review":"I cannot let the posted reviews go unanswered. I have taught from the various editions of Merzbacher for many years (since I was a graduate TA for a QM course) and have always had good results with it. It is not, however, an undergraduate text at most institutions. And any student advanced enough to be in a course where Merzbacher is appropriately used knows that graduate physics textbooks are not intended to be problem solving manuals. At this stage of one's development, one knows how to convert the principles learned from lecture and study into appropriate problem solving strategies. My principal complaint is the price; I cannot ask my students to pay $100 for a textbook, even in 1999. More's the pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly written, traditional approach to QM","review":"Having had this text recommended for my graduate quantum class, but not taught from (instead taught out of the execrable book by J.J. Sakurai), I think that Merzbacher has written a very readable and very thorough book. Clearly, it is not a book aimed at undergraduates, but it is very elegantly written and uses the approach mirrored in Gasiorowicz and others, building the subject up with ordinary calculus and slowly bringing in matrix algebra. For a more modern treatment, and one very well written for the motivated self-studier, try Shankar's \\"Principles of Quantum Mechanics\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I agree with Mr. Jacob; this is a classic for good reasons. A student with an introductory QM course under his/her belt will enjoy the more advanced subjects (2nd quantisation, dirac equation,...). I also agree with Mr. Jacob about the price: this is much too high for the average student, presumably the targeted audience; something like 40 dollars would be more reasonable. Moreover, a book should be judged on its own merits; it is not Merzbacher's fault that some students want a easier book. Giving a 1 star comment because a book is too difficult is inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is unreadable","review":"I was lucky to have other books and a great instructor in Quantum Mechanics, otherwise I wouldn't have learned the subject at all. The language of this book is very dry and abstract at the same time, leaving the reader without an idea of what it all has to do with the real life. The approach to teaching is by no means classical and lacks examples. Another thing that I didn't like (and that unfortunately occurs so often in scientific literature) is the way references were handled: the author would send you 10 chapters back to substitute formulas 178 and 186 into another one 5 chapters back to get a result on the current page, whereas in good books relevant formulas would just be re-typed once again for reader's convenience.Having said all that, I also need to say that the author did a good job picking the problems for this text. They are of moderate difficulty and well related to the discussion in a preceding chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed attempt","review":"This book was originally written to make Schiffs book on quantum mechanics available to a wider audience. It was supposed to be simpler and more readable. Never happened. It is too wordy by far and many topics are actually covered very superficially with the student then being expected to solve difficult problems as though the treatment had been complete. Unfortunately, this is a common malady of physics texts. If you want a wordy, good, reasonably complete, text then Messiah's book is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT","review":"I have been waiting over a month and still do not have my product.

With \\"Initiation\\" he ran himself into a brick wall. It's a terribly overproduced album, so much so that the good song \\"Real Man\\" gets washed over with oceans of synths and cymbals. The extended pieces just aren't interesting and drift along without a solid focus. Todd made a much better album out of this template with \\"Healing\\" in 1981.

This is when Todd, I think, was crazy and thought he could do whatever he wanted. Hey Todd! Art should always have an audience and this was brutal.\\"Eastern Intrigue\\" is OK but the rest was really, really bad. It was unlistenable in the psychodelic 70's. Today, it is even worse.I saw Todd on the LIARS tour and he played \\"Born to Synthesize\\" ...yuck...I am not the artist but as a fan, I am the audience I know what should and should not be played.

Todd, easily one of the most gifted songwriters in pop rock history, completely falls off the deep end with Initiation. I'm not going to experiment with what Todd used to come up with this album, but perhaps that means that I won't ever appreciate this album. I'm fine with that--the bizarre album is virtually unlistenable except for the first track. Todd has dozens of classic songs, so even devoted Todd-ees can skip purchasing Initiation and have a real complete disography of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry, folks -- this one's a winner","review":"If you think an album consisting of pop songs, reflections on God, the music business, and the state of the world, coupled with an entire side of instrumental homages to God and sex can't work, think again. It does. Expect the unexpected from Mr. Todd, and you'll still be surprised. You'll want it just for \\"Fair Warning,\\" as elegant a snapshot of a man caught between worlds, charting his course, as you'll ever hear, but you'll listen to it again and again for the intelligence, humanity and passion this whole album delivers in every groove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Vermont American","review":"Someone told me that these are great blades.

The kiln people are akin to the instant clones in the movie \\"Multiplicity\\" with Michael Keaton, but instead of lasting forever, their memories are \\"inloaded\\" at the end of the day, back to the original. This revolutionalizes the world. Want to make some menial tasks? There is a specialized ditto for that. Study? Use another kind of golem. Have somebody represent you? Just pick the right blank! That's what makes the story so interesting. Brine explores implications to society, copies feelings, economics, war and defense, and more.I really enjoyed this book. I'd stay awake late reading, yet managed to save the last four pages for the morning, when I'd be fresh for the conclusion.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book but Ending is a bit Drawn Out","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's a Science Fiction Detective novel centered around the detective, his evil genius nemesis, and, for spice, an evil genius mad scientist, each in plural. Cool.I do agree with others, though, that the ending could have been better. First, at about 150 pages short of the end, it seems like everything's ready to be tied up. Brin uses those extra 150 pages to escalate the evil scheme from the personal through the corporate to all humanity. By the time you get to the actual end, you understand that. But still, it FEELS like the book should have ended 150 pages earlier. Also, those last 150 pages do tend to get bogged down in a lot of metaphysics. Those are interesting, but they could have been condensed somewhat. The very last action of the book is a bit of a letdown, though.Even though the ending could have been better, this is still a very good book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"half good","review":"The first half of this book is quite good. It's an interesting view of a society which differs from ours primarily through the ability of its residents to program their personality and knowledge into autonomous \\"dittos\\" made of a sort of clay. Setting a mystery in this society is a fine way to bring out its interesting points.But then the book segues into the one that Brin apparently really wanted to write, about \\"soulistics\\" and how consciousness actually exists in some metaphysical form related to (but apparently distinct from?) quantum mechanics. This is just NOT interesting (speaking as someone who knows a fair amount about quantum mechanics, and has thought a fair amount about consciousness). And it's tedious even for the characters in the book, much less for the reader, to sit through all the speechifying about it.Come to think of it, even recommending half of the book is too much. Read just \\"Part I\\", then call it quits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and different","review":"I enjoyed Brin's creation of a world very much like ours, where you can be in 2 places at once and do all of the things that you want to do. He carefully thinks out the consequences of the technology on society. Because the lifespans of the copies are so short, he also reflects on the nature of life and death.On another level, this is a satire of a traditional gumshoe mystery that is full of delicious puns, particularly on the word \\"ditto\\" (ie, he is a ditective). \\"Pundits\\" should discuss this book at length."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the first half . . .","review":"I saw a copy of this book at the bookstore, and after flipping through it, ordered it from the public library. Thankfully. I loved the concept, and enjoyed the first few chapters. Once I'd reached the halfway point, however, I began to feel restless, an unusual thing for me when I'm reading. I suddenly realized that I wanted the book to be over. It felt finished, and as if the plot should be wrapping up, but there was still half a book to plow through. If you really want to read this book, I'd recommend saving a few bucks and checking it out of the public library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of Postman and Earth: this will rock your world.","review":"Kiln People is what SF is all about. It's hard to describe in a few words, but it's a quasi-existential transparency-pushing SF noir crime thriller with a quantum Buddhist (my interpretation) take on the question of the human soul (quantum theology? transquantum theology?). Sounds like gibberish the way I've written it, but this is a great page-turner that will make you think hard about the cliched separations our culutre erects between issues of science and faith. David Brin doesn't like being told there's a field of knowledge inaccessible to scientific inquiry, and in addition to being a terrific SF thriller, Kiln People reads like a systematic proof of why science should never back off just because some theologians try to draw a line in the sand. The book also riffs on themes of social transparency raised in his book The Transparent Society. Read Kiln People, but read that next."},{"rating":"2","title":"<insert clever title>","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but this book deserves some support.I liked the entire concept, along with the twists and turns that came along with it.Loved the ending.Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concept, Excellent Writing","review":"Short and sweet, to the point- this is a great book. The action as told by multiple points of view by the same person is fantastic. My biggest complaint is about the end of the novel, where the witty, scifi ditective tale is lost in a morass of high-concept quantum mechanics. Kind of threw the book out of balance for me, but it is still an incredible read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gumby Soul is metaphysics not science","review":"A clay fiber that can act like a muscle isn't possibleby today's science and probably not by tomorrow's either.A clay that will form neural networks that can learn is even less scientific.So instead of science we have the metaphysics of \\"souls\\"as quantum mechanics. The characterization is beautifuland the permutations of personalities is very well done.The book is after all entertainment, but it is unlike most of Brin's work,not really science fiction; more in the line of metaphysical speculationabout the nature of intelligent waveforms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A good read.

I have this movie on VHS and have watched it many times and each time it brought back great memories of me in 1980s. This movie may not have the graphics of today but it is still a Marvel classic. This was one of the better Captain America movies (sorry Reb Brown) produced back then and was really fun to watch. If you are a Marvel fan this is a must add to your movie collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"I am not taking about the acting or the the production of the film. its actually what I was expecting. But the image quality is that of an old worn out vhs tape. not even a new vhs. but old. shame of the company that brought this to dvd in this poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Release","review":"I have been waiting for this movie for sometime. Pre-release rumors stated that there would be extras including a commentary by director Albert Pyun plus some extra scenes. What we get is no extras and film that looks like it was recorded straight from an old VHS tape. I am glad this was finally released but I wish it would have been more than this poor quality DVD-R."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as they say.","review":"I found Captain America to be a good film in all,Matt Salinger is terrific as Captain America in his cool outfit,and Scott Paulin is good as the Red Skull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain America VHS.","review":"I had the opportunity to see Captain America on Hulu. I feel it's an Horrible Adaption, Red Skull looks Horrible and is a Businessman?!? Although Steve Rogers/Cap is good, and the costume is good. The Beginning of the movie is in Italian no subtitles in mussolini's WWII Italy. I thought the movie had potential. Sadly, This is the only Cap Movie we have for now sadly. As a Captain America Fan we need something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not.","review":"The only good thing about this movie is the costume that Captain America wears, Everything else including the acting, is a one star rating. I guess they were more focused on an image than a good quality movie.Use your moeny on the cartoons instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL CRAP","review":"The first 15 minutes suggest a very promising film, but then it degenerates into a complete travesty. Captain America is a wimp in this movie. He gets knocked down when a woman hits him with her purse!! There is absolutely nothing redeemable about this movie. The only reason to rent it would be to see just how bad it really is. Watching this movie one gets the feeling that the filmmakers didn't really care about making a good movie, so long as they filled up 2 hours worth of film. Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every copy of this movie should be burned","review":"This straight to video mess is undoubtadly one of the worst comic to film adaptations of all time (yet, not as bad as Batman & Robin). This movie ranks up there with Roger Corman's never released Fantastic Four movie, and long time fans of the Captain America comics, or even those who just have basic knowledge of the character, will be utterly disgusted with this low budget mess. First off, the changing he nationality of the Red Skull from German to Italian is annoying enough, but one look at Cap's (Matt Salinger) rubbers ears on his costume will either make you laugh out loud or cringe in horror. All in all, any discerning comic fan should avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the last","review":"Like I said before, cap is always cool!

If it was low budget I could understand but this wanna be \\"B\\" movie of Captain america pails in comparison to the 2011 version. If you really must own this it comes out on 09/13/2011 Be advised it is campy though not as indigestible as the 1960's Cap movies. Watch either the 60's versions or this and you will cheer when they kill off Captain America in the Civil War story lines. Again buy at your own risk as this turd exists only for true collectors or people who want to toture visitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close...But Not Quite","review":"There's one good thing about this movie, based on the Golden Age comic-character, the costume! Matt Salinger, in costume, LOOKS like Captain America (at least a lot more than Reb Brown did in the motorcycle-outfit from the 1970's Captain-America made for tv movies.)That's about it. The Red-Skull isn't German anymore, there's no Bucky Barnes, & as portrayed in the movie, Cap had only ONE mission during World War Two. (He's supposed to have had an illustrious career as a spy-smasher up till the end of the European War.)Oh well. I don't mind if the screen-writers take liberties with the original stories. After all, Sam Raimi took a few for the recent \\"Spider-Man\\" movie. But \\"Captain-America\\", with the exception of the costume, is way off from the original.Hopefully, now that Stan Lee has more clout in Hollywood because of the recent \\"Spider-Man\\" movie, maybe they can try again with \\"Cap\\"...and this time...get it right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"B-movie","review":"Just skip this captain america movie.

OK, this is an Authentic \\" Region O \\" import, but most (not all) DVD's made available this way, that I have seen, are from top quality, crystal clear, source material, but this is a disappointing, dark, grainy version on the DVD, similar to the lowest VHS picture quality, you could possibly imagine, maybe 1 out of 10 & the sound is not much better at 3/10.Overall, a very disappointing DVD, of so poor quality that it won't be added to my collection. The day's when buyers & collector's, like myself, would accept inferior quality material, just to own your very own copy, are long gone & I won't lower my standards, as rubbish is still rubbish, no matter what format it is presented in.BE WARNED, don't waste your money!( The 2 star rating is for the DVD quality only! )"},{"rating":"2","title":"early 90's","review":"i like this movie a lot. i like how captain America was in investigating a little bit. and the action i like to. i wish i had the shield of captain America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Captain America is a great Movie of all time and just love it how he throw that Sheild and his Custom Rock"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Copy","review":"Item came on time but the video is crap!

The movie itself is what you should expect from a 1990 point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain America...","review":"Well Captain America is a low budget movie based on a comicbook superhero. This was another one of those bad Marvel movies that was never re-leased to theatres and has found it's way to home video. This movie is right up there with such classics as the never released Fantastic Four and The Punisher movies. I you like these two movies you'll like this one. If you haven't seen these movies you should check out the much better Superhero movies such as Batman, Superman, The Hulk, X-Men, Daredevil, Blade and Swamp Thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun low budget movie","review":"This movie is very entertaining despite it's bad reputation. It is well acted and much better than other super hero movies that have gone to the theaters. If they would have had a better budget for the costume and special effects it could have been a great movie. Fun stuff for a Captain America fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain America review","review":"Captain America in this film is nothing more then a punching bag and a wimp. The story is boring as the Pagemaster. The production values is so 1970's. Redskull in this film lost some credibility as a villian when he put on some new human skin. The female lead & the rest of the cast are forgettable.

After a couple months I've lost 15 pounds, eating proteins and fats, and a few nutrient-dense carbs such as broccoli, berries, spinach, etc. My blood pressure continues to be normal without medication, staying slightly below 110/80.

It explains to you what heart health is, what will hurt your health and what you can do if you find yourselves with issues. Lowering sodium is not easy because it is in everything and so much!

(The menus are located in chapter 16, not 14.) I agree with other reviewers that ALL of this information can be found on the Internet. The dashdiet.org site is simply advertisement for this book.

I love strings, especially real strings, so I immediately knew I would like this CD. They have a retro 70's pop sound with a big piano/strings feel. You feel like their concerts should really be performed in a symphony hall and not in a traditional rock concert setting. I often hear country flairs in this music as well. Wilco is probably a good comparison. Even Tahiti 80 if you mellow it out and take away the electronic influence.This is not the most innovative music out there, but it has a home and is unique, especially for this era in music history. This is a great band, and for those of you missing mellow pop music, hop in your red flame decaled thunderbird and go for a road trip with your new Chamber Strings CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!

What could have been an incredibly clever vehicle and plot (the proxy marriage by the meddling younger brother) was a waste of a good idea in this novel.

We did figure everything out eventually, it was just not as well laid out as the Spain book- I think having another book or more detailed maps might have been more helpful. (I think he does suggest getting another city map upon arrival- I just find it annoying to have a book and a huge map while wandering around- his Spain book was nice in that we only needed the book).Even if he had a map section at the end with more details, it would have been nice.

The statement right at the start of the Intro, that the \\"roads are rutted\\" is a ludicrous. I have been travelling regularly to Portugal since 1965 and can guarantee that the main (toll) roads in Portugal are now some of the best highways in the world. They are certainly better engineered and constructed than any of the highways in the US Interstate system. The secondary roads are also generally well maintained although crowded at times.

The RS writers make periodic attempts at wry humor which have a decided political bias, like reading usual newspapers from the USA, they amounted to little more than moral posturing for the reader.

If there is a problem in a fax transmission, this fax won't hang up/free the phone line.3) It has a very 'fragile' construction (paper holder is a joke)4) You won't be able to use it as a printer in network mode (ethernet connection and, probably, USB). So called 'printer drivers' are not optimized for Windows XP and you will get a lot of 'can't communicate with printer' errors.I'd suggest to stay away from this fax. Canon L80 might be a better solution if you can invest more in a fax machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Installation Disk!!","review":"I have been using my Brother IntelliFax 1940cn for almost a year now and I am very pleased with it. As others have mentioned in their reviews, there is NO Installation Disk packaged with this printer. You're forced to download them from Brother's web site and it is not immediately apparent which drivers/applications you need. I am using this as a shared network device and and it works great as both a printer and Fax. One of the reviewers here mentioned a problem with the drivers in Windows XP. I don't know what they're referring to because mine works great with Windows XP. The documentation is very detailed and does a good job explaining the advanced features of this printer/Fax. I give it 4 stars because of the burden placed on the consumer to figure out on their own which drivers/applications they need to download from Brother's web site instead of just including an installation disk like almost every other computer hardware manufacturer does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother? Don't bother!","review":"We wanted an all-in-one machine that does fax and has answering system, and this was one of the few in the market. Shouldn't have bothered. Reasons: 1) Abismal voice quality on the phone and phone message. A phone message is particularly bad, you cannot understand a thing. 2) Fax is SLOW-- don't trust whatever they say on the box or in the manual. 3) For some unknown reason, the answering machine cuts off people calling on certain cell phones. Either they are cut off in the middle of the message, or they hear one ring, and the phone hangs up on them. 4) The ink jet cartridge goes out very quickly. 5) Very flimsy plastic tray, part of it broke off only after a few weeks' use. Overall, very poor quality that the Japanese company should be ashamed of. After only 6 months, I am looking for a replacement, but I haven't a clue where to look. Certainly not Brother's machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"caution","review":"Compared to others, this looked like a really good fax machine, features, price, etc. It had decent reviews.However, I have now had 2 units sent to me with the same problem-the phone on-hook/off-hook mechanism is defective.Perhaps this machine doesnt survive shipping well...On the plus side, Amazon has been helpful, I am now returningthis 2nd unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game","review":"I really liked this game because it's pretty good for something on a gameboy.

I wonder if Ms. Jeffries herself derived any pleasure from writing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I have read this author before and enjoyed her books. This one was (sadly) disappointing especially in light of the fact that I was so looking forward to it. I just didn't *believe* any of it. The plot was contrived and the characters were hollow. Don't *tell* me about the characters and their feelings. *Show* me what the characters are like by their actions. This one just didn't ring true for me. I rarely don't finish a book but sadly put this one down. I don't like feeling that I'm being talked down to by romance authors. I'm always looking for authors who actually give me some credit. I can figure out what's going on in a story by following the action. I don't need it spelled out to me so simplistically. Read and enjoy her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep away from this book!!!","review":"When i started reading \\"after the abduction\\" by Jeffries, i have to admit i was into it, it started off goood but once it got to page 82, it was downhill from there and even worse as the book continued, i had to force myself to finish the book, which is so unlike me, just because i wanted to see if Jeffries will redeem herself, i cant see why since the book was dull and unbelievable. The reasons she made up to make him confess he was truly her kidnapper (like he tutoring her to 'recognize scoundrels') and the way he convinced her to make love to him was so unreal! The heroine could have come up with a more convincing plan and they're arguements were so dumb. Trust me - stay away from this book!

It seemed to work well at first as long as you made sure to close the lid tightly, which wasn't always easy. It usually took a minute or two to get it on properly and make sure it was tight in order to prevent leaking. After a couple of months of use, the rubber that keeps the lid tightly in place began to tear. Needless to say that without it, it leaks. It's hard to say to avoid such a cheap item, but save yourself the trouble and go with a shaker that snaps on. Much easier to get on and off, I've never had leaking issues, and also doesn't have any grooves in case you decide to drink directly from the container. I've have good luck with Tupperware personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Garbage","review":"This thing is a piece of garbage.

The biggest leak came from a crack in the smaller vent cap that was most likely caused by repeated pressure to keep the seal tight. Over time, the physics of the design simply causes the plastic to split. If the cap was made of something more elastic like silicone or rubber, this problem probably wouldn't exist. The rest of the leaking seems to be coming from a worn-down rubber seal that lines the inside of the cap. Even though it's sightly more expensive, I'm buying a BlenderBall BlenderBottle to replace my BodyTech bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaker-----","review":"too hard to close and sometimes you have to close it a few times so it will be tight.

V ery little downside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect ride not perfect read","review":"I admire Gary Stevens as a world class jocky, but world class writer he is not. At times he comes across as quite cocky, maybe he has reason to be proud of his success but he sounds conceited more then proud. Often he writes as though he knows more about the horses he rides then the trainers or owners, that he is a better judge of their capabilities then either of the others, and he has been proven wrong on that score. He also seems to be trying to give us a smattering of his philosophy on success and I think he fails. What has worked for him, a God given ability to ride horses well and an incredible tolerance for pain can not be applied to the rest of us. I have to say, I hope Stevens does not follow this book up with any others. He is a much better jocky then writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inside Look At Horse Racing","review":"If you love thoroughbred horse racing and are hungry for an inside look this book is for you. Gary Stevens discusses the great horses he has ridden and the great trainers he has worked for. At the same time he is still a working jockey and I believe he went to great lengths to not offend anyone. It is a shame because you can't help but believe that Gary has a strong opinion on just about everything in his industry. He avoids saying much about his fellow jockeys except for kind words regarding Bill Shoemaker and Pat Day. And Chris Antley is discussed in detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"Gary Stevens, with his co author Mervyn Kaufman have done a great job with this book. The material is well presented, concise and very informative. Stevens clearly loves what he does, has a great respect and appreciation for the many horses he has ridden. He's also overcome many injuries and a childhood disability to pursue his dream of riding throughbreds. I came away from this book learning a lot about the life of a jockey and the horse racing business in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described on this page!","review":"The product description says that this items comes with THREE pairs per package. I bought five packages, expecting to get 15 pairs of stockings. I got ONE pair of stockings in each package.

Since XP doesn't have a built-in dictionary, as Mac OS X does, I installed Bookshelf. Note that you can copy the entire contents of the CD onto your hard drive, so that you don't need to insert the disc every time you run the program.Even in this age of easy access to web information sources such as Wikipedia and other sites, I still find Bookshelf to be very useful. It's nice having a serviceable atlas, quotations and dictionary at your fingertips.

I couldn't put it down; I couldn't wait to get home from school and read it. I learned so much about Texas A&M and Bear Bryant from this book. I definatley reccomend this book to any football fan that enjoys reading. Jim Dent really scored a touchdown with this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"author obviously did not check his resource people","review":"If the author wants to write fiction, he should label it as such.

He also made his fortune in the baking business and from investiments, not oil as Mr. Dent states."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the movie!","review":"Excellent account of what playing football for Paul Bryant was like when he was possibly at his meanest. Frustrations from dealing with The University Of Kentucky's lack of support for their winning football program (which Bryant was responsible for) and the job of turning Texas A&M around at that time would have made ANYBODY a little edgy I think!! If you love football you will love this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Junction Boys: How Ten Days in Hell with Bear Bryant Forged a Championship Team","review":"Read about the greatest football Coach of all times. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Written Book","review":"The Junction Boys is the story of the lowly Texas A&M football team. They were one of the worst teams around until \\"Bear\\" Bryant came to town. This a great story and is excellently written. Jim Dent tells us how Bryant turned around the football team which eventually turned around the whole school. He shows how the legendary coach earned his nickname and why he was so great. In three short years Bryant turned the whole program around in a state where he couldn't get the best recruits. Dent writes the book like he is telling a story unlike so many non-fiction books which get long and boring this was very interesting until the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story for the College Football Fan","review":"This book tells the story of how a bunch of college kids survived a hell week with Bear Bryant and went on to win a championship with him. If you enjoy football you will enjoy this story. My only complaints are that Jim Dent has a few too many down home Texas similes. It also would have been interesting to have Dent put the story into a little bit of historical perspective. Not providing water at practice makes Bryant seem cruel in today's terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Not Put it Down !!","review":"This could quite possibly be the best book I have ever read. I am a Texas Aggie, but if you just like football, you've got to read this book. Jim Dent goes into great detail about how the Bear worked the Aggies to become SWC champs. They go to the tiny town of Junction with 111 players, and come back with only 35 !! For those who survived, their lives would be changed forever. Bear Bryant was truely a great coach. The book also shows how the Junction Boys changed his life. This book is a must read if you enjoy football and/or need to be motivated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact or Fiction","review":"Reality or exaggerated, sports fan or not, what difference does it make? This book is about motivation, team building, success, building character and the price paid for it. It has as much right to be listed in the business or military section as it does in sports. It is one version of how a successful empire was built. This is not the only recipe for success, but it is one that worked for a poor boy that grew up in southern Arkansas during some hard times. It is a good read for anyone that has had to sacrifice for success. It is every day, real life for a lot of people, only they may not be practicing football in Junction, Tx. Thank you Dent & Stallings for sharing a story of success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junction Training Camp Not Necessary","review":"I read this book only for its historical value.I have never liked Coach Paul Bryant because his actions and coaching style were clearly abusive, rude, hostile, disrepectful, confrontational, and brutal. He came close to killing some of his players!The hard part of reading this book are the detailed, graphic injuries sustained by many of the players. It is deplorable how these players were treated by Coach Bryant and his assistants. Coach Bryant almost appears to be sadistic and callous in his attitude toward hurt players."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling read, not for the faint of heart","review":"Not only a riveting account of the fabled ten days in hell, but also of the seasons that followed. The writing is a little uneven; the narrative tends to jump from player to player rather abruptly, which is a bit jarring to the reader. Even with this small fault, the book is a compelling read. This is college football at its absolute gutsiest. Warning: The descriptions of what the Junction boys endured are so graphic that the book should have an \\"Explicit Violence\\" sticker on it. Not for the squeamish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerfully Stimulating! A must read for all.","review":"The Junction Boys is a magical story that takes you back to an era of truth and accountability. A highly descriptive telling that entrances the reader throughout the whole book. This book is much more than a story about college football. It is story about life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for any true college football fan.","review":"I read this book on the first two days of my honeymoon. It was that good. My wife wanted to take romantic walks and I was glued to this book about the Bear. I was borned and raised a Tennessee fan. I will always cheer for the Vols above anybody, but I gained new respect for the Bear when I read this book. It gives you a true understanding of the man behind all the stories and championships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Good As Learning Perl","review":"'Learning Perl' by the same authors is one of my favorite books of all time in in the O'Reilly family of books. It's incredibly well written, easy to follow, and it's like having the best instructor you could want teaching you live and in person. As for 'Intermediate Perl', this book is supposed to take regular Perl developers beyond the scripting abilities of the language, allowing them control of much of the power of any other popular and powerful programming language in the development world. While this book has lots of nice material, I find the book to not be as clear, concise, and easy to follow as the precursor to this book. I am certainly no Perl expert, so maybe that is part of the problem, but upon opening this book I had hoped to find a book that was easier to read for any and all programmers.All in all, a nice book, but not up to snuff with what I had hoped for.**** RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge from beginner to master","review":"This is a good book for anyone to learn perl by yourself.

I have yet to see them play live but I will make sure that I do. This is some the most original and catchy music I have heard in a long time. If you are like me and are not a fan of things that are on the radio anymore you will love this. You need to buy this and you will not be dissapointed! This cd is amazing.

I'm a HUGE pure-pop fan (fav recent albums are by Wilco, Matt Sweet, Belle & Sebastian, Fountains of Wayne)and this is going to be a great addition.

Taking their cue from the best of such late 70s/early 80s bands as The Pop and improving on the hooks and delivery, the Waxwings have delivered an unforgetably catchy masterpiece. There's no shortage of muscle here, either; this CD rocks. Word to radio; If you don't pick up on \\"Ten O'Clock Your Time\\", you've missed your last chance to be a valid musical medium.

The book is good to get used to the format of the exam, but the questions are about half as difficult as the real ones, especially the math section. If it wasn't for the fact that I am a math/computer science major I would have never passed! I went into the exam with a false sense of confidence because of this book. My suggestion, use the other TEA exam book (white cover), I heard it is much better.

I just took the TEA and am in shock. This book in no way prepares you for the math and even the verbal reasoning doesn't match up to what is actually on the TEA exam. I hate to admit this, but because of relying on this study guide alone, I have probably blown my one and only chance to become an ATF Agent. Don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unrealistic!","review":"It's more like 1.5 stars. This book gives a general outline of the exam, but don't be fooled, the verbal reasoning on the actual exam is not as easy as the book. There are more complex questions. Also, the math section of the book is NOTHING like the exam; the exam has much more complex word problems. The questions for investigation portion of the book is probably the most accurate. Overall way too easy and unrealistic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: This book will not help you","review":"This prep book will not prepare you for the TEA Exam. It is nothing like the exam. All practice sections are extremely weak. Especially the math section. This book will give you a false sense of confidence about the TEA Exam. I have taken the TEA and this book is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"If you plan on spending loads of money for airfare and a hotel in order to get to the TEA test location, save some of the money by not buying this book. The practice exams were fairly simple and the math section was completely unrealistic compared to the actual test. I am by no means a math wizard, but this book portrayed the math section as one of mostly very basic math. The actual test is 10x harder! Ill be buying ARCO's guide (US Marshal test book) for the next time. Several people told me after the exam Arco's math section closely resembled the actual test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Poorly written examinations guide.

It gave me a good idea of what is expected on the test but then again, like the many reviews here, it just wasn't enough. I could have gotten the format of the test on the internet but it is a good practice. The information on the workbook is definitely easy and it should give you a boost of confidence. Once finished with the workbook, it should only take you several hours, purchase the Kaplan gre/gmat math workbook and solve all the word problems. That should quickly deflate your confidence. Now that you're back on Earth, continue to work ont he math workbook for about a week. For word section, this book should be sufficient. Remember to manage your time well during the test. I didn't feel so hot after I left the test but I still passed. Best of luck to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Math!","review":"If you plan on passing the math section of the TEA, and want to use this study guide as a gage...don't! The math from this book did, in no way prepare you for the test. The other two sections were adequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives you a start","review":"This book is to simple for the real TEA exam. If you are going to get a book to study get the ARCO Special Agent book. The questions in the ARCO book are more complex and do a better job of preparing you for the test. I just got done taking the test, and if I hadn't had the ARCO book I most probably would have failed the test.

I read the book cover to cover and walked in feeling very confident. The joke was on me! When I got to the math part, after 4 questions, I seriously considered walking out. I reconsidered and finished the test. Luckily, I have a strong enough background that I passed. A friend of mine who took it at the same time (and studied the same book) was not as fortunate. I definitely do NOT recommend this book! The other sections were not bad, but the math?

I used this book about 2 years ago to study for the original TEA. I was cofident and felt very prepard. I was dead wrong. The math section seriously gave me a panic attack - I am terrible in math and the TEA book did not prepare me whatsoever. SO, I failed, but I took the ICE test just a few months ago and passed. I used the Arco Special Agent book which really, really helped me. The math sections are so helpful. Even read the logical reasoning sections. When you take the exam, you will realize how much easier the logicals are compared to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time!","review":"The actual exam was much harder than any of the practice tests.

Also, don't buy \\"The Championship Softball Hitting System\\" if you buy \\"The Art of Hitting Slow Pitch Softball\\", they are the EXACT same video, but \\"Art\\" has 15 extra minutes, so this is the one to get between the two.

Her character is one that holds you attention, and you can get lost in her story. Holly Hunter is REALLY great in this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Show","review":"This series is incredible! The story lines are current and the cast is exceptional. Granted, the idea of an angel appearing to try to save someone from the path they're going down might be difficult to adjust to but somehow in this show, it works.

I always always read the exam cram for the test before I take it. Most of the time Exam Cram's are my primary study tool, and on a few test my only study tool (which is always a bad idea). This book however was the first of the 8 Exam Cram's i've read that didn't cover the points that the test hit. RRAS is a very important topic on this test, but the book doesn't cover it in the detail that the test warrants. I am overall disappointed in this title and will avoid this author in the future. As far as the Server and Professional Exam Cram's they are excellent very few typing errors and no technical errors that I picked up on.

The material covered in just abut 250 pages sans the Sample Test and the Glossary is nothing to shout about. Take away the first 2 chapters which are merely basic stuff found most probably in their other books on the OSI model/Internet and so on and what you have is very skimpy material that hardly covers 30% on what the exam touches on.The 70-216 exam is probably the toughest exam of the Core, and the Sample questions are no where near the Case Studies.

Unless you fully understand routing protocols down to the registry level, you're better off getting a \\"real\\" study guide of your choice.I love ExamCram books, but my experience has been that about 1 out of 3 of the books are just plain horrible!

Tutter, Ojo and Treelo all use the big toilet, and Pip and Pop induct them into the Toileteers. (A Toileteer sticker is included with the book.) In conclusion, Bear and Luna discuss how growing up doesn't mean you won't be cared for and loved.Not the best book for teaching -- for that use Sears' excellent 'You Can Go to the Potty' -- but a gentle reassuring book for kids who might be a little skeptical about the whole process.

How can a hero be a real hero if he RAPES his heroine? And that's exactly what took place--he had sex with her against her will. I'd always hoped that 1000 years of living would make Gregori a little more understanding, a little wiser, than some of the other Carpathians. It only seemed to make him more stubborn, close-minded and dominating. If you like to read romance about a relationship you don't have a choice in, about living with a man who treats his woman like a child, along with the usual amount of blood, this will work for you. I've read the whole series now. The only hero I thought was great was Adian from Dark Gold. That book gave me hope for this one. But this was so disappointing, so much of Gregori telling Savannah what to do and how to do it, I could only think she was a co-dependent sap for falling in love with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for other books","review":"Unfortunately i purchased all of Chrisgine Feehan's books that were available from Amazon. The first was boring, sappy drivel, that was so unoriginal it did not catch, much less, hold my attention. The best i can say is that this is the worst Vampire series i've ever read. None of the other books is any better than the first one - in fact if you substitute the cover page of one for the next you won't really see any difference. Same cliche's page after page.Save your money and buy a book from Laurell K.

I have enjoyed her previous three novels, but I am very disappointed with her latest effort. Dark Magic is nothing but a reiteration of her first three books. It contains the same elements of a dark, brooding, overprotective male and a bratty, weak, and stubborn female. The only thing that separates this novel from the first is the geographic location. The same plot still abides with Gregori finding his lifemate and binding her to him for all time while trying to protect both her and himself from Carpathians turned vampires who want his lifemate for themselves. Christine Feehan's first novel Dark Prince was a one of a kind and even the second presented us with another side of the Carpathian culture, but I have found her latest two novels to be tired and played out. Christine Feehan please write us something a little more original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Romance for the Anti-Feminist","review":"I love vampire romances, however this entire series horrifies, and at times, sickens me. I wouldn't give it any stars except that it's required in the form.If the idea of \\"justified\\" rape and women born to belong to men is sexy to you, then this book, and the series, is for you. The men are all thinly disguised Neanderthals and the women are obedient doormats. Sure, they protest a bit at first, but soon they're all happy to belong to their men and do what they're told.I truly believe that people should be allowed to write and publish whatever they wish in our society, even if I personally disagree with it. However, the fact that young women are reading this and finding it sexy is truly disturbing. I fear for the future generation if they consider *this* to be the way men should treat women.Don't waste your money on this series.

I mean, really! How many times can an author use the word \\"Carpathian\\"in one paragraph?? She was going for the record. In the beginning of the book, she seems to use it at least once in every sentence, sometimes twice!Besides the overuse of \\"Carpathian\\", the heroine was vapid, the male was insecure and overly controlling, and the plot was trite.

He only respects \\"no\\" when it comes out of his mouth.The \\"hero\\" is completely uninterested in knowing this woman as a person. His laments about giving in to her are laughable and insulting.

I was barely 100 pages into it when I was overwhelmed by Gregori. He may be dark, dangerous and sexy but he was also overbearing, arrogant and violent. He was worse than a stalker, following her to the ends of the earth, using the powers of his mind to force her to do things \\"for her own good\\" and his violent first encounter with her completely went against my idea of romance. I've read \\"forced seductions\\" but to me this was all out rape.

Every fiber of me was wanting to reach for her next book. I was addicted to it. I wanted nothing more than to hear the words. I was amazed of how captivating a writer she was. I am the kind of person to only read one or two books of a writer and then just lose interest but Christine has made me want to never stop to want to go on to the next one.

They will want you to keep coming back for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful reader!","review":"Once one accepts the basic formula and Feehan prose style for almost all the \\"Dark\\" novels, the issue becomes how well the material is read. Juanita Parker, who does both \\"Magic\\" and \\"Gold\\" is horrendous. I'm unfamiliar with the word \\"accross't\\", and she consistently adds a \\"t\\", as well as contributing so many erroneous pronunciations that one's attention is drawn to her multitudinous mistakes, and waiting for the next one to happen. Which it invariably does. I have a very large collection of cd books, and the 2 read by Ms. Parker are going straight to the Salvation Army. I have 3 other Feehans, with a different narrater on the shelf which I'm going to try once I've gotten the dreadfulness of the Parker experience solidly in the rear view mirror.

It's not as good of a story, but its underlying message - the temptations, are a well deserved lesson. Being a people-manager for the past several years has been a challenging, fascinating and at times humbling experience. This book describes some of the mistakes I've made and some of the mistakes I've seen being made around me, and puts it all in a coherent framework. And that's all I really expect from a good management book - to be able to put your experience in some new frame of reference. This enabled me to take another look at my habits and conduct and, hopefully, improve some of them.I recommend this book to new managers after going through one or two years of actually leading teams/groups of people. Unless you walk in a leader's shoes, the theory alone is of little help. You just won't have anything to hang on the structure described here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshingly useful business book for all readers","review":"This book should be read by anyone who leads people or would like to.

Given that the attention spans of organizational leaders are short, and the need to adopt a 21st century approach to leadership is critical, Patrick Lencioni has hit a home run in crafting a message that is engaging and to the point. Charlies of the world must find the collective voice to help leaders grow. Leaders must find the courage to listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Very entertaining and easy to listen to. Very valuable information for anyone in a leadership position."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage","review":"If the proof is in the pudding, the value of this recipe is that I have faced three concrete 'CEO moments' since finishing Lencioni's fable two days ago that have proven to be the turf for implementation of his well-told counsel to CEOs who live or die by clarity and courage.Courage. The author understands that life at the top of an organization calls for extraordinary bravery as one faces the limitations of oneself and then of others. He does not let his reader off the hook, but presses into him the need for firm resolve and courageous action in resisting the temptations that come-one at a time or in fearsome mobs-into the life of the CEO.This is my second Lencioni fable (after Four Obsessions) and the best of the two.If you, like me, find your finite reservoir of courage in ample demand as you attempt to lead human beings to succeed in a group, success begins with our will to summon up that quality yet one more time. Reading this book will help you find the moral courage to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed.","review":"The book does deliver a message, but one that should be delivered via a short magazine article.

Maybe next time her editor won't just rush to publish because of a deadline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Tone then Previous Books","review":"Previous books by Stephanie Laurens in the Cynster series have had more of a conspiracy feel to the plot. However, Laurens starts the book by having Gerrard Debbington confess that he doesn't believe he can love deeply and completely and still have the energy to paint.This book isn't about conspiracy. It's about the truth of love. The last pages of the book are very beautiful. Love is defined by everyone differently. But this book is a wonderful expose on a deep romantic love that is beyond words and is about feelings. In this case, Gerrard Debbington paints his love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best Cynster novel","review":"Like all books by Laurens, this one has good use of language and beautiful settings. However, this is definitely the weakest plot of her Cynster series. There is no tension between the male and female protagonists - their relationship is so predictable and comfortable that it becomes boring within the first third of the book. The only mild tension in the story is a conspiracy that is made obvious to the reader early on. I am a longtime fan of Laurens, including several earlier Cynster novels, but this series is definitely played out. My advice to other fans - don't buy this one; get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful!","review":"I've read and enjoyed Stephanie Laurens novels over the years - some more than others, but overall, all have been at least good.This one is horrible! Hero and heroine are basically an item from the first 40 pages or so, and after that it is an incredibly lame plot involving murder, intrigue and so on. Zero romantic tension (but lots of sex).

The premise is so ludicrous, I couldn't believe I was actually supposed to buy it for one minute. The style of writing is also weighed down heavily with way too much detail.

The Cynster men and honorary Cynster men have been very sensual, etc; but this one is just ho-hum.I have loved reading Stephanie Laurens' books but the recent novels (2005, 2006) lack the spark or chemistry that makes a romance special.

This one I really could have done without reading. What is really strange is I am not sure why. The story sounds interesting, but it really wasn't. The plot dragged on and was unrealistic. I did not like the characters and could not even finish the book. I have never read a book this bad by Stephanie Laurens before.

And the heroine, a noble lady, sleeping with the hero, Gerrard Debbington, without even the promise of a forth-coming marriage(as far as she knew) when the hope of making a respectable marriage for herself in the future wasn't still beyond her & doing so without even taking any precautions against a possible pregnancy?

Empress Wu Zetian chronicles the rise to power of the woman who was empress of China from 690 to 705 AD. It is slow-moving and the actress playing the empress sneers evilly throughout. A drunken monk attempts to provide comic relief, but instead is just embarrassing. Dream of the Red Chamber is based on the famous novel and is one of the most filmed stories in Chinese cinema. This is the first filmed version and I sincerely hope the later versions are more interesting than this one. It is a long (2:05) costume melodrama which is static and even more boring than Empress Wu Zetian. There is lots of weeping and whining, a couple of songs, and a final tragedy.

So are her handsome and irresponsible brother, her elegant and surprising mother, and her boyfriend's formidable mother.The wrought-iron flamingos of the title remind me of a real-life wrangle in historic Hanover Courthouse over pink plastic lawn flamingos.

I waited on baited breath for this book to arrive in the mail after all of the glowing reviews. Not so much. I am an educated person and an avid ghost story reader, but to me this book read as though the author was attempting to wow us with her highbrow metaphors rather than tell a good account of a haunting. The result was the ghost story was lost in a verbose nightmare! I found the author's writing style pompous, and narcisstic. My vote is for SAVE YOUR MONEY..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Pretentious!","review":"This is NOT a story about ghosts. It's a story about a spoiled, manic-depressive wannabee actress/writer/debutante. I just finished half the book as research for a ghost tour I lead and I give up. I received just about a perfect score on the verbal part of the SATs and I still never heard of half of the words she uses in her pretentious prose.

I loved the use of the World Tree as a journeying tool, and definitely benefitted from it. It also is a collection of herbal associations and totem animal meanings, and has a great layout that guides the reader through various exercises that strengthen their work in the shamanic realms. I really don't have anything to complain about with this book, I felt it covered at least all of the most important bases, and helps a person grow through use of various meditations and exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Penczak provides good information on shamamism in the first chapter, so he clearly did some research, but failed to provide much of substance about shamanic practices. He makes statements that were nonsensical, and probably unintentionally hilarious - like how shamans in Second Attention (which is not explained) can be found studying sand or walking backward. This was clearly written to be a serious statement of shamanic mindset, but instead simply sounded absurd. He also lifted and included entire segments from his previous books (inner temple meditation, alpha countdown) as well as rehashing casting a circle. It felt like filler to create enough material for this book, so that he could keep the series going. Disappointing, given how good his first book was."},{"rating":"2","title":"good bit of knowledge","review":"I liked how he explained the infinity loop the spiralization of the universe and spirit world that is an incredible bit of knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"it makes you want to learn more","review":"The Temple of Shamanic witchcraft is one of the many very wonderful products of our soullife but as there are many more touches of the unknown we will be hungry to learn about the wonders of the universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the newbie pagan","review":"I liked this book.

This is a GREAT rehearsal tool for anyone getting ready to produce a production of \\"The Sound of Music.\\" Of course, it is against the law to use these tracks for an actual performance, but for rehearsal purposes, it is fantastic. Only a couple of the songs are not spot-on exactly like the Broadway score. For instance, \\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\" leaves out the dance section at the end of the song (pity!) Overall, however, the quality of this CD is VERY HIGH, considering the other junk out there on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic that rewards rereading","review":"Brilliant, iconclastic, witty, and all that.

Look past the sometimes-dated language to the fundamental principles. This book was true when first published 40 years ago, true when I first read it 28 years ago, and will remain true long after I have retired decades from now.And be careful quoting it, some of the best parts were not work-safe 40 years ago and never will be work-safe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"I've read this book cover to cover many, many times over the past 20+ years - it's that good.

But in 2007 they have been long superceded by more compelling in-depth works. This is not a literary masterpiece. It is a collection of random thoughts on running a company, arranged in a queer alphabetical order (sort of) for lack of any other organizational theme.

Ant's production sets the mood that spans the entire album. To any Atmosphere fans reading this, you must understand: this is Slug's BEST work by far. EVERY verse is ill, and the only other emcee on the album that comes near him is Gene Pool. Beyond (Musab) rips it as well (see Beyond Comparison). Although it's disappointing to see what's happened to Slug and Musab, THIS album has stayed in rotation since the day of purchase. If you don't have it, your only valid excuse is ignorance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not very involving biography","review":"I found this book dry and yet overly sympathetic to its subject, without a historian's objectivity. Oddly, despite the author's admiration for Otto the statesman, we never learn much about Otto, the inner man. A balanced biography should have both sides of the story. I, too, noticed many of the errors cited by the other reviewer... While I appreciated some of the newer information supplied by the author, a noted historian (particularly about Emperor Karl's attempt to regain the Hungarian throne), I didn't really enjoy the book, and it didn't make my keeper shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Read","review":"This was one of the most amazing stories I've read of WWII. The bravery and sacrifices made by the men during this battle is incredible. Having only learned of my father's experiences in WWII as a Marine following his passing, I've read as many books as I can about the Marines in the Pacific. This is easily one of the best written. It's told from the view of the Marines who fought for what seemed like 24 hours a day for over a month. Most Americans know the story of the flag raising but that was long before the battle ended. As was my father, these were ordinary men who did extraodinary things to defeat the enemy on this piece of rock near the Japanese mainland.I recently visited the Marine Corp museum where the actual flag raised on Iwo Jima is on display. This was very emotional having read about what these men accomplished and sacrificed.

I had the privilege of seeing the book in it's developmental stage and was very impressed by the contribution it makes to behavioral biology and to the debate over the origin of sexual expression. I was also impressed by the commitment of its author to stay true to his vision of a completely documented exposition of sexual diversity in the animal world. I am even more excited to see the original conception in print in all its fascinating glory! This book will change the way you view animal (and human) sexual behavior!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-baked theory","review":"The book's extensive documentation of homosexuality in animals may be valuable, but the book's style doesn't leave me with much confidence that its interpretations of the research are sufficiently unbiased to be relied upon.The book's discussions of why it is hard to provide an evolutionary explanation of homosexuality are mostly reasonable, but the alternative to evolution that the book proposes isn't sufficiently well thought out to qualify as a testable scientific hypothesis. Evolutionary theory has a good enough track record at explaining things that appear at first glance to be counterproductive that people shouldn't reject it without finding an alternative with a good deal of explanatory power. But exuberance is an idea which explains very little. And anyone who has made impartial observations of typical natural ecosystems should see that the extravagance and waste that the book worships are sufficiently uncommon as to be hard to reconcile with the book's characterization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't put any stock in this book","review":"Interesting how \\"scientists\\" can prove anything they want. State a hypothesis, then go about collecting information, categorizing it to suit your purpose, then use it as \\"proof\\" of your claim. The reason this book is dismissed by virtually every true biological scientist isn't because of \\"homophobic academia,\\" (like the book's advertising claims)-it's because true scientific academia can see right through his preposterous claims. Come on, use real science and we'll all get on board with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A scientific look at animal behavior and physiology","review":"The thing that particularly fascinated me about this book was the broad array of variations in physical gender found in animals. For many animals (e.g., hyenas, bears) a significant percentage of their population at any time is made up of intersexed individuals. Nature is both more strange, and more wonderful, than we usually perceive. The book was a real eye-opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out well, then crashes","review":"There is indeed some impressive scholarship in this book, except where the author attempts to make sense of figures he has failed to study in depth, such as Aquinas, where the errors are numerous and elementary. Behind the project, of course, is an agenda, a familiar anti-Western polemic dressed up in good historical research and extremely clumsy philosophy.I notice that the publishers quote David Burrell's review in Nova et Vetera--funny, since that review was anything but positive in its final conclusions regarding this book.Bradshaw is a bad philosopher, but he gives his audience what they want. He will be praised extravagantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Bradshaw is a horrible racist, do not buy","review":"I'm currently taking a class from David Bradshaw. During lecture he noted that the reason freed slaves began to gain acceptance with the white citizens of America was because the white people could see that the freed slaves were \\"better\\" at \\"sports and entertainment\\". Bradshaw has also advocated such ridiculous views as the idea that the reason people don't refer to the United States as \\"The Union\\" anymore is because the North took away the rights of the states to secede- and not quite obviously because the Northern forces were colloquially known as \\"The Union\\" while the Southern states were the Confederacy, so that the term \\"The Union\\" no longer refers to the United States but to the Northern forces during the Civil War.Please do not support this evil man, nor his clearly flawed views on religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANYONE CAN WRITE A NOVEL, RIGHT?","review":"I'm not sure why so many educated men and women who have spent many years studying their field of expertise imagine that they can sit down at a keyboard and tap out a great novel without ever even bothering to learn what a novel is.

He likes the various images of the train which are also brimming with incidental details: countless children and animals, mountain climbers, boats, school busses, carriages, kites, bridges, produce stands, and castles, just to name a few. Sometimes, he will \\"read\\" the book himself. Because the prose is simple and repetetive, he is easily able to remember and recount portions of the text.

It may be appropriate when they are older and we can discuss stereotypes, but they're too young now. The book depicts this adorable little caboose traveling through a variety of towns and cities. One page shows the caboose passing a group of Native Americans living in teepees, dressed in stereotypical clothing. It simply doesn't fit with the values I want to share with my children. Just like I won't watch the racist version of Song of the South with my kids, I won't read this book. It may have been acceptable in the era in which this book was written, but it's no longer appropriate.

The transfer was below average and the sound is probably the worst sounding DVD i own. I even tried to turn up the volume to give a theatrical feeling, but still could not ignore the poor recording. For a $30 Criterion disc, I was expecting more features, better quality and a behind the scenes look at the movie but again was dissapointed.

It's been my favorite for about 4 or 5 years, so it's hard not to. The plot is funny, yet thoughtful at the same time, playing with the idea of \\"what if god left some things undone, having created the world in only 7 days?\\" the dialogue is cynical and ironic, at times. The cast list is wonderful. Contrary to the information that Sean Connery stars in this, he does not. He is simply the most well-known. His part isn't insignifigant exactly, but not that big. The real star of the film is, well, everyone, come to think of it. Python fanatics, such as myself, will be entertained with appearances by John Cleese and Michael Palin, both of whom have probably the funniest scenes in the whole film.

Time Bandits is a cult classic, not really worthy of an award but a way to satire on aspects of people's lives and poke fun at them. This movie falls right into the category of fantasy and, as previously stated by another reviewer, like The Princess Bride, it manages to bring together an amazing cast that balances the movie and the plot keeps it going.Bottom Line: If you are a Monty Python fan, you will laugh, but not as hard as when you saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail for the 30th time. If you love fantasy, you will be pleased and will love owning this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have watched many movies over the past 45 years and this is easily the worst.

As awful as Jabberwocky if you can believe it.The only post-Python Gilliam-directed film I can recommend is 12 Monkeys. In films like Brazil and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Gilliam hits us with crazy visuals...acid trips and fantasies...that go on and on and on until the credits roll. No plot, no involvement, no point at all.If you've ever seen Lost in La Mancha, you were probably saddened by all the events that led to the cancellation of Gilliam's Don Quixote film...from the lead actor breaking bones, to a flood that destroyed expensive equipment. But after seeing some of Gilliam's other films, I'm now convinced that those events were:\\"A blessing! A blessing from the Lord!

Fun Movie!","review":"I have fun with all of Terry Gilliam's quirky movies from this toThe Adventures of Baron Munchausento the recentThe Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus! Sadly, horrible picture quality drags this wonderful film down.For Amazon reviews of older movies, I tend to assume that readers have a familiarity with the film already, so I'll instead focus on the question of how well the movie transfered to the Blu Ray format. The answer? Not well at all!In fact, I think this is the worst Blu Ray transfer I've ever seen. Artifacts abound, from lines across the screen, to random specks. It's pretty awful in parts! It feels like I'm watching an old film reel on an elementary school projector.You'll definitely notice that no effort appeared to be spent restoring the film for this release. I'm a bit saddened by it, too, because it distracts from the enjoyment of an otherwise interesting movie.Four star movie, one star quality, two stars total."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRITERION is NOT the Paragon of Quality","review":"Criterion has successfully promoted itself as the place to go for quality, putting out the best films in the best transfers with the most bonus materials. All the while charging considerably more for their products.Well DON'T you believe it! They certainly cut corners on this DVD. I noticed that everything looked a little claustrophobic as I watched this DVD, so I compared it to the VHS version. The black bars in this actually COVER UP part of the picture!!! They tried to fake the widescreen, apparently. Why would they do such a thing?The recently released \\"Notorious,\\" also by Criterion, is a shabby print that also costs far more than the previously released version. Take my advice...stay away from Criterion products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE FAKE WIDESCREEN!","review":"This Criterion version of Time Bandits contains one of the most shameful practices to be found in DVD production--fake widescreen. For whatever reason, instead of putting the film in true widescreen format, they simply slapped black bars across the top and bottom of an already \\"modified\\" version of the film. So in the end, not only do you miss out on what's going on in the sides of the picture, but also in the top and bottom!!! A rip-off and a shame, because this is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"a title for your review:","review":"^^^Haha...just following instructions^^^I remember watching this movie when I was a kid and it was awesome to be able to watch it again.

I love how they give abstract concepts concrete reality. They touch on many topics regarding religion myth and the nature of existence. Very cool to at least see once.It was one of those older movies that has that nice feel to it, it's about a GOOD kid, going through some amazing things and making decisions based on innocence and kindness, even if the environment is crazy full of death and thievery.The way they portray the parents in the beginning was actually disturbing to me, and I JUST watched it today in 2011. I grew up in the 80's and this depiction doesn't remind me of my childhood, but of the common sub par childhoods of many during those years and before. The stereotype is chilling...plastic covered furniture and family ignoring everyone the kids to watch the tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie, but quality of DVD is not good.","review":"The movie itself is great.

I love British sciences fiction movies. I remember watching Time Bandits in the theater and loving it. However, I'm extremely disappointed with the picture quality. To me, the picture looks like someone took an old, extremely well used, VHS tape and transferred it to Blu-Ray without even bothering to clean any images.

The film was co-scripted by Monty Python alumnus Michael Palin who appears in the film as Vincent. John Cleese also appears in the role Robin Hood. This wonderfully imaginative film follows a boy who gets caught along with a group of dwarves on a journey of time travel.The blu-ray has not been remastered and there are many instances of dust on the image, but the black levels and colour appear to be fine.

Along the way, they encounter Napoleon (Ian Holm), Robin Hood (John Cleese), King Agamemnon (Sean Connery), Evil Genius (David Warner) and God (Sir Ralph Richardson) -- who almost answers one of the supreme theological questions.This new two-disc edition in Divimax is a state of the art hi-def transfer.

I have several Criterion laserdiscs, including their Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and this is my first DVD from them. This does not do the film justice in any way. The transfer is riddled with artifacts from a presumably aged master, and the sound has distinctly noticeable dips, much like turning the volume knob quickly. This is painfully evident in George Harrison's song that plays over the end credits; that song is on no other CD I've seen, which is a shame because it's a very Beatles-y tune. I'm suprised Criterion let this out. My DVD of Dolemite from Image Entertainment is of comparable quality, and their production budget is generally pretty low compared to Criterion's. Is Brazil this bad?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too many extras but a great main feature","review":"This is how children's fantasy should be - genuinely fantastic, avoiding (or, where possible, upturning) all the sword and sorcery cliches, and with a black, mean streak running through it, as kids themselves have. All second nature to one T Gilliam, of course, and the brilliance with which he pulls off the many spectacles herein is offset by a refreshing lack of \\"and do you know what, children?\\" sentimentality. If JK Rowling is the well-meaning but rather patronising relative who produces sixpences from behind your ear with monotonous predictability, Gilliam is the \\"odd\\" uncle who nicks your Almond Joy and scares you half to death with tales of the Toilet Monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not by Sean Connery.

It's a film I could see (and have seen) over and over again.But to expect me to pay this much for what is (merely) a charming movie is absurd, particularly after reading reviews about how this is a sub-par transfer. Not at the current asking price. The price for the non-special edition isn't much better, either (nor, unfortunately, for most of Gilliam's titles.) Gilliam's can be a genius, and \\"Time Bandits\\" has its moments, but I feel like I'm being taken advantage of if I'm expected to pay nealry 40 bucks for this.I'll pass on Time Bandits, or look for a less expensive copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and plotless","review":"Please don't waste your time with this one.

Since using this addition, my pictures are well lit and not as harsh as they were before. The common thread that I see amongst the previous reviews is that the diffuser does not fit snuggly. Knowing this ahead of time helped me to make a decision whether to buy or not because I immediately came up with a plan. I simply cut a small strip of adhesive-backed velcro and stuck it to the top of my flash and on the inside of the diffuser. Now, I don't have to worry about the diffuser slipping off while doing a shoot! Looks neat and works like a charm!! No messy tape to deal with.

Brian before his breakdown, Mike Love strutting around like a proud peacock- something tells me he's putting us all on and this is all done with a wink and tongue firmly in cheek- and hearing the group without benefit of a back up band.

It is basically a manual to help people who somehow find themselves stuck with a BPD to distance themselves. If you have BPD and you are committed to recovering, this book will not help.

Be sure to use the information you find in this book for the BENEFIT of your relationship with your loved one, not to the detriment. There is a tendency in this book to blame the BPD sufferer for actions they are unaware they are making. Be forewarned.As someone who has BPD, although my psychiatrist indicates I am \\"high functioning\\", the best thing that I can recommend is a counselor and Dialectical Behavioral Training.

It does not delve into what any of the causes are for the behaviors! It also has no firm criteria or documentation to back up it's assertions. It seems to assume that everything is the fault of the person with the behaviors and it tries to explain how one should try to cope with those behaviors without becoming too involved. A person with borderline behaviors needs help and a responsible person would be trying to help their daughter, wife, etc. I found no really good answers in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more research","review":"I believe that there needs to be more research to get the accurate satistics. I am worried that buyers of this book may be misinformed.There should be more input by specialists who treat this disorder not only the opinions of those who live with someone that has BPD. I could easily say that my ex of 15 years has BPD but even with the explanations in your book does not qualify me to make that judgement.I have now been in a relationship for almost three years which my partner has been diagnosed with BPD. Her behaviours are very much different to those of my ex.

Although the book doesn't cover work situation, it empowered me since I now know what it is all about.There are may high functional BPs who I met in my life. Even as a friend, they are very loving at first. I have been always puzzled why they can be so 180% different and deceiving.

I was misdiagnosed with BPD, my family bought this book, I went through torture and then we found out that I had a hormone imbalance because of peri menopuase. I recommend a wonderful book called Menopause and the Mind. I caution readers when reading this book not to quickly label their loved ones and condemn them. Get 2nd and 3rd opinions before you accept this diagnosis.

Finally, I discovered an explanation (not an excuse) for it all. While I am not a licensed therapist, it's easy to see that this book's description of high-functioning BPD exactly matches my sister, and I cannot describe the validation and relief I feel in finally seeing some kind of sense made of the madness. This book gave me much comfort in understanding how her brain works and how to deal with her now. I still keep my distance from her as much as possible, but when I have to see her I at least have an understanding of what is happening (e.g., the logic behind her loss of logic, and how to deal with her rages and smear campaigns).

BPD is an obscene illness that defies logic and common sense. The authors do a superb job of introducing the reader to the illness, walking through its components and syndromes, and establishing effective strategies to deal with the disease. If you follow the advice, you will no longer be a co-dependent, lashed to the bizarre behavior of the victim, responding inappropriately and dangerously. You will get your life back and actually help the victim by breaking unhealthy bonds and establishing necessary tough boundaries. This is especially important for parents, moreso for mothers because of nature's bonding ways.

It said that BPD is like diabetes,in that the BPD can not control their moods.This, I believe, is the root of why this book and others like it are dangerous,----- The BPD can control themselves when other people are around.

It doesn't just keep the focus on academic research. It also helps you understand the twisted \\"logic\\" behind a borderline's behavior.

I cannot reccomend this title, in fact, I find it a source of considerable negativity in an area needing love, compassion, and understanding.

Dworkin vents her anger indiscriminately and unthinkingly in a vitriolic, incoherent and hateful manner. While I empathize with many of the sources of her anger, the expression of it in such a manner can only hurt the cause she cares so deeply for. It is the identification of books like this one with the women's movement that has made feminism the new 'F word'.

There is a lot of time spent on the Ponies - something I really can't get into or understand, but her total willingness to do this and her will to do really well is amazing. You almost forget that most of us would consider this degrading when you see how proud she is of herself.When her time is up, she returns to her Master. I really began to hate him in this book.

She gets a lot of things wrong and gives some scary-bad advice.She also takes a really narrow and negative approach toward fathers.

Rather than having adults select the poems in this jewel of a book, Cullinan polled the persons for whom these poems were written, children. The poems, though simple and easy to read, reflect on deep and personal thoughts; they are also wonderfully humorous. At the end of the book, in a section titled \\"About the Poets,\\" Dr. Cullinan lets the poets speak for themselves, adding additional information sparingly and tastefully.These poems are a joy to behold, not only for children, but for adults as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I can't seem to get my daughter interested in this book.

This was just the ticket. I finished the book in four days, reading a bit in the morning before work & a bit in the evening after work. Chapters are short & easily digested. The author gently leads the reader through the components of XML & how they all fit together followed by a similar path for DTDs. In the end the reader should be able not only to read & understand moderately complex XML documents & DTDs, but also design & write both DTDs & XML documents that conform to those DTDs. There is an appropriate amount of repetition to reinforce key points. There are a few misprints, sometimes glaring, for example, \\"Names may begin with integers,\\" NOT! The included CD is a blatant commercial self-promotion for an XML editor that the author's company sells & little else of value. On the whole, I was quite happy with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"world record for poor proof reading","review":"I have never read a book so littered with mistakes. To a neophyte this book must be so confusing as to be totally useless. Can you believe the author gives three different renderings of the acronym SGML within a few pages of each other. Many absolutely critical points are muffed by the most banal and obvious proof reading errors. The final straw is the tear out reference card which can't even get the rules for XML names correct. Really, it's just too, too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't even define EDI right","review":"To most of the world, EDI stands for Electronic Data Interchange. In this book, however, it stands for Electronic Document Interchange. The author's explanation of ED and its pros and cons are ridiculously simplistic and incomplete. I didn't expect this book to go into much detail about EDI, but I expected the information it did give to be accurate. This error makes me question the validity of the rest of the book. I'll find another resource, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did it Happen?","review":"I still wonder how much of what the media tells you is true and how much is fantasy.....don't you?Fabulous movie, either way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"I always love watching this movie. One of the best even with some pretty bad/corny lines, it's still a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capricorn One","review":"Everything previously stated about the film is dead on. Good flick, nice transfer, great Jerry Goldsmith score however the quality of the recorded dialog is horrendous at times. I remember this when I saw the film theatrically in 1977. Many scenes have distorted dialog or are so poorly recorded and mixed as to affect intelligibility especially the scenes on the Mars set. But albeit the recorded dialog quality is subpar at times the overall appeal, fun and enjoyment factor of Capricorn One makes it worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing farce","review":"This is about as silly as SF gets, although it's a better than average conspiracy flick. Okay, you can no longer watch the scenes with O.J. Simpson without cringing, but that's not the movie's fault. The key plot device is, unfortunately, ludicrous (no, I won't give it away) because (1) NASA could not have possibly overlooked such an obvious giveaway and (2) every teenage geek and nerd in the country would have caught it way before the intrepid reporter finally puzzles it out. (Speaking as a former teenage nerd, trust me on this.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely for NASA Cynics","review":"The president decides to counter sinking polls by ordering a manned mission to Mars. All goes according to plan until just before launch, when red tape makes the flight untenable. Should mission control scrub the voyage or fake it? The last scenes are cliche, but anybody who regards NASA as just another politicized bureaucracy will love this film. OJ Simpson stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, lousy acting, Great chase scenes","review":"The concept is there, God knows enough people actually believe it, if only the acting and screen play matched the concept it would be a decent film. The two scenes that I love are when the reporter's car goes out of control and is running through the city with the camera on the hood of the car and the chase scene between the helicopters and bi-plane. Other than that, nothing special."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"This is and should be a classic. The cast is amazing, although its strange to see O.J. simpson acting....(ugh) If you have never seen this movie your missing something!!Im never one to watch movies or read books more than once, but this one grabs you everytime....and its ageless, it came out in the 70's, my son who is 18 just watched it and loved it!! and he doesnt give a thumbs up to much lol...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you wonder if we really went to the moon","review":"Good plot about our own government attempting to hoax the world with a staged manned space flight to Mars. The film keeps us in our seats with moving action and suspense as the three astronauts attempt to escape their captors and reveal to the world what was really going on. A rare acting appearance by O. J. Simpson is featured in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Drive In Experience!!!!","review":"I saw this movie back in 1978 at my local Drive In Movie Theatre with my girlfriend at the time, Cheryl. Cheryl wanted to get into the back seat but I was enjoying this movie too much. It concerns a group of three astronauts who are forced to fake a landing on Mars and then they are on the run in the desert. This movie stars the HOT Brenda Vaccaro and the equally beautiful Karen Black who both give fine performances.This movie has become something of a Cult Classic in recent years and deservedly so. It was not that often that a movie could make me neglect the ever so seductive charms of Cheryl!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mission-to-Mars misfire will not be televized...","review":"-> BLU RAYBack in the seventies 'conspiracy' was all the rage: 3 Days of the Condor; All the President's Men; The Parallax View; Night Moves; The Domino Principle; The Conversation... to name a few.

I have some minor complaints on features, but overall the system suits the needs of my home-based business. For a while, I was very satisfied, but then just a little more than a year after I made the purchase, the handsets started to lose contact with the base, often in mid-call. I bought third-party batteries once to save $$, but they didn't resolve the problem so I sprung for the AT&T; batteries. Same problem. This system was way too expensive to have to replace so soon. It's a shame - once upon a time, the AT&T; brand guaranteed an excellent product, but next time I'll look for another brand.ADDENDUM, OCTOBER 2011: Three of the four handsets are dead (despite battery replacements).

And besides, the third 'episode' actually convinced me to watch DS9, because the characters in the book were so interesting; and to my (good) surprise, they were exactly the same in the series, which I now love! The fourth 'episode' had the funniest bits, especially the one with Janeway's hairpin. That was a hoot! All in all, the best Star Trek literature around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BOOM!!!

She adds color and impact to the picture of your imagination while reading the words. Some readers tend to be too critical, Lighten up and enjoy.

It has inspired me to think about media in new, ecological terms. This is a great book for defining paradigms. The first section, which focuses a lot on technical biological science lays the groundwork for the rest of the book. Gene and cell networks can be applied to how cultures and societies are structured. Some chapters are truly scary (such as the section on biotechnology), and others are very uplifting (like the chapter \\"Changing the Game\\").

From the build up of this new game I thought we were going to get some new fun to play 5 reel games but alas this was not to be the case.

It has NO new slot games - just a re-mix from all the previous software releases by the company. I suppose this edition will be nice for those who don't have the any of the previous versions. I think the point of releasing new software is so that we can play more of the slot games that are have been or are currently being released in the casinos. So we can play our favorite slots when we can't go to the casinos!

Anyone who loves ideas should read this book; it shows the power of ideas and how they shape our nation's Founding. In it, Bailyn traces the intellectual twists and turns that shaped America in the years leading to revolution and beyond. Nonetheless, it is open to criticism because it focuses almost exclusively on ideas, to the detriment of a discussion of social conditions. To some extent, these criticisms are valid: people aren't always rational and don't follow intellectual necessity.

I went on Amazon and Bingo, there was my bra with a bonus. It was being sold for a sale price. The vendor shipped in a very timely fashion and I am just delighted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bali Women's Lace Bra","review":"I've been wearing this style for years.

This style wears, well, washes well and is very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit right","review":"It was comfortable, but did not fit at all like I had hoped it would. The cups had pretty much no support, and it even seemed like they had too much material. It sort of bunched up...not attractive. I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"review","review":"I bought this bra for my 13 year old daughter and it has very good support - but it is not really true to size. My kid is very well endowed at a 34-DD. I also ordered a couple of bras for myself but unfortunately Bali does not carry my size 44-DD, and I don't know why because there are more big women than little women. Hey, Bali get with the program!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At last a lacy bra for seniors, too!!","review":"I love this bra not only bcause it fits so well, but it has great support as well. Also, it is very comfortable......everything I look for in a bra. I wanted to get it in black, but it is not available in my size right now. Older women like lacy bras, too. It is hard to find a lacy bra for seniors. I am glad that this one is available, at least in white!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!!!!( V ) Don't let the my name fool you....","review":"I actually liked it, it was funny, and kool to see all the chacaters. I would have ;liked to see more of Miley's opinions. Jason Earles did a good job of introducing the fueds. It was nice to see Selena Gomez, Cody Linley, Dolly Parton, Raven Symone, and more. It was awesome, and i can't wwait for the next one. Each episode you've already seen on the disney channel, but its always good to have them on Dvd. Because you can't take cable tv with you every where. In my opinion Miley Cyrus rocks. Keep It Up Miley. I do believe that you are a good role model, and you do very well standing up your beleives, Because i have the same believes!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"granddaughter loved it","review":"I bought this for my granddaughters birthday.

She is an OK singer, she can only sing Rockish Alternative Pop music because her voice is so raspy.Hannah Montana copies off of That's So Raven in these ways:1. About a pop star, who keeps it a secret from everyone, but her family knows she is Hannah Montana. (Raven is psychic, only her family and friends know. It's a secret from everyone else.)And, that's the biggest CLUE, that Hannah Montana is copying straight off of That's So Raven. Which is still Disney Channel's only show to have 100 episodes.Plus, Hannah Montana's viewers have gone down to 2 million every new episode.It music suck, because That's So Raven drew in over 3 million viewers every episode, and gets 1.8 million viewers on ABC Kids on Saturday Morning.NOW THAT'S TALENT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh sweet Jebus No, No, Nooooooooo!!","review":"Lets nip this trend in the bud before it starts, shall we?

Nope, this mush is all too common.Just because you can make a piece of dreck movie starring an obnoxious no-talent, does not mean that you have to do it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful but limited","review":"I used this book as a reference in an introductory Java class. In most cases, it was extremely useful, but there were also many times when I couldn't find a particular topic I was looking for.

This is nice to use as a simple, quick reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"WASP grow up...","review":"It is said by a lot of critics (and fans also) that this is WASP's best album...that it is a lot more mature, deep etc etc. than their previous releases.While that may be true to an extent, it lacks the solidity of the first 3 albums (more than likely because it was a step in a different direction). Some of the songs are great (Mean Man, Headless Children, Forever Free, Rebel In The FDG, Maneater)...but the rest are more or less filler.It lacks the energy that WASP displayed in their first 3 studio outings (as well as the live album)...and for me doesn't really compare.However, it is definitely worth getting if you are a fan of WASP, and more importantly, Blackie.If you are only getting into them now, I'd recommend The Last Command as the album to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I truly wanted to love this book and thought I would because I love stories with music in the plot. However, this book had no plot. I couldn't remember from one page to the next what happened on the last page. It seemed to be a lot of rambling with run-on sentences that could take up a whole page and paragraphs that went on and on page after page!For the first time in several years, I slammed a book shut without finishing it. I don't know if I'll ever try to read it again. It just made no sense to me. I kept going back to the synopsis on the dust jacket and I didn't find anything in the book even remotely like the synopsis.I made it to page 43...chapter 8. Chapter 7 was one page long...a single sentence. That was all I could take of the book. Perhaps there was something later in the book, but I didn't have any motivation to read one more page. There was just nothing to hold my attention. It was a great sleeping aid.I hate to say this, but this book was a waste of good paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Amazonian bungling!","review":"Yet again the folks at Amazon have bungled matters. The other \\"review\\" of this book is in fact a review of (or a puff for) the Penn series of translations of Greek tragedy, not of Euripides' \\"Selected Fragmentary Plays,\\" a scholarly edition offering Greek texts, English translations, and detailed notes on several of Euripides' fragmentary plays. It should also noted that the book in question is the recently published---and long-awaited---second volume of a work whose first volume appeared in 1995. Eventually, there will be a Loeb Classical Library edition of the major fragments of Euripides, but it is unlikely to replace these volumes of Collard et al., for their very full notes will remain invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mussolini and I","review":"My only major critisim is that it should have focused more on the politics of Ciano and his diaries.

Small's debut thriller, a force of nature nearly as powerful as the mountain on which he preys. Nearly... Not quite. This mountain has surprises gushing all over Mr. Boyd and his best-laid murderous plans.Poor Boyd. What started as a simple stock swindle has turned into blackmail of a federal judge. Then his partner discovers the crime, and Boyd must remove him before his goose is cooked. Where better to put him than Rainier, where mile deep crevasses don't speak? But glaciers move, and Rainier's are full. Seems Boyd's been a busy, busy man.Small brings Rainier alive, makes it tremble and shake, even as the reader too quakes with suspense. This is a great story, and I couldn't put it down.But I have to give it four stars only, just because it's a debut. I expect this author may earn my highest respect with his next effort, if it's as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced, suspenseful reading","review":"Ben knocked the cover off the ball with his first book! Very easy book to read, as the suspense filled plot keeps you wanting more and to know what happens to Emery, John and Amy. Ben does a very nice job of helping you to get to know each of the key characters in the book, all while keeping the background interesting and entertaining. Ben keeps you wondering what will happen and just when you think you might have the story figured out and how it will happen, he surprises you with a twist in the ending of the book.Highly recommend this book, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I have been trading professionally for over 10 years.

Aaghh!!!!!!","review":"Joe has a consistent smooth jazz style which has made all of his albums up 'til now, absolutely essential. But, i feel i should say i'm personally dissapointed with this project. The background use of organ and scatty use of organ is too prominent and i for one, absolutely hate the organ sound. (IT MAKES ME CRINGE! AAGHH!) It belongs in a church and should stay in a church and not spoil smooth jazz grooves. If Joe had not used any organ and it's definately not needed, this album would've had 5 stars! This album does has the odd moment, but all i could hear was dreaded organ on every track which spoiled the enjoyment of joe's keyboard. So, this is a big dissapointment for me. If you are a Joe Mcbride fan, i recommend you listen to this album before you buy. If you happen to love organ, you will adore this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian & Sylvia Are Timeless","review":"Ian & Sylvia transcended folk music. In the early 1960s I viewed folk music with disdain. In January 1967, however, I attended a concert by Ian & Sylvia and was impressed but largely ignored their music.

My first AF SLR was a Nikon!! with this same strap! 14 years later...thousands of pictures, travel across South America, Central America and North America. Nikon camera serviced by Nikon twice, strap replaced ONCE when I gave the camera away! The strap was on its last legs and did not want the new owner to have the strap snap while shooting. All things considered it held up extremely well. I have 7 of these straps and leave the original straps that came with my cameras in the camera boxes. You can not beat the $, durability and acceptable comfort level (not bad for a low cost strap that is also durable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheap, I DO NOT RECOMMEND","review":"I was very disappointed by this product. First off, the photo shows \\"Nikon\\" in yellow stitching. The product I received had \\"Nikon\\" in white in what looked like a fuzzy sticker. The strap is too short to be usable. I do not know why it is listed as a \\"wide strap\\" because it is no wider than the strap that comes with most Nikon DSLR's. In fact the default strap that comes with Nikon Cameras, is much better quality than this one. SAD. I bought this to be an upgrade, not a downgrade. Being so cheap I'm not too upset, but it is still a waste. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"neat idea, but bad implementation","review":"These things don't work very well.

Either these Kool Floss swords don't use waxed floss, or the floss isn't as thin as my good floss.My teeth are very close together and it's a little tough getting normal (good) floss through the gaps but using the floss swords requires an insane amount of force to drive the string between the teeth.

Timing has a lot to do with one's ability to enjoy this soundtrack because your association to the end of the cold war will influence that judgment. This is NOT a Pink Floyd recording on side 2. It is a Bleeding Heart band recording of the RADIO KAOS era. I was, and still am, a huge fan of this recording. The musicianship and performance characteristics are stellar. The production, using what was at that time state of the art, is great. Roger did have something important to say about the fear of death in a increasingly tense stand off between the USSR and NATO. If you weren't alive or cognizant of those times this recording is hard to enjoy. While opaque drug induced lyrics make bong hits all the better, this is a very political statement which lacks the subtlety of such recordings of the Pink Floyd era."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart wrenching, and haunting story","review":"My friend and I happened to find this video in our local rental outlet, and rented it solely because it claimed to be the a twisted and disturbing cartoon. What we got in return for our dollar was a stunning vision of life, love, and death that continued to haunt me with it's portrayal of an english couple for these months since. It truly is a pity that it isn't available on video, and that few people will even come here to see if it is, but I Strongly urge you to search this film out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two excellent Roger Waters songs from a moving film","review":"Half of the CD (Roger Waters part) is what can be considered a soundtrack with two proper songs and music bits from the film. The film itself is very moving and the Waters song are excellent and spot on with the narrative along withAmused to DeathandTo Kill The Child / Leaving Beirut. Lyrics are what you would expect from Waters and the music of both songs are quite strong. I can recommend to any Roger Waters fan even if only for these two songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIsconnected like WHAT","review":"I seriously have no clue what is going on with this book...I purchased it hoping that there would be scholarly information with connections between linguistics and morality (as the title suggests) for a thesis.

I was expecting to experience a minty tingle on my scalp as I have with the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree product I've used before. Unfortunately the shampoo went on just like any generic shampoo except with a very strong and synthetic lavender (and to me unpleasant) odor. This definitely doesn't jive with the majority of the reviews and I'm wondering if Amazon hasn't mixed all the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree product reviews together. The strong synthetic lavender scent lingers for a very long time. I won't be able to use this product due to the strong odor. I plan on looking into this to see if I can get to the bottom of it. Hopefully I can return these two bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like...

In our yearly vacations to Europe, his books were always the most accurate, detailed and useful.But this one is really different, as if there is some (political? commercial?) agenda behind it - for example -- Gimmelwald as the center of the Bernese Oberland alps? Are you insane? A vilage with two BB and no restaurants... Is someone reviewing these books?- And Grindelwald (there) is only mentioned as a side comment while it is the largest resort in that area.Not even mentioning that Geneva is poorly covered (not interesting...). And these are only the items I've seen until now.If you are going to Switzerland, specially if focusing on the Bernese Oberland, do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. Don't even read it because you will only get confused, specially if you used to believe Rick Steves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geneva is ommitted","review":"I bought this book because I am planning a trip to Geneva--but Geneva is completely omitted from the book! It is not even listed in the index.

Several friends who travel frequently highly reccomended Rick Steves so I purchased this book without looking into it carefully. I am planning a trip to Geneva and was shocked to discover that there is nothing about Geneva in this book. It isn't even listed in the Index and in the chapter on Lake Geneva the only mention is \\"Skip the big, dull city of Geneva\\". How can he call this a guide to Switzerland without anything at all about a major city? To be fair, his generic advice about packing, language guides are fine but they can be found in any guidebook and I found the advertsing for his luggage and tours annoying. I will not have time to travel beyond Geneva so I can not judge his advice for other areas of the country, but for me this book is basically useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bummer\\"","review":"Rick does not cover the 3rd largest city in the country.

I think Steves's success has gone to his head -- this level of opinionated advice is useless at best, irresponsible at worst.

Still the best European travel books around if you travel solo."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still just Zwitzerland","review":"We are big fans of Rick Steves and his guide books; however, Switzerland isn't France or Italy, and Rick hasn't much to work with as it's still just Switzerland.For those who have never been there, it's still the best guide book on the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick Steves Switzerland","review":"Typically great Rick Steves. Everything you need to know to be your own travel agent and tour guide. Rick makes you feel like you're there even before you leave so you can pick and choose your stops, schedule your transportation and pick hotels and restaurants with good insight. We used his books for France and Italy and everything went flawlessly. Most of all his travel philosophy ensures you experience the 'real' Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switzerland Planning","review":"As with all Rick Steve's guides, this one has a wealth of information on Switzerland. I was very disappointed, however, to find that the second largest city in the country, Geneva, was not mentioned. I expected the ususal comprehesnive coverage of this city and found - nothing! Very disappointing since Geneva will be the site of the conference I will be attending and the hub for our travels in the country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"There was no attempt to take advantage of the digital format.

As many others have mentioned, there is only one passing mention of Geneva - don't come here looking for ANY recommendations about that city. I'd never bought a Rick Steves book before this one, so I don't know if this is common or not, but if he wants to make a book about his \\"top picks\\" of Switzerland, OK. But tell us that first. I was expecting a full guide to Switzerland, which this isn't.Also, the quality of the illustrations is terrible. I'm not sure if this is because it's a Kindle edition, or if it's because I'm reading it on an iPad Kindle app, but the photographs are tiny - and all in B&W; - and not zoomable. The maps are the same way; by the time you zoom them so you can actually see them, they're illegible due to deterioration in image quality.I'd really like my money back for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insights","review":"I think the Rick Steves' guides are the best. After reviewing his recommendations for Switzerland, we are headed to the Berner Oberland area with a destination of Gimmelwald. Seems like a place that is a hidden gem and we can't wait to get there and explore. These guides give you meaningful suggestions on where to go and what to see. They don't just cover everything possible, they truly prioritize for you. It is like having an expert guide give you personal recommendations.

The Switzerland 2007 book, like all his other books, tell you everything you need to know to help you plan a trip to Switzerland. He tells you all about the typical tourist sites but he goes farther than that. Rick tells you how to find the \\"backdoor\\" locations. These are usually small towns or lesser known attractions that the average tourist would probably not be aware of if it wasn't for Rick's books. One backdoor that he mentions in this book is the small quaint town of Gimmelwald which is close to Interlaken. Visiting towns like Gimmelwald gets you out of the big cities and shows you what life in Switzerland is really like. He also recommends hotels and restaurants that are affordable and full of charm.

The picture on the cover of the book illustrates more animals than there are patterns or instructions for in the book. There is no pattern for the Ark. His carving style is not what I was looking for or wanted, but I was not able to clearly discern his style from the cover illustration. His carving of Mrs. Noah is a caricature, and his carving of the animals is rustic. I will not use the books myself but may donate them to our carving club's library for use by beginning carvers.

The main theme is about an abused under-rated horse who was purchased by a less-than-wealthy trainer. The trainer's assistant takes to the horse and puts it through its paces and develops the animals strength. It is the fastest horse in all of Australia and proves to overcone tremendous odds both physical and political. The characters are realistic and not overdone. The story is compellling and honest. The ending is heartbreaking as men do what is financially expedient at the expense of a great animal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome guide.","review":"This book rocks.

Actually you have to download the examples off the publisher's website (for an additional price, of course).As for teaching PHP and MySQL, it's not worth it. I followed the examples to the letter but couldn't get PHP to work with MySQL. (Couldn't even get them to talk to each other)If you're going to waste your money on this though, I *highly* recommend you order directly from the publisher, since it \\"seems\\" if you do, you might get the examples for free (maybe), but don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Top 10 Tech Book - You WILL Learn PHP and MySQL!","review":"I was first introduced to this book...when I downloaded the first four chapters. They were EXCELLENT and got me up and running with PHP and MySQL (on a Win2K box) in no time. This is simply one of the best tech books I own.Kevin has done a fantastic job of clearly explaining AND teaching PHP and MySQL. He somehow found a way to cram as much useful information as possible into this small book but managed to organize it in a tech-friendly way. You WILL learn these technologies AND build a PHP/MySQL website by the time you finish (if not earlier). Even his chapter on installing the technologies is as good as it gets. How many times have you followed a set of installation steps and when you were finished had something work EXACTLY the way you thought it would? Well, Kevin does just that in this book. Sure, this may not be the largest book you'll ever buy but it WILL be one of the best!Buy it and enjoy!! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for Beginners","review":"If you are anything beyond a beginner, don't waste your money on this book.

As I need to build a website using mysql & php, I thought this book would be exactly what I needed. I already know sql & html and only needed to know php and how to connect the three. Unfortunately none of the code in the book actually works. Having programmed before I know you cannot call variables without declaring them first (quite a stupid mistake for someone who calls hiself a glorious leader). changing a method from get to post can't really be done that way either!!!I would have expected Kevin to have at least checked his code before publising. All in all quite a useless book, specially for a beginner. Not worth 1 star but Amazon doesn't allw 0 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great beginners book","review":"I bought this book and am very happy with it. I've bought a lot of books on PHP that really suck, not because the author didn't know the subject, but because the author stunk as a teacher. This isn't a reference book, it's a how-to tutorial and it succeeds at what it set out to do. It teaches PHP and MySQL to newbies. I've used it and have loaned it out to others in my company and they love it.

But after reading Kevin Yanks Book I'm sorry to say that the adjectives that pops up in my mind is: insufficient and boring. Insufficient because the text do not explane the PHP language in the examples given and because one need some actual (allready made) tables for the examples. It is boring because of the way it is written, the typograhy and the lack of \\"candy for the eyes\\" in the resulting pages of the examples. Allthough I've read the second edition (which just arrived I believe!) I must say that this book needs another rewriting! Find some more exiting database-examples, make the typograhy more clear, make the resulting HTML-pages more interesting and last but not least: be sure to explain what you do in the given examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent for beginners","review":"I read this book in about 2 days and have built a working database for the web in about 3 days.

The database works well, looks great on the web and I owe it all to this book.It was much appreciated to have the \\"whys\\" answered so clearly.

I was able to set up my G3 266 running OS X (that's right kids, 10.2.8) and get Apache set up right, MySQL installed, tested and working securely and PHP connected up. When I got my first test page working and pulled my first record up, I came to the realization that the instructions in the book worked. Exactly right. First time. Well-written, well-formatted and CLEAR. The Mac section had everything I needed. When I began doing the exercises, I began to dread typing in all the code - then I finally keyed on the CODE ARCHIVE!!!! No CDs to screw around with - just go to the site, punch in some numbers and BINGO, complete set of files, ready to use. Gotta love that. I'm confident now, having finally gotten over the 'hump' of setting up my system and UNDERSTANDING what I was doing, that I'll be able to build database-driven sites with good insight.I strongly recommend this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a limited audience","review":"I wouldn't say this is for the total newbie, although basic explanations of the various component software (web servers, MySql, and PHP) are good. But it is a handy reference and tutorial for anyone who has some knowledge or understanding of databases and programming, and wants to know more about using PHP with MySql.The tutorial format is somewhat weak on details, which are supposed to be supplemented by the SitePoint website (which I didn't check). I found the greatest value, however, in the explanations of the programming techniques and tricks. Given the complexities of working with a database and PHP, this book will surely disappoint newbies who are looking for a \\"Learn MySQL and PHP in 24 hours\\" type of book. For those venturing fearlessly into the waters, it's worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHP for Dumb Me","review":"I hit on SitePoint while working on a php/mysql project for a degree I am working on. First of all I appreciated that a lot of Kevin's book was already online and that SitePoint decided to share that with neophytes like myself. Kevin has a gift for explaining clearly the theory and also for how to practically get started. I downloaded a number of classes on php duringmy project but Kevin's was at the top.This in turn encouraged me to purchase the book.

Everyone in Japan was stunned at how good my pronunciation was, and how good my vocabulary was. Although my vocabulary was not large and I was by no means fluent, I was totally confident in what I knew. The method is excellent, and really works. No other do-it-yourself course even comes close. As soon as you complete the first few lessons, it\`s clear right away that this method is very effective. In addition to giving you practical language skills, the program serves to build your confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent course!","review":"The Pimsleur courses are certainly among the very best on the market. The \\"just-right\\" speed of the set is amazong, it's fast enough to \\"sound real\\", but slow enough to get the nuances. One reader/listener criticized the pronounciation of \\"\\"wakarimas\\" vs. \\"\\"wakarimasu\\" - I may add that it is correct that it may be written \\"wakarimasu\\", but it is about 15 minutes into the course you learn that the \\"su\\" at the end of words is not really spoken in Japanese. Since they use native speakers on the courses, it also appears unlikely they'd make such a simple mistake. Good luck with your learning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"War of trust is fantastic!!","review":"Sir Anthony Hopkins plays a defense attorney trying to recapture a dissolving marriage.

Micky Rourke is better than usual. Mimi rogers is great. two things make it not so good. Comparing this to the original; there just isn't a comparison. & Lindsay Crouse...oh man, she's painful in this one. she has a very, I mean very, bad southern accent & it ruins the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save us from remakes","review":"This film is actually a remake of a 1950s film with Humphrey Bogart and Frederic March. It was based on a highly successful novel and stage play by Joseph Hayes. Perhaps if you've never seen the original this version would be more palatable. But there is nothing like Bogart as the sociopath who invades a suburban home and trades insults with papa Frederic March. The original was also shot in the Leave it to Beaver House (now used in Desperate Housewives) just for good measure. So pass this one up and find a copy of the original!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The TRX is not a toy!.","review":"I am 75 years of age and this is not a toy for me.

I've read some of the reviews and agree that this scooter is unsafe. Once the front end pops up and rolls on the back wheels you have no control over the steering. You can usually pop it back down but it gives you kind of a scarey feeling. The battery discharges way too soon. At first it would go for several minutes before needing a recharge and now, after a few weeks, won't go for longer than maybe 8 minutes. I've also looked at some of the reviews like the one that says \\"bad batteries...it happens\\" Yeah, it happens! And when it happens to you, it isn't just a casual problem. Good luck finding a new one! I refuse to deal with Sunco customer service any longer. They really should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to sell this product.

The comedy is light and easily understood. The ending itself is a machine that just keeps on building and building up.

You can immediately tell that it is written by a true Vatican \\"insider\\" with both an American and an Italian heart. It is easy to read, and gives the reader a sense of both the objectiveness of the Catholic Church (and it's newest Pope), and the depth and beautiful mystery of both. As Mr. Gibson is a convert to Catholicism, there are enough explanations that both Catholics and Non-Catholics alike will find this book easy to follow and will be able to form their own opinions. I would highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to familiarize themselves with the hierarchical Church or the role of the Church in International politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another old hack dissing the Pope","review":"Well well, what can one expect from Mr.Gibson? He is of the \\"Catholic\\" dissident mold, the type that never tire of throwing out the old \\"causes\\" of the liberal 60's and 70's even though the Church (thank God) is finaly past that stage. The book gives a fairly good background on the Holy Fathers early days, but it is full of Gibson's tired old \\"change the Church so we can be more like protestants agenda.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Gibson is a Loser, Benedict is a Winner","review":"Gibson is a biased writer with no understanding of what it means to be Catholic. Gibson wants to throw away 2,000 years of tradition and make the Church another protestant denomination.

This is the type of leader the world needs! Unwavering in his principles which are firmly founded in God's Revelation. I am very happy that the author is a convert to Catholicism but faith is not like a cafeteria, that one pick and choose what one would like to savor. If you are an authentic Catholic, you are convinced that the Church throughout the ages has been passing on the fullness of truth revealed by God to His flock. If you don't like that, then please, no one is forcing you to remain. Go and find a denomination that better suits your taste and preference. As for me, I remain with Holy Father Benedict XVI, because where Peter is, there is the Church, and there is Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after just 1 year","review":"Don't buy this machine.

Then as time goes by, you get closer and closer to that court date, but \\"Series one\\" only takes you to 6 days before the court date. So it's only half the story.

If any newcomer is able to follow along with the tutorial application and actually build it, I'd be very, very surprised.I just do not see the point of having the book's text on even pages and a bulleted review of that same text (along with code) on odd pages.

The reader gets lulled into thinking he can skip the summary page on the right if the left page is read -- but WAIT, there are two or three words of important information that was not mentioned on the left page!! The end result is that the reader is forced to read 95% of the information twice! Once on a single page and then again in summary form on the very next page and you dare not skip it!The couple of Authors who write Murach's books seem to be little more than contract writers with little experience in any one specific area of programming. However, if you can stand the format, they have done some research work on the topics they write about but they are also quick to bail out on you when real expertise is needed.

He often presents stuff that I am in no postion to understand until more basic concepts have been covered. He also introduces concepts that I will not use until much later. I would rather learn about something and use it immediately. Other topics can wait until I have to use them.I can learn ASP.Net from this book, but it seems like a lot more work than it should be.Also, his habit of repeating the same thing on the left and right page annoys me.

It's flawless. Brilliantly written, brilliantly acted, superbly plotted. Faultless. Daniels and Farrow are perfectly stunning in their parts. Whatever happended to Jeff Daniels? Why is this the only film I've seen him in? He plays this part with the lightest of touches: it's like whipped cream. Farrow is incredible, retaining always the slight reserve of suspicion that things can't be quite what they seem, which just about makes the ending bearable. The real mastery of the writing and direction is that what threatens to be a one-joke plot never topples over and falls flat.

The horse has long since left the barn and the farm but when a film is this atrocious an additional warning cannot be amiss. The performances, cinematography, etc. are exactly as you expect them to be for a film this expensive. But it is all for naught. The screenplay and the idea behind it are so awful that no amount of technical excellence could salvage it. A collection of morons decided to extract the heart of Becky Sharp. The very thing that has kept people reading her adventures for 200+ years was judged as inadequately upbeat for the American public. It is a deeply insulting film. Their Becky is sweet. Vanity Fair is a cinematic hatchet job; they gut Becky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Show!","review":"I am very sad to say that both the screenplay and direction are utterly abominable. Both play havoc with the very core of Thackeray's masterpiece. Mira had tried to manipulate albeit very unsuccessfully with each and every character that they, as a result, appear absolutely farcical, and evoke no sympathy for Amelia nor hatred or grudging respect for Becky Sharp. This is utterly unacceptable! Mira and the screenplay writer have made a garbage of this masterpiece! The core of the novel was emotional interplay between the various characters that is abysmally missing in the movie version! The girl who played Amelia is quite horrible with no talent to speak of but being WHITE, British and trifle pretty, will make her the toast of the town.

The meticulous researchers from \\"Titanic\\" are probably shuddering. But aside from the visual fallacies, there is the whole issue of the dance scene, an Indian spectacle put on by miss Becky and some noble ladies. In the 19th century, a woman didn't show her ankles in public let alone her midriff! That entire scene was in the realms of fantasy not only in the behavior of the women, but in the music as well. Please, if a director is going to make a historical film, let's at least hope that he likes the era enough to portray it correctly.

The people who made this movie cared more about visual style than actually telling a story, any story, let alone the story in the book.

The costumes were awful, the hairstyles copied from Spock, and the aura was the Roman Empire under Tiberius and Caligula . How bad was the actor who played George?!?The only \\"bright spot\\" if you can call it so, is Reese Witherspoon.

The costumes and settings are absolutely fantastic, lush and colorful. The acting was wonderful, and was inevitable because of the astonishing list of actors. Especially if you follow British Theater, you recognize actor after actor. And Reese has more depth to her acting than I had realized.But the complaint is the editing, the sheer choppiness of the story line. By the end of the movie, my husband and I had joined others in the theater who were laughing at supposedly serious parts. For example, someone falling madly in love with someone they hated one second ago.I recommend A&E;'s version instead.

Even the trailer on Youtube is worthless by my judgement,How can something so pretty be such a mess? Dunno.

This? She disappears a lot of the time, only to pop up at the oddest moments, and she's very obviously pregnant (with her second child, Dylan) during it! They tried to cover it up as much as possible, although at least she had cleavage-enhancing outfits a plenty, you can sometimes see the outline of a bump. But she's not as good as she was in Legally Blonde.I also thought Johnathan Rhys Meyers would be good in this too, he was lovely in Bend It Like Beckham (mainly the Irish accent), but his character is a bit of a prat in this.

This is a strange movie. It seems that a lot of staff was trying to be fit into the movie and not successfully at all. The movie spans more than 10 years, yet noone except the children gets physically older. The motivations behind characters' actions are a mystery - most of the time a viewer is dumbfounded. For example, one moment George Osborne cant stand his fiance, the next - he marries her. Hah? The 2 stars are for the pretty and colorful costumes and scenery. Also, I thought all the young men did not look very manly, with all the feathery clothes and \\"rooster\\" hairdos :) What's with their hair? \\"Persuasion\\" of 1995 is of exact same period - no funky hair in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of money!!!","review":"I was really excited about this movie, that is until I sat down to watch it.

The latteris excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I'd hoped","review":"The sets and costumes are gorgeous; however, I wish more time had been taken on the screenplay, and/or editing. I, like some other reviewers, was a bit confused by the startling transitions - there didn't seem to be a flow or reason to them at all. I'm wondering if they cut out what might have been explanatory scenes, in the essence of time. Still, the movie clocked in at almost 2 1/2 hours!!So I guess the transitions were my biggest problem, and left me and my boyfriend wondering what in the world was going on. Also, it seemed everyone in the movie aged except for Becky Sharp. Maybe it was a nod to her youthful and witty nature, but come on - a little realism would be nice!Bottom line - if you've read the book, see it (it might be similar). If you haven't, and you're looking for a movie that's beautiful to watch, check it out. If you're looking for a great storyline - skip it.

This book is about a group of kids who don't like this girl named courtney because she's a showoff and she thinks shes all that.Throughout the book the kids come up with ways to try to scare courtney. This book would have been a lot scarier if they talked about the mud monsters more and had more scary things happen. When the book actually reached the scary part it didn't last real long.This book was dissapointing and not the best book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"I always felt this book wasn't that great. From the cover you expect the story to focus on those cool mud monsters, but they only appear in the last few chapters.

Jenny Lumet wins both, with extra credit for random overacting, but Timothy Hutton puts up a grand fight for second place. The script is wordy way past the point of tedium: it HAS to be based on a bad play. It's like a very literate writer trying desperately to be authentic, but unwilling to discard a single line he's ever heard in a cop movie. Never mind: you can have a fine time playing 'count the hard-boiled cop cliches'. Cheap special effects, along with a listless score and jarring theme song,reinforce the impression that nobody's heart was in it.Some distinguished people were associated with the making of this film.

There is a chain of corruption going all the way to the top and of course the inevitable chief looking to be appointed governor. Poor Al does what he can to trap Nick Nolte's character and despite the deaths of various shady characters who \\"won't be missed\\" he does it but all ends in a great disappointment for him when the \\"Powers that Be\\" decide that the best thing would be to forget all about it and let everything carry on as before.

The simple story is about a little girl picking a pumpkin, rolling it home, chasing it as it goes awry, and making a jack-o-lantern out of it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the \\"pumpkin moonshine\\" title (and some of the other language in the book) is slightly outdated. I didn't realize until the end what a \\"pumpkin moonshine\\" was-- it's a jack-o-lantern. I had only associated the word \\"moonshine\\" with liquor.

'Pacific Freight' is actually a recording session by Nanette Workman (actress, singer, songwriter). My guess is that Peter Frampton was merely Wokman's guitarist during this session.

However, I have to say this film has not aged well. It is very slow for the first 45 minutes before the little monsters arrive.

It is a story of a young white man who falls in love with a beautiful Cherokee girl. When they decide to marry, it is inevitable that she must leave her people and that they must go and make their life among his. Silas House tells their story of love, acceptance, prejudice, secrets and betrayals in an intricate manner, told in the voices of the people themselves. The ultimate search for love and forgiveness is a poignant tale. The decisions of which secrets are revealed and which ones are locked away and the friction that results is deftly revealed. The fear and the loneliness is so striking and intense, the pure love is so vibrant and the story so well imagined that this is a novel that stays in your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Wanting some more Appalachian lore, this book was suggested based on another author/book that I read from a similar genre.

This love story between Irish Saul Sullivan and Cherokee Vine is not to be missed. Wonderfully drawn characters, (my favorite is Serena, the wild midwife who befriends Vine), and lyrical, evocative writing make this a story not to be missed. If you enjoy this as much as I did, read House's The Coal Tattoo next, followed by Clay's Quilt. This will follow the whole family's saga from start to finish. All of these are wonderful stories, but this is the best of the batch, followed closely by Clay's Quilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Bad As The Others","review":"This book doesn't deserve any recognition as a piece of literature.

It's more typical of JAK than most of her early books under the James pen name in that it has her trademark themes...dangerous man, adventurous woman, witty dialogue and narrative.The only aspect of it that might make some readers weary (it did me in parts) is that this book was originally published in 1984, therefore the sex scenes are very reminiscent of the \\"forced seductions\\" common to 80's romances.

That is a too rare occurrence in most book series - including the Plum books which sometimes seem to be the same basic template with the name of the guy she is involved with changed. If you have ever enjoyed any of the books in this series, I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"I don't know why people can't seem to separate Janet Evanovich from the Stephanie Plum series.

I felt little for any of the characters, nor did the narration by Lorelei King do very much for me . . . what I likedbest about FULL BLAST actually had nothing to do with the story . . . at the very end, there was a brief interview of Janet Evanovich about how she goes about her daily writing . . .

It's hard for me to choose which is my favorite book from her, but Years has to be right there at the top (along with Bitter Sweet, Vows, Bygones, Family Blessings, Separate Beds, Forgiving). The movies in my opinion doesn't do her books justice at all. I read her book over and over again and they will never leave my library. I have yet to find a writer that matches her skill in spinning an emotionally-driven romantic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.","review":"I always enjoy this author-some books are slightly better than others and I like the earlier books the best. Years is one of my very favorites. It deals with life - happy, sad in-between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Years","review":"This is a great book the connection between Linnea and Theodore is explosive from start to finish. Linnea is a 18 year old girl who comes to town to be a school teacher and has to stay in the home of Theodore, but he thinks she is a male because he will not allow a woman to live in his house because his wife left him with a 1 year old son to raise by himself and he still has regrets about this. Theodore son is 16 years old and has feelings for his teacher Linnea, but Linnea only has eyes for his 34 year old father. This book is over 500 pages, but the ups and downs of this family will make you laugh, cry and rejoice with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've always loved this book.","review":"I have always loved this book! I graduated high school almost 20 years ago and I can remember having this book confiscated by a teacher in 6th grade. The cover on that issue was a bit racey. I still keep a copy of this book on hand and reread it at least once a year. I've even named my daughter Linnea. I'll be a very happy girl if they ever release a CD audiobook version or Audio download. Very happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This is a great book. I do love LaVerle Spencer as an author. One thing, though, this Kindle book needs to be proofread better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YEARS","review":"I re-read this book after several yrs. Forgot how it grabs the reader's emotions. I found myself crying more than once...favorite comedic situation (Santa's appearance at the holiday school play... \\"thoop?\\"), and the tearful departure of Linnea the following day. I would only, perhaps, not have so many tragic events towards the end of the book. I have read almost all of Spencer's books. This is on my \\"keeper shelf\\" along with others including Hummingbird and Morning Glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love comes at any age","review":"I also read this one many years ago, but i just love the time of innocence in this story.

She was a great writer and her work will live on and be enjoyed by millions for years to come. You will find yourself laughing out loud throughout the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, I've read this several times now.","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I do believe I've read every book LaVyrle Spencer has ever written. I tend to do that once I find a writer that I feel can put together a story line and character dialogue that doesn't make me want to throw a book in a fire. And much to my dismay, I only discovered her books shortly before she retired.This story is one of my top favorites. If you have read her as extensively as I have, I'm sure you noted the development of her skill in fashioning story devices. I personally love that she can say in one ten word sentence what some authors I've tried to read say in a paragraph or more.I have found she's rather insightful in writing male characters rather than writing pat representations of male characters. Although this book is a romance, it's not just a romance between the two main characters...it really is a well told story snapshot of a different time in a young America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spencer","review":"I have read all of Spencer's books and wish she would start writing again. My most favorite is Morning Glory, but I have never been disappointed in any of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond words! a true master piece. Outstanding!","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. Words just can't describe the depth and magnificence of this novel. I have read many historical romances, and I would not classify this novel as such. There is no prince charming and our heroine does not looks like Barbie doll. It a story of real people that like in real life have to face hearth wrenching realities. The love story is so pigeon and touching that I could almost imagine being there with them and going through thier heartaches and pains. If you are looking for an \\"easy\\" Cinderella kind of story read you can skip this one. However if you wish to read a great novel that will leave its mark on you forever this is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't hold my attention","review":"I thought the writing to be as uninteresting as the characters and the plot.

Years is the complete opposite--wonderful story, interesting characters, sparkling dialogue, an absolute joy to read. I can't believe the same author wrote both books! I'm buying this for a Christmas gift for my mother, I loved it so much! My only two complaints about it are that the heroine is almost too pure and loving to be believable, and too many characters were killed off at the end of the book--but that's like saying that you loved the movie but the popcorn was a pinch too salty. READ THIS BOOK!! You will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"This book is not only disgustingly anti-Japanese, but completely ridiculous. The premise of the book is that Americans and Japanese can never understand or relate to one another. The Japanese (of course) start a war. It also portrays the American Navy as idiots who cannot counter an enemy attack. Our submarines accidentally get run over by oil tankers. I could not finish this book. It became totally ridiculous. Joe Weber treats his audience like we are idiots!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adverb Central!","review":"Yes, the plot is interesting. Yes, the characters are (somewhat) believable. But it is very apparent that Mr. Weber has a bonus clause on his contract for the number of adverbs he can use. How many different ways can you depict mannerisms and emotions while speaking? Just ask Mr. Weber. I tried (in vain) to find a portion of dialogue that did not have the characters words embellished with so many trite expressions to the point of total distraction from the storyline. Too bad, it could have been a great book. Also, what's with the ending? Did he come to a point where he had a limit on his page count and had to condense 10 chapters of conclusion into one Epilogue?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Following the traces of Werner Fassbinder!","review":"Stephen Frears paid a felt tribute in Fassbinder' s memory through this picture. This launderette is an authentic micro cosmos that allowed to join two well opposite personalities so different in attitudes and particular ambitions.Somehow S.F. continues exploring the advanced roads initiated by his predecessor; and even Frears lacks of the human touch that became a true landmark in Rainer, he achieves a mature film that focuses and handles the complex ambiguity of this couple in London."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't get it","review":"and won't again. i could see where it was going and geez i wish I had stopped trying to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Beautiful","review":"Did you ever see one of those films taking place in a foreign country that makes you \\"not\\" want to go there. This is one of them. As a gay man, I do not want to meet these people...ever! In American terms, I put the characters of this movie into the greedy sleaze meets trailer trash category.

Gram Green dose avery good job. I watched this movie some years ago and is still my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic attempt at entertainment","review":"I viewed this film as part of my Washington State History Class. I watched the unfortuneate actors deliver their sad diologue, and could almost see the pain on their face, caused no doubt by the act of uttering such drivel. The diologue is awful, the premise is true, of course, but so poorly scripted and acted out that if I hadn't known better I would have thought this a comedy. The Indian garments of the Nez Perce are ridiculous, and amazingly every one of the Indians speaks fluent English. The portrayel of Cheif Joseph is sad, a sullen James Whitmore speaks slowly, in halting English. He tries to act outraged and\\\\or sad, but looks rather pathetic doing it. This film is quite amatuerish and not worthy of more than a passing glance. Obviously done on a shoestring budget,(which would explain the poor actors and script-writers), \\"I will Fight no More Forever\\" is a sad, rather pathetic little picture. I don't advise renting or, God Forbid, buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad story told beautiful well","review":"This is one of the most heartbreaking stories I have watch. To watch the indians get pushed off their lands by greedy white men were horrrible. Chief Joseph didn't won't to fight but his people did. And they lost. The truth is told is how white men pushed around the indians and anybody they had power over. A truly sad beautiful movie of a chief and his people who wanted to be left alone. Finally a true story telling how the indians were robbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing old videos","review":"This is an amazing collection of rock videos from the 60's. It is a lot of fun to see what the groups looked like when they where just starting out. Most of the songs are well known, with a few in there that didn't make the charts. All in all a must have for classical rock and roll fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A viewer","review":"Great DVD, but there are no pop-ups in this DVD. Classic Pictures should have added the pop-up features in it just like it did with \\"Wild Thing\\" and \\"Get It On.\\" Those clips were made in Germany long before digital computers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special","review":"This single showcases a much-improved impersonation of Bruce McAvaney than the 12th Man (Billy Birmingham) has mustered previously, which was during the AFL Tight Shorts Controversy on Wired World of Sports II. Billy can't hold a candle to that bloke who does Bruce and Sam Newman, but Billy is more of an all rounder, and this is a decent work from the 12th Man. Worth buying as a memento of the 2000 Olympics, even if comedy singles aren't as good as the 12th Man's many great albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"LED light","review":"These lights are great for everything.

The makers have something that they want to communicate and and they don't let history get in their way. This is essentially an evangelistic movie that targets westerners for conversion.The acting is very poor and some of the transitions in the movie are a little disjointed.The most annoying thing is that the main character (Mohammed)is never seen. This is reminescent of the rabbit Harvey in the movie \\"Harvey\\" with Jimmy Stewart. Harvey's invisibility added to the comedy, but \\"The Message\\" is not trying to be funny. There are many times when it is not clear who a character is speaking to because he is looking at the camera or at nothing. The only clue when Mohammed is around is if he is carrying something (like a long sword) or a tune that is played.If you are looking for an entertaining movie with invisible people, this is not it. If you are looking for an educational experience, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie but....","review":"I love the movie. I would like to agree with all of the above. But for all nonMuslims please try to read on Islamic history and religion first. The movie is not complete. Of course due to Islamic faith we Muslims cannot draw or make a movie showing Mohammad. The movie ignored people like Omar, Abu Bakr... I am sure we cannot show their faces as well. I would like to appluad Mostafa Akkad for his effort. However, a movie on such an important subject must be viewed critically. The movie could have gone deeper and concentrated on the teachings of Islam not just major battles. I still love the movie... but I would recommend the nonMuslim folks to read some literature on Islam first. Start with the Quran or Introduction to Islam...Thank You. May Allah Bless you All."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Cinema Epic","review":"The Message is a compelling and riveting cinema epic. I have to say that I am certainly moved everytime I watch this movie. It tries to be a factual and informative movie while not trangressing the limits set by Islam such as not seeing the person of Muhammad and some companions. This epic is certainly moving, it captures the essence of Islam and preaches the Oneness of God, and that Muhammad is His Messenger. It chronicles the life of Muhammad S.A.W. from when he received the first Divine Message up till his end. It examines the tribulations and greatness of prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h.) and tries to keep as though the viewer is there among them. Truly a captivating experience. I recommend it highly for Muslims to deepen their knowledge of Islamic history and also especially for non-muslims so that they may know and understand the message of Islam, what not with the bad protrayal of Islam by the media nowadays. This remains my favourite movie of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good documentary enjoyed it","review":"I brought this DVD to learn about Islam; in that regard this was a success. I have a better understanding about how Islam came into being and the importance of the two cities of Mecca and Medina. I did not view the second disk, which is in Arabic. Someone who only speaks Arabic might find the 2nd disk of some benefit. Overall this is a good starting point for studying Islam and I would recommend buying this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The True Meaning Of Islam","review":"An absoloutly outstanding movie!!!! Hollywood and the media have unfortunatly shown the negative side of islam.. if you really want to know the true meaning of this pure and peacful religon then you must watch this. Words can not describe the wonderful feeling that grows inside you for those who have done all they can to insure that the messege of our lord reaches all of us, regardless of our race, religon, sex, beliefs, we are all one. Whether or not you are a muslim, you will enjoy this movie because for those who are muslims, they will be reminded of the beauty and purpose of there beliefs and for those are not they will better understand us and respect us the same way we respect them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction","review":"I believe this movie serves as good introduction to Islamic history of early years. There are some facts which not all Muslims would agree, but that is hair spliting. Generally speaking it well made movie. I recommend watching it strongly for both Muslim and non-Muslims."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Poignant portrayl of the birth of ISLAM","review":"I am a moslem and I saw this movie as a kid. This movie helped me to see the birth of my faith in a clear perspective. This movie is an eye opener for all bigots, moslem and non-moslem alike.It propagates universal values of equality(Hazrat Bilal despite being a black negro slave was chosen by the holy prophet as the first man to recite the moslem call to prayer.). This movie also dispells the sadly popular notion that Islam is a violent and intolerant faith. This is truly a great film and I would recommend it to people of all faiths.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth about Islam","review":"Great movie for life time collection.

I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to know the history of Islam in synoptic form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which message?","review":"I first saw this late night on TV when it was called \\"Mohammed: Messenger of God\\". I was impressed that the start of the film shows that it's been given the seal of approval of authorities in Egypt.I was impressed by the fact that no actor actually plays 'the prophet'. People talk to the camera - as if the camera itself is him.I was drawn to Islam by its simple and direct message. However I was disappointed by the highly selective dealings with his life. His child-bride Aisha is not shown at all.Some of the battles are shown, as he fights to regain entry to Mecca. The subsequent murder of political opposition, and the massacre of hundreds of Banu Qurayza prisoners in cold-blood are excluded from this narrative.If you want a film that completely ignores controversy about the founder of Islam, this is an ideal film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The Best Movie Ever Made","review":"I think this movie will help you understand Islam (the largest practiced religion in the world), great drama and acting. This movie will help you have a better view of the world and people, it will make you more educated and smarter, buy it!."},{"rating":"2","title":"To me, it's a therapy","review":"Watching the Arabic version of this movie is like a therapy for me.

It is also a good movie for those who look to be introduced to Islam."},{"rating":"1","title":"show his face.","review":"The movie tells a good story somewhat about the prophet mohammed. but the decision NOT to show the prophet is silly. HE is a prophet not a devine being that we can't see. It gives the film a wierd aspect as the camera becomes mohammed. OF course we could expect some of the fanatic idiots to riot if they showed him I guess. How intolerant can you be? this movie however does tell the basic story of the prophet. Anthony quinn does carry this movie and is the only reason to sit through it before you realize that it's bullcrap that noone is acting the role of the lead character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to watch","review":"Interesting for those wanting to know more about the historical outgrown of Islam but far from an excellent film. At times the acting is tedious and the dialouge overly heavy. It is difficult to follow the plot due to the odd artistic element of never showing Mohammad's face or allowing him to speak. I had to watch it over several nights and will never suffer through it again. I would not recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the movie and happy to have it","review":"Been waiting for the movie for a long time since it is a hard to find movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most powerful message","review":"The first time I have seen the message was 27 years ago.

I say reverted because my ancestors who came through the middle passage were from Mali and I have no doubt that they were muslim. This movie gave me a better idea of the Prophet Muhammad's life (PBUH) I also see how Africans accepted Islam, it wasn't by force as some folks say, Northern Africans such as senegalese, Morrocans, Malians, Tunisians, Algerians, etc all accepted Islam. Africans were enslaved by Arabs before the Europeans began. The acceptance of Islam happened initially through Ali and his exposure to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)Such a beautiful movie. I watched it twice. I would recommend this movie to all non-muslims who want to know about islam.

A necessary aspect of the mystery for anyone wanting all sides and all input about everything Oak ISland.

However, after several washes (about 3-5) it has already started to pill badly.

It has a tiny little speaker with so-so sound quality. The display is good and the buttons are intuitive and it is smaller than it looks if that is important.

With a sharp mathematician leading the way, the foursome carries out a comprehensive investigation of Harvey and develop creative schemes for retrieving their fortunes, catering to his fears and vanity. The story has some unexpected twists at the end. This was an early novel by the author (copyright 1976) and the writing style is not always the best - conversations sometimes shift from one group of people to another group in mid-page, with no indication of the shift (a little confusing to readers).

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! I've always thought Tom Berringer didn't make it to real stardom because he could not act very well--his emotions in this movie go from occasonally raising his eyebrows to occasionally smiling. But then again, no one else in the movie shows any real feeling either. Maybe these actors would have made it big in melo-drama back in the 1890's. Maybe that was the 1980's style. At any rate, this movie is just going through the motions much lie a tv movie-of-the-week from the era.

Even before we had any idea that our family would experience divorce, I found the book depressing. In one letter, the boy writes that he was talking to his father on the phone, but his father had to hang up because the he was taking his new wife (or was it girlfriend?) and HER son out to eat. The boy and his mother couldn't afford to go out. So sad! The fact that it is perhaps \\"realistic\\" makes it no better.

Another problem he has is that someone keeps on steling food out of his lunchbox. He tries to stop the lunchbox thief. Can he stop them?

Thirty years later, at 6'2, Buddy still believes that he is truly an elf. That is, until his adoptive elf father tells him the truth, that he is actually a human, and that his biological father lives in New York City, but is also on the naughty list. Buddy decides to set off to find his father, and to not only convince him that he is his son, but also to help him make the big leap from the naughty list to the nice list.After seeing the movie ELF, I just had to read the movie novelization. Identical to the movie, this book will offer laughs for children and adults of all ages, as they follow Buddy on his crazy adventures all over New York City.

Beautifully filmed on location in Pittsburgh, this film starts off well, lags a bit about 3/4 of the way through, but then picks up again for a great finale. I love the way Michael Woods, who plays the stalker, gets uglier both physically and emotionally as the film goes on, and I also enjoy the symbolism that the female director throws into the mix. But the reason to watch this film is Diane Lane, whose rage and breakdown and ultimate victory is achingly real. She truly carries this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humble Beginnings for Diane Lane","review":"Diane Lane stars at Katya, a window dresser for a big city department. However, her displays are borderline erotica, and she unintentionally attracts the attention of Jack, a married man who has developed an obsession with Katya as he believes her displays are speaking to him, telling him of her wanton desires for him. Inevitably, Katya tells Jack's wife about him, cracking his madness wide open into homicidal rage.Next to some of the erotic scenery in this video flick, Diane Lane is (as always) the only thing watchable.

The back cover notes that the author is professor of English at Chapman University in California. This short book (78 pages) is a surreal fiction about the title character and his personal library.I agree with the back cover blurb that compares this book to the work of Borges. This book is a literary hall of mirrors that explores the line between fiction and reality. Nakell's writing is very literary minded--he drops references to \\"Hamlet,\\" Frantz Fanon, Gertrude Stein, Herman Melville, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, and much more. He also touches on censorship, the relationship between reading and time, etc.Overall, a compelling work with an appealing experimental flavor.

I usually clean it in the dishwasher, and it turns out great (although I suppose it is possible that the heat of the dishwasher may have caused the one to crack, too, but I think it best to assume it was the boiling water).

Marshall fails to distinguish adequately between British English and American English and often preaches the habits of the former as the only proper way to speak and sing. She insists that we should \\"never\\" -- with \\"no exceptions\\" -- sing r before a consonant. She would have us sing \\"chahm\\" instead of charm and \\"haht\\" instead of heart. She seems unaware that the voicing of post-stress intervocalic t's is standard in America, Canada, Ireland, and Australia.

Tim, an imaginary user, is a member of two groups. One of the groups has a ACL entry of deny-read. The author is under the impression that this is a deny of all flags. It is not. Any administrator that has used NT classed systems understands this deny only appies to the READ bit. The user will still be able to write. Try it in a lab. Since Write was a viable answer listed, it is the correct answer.

I know that the Exam Crams are a \\"CRAM\\", I don't expect the book to explain everything in detail or cover all material and subjects starting with \\"Computing 101\\" but the book was more like an index pointing you to areas where you should study for the exam. There was almost nothing of substance in the book itself!I have been building 2000 Servers for about 4 months, I also used some on-line study guides, and practice tests in addition to the Exam Cram.

I can say worst, because I would normally rank any book from Exam Cram as either Excellent or very close to that. If you are at all interested in passing Exam 70-215 on your first attempt, then I strongly suggest avoiding this book.First of all, it's riddled with errors. Additionally, the coverage of key exam topics is far from in-depth. This made the book into more of an annoying companion rather than a critical exam preparation tool.

However, it did NOT help me with any complex or performance-oriented questions (which made up the majority of the exam). I was grateful to have purchased Transcender materials, as well as the Sybex and Syngress books for this Exam.

Remove the fluffy stuff from the story and you have little to get excited about either. Maybe a good editor could have shaped this up but we'll never know.To be fair, if I'd read the previous book, maybe I'd so love the character that I'd wade through sewage for her.

A variety of spell subjects are covered that include your cat(s) and/or hairs shed from your cat. There's a kitten blessing, feline naming ritual, listing of names (with a witchy slant) for cats and their meanings. The back of the book contains a \\"workbook\\" and journal with subject headings. Ellen Dugan really nailed this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Concatulations Ellen...","review":"You've done it again! This is an adorable book for any cat lover. There's a history of cats, a list of cat gods and goddesses, and several charms and rituals designed around cats. There's even an astrological chart, and an elemental chart for your cat. The combination of knowledge with fun and cute tid-bits makes it a winner. Ellen Dugan's writing style is amazingly addictive, and I plan on owning every book she's ever written or will ever write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped Off","review":"Ordered 2 bottles.Paid for 2 bottles.Received only 1 bottle in the mail.What can be done about this shortage?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Guitar for the money","review":"I bought this guitar well over four years ago and have enjoyed it very much. It's got an excellent sound and tone to it. The guitar is very bright sounding, keeps a bit of twang.Overall the body style is a little to big from what I like to play now (something I hadn't quite figured out as a beginner). The fret board is a little wide and hurts my hand after a while if I haven't played on it for a while (most electrics have a significantly thinner neck than this guitar).It's an excellent guitar, I would recommend it more for novice players, as the large neck/wide frets make it hard to learn chords on for smaller hands. It's a great guitar for someone wanting to upgrade to a nice acoustic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story told with dull writing","review":"Thud, thud, thud went the dialogue; clang, clang, clang went the prose.I liked the story quite a bit. It was rich with possibilities: a mother who won't stop dying as she questions her religion toward the end; a yuppified gay couple (one of whom is her son) that lives in the suburbs; a lesbian-questioning-pregnant women's music performer (the mother's daughter); a little bit of online sex; a sympathetic yet philandering father/husband. Yet it didn't work. The dialogue is so dreary, so heavy, that it reminded me of high school creative writing class. Page 244, in which April finds her way to New York and meets her brother in the airport exemplifies simplistic, sterile storytelling with truly horrendous, flat dialogue. Why can't Leavitt do his somewhat gripping story and genuinely touching plot more good than that? Oy. This novel needs a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"This would be one of my more favorite of Frank Herbert's oneshot novels, though I do wish that he could have expanded a bit more on Hive-life. This book was a fun and thought-provoking read, and a bold foray into various issues. Overall I felt the story was believable, though the story would definitely have benefited from more background on the Hive and just how these Hive-people came to be.I also found myself a bit cheesed-off by the ending. It had a 'The Lady or the Tiger' feeling to it, and ended rather abruptly, though I suppose Mr. Herbert wanted to leave the ending to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Environmental bees","review":"I read this for second time, and the first time I got it at a used book store.

Hellstrom's Hive is a 1950's, cold war sci-fi tale, nothing more, nothing less.

I feel that producing a studio album in mono is very very bad for one it takes way too much from this kind of music its supposed to wrap around you like the sky or space and has a 3D sound not sound dead, flat or 2D. Mono 2D was dead decades ago but certainly holds some quality its not all bad but certainly not his best work.SummerBreeze was so much better even space age 1.0 and 2.0 where better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiesto sells out..............","review":"Rather than featuring trance, which Tiesto has played for several years, he's now dropped that in favor of 'progressive'. Which is basically like techno, monotonous, non-melodic, and dull. But it's the 'in' thing now, so people just rave over it.That's not necessarily a bad thing though, if it were all like that. Since some people like that sort of thing, but he also mixes in a few trance songs, and IMHO, mixing the two simply doesn't work. It didn't work on Tranceport 3, and it doesn't work here.Avoid this like a plague if you like either progressive or trance. It tries to combine both and fails miserably...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maintains Quality Even If It Isn't a Good Album","review":"It says something about this guy that I think this is his worst and my least played of all DJ Tiesto albums but it still rates a 4. Most of the tracks are available on other DJ Tiesto mixes which are cheaper. This album is for those that really know, love and appreciate what Tiesto does in other words don't buy if its your introduction to his work.

I know Mr. Blackwell is a social and fiscal conservative and yet I still think his ideas are \\"progressive\\" in that they are brilliantly aware of what needs to be done in order to allow people of any color to take back control over their lives and create an atmosphere in which they can distinguish themselves in the most positive way possible. It is the welfare state that is obsolete and that has failed to better the lives of those people who are trapped by it.

He neglects to mention how the Ohio Mental Health System will be gutted, immediately upon entering office, to the point of ineffectiveness which will then allow the State the right to shut it down completely. Those who need the services the most will not receive much needed rehabilitation. The type of rehabilitation a corporate trainer or consultant will not be able to provide. A recipe for disaster. I'm sure the man who is the head of the Ohio GOP, the Sec. of State, Gubernatorial candidate, and Supervisor of Ohio Elections (conflict of interest?) felt pressed to get a book out during his campaign because his consultant told him to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"This book is conservative claptrap under the guise of a political roadmap. I'm immediately suspicious of any book that writes about liberals with a capital \\"L\\" as if they are the devil incarnate.Blackwell rails against \\"Liberals\\" who have allowed AIDS to spread through the African American community, while ignoring that his conservative idol, Ronald Reagan, allowed the crisis to go on for years without ever bothering to mention it. However, a balanced view to any issue would be beyond this candidate.His co-author, Corsi, is tied to the Swift Boat guys, and I thought was downplayed after it came to light that he was a rabid anti-Catholic bigot..The truth is that Blackwell is tied to everything that is wrong in Ohio, taking money from Tom Noe and Coingate, his inability to run a fair election in 2004 and 2006, and his repeated snafus with publishing Ohio residents' private data (social security number and more) on the state website."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story of the Judas Goat","review":"Once upon a time, there was a Judas goat. His mission was to lead the other goats and sheep into the slaughterhouse....But I digress.Ken Blackwell's new book is a reminder of the real meaning of compassionate conservatism. It is neither compassionate nor conservative. Rather, it is an attempt to impose a theocratic dictatorship on America. That's Mr. Blackwell.

Sing sing does not have nor aspire to create the ethereal sounds of lush. It is clearly its own style defined by the beautiful voice of Lisa O'Neil. Themes transition from lost love to friendship and joy. The music is excellent and varies according to the theme. While there are perhaps two songs on the disk I do not care for (including one troubling duet), there are four or five new songs that are so strong - \\"everything,\\" \\"I'll be,\\" \\"me and my friend,\\" \\"panda eyes,\\" etc. - that they easily carry the weight. Two of the three songs from the feels like summer single disk are also remixed on this disk (though I have no idea why \\"hit and run\\" was omitted).

My main problem with this book is the unoriginal plot twist upon which the book (and specifically its ending) is based. But since this is a novelization of a movie script, this can't be blamed on Steven Piziks. For the most part, this is a well-written novelization and very cinematic, but the characters never really came to life for me. So, do I rate the story or how the novelization was written? I think to be fair, I need to consider both and that's why I only gave this book 2 stars. A quick read at less than 300 pages and a somewhat engaging story, but taking all aspects into consideration, the book falls short. I also thought the excessive use of the f-word was unnecessary. I'm no prude, but the word's usage got to be tedious after a certain point. I do think I will give Steven Piziks another try before striking him from my list of authors to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"The A-side has a fine selection of tunes that bring back classic moments from Johnny Cash.

But in terms of presenting the essential tracks by Johnny Cash, this record goes only two-thirds of the way.The good news is that listeners have abundant choices - and who know, maybe for a sizable plurallity, this selection might indeed be essential enough.

And while I'm sure this highlight album just touches the surface of his body of work, it brings forward many of the hits and styles that made Cash so much of a favorite for so many, all these years.

To the band's great credit, all of the tracks are strong and 98% of bands out there can't ever achieve that goal. The studio recording is exceedingly well-done too. The signature droning bass can make portable ear-buds distort the bass; so these tunes are best heard on a good soundsystem that can handle the bass.If you like UK bands like Loveless, Stone Roses and Jeses and MC, you really should give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychocandy (and a Lot More)","review":"This San Francisco trio is going to get compared, ad nauseam, to The Jesus & Mary Chain circa Psychocandy. Well, B.R.M.C. is that, and a lot more. The feedback is here, but under a tighter rein, which gives the loaded melodies freer reign, and though there's darkness in the contours, these Bay area boys don't wallow in the mire, they rock themselves out of it. There are echoes of great bands from the past twenty years, but the nifty trick BRMC pulls off is that even though they mix elements of gothic, glam, techno, punk, they never sound slavish to any one sound. They aren't too deathly serious about it all, either, most noticeably at the beginning of \\"As Sure as the Sun\\", when guitarist Peter Hayes punctuates his gothic blues with electric blasts of \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"black jesus and the rebel marychain motorcycle club","review":"Rock and roll is appealing to Little Poomba, but not Big Poomba!

This is not to say that it's a terrible thing to be compared to the Call, especially since the father of the bass player for B.R.M.C. is none other than Michael Been, singer and bassist of the Call. And clearly they do not sound like the Call. To my ear, they sound more like watered-down Jesus and Mary Chain. But the production of this debut record is clearly Been-inspired, if not Been-orchestrated. Many of the lyrics on the album harken back to the religious, Christian images presented on the Call's records. Labored melodies wandering aimlessly through strained, moralizing lyrics. The production is too heavy-handed, with assorted studio tricks. But the album's main weakness is the tunes themselves. They all sound contrived and heartless to me. To sum it up: too much affect, too little effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"the world run amok","review":"I was recommended this album because I like Monk.Sorry, this is not for people who like Monk.Too simplistic and superficial where as Monk is the genius of modern music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre rock group, manufactured album","review":"I've listend to the cd several times, since I realize that some get better with listening.

Frankly, they sound like Jerry Lewis when they sing live - very high pitched, whiny voices compared to the recordings. They don't have bad voices at all; it's just a bit irksome when you expect one thing and go to a show to hear something vocally pretty different.

These quotes tend to ground Mazower's sweeping analysis. Moreover, he puts the Balkans into the context of the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, and he shows why individual studies of each nation in the region sometimes miss a larger context. One fact needs to be corrected: the Patriarchate in Istanbul now presides not only over the 2,000 Greek Orthodox Christians in that city, but also over all the Greek Orthodox Christians in Australia, and North and South America, as well as some non-Greek denominations in those continents. If I'm not mistaken, the Palestinian and Syrian Orthodox churches also come nominally under that Ecumenical guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thorough!","review":"Thia ia probably more than I wanted to know on the subject. He concentrates on the past 3 centuries with only slight attention to the past 50 years. In any case, it is a good description of this toubled area of the world. Apparently the entire history of the Balkans is really a history of religious strife, between Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Catholics and Muslims. One wonders if these tensions and wars have come to an end or if they just lost the stage at this time to other world crises."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great intro to the region","review":"The Balkans is an all around solid book covering such a complex subject. Anywhere there is such a clash of religions is always bound to be a hotbed. And Mazower does a wonderful job in showing this hotbed, but in also dispelling the commonly accepted notion a region that enjoys and lives for violence. In fact he goes one further and shows the culture in the Balkans is, in fact, no more violent, and quite possibly less, than many a Christian culture and region.Without having read much on the Balkans before I feel pretty confident in Mazower's scholarship. His grasp on the subject is very in depth. I wish the book could have been longer and deeper in many areas, but this is most certainly a great introduction to the region.All in all, a great short book on a complex region. I would recommend to anyone looking for an introduction to the region or to brush up on the region.4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion","review":"If you are looking for a chronological history of the Balkans, this isn't it. The book skips back and forth between the centuries in a confusing and disorganized manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balkan Confusion","review":"Mark Mazower has managed to clarify the history of the Balkans somewhat, but his subject is far too difficult. He certainly would not have been able to exhaust the subject in such a short history. Still, most of the world hasn't a clue as to the present day struggles of the Balkan region. Because of war in Bosnia and Kosovo as well as Milosevic and other war criminals in the news, the world's interest has been spiked. The problem is that nobody really seems to be able to get a grip on the problems facing Southeast Europe. For those with an interest but little understanding, this book will certainly help clarify many things. The strength of the book is that it takes the historical confusion of the Balkans and uses it to explain present day problems. We should all learn from the past. Hopefully, the people of the Balkans will learn from their past and lean toward a brighter future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dense and Unstructured for Everyman","review":"Pascked full of facts and theories.

It is distressing that the seller seems not to realize that her name is virtually the ONLY selling point to purchase this docudrama. Extremely topical in its day regarding the fatal shooting of Korean Airlines Flight 007 over Russian airspace, Ms. Lansbury is the chief artistic reason to buy this DVD. Since the airing of this made-for-TV movie, much more information has come to light about what really occurred to that fateful flight. One must look at this as an interesting drama, correct in its day, but as a historical piece in time. Artistically, this is efficient but none too special in every other way. Ms. Lansbury, as usual, raises the whole enterprise into something worthwhile and even compelling. Kudos to Lansbury.[Respectfully, who is Diana Bellamy? Not a house hold name in my home.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's a conspiracy","review":"This movie was made before the Soviets/Russians released the flight data and voice recorders from KAL 007 and it shows. Angela Lansbury's character wants the world to believe that the US had a role in the shootdown, that 007 was on a spy mission, and that the 007 pilot was teasing the Russians. Some conspiracy theorists were taken to court for slander and found guilty. I wanted a visual aid for my class that had read a book about the last flight of 007, but this movie turned into a lesson in conspiracy propaganda. Way too \\"patriotic\\" of a message touting the perfect virtues of democracy and dangers of big government. I didn't know Lansbury was such a right winger. At least if there had been more action sequences illustrating the actual flight there might have been some reason to watch this movie.

As happens so many times, the movie was a disappointment compared to the book. The character names were mostly the same but the movie characters did not do the things the book characters did. There were characters left out of the movie and some added in. The movie changes to the story did nothing to improve the story. This was a movie about a boy named Agba and a horse named Sham but that is about the biggest similarity to the book's very sweet, inspiring story. The production values are very low as well. It seems very cheaply made.

Sham was a full fledged, highly bred Arabian, from stock whose lineage goes back many many generations. The stories of how these finely bred animals were treated in the West initally is what the book's author was trying to get across- not the story of some boy and his horse.

Cooke isn't great on exact accuracy of dates and events, but he captures a certain mentality well. If you want the Virginian-plume-wearing-chivalry Thing, you'd better read this book. And he is entertaining, if turgid -- the character sketches of people like Stuart and Farley the Scout are the best parts, I think. A brief chapter on the siege of Petersburg stands out as well. The book does give a good idea of what scouts and detached cavalry units did, which I found useful.Thickly styled though much of this is to a modern eye (and perhaps a contemporary one, since Stuart himself apparently considered Cooke \\"a crashing bore\\", though he was too tactful to let on), it's still really a classic of the period. It represents a certain facet of Civil War mentality, and people interested in the period should certainly look at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzz","review":"This book is better used as a narcoleptic, as 10 pages in I was snoring like a buzzsaw. The material is presented in the accounts of Mr. Cooke who served in the Civil War as an aide to one of the great generals of the Confederate army. Mr. Cooke's views are understandably distorted by having served and fought for the South. Therefore, this book should not be considered if you are looking for a good first hand historical account of the Civil War. It's literary value is better described by the beauty of its prose - not it's historical context.If you enjoy 19th Century writing this book is for you. If you're looking for personal narrative of the Civil War there are better books available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice for the price","review":"Purchased for my smallish 7yo daughter.

The tone is pretty good, and it has good volume. However, I don't think much of it as a musical instrument, because it is difficult to tune, and it fails to hold its tuning very well. The difficulty with tuning is this: when you start with any string and progress through the other strings, by the time you are done the first string is out of tune significantly. You end up cycling through the six strings repeatedly until the process converges - almost. And then if you want to play it the next day, you go through it all again. I think that the neck is just not stiff enough to resist the tension on the strings properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, get a sub","review":"Great product. Sound quality is superior, only very limited on the low end so make sure you get a sub. This is much better than a 5 channel surround sound bar.

Why? Because Terry Lewis, Jimmy Jam, & Janet Jackson have absolutely nothing in common with The Human League. Except maybe an occassional pop lyric. The Human League's signature sound is synthesizers, drum machines, and guitar samples. This album could have been a solo effort for any of the Human League members. And they could have gotten away with it! It's not a bad album, it's just a musical departure for the League. Tracks I liked are: \\"Love is all that Matters\\", \\"Party\\", and \\"Love on the Run\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"Crash is 44 minutes and 40 seconds long and was released in September 1986.

For some, it was an excellent pairing while others thought it was a disaster. I am in the former camp because I find this an enjoyable 80's album with some great singles, particularly the number one hit, \\"Human\\", and the underrated \\"Love Is All That Matters\\".I also think their follo-up album, \\"Romantic?\\" is another underappreciated gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A soul-searching read","review":"Thomas Brooks captures the true essence of ambition, which is depicted in his heart-felt book \`A Wealth of Family'.

Which is a shame, since there's a lot of good material here, hiding just behind the screen of self-conscious hilarity. The scene that lends the book its title hints at potential the rest of the story never quite lives up to, leaving us to grow tired of the orange motif, the limp terrorism subplot, and various instances where characters are shot or beat up without managing to elicit any sympathy from the reader. When a suposedly focal character dies and you find yourself not particularly caring and in fact being *annoyed* that the other characters are obsessed with her, you know this story is in trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"prop this one on your steering wheel and go","review":"Anyone who has propped a book on the steering wheel for a little reading at 65 mph can appreciate this book. Anyone who hasn't shouldn't write book reviews. Anyone incensed with the \\"crash dummies\\" or concerned with experimentation using animals can appreciate the dark satire of this book. Anyone who had juvenile fantasies about a redhead can appreciate the strange love story within this book. Anyone who has hitchhiked can relate to this book.For me, all of the above. I loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"Let the Dog Drive is a tribute to the hard boiled detective genre and to offbeat American classics like Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. In this strange road novel, the young hero's life is transformed when he hitches a ride with an eccentric older woman whose main pleasure in life involves hurling citrus from moving automobiles. Their adventures together, and his solo exploits after her murder, are truly bizarre. It's hard to give an accurate description of this unique bildungsroman, but, if you enjoy the likes of Joe Lansdale, Don Webb, Neil Barrett Jr. or Gary Raisor, you'll probably get a kick out of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"snoozer","review":"David Bowman has no talent, his books are dull.

This novel is less modern art and more grand master than I have experienced in a good long time. He paints bold, odd, character brushstrokes and then shades in the small flawless details.

This clearly stems from a lack of understanding on Broomfield's part and it is disappointing that he didn't learn a bit more before trying to speak credibly on the subject.So read this book if you must, but know that the science discussed here is incorrect and that many of the statements made about science itself are caricatures and straw-men.Again... let me be clear that I have not read the entire book and cannot speak to the other parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read.","review":"Full of detailed information on the Royal Marines.

However, he misrepresents much of that research to attempt to prove that global warming is not taking plzce. For example, he portrays the research of John Christy and Roy Spencer, who have compiled temperature records based on satellite measurements, as showing that the earth is cooling. Christy himself has repeatedly stated that this is wrong and that Michaels is misrepresenting and misinterpreting his research.

The deleted scenes/outtakes/edits are great for fans of the film. Looks and sounds as excellent as can be expected, certainly much better than the early DVD editions.I don't know how they can improve on this version to make me buy the movie again. Maybe they can CGI the animation so it looks slickly professional and full HD, and not like one guy making crude animations. Or get Graham Chapman to do some commentary...

Apples! Very small rocks!","review":"This was without a doubt the funniest movie I have ever seen. The scene with the witch makes me laugh harder and harder each time. John Cleese make a fantastic performance in this movie, and the dreaded Black Knight seems to be in denial of his plight, which makes you wonder why he's so dreaded. The mention of llamas and sacking people in the opening credits only makes for this to be the most fantastic satire ever created. The only slow part was the castle of hard-up virgins. Otherwise, this would be a great addition to your DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're All Silly Twits","review":"Every Pythonite should own this DVD, I don't care if you don't even own a DVD player; just buy it and watch it at a friend's house. Countless hours of one's life can be wasted on this single purchase alone. Not that it's a bad thing.I dare anyone to find the newly added 24 seconds of film!! It'll take you at least that many times watching it through to find it. This set is loaded with awesome special features and anyone remotely interested in Python will enjoy them to the fullest.Lastly, I read the first review and I have no idea what the glitches are because I've yet to encounter any.

How can you not quote from this film? They cleaned it up a lot except for one small scene, so that was nice. BUT, it's not widescreen. At least not that I noticed. That's why I gave this edition only 4 stars. All the widescreen movies I've watched on my DVD player have the black bands on top and bottom; isn't that what widescreen is, so that the whole film fits on your square-screened TV? My version of this DVD does not have these features -- does that mean it's not really a widescreen edition? Help me out here, or I'm returning this thing pronto!

Nice to see it restored in the original Widescreen format as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ni! Ping! Neeeeee-WOH!!","review":"When I first saw MP&tHG several years ago, I didn't get it; however, after a little more aging and more exposure to all things Python, I can safely say that this is one of the best farces I've seen. All the Pythons do a good job, but John Cleese really outdoes himself; almost every character he plays is very funny (especially the French guard with the smart mouth). The animations are great as well.I would have given MP&tHG 5 stars, but it does have its weaknesses. It's definitely uneven; it's hilarious when it's funny and almost awful when it's bad. The sheer absurdity of everything that goes on in the movie can turn off some viewers, and the gratuitous (if obviously fake) blood could lead to re-visiting of the most recent meal. If you don't \\"get\\" British humor, then I strongly suggest that you avoid MP&tHG; if, however, you like a nice shrubbery and can quickly recover from being turned into a newt, then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Bad Packaging","review":"This is a great movie preformed by the legendary comedy troupe Monty Python. I have nothing to say about the movie, other than everyone should watch it at least once even if you're not a Python fan. This review is to serve as a warning to potential purchasers. I purchased this movie only to find the discs were scratched due to a poor packaging design. This 2 disc set stacks both discs one on top of the other on a single bracket, without a separator. If you are unlucky like me the bracket was rather lose allowing the DVD's to rotate independently of one another, resulting in many tiny scratches rendering the feature DVD unreadable. You can find the exact same features on the Special Edition (Wide Screen Edition) but without the movie cel and script, not to mention saving yourself some 20 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the subtitle glitch!","review":"This is, of course, one of the funniest movies ever made, and the new SE looks very good as well. But the DVD has a major flaw. Subtitles appear intermittently and cannot be removed. Over 100 posters to the Home Theater Forum web site have already reported on this problem which seems mainly to appear with Toshiba and Sony players. There is no apparent fix to the problem, which appears tied to one of the special features on the disc.Columbia (which is owned by Sony!) should face the Spanish Inquisition for doing this to Python fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING MOVIE","review":"I'm very pleased with my blu-ray purchase.

Consequently, I am desperately tired of new editions coming out every twenty minutes, with minimal special features, hoping to wrest more money from people who went through college saying \\"ni\\", singing about spam and saying \\"burma\\" because we panicked. This is the third packaging of this edition of the movie (and I believe fourth DVD release), and the rationale seems to be that there is a tie-in with the highly unnecessary \\"Spamalot\\" stage show.

The screen rips in the middle of a scene.This movie is an absolutely travesty and wholly unfunny. I have not the slightest clue what people find funny about this. Maybe its the opiate of the masses. Maybe its one of those cult movies like the Ed Wood stuff that is so bad its funny, but this doesnt really put itself out that way and its fans seem to really be deluded into thinking its funny.

There are wonderful and unforgettable lines like \\"Bring out your dead\\" and \\"The knights who say nee\\".

That is just the movie itself now with the DVD you have a whole new level added to the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest Film Ever Made","review":"THE HOLY GRAIL is the finest work from the esteemed British comedy troup Monty Python. Their hilarious skewering of the myth of King Arthur and the Round Table is successful on so many levels that it makes one, well, laugh out load and smirk with knowing admiration. From gross physical humor(the Black Knight losing his limbs in combat, but refusing to give in) to pungent socail commentary (most of the movie) the Pythons deliver over and over.I have seen this numerous times (40?) over the years and still can be reduced to painfull fits of laughter by at least several scenes. Do you need any other recommendation?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly-ness and Snorts","review":"Another Monty Python marvel, The Holy Grail has a delightful spontinaity to it (which stems from the fact that the leading actor was drunk for the entire duration of the filming). Like all Python films, it is a wonderfully confusing mixture of slap-dash storylines, the obscene and ridiculous, and a satiric view of Celtic history. This film, however, is unique in its \\"simply silly\\" approach to one of Britain's most loved myths... Killer rabbits, three-headed knights, naked ladies, snobbish Frenchmen, and flying cows abound, so sit back and enjoy the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"No matter how many times I've seen this movie, I continue to enjoy it.

I mean, the image is even off-center somewhat. The additional DVD features are limited to a bunch of uninteresting movie trailers. Not worth the extra money over the VHS version. Actually I spotted some digital image glitches like the ones you see on a low-resolution .jpeg, this is in addition to all the flickering crap you see in regular film movies. If you still want it, save some money and buy the VHS version."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could, I'd give it (on DVD) 6 stars!","review":"This movie is outrageously hilarious. If \\"Excalibur\\" is the definative movie-telling of the Authur Legend, then Monty Python's Holy Grail is the Ultimate Parody.From the \\"horses\\" that lead to a discussion of sparrows, to the three-headed giant, to the French Knights, to the Brave Sir Robin, you will be left laughing til your sides hurt.The DVD version of the movie restores the portions of the screen cut off by the pan-and-scan process. The Python troupe notoriously used the big screen to their fullest advantage. You can now SEE things that could only be heard in the VHS version. And hearing gets better too thanks to Dolby Sound.Granted, this is dry English humor with a bit of gratitous violence... so it may not be for everyone... but:If you are a fan of the Aurthur Legend or just like off-the-wall comedy, this is a must see for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"\\"Where'd you get the cocoanuts?\\", \\"We are the knights who say NI!\\", \\"She turned me into a newt!\\", \\"One day lad, all these will be yours.

The black knight at the bridge, the french in the castle, and of course the swallows and the coconuts. Genius.So for those who want a laugh, get this movie. I enjoyed it thouroughly as a boy, and my 16 year old, as with many, normally interested in computers/computer games and not my \\"old\\" movies\\" laughed and laughed.

The on-location documentary is good, but even better is the \\"Quest For the Holy Grail Locations\\" with Palin & Jones. It's remarkable how much footage was shot in a single castle (it's only a model...). My only disappointment was that the Japanese dub is only two short scenes. It's very funny to see the dialogue reworked, and I wish they'd showed the whole film with the dubbing.

And the blood that comes from the aftermath is so obviously fake, but it comes in very disturbing gushes. It's outrageous to believe this movie was rated PG. But the reason I gave it 2 stars is that there were only a FEW moments that made me chuckle, including the opening credit subtitle gag, the \\"Trojans\\" scene, and the annoying man who sings constantly alongside Robin Hood, but doesn't know he's being a pain in the butt.So, in other words, don't see this movie if very disgusting humor is not your cup of tea.

For Python purists, this truely is the HOLY GRAIL. Carry on the hilarity by seeing John Cleese in 'Faulty Towers' (available in U.S. on video). By his own admission, this was the finest work by Cleese and the reason he made only 2 seasons and no more telly shows.

Not only are there no extras (forgivable), the quality of the transfer is atrocious. Sure, it looks better than my VHS copy, and for that I'm grateful. But there was no attempt made to clean up simply things like dust and fiber from the print. In addition the sound is mastered at a volume that is too low to do much with.

Unlike most comedies, which adhere closely to the conventions of one particular comedic style, Grail is an absurd farce. From the opening scene, in which a castle guard demands to know why King Arthur is using coconuts to simulate a horse, and then belittles his analogy to bird migration, the film constantly seeks to surprise its audience and keep us off-balance. King Arthur is never allowed to become an heroic figure since almost no one respects his authority, and the Knights are variously too bloodthirsty or too cowardly. The world they inhabit, of lustful maidens, killer rabbits and vindictive enchanters, hilariously parodies the Arthurian legend. Followers of the Lord of the Rings films will be amused by its twisted take on mythology.

If you know anything at all about the Arthurian legends, you'll find this film doubly hilarious: the Pythons actually used a lot of motifs straight out of the tales (e.g., the castle of women) and gave them their own special, twisted treatment. They're fearlessly irreverent (the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch had me rolling on the floor), and even if some of the jokes (e.g. the non-horses) get a little old after a while, there's so much wildly original material that you're too busy laughing to care.

It's a classic and deservedly so, joined in general quality by the uproarious \\"Life Of Brian\\"! However, the Pythons couldn't keep it up beyond \\"Life Of Brian', and you'll notice they pretty much broke up after the miserable \\"Meaning Of Life\\", only making cameos in Gilliam's movies afterwards.Enjoy the first TRULY funny effort by the crazy Pythons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for the movie--1 star for the DVD","review":"This is an excellent movie, but the DVD edition is awful.

The movie is made in a British style in that it doesn't have many great effects or great acting, but it is the lack of these things that makes it so funny. This movie has been a favorite of mine for years and it never ceases to make me laugh. Watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Want It, So Get It !!!","review":"Yes, you've seen it a hundred times on TV...but not at home on dvd.

If you do like Monty Python, then you are probably one of the happiest people in your neighborhood. I first saw this movie when I was in third grade, and, altough I didn't get all the jokes, laughed hard at the more obvious ones. How can you go wrong with the killer rabbit, Tim the Enchanter, or the Black Knight who believes he is invinsible, even as a limbless stump standing on the ground? Altogether, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the best movie I've ever seen, and I'd highly recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie,Dissapointing End","review":"I loved this movie the first time I saw it.It was possibly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.The only letdown was the ending ..........what a stupid ending. The special features were all garbage. I recommend getting the VHS copy of this. Still a very good movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A DVD!","review":"This is depressing - I bought this movie for a friend, and when she opened it, there was only one disc inside and it was just the special features, no movie.

I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you wanna laugh until you burst an artery buy this movie!","review":"Even if you're not a huge fan of Monty Python's, like I am, you'll still be laughing so hard you won't be able to catch your breath for the whole 2 hours or so, trust me on this one. From my experience, this is one of THE funniest, laugh-out-loud movies there is not to mention that it's quoted very, VERY often by the people I know. No matter what your tastes in movies are you won't be able to help yourself from falling in love with Michael Palin (my personal favorite of the group), John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones Graham Chapman and Eric Idle. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! I've always liked the groups TV show, Monty Python's Flying Circus, but this is even better than it ever was! This movie has sight gags, inside jokes and some of THE funniest dialogue you'll ever encounter in your life. Kudos to the boys of Monty Python, you've done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monty Python - how can you go wrong?","review":"OK, I did actually go wrong.

I do wish I would have waited for the special edition, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE funniest movie ever!","review":"First of all, I'd like to say that if I were rating the movie itself and not the DVD...It would get 5 stars hands down. Monty Python and the Hold Grail is by far the funniest movie ever. There is no other franchise in history that could pull off having a bloody knight with no limbs, or a French taunter without just being ridiculously un-funny. Monty Python gets the job done perfectly and should be seen by all. Ok, now back to the DVD. There are a bunch of special features, but for the most part they're long, drawn out, and not funny. But that's ok...they're just extras. The problem that I have with the DVD itself is that it doesn't play correctly (or at all) on some DVD players. The encoding is just a little off. But the amount of improvement in the quality of the picture and sound are great, and all in all it's a great DVD thatI'd recommend to just about anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the DVD with the extra extras","review":"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a hilarious movie. However, most people consider the movie to be either a classic or crap. So, although you will probably consider this movie to be a classic, you may not like it at all. However, if you have seen this movie previously or have seen other work by Monty Python, and you are considering whether to buy the DVD or the video, buy the DVD. You not only get to watch the movie, but the extras are the best, funniest,and most plentiful of any DVD I have ever seen. The most notable extras are the theatrical trailer, the Lego \\"Camelot\\" scene, and the educational video on how to use coconuts. Without a doubt, it is worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comedy classic!","review":"MPATHG is a comedy classic, plain and simple!The story, in a nutshell, is that King Arthur and his knights are looking for the Holy Grail. They encounter many things on their quests, and many humorous things happen.This movie is hilarious. From beginning to end, it's filled with random, British-style, humor that will make you howl. The killer bunny rabbit, the Black Knight, the Camelot song, and an ending that will make you go, \\"WTF?!\\" is the best parts about this hilarious film.If you want a good laugh, check this out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaking of swallows...","review":"Hurrah! Hooray! The greatest, funniest film of all time! I must say, to me the movie looked boring and, well...stupid when I first heard about it. But then I watched it, and was instantly converted.If you have never seen any Monty Python productions (which I hadn't, when I first watched this movie) then you're in for a humorous surprise. What other company could come up with such wonderful songs as \\"Bravely Bold Sir Robin\\"? What other company could create a Trojan Jackrabbit and the famous Killer Rabbit? And to those who don't like the ending - it's Monty Python! What else did you expect?Anyway, if you love movies that can laugh at themselves, and films that purposefully appear cheap and low budget for their own amusement, you'll LOVE Monty Python and the Holy Grail!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is the funniest and best movie ever viewed by man","review":"This is the funniest movie ever made. If you don't like it you deserve to get your neck ripped out by a killer bunny or destroyed by a holy hand grenade.

You can imagine my surprise when I opened the case and found what looked like some kind of strange contraceptive device. Don't order this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry to spoil the 'fun.'","review":"I had heard this was the funniest movie of all time. I found it impossible, however, to approve of a film that implies that the weight of the African swallow is not well-known. King Arthur, being an all-round Kingly sort of fellow, would never have been so wantonly ignorant of ornithology, and to imply this was so is a gross insult. I also found it grossly offensive to limbless knights, grenade-throwing monks, and other minorities. I was watching with a three-headed ogre friend, and she literally burst into tears at the stereotyped protrayal of her race. (Three heads, that was a lot of tears to clean up.) Only utter lunatics would find this movie funny. That includes everybody I've ever known, by the way, except for a grumpy Scoutmaster and my dour auntie Prue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad mistake from Amazon","review":"I ordered the new 2 DVD disc special extraordinarly edition and I received this crappy PSP version!

I would have sworn that they would 'no problem, we're sorry' exchange the PSP disc with the Extraordinarily Deluxe that I and so many others ordered. Deeply disappointed to learn that they're only return-and-refunding. I have heard of them honoring much more substantial pricing errors... this didn't even seem like much of one. It was a 'good' price, yes ($13.99 pre-order for the new 2 dvd/1 cd Grail re-package), but it wasn't SUCH a ridiculous goof that it seemed impossible...Anyway. Won't turn me off of Amazon forever, of course, but it does besmirch the near-perfect record they had going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to see the reviewers saw the film . . . not","review":"Nevermind Maltin, who knows why anyone listens to him, but how could anyone say that the three-headed knights (sic) say \\"nee\\"?

What if Shannon in a review said \\"Rosebud\\" referred to Kane's ice skates?Anyway, what's the point of re-issuing the DVD if it (stop saying the word!) doesn't come with outakes, bloopers, interviews, screenplays, commentary tracks, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Funny","review":"I really hated this movie and am sorry I bought it.

I checked this out from my local publick library to view with my two kids (11 & 10) during the holiday season. I got it because it is rated PG. We kept watching and waiting for a funny good story but none. Instead, we got many words not appropriate for kids, such as, oral sex. We adults were shocked to hear those words. Who did the rating of this movie!? Bad for family with kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Grief","review":"Without a doubt, \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" is the WORST movie I have ever seen.

I mean, come on, guys, what's the overall point of the movie? What's the general theme?Anyway, if you've read this entire review, and if you still want to purchase this DVD, that's your own choice to make.

There's tons of \\"in the studio\\" footage, interviews with each member of the band, and a load of behind the scenes sort of stuff. (Not surprisingly, there's not a single mention of Bach at all.) Considering that the album and DVD are both on SR's own label, it's remarkably high-quality. I didn't expect such a pro job. If you ever saw Aerosmith's \\"The Making of Pump,\\" it's kind of like that.Like I said before, if you really like the new CD, pick this up and check it out. If you didn't like the CD, why are you even reading this????"},{"rating":"2","title":"DEATH RUN TO ISTANBUL","review":"I realized this was a low no budget picture and I was amazed it was shot on Hi 8 video even back in 1993.

This is a great piece of work from The Killers and I hope you will all think it's great too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky name, great anime!","review":"There is no way you can walk away from this series WITHOUT liking it...It's got charming characters (from cool Spike to sexy Faye), great animation (by the same man who brought us Kintaro Oe in the lovely antics of Goldenboy), a funny-witty-exciting plotline with tons of twists and turns and excellent music.But even more impressive is just the general set-up of the series. It's hard to explain it, but once you watch it you will understand what I mean.It's a must see for any anime fan, and don't let anyone throw you off. If you are debating between buying this and some other movie... trust your gut and get this.DVD version is even more spectacular!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Anime!","review":"This is a favorite anime of mine that aired on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network until this week.

I say it's money well spent.I can't stop watching Episode 5 in this case, SO BEAUTIFULLY done! and the music in the end puts a tear in the eye.In my reviews I don't give much of the plot or story away cause I don't wanna spoil anything.

The episodes are self standing and as the story progresses, they are combined to form an excellent storyline describing the formation of a group of bounty hunters, consisting of Spike, an extremely cool individualist, Jet, a very likeable and caring guy, Faye, a fit beyond belief female, and Ed, a naive, energetic girl (and their dog, Ed). Hounted by their tragic pasts, they all seek their personal salvation, while the viewer is provided with sporadic references about each one's history. Action, humour, sorrow and hope, all there for you to enjoy, in this anime which should be instantly added to your manga collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true masterpiece...","review":"Cowboy Bebob has been hailed, and rightfully so, one of the best animes ever. However, all of the praises for it have already been sung, but the thoughts present in all the positive reviews it recieves are very helpful when considering this anime. The statements regarding music, combined noirs, and a show like no other truly do this series justice. This first DVD is an especially great compilation, the first 5 episodes being some of my favorites. This series is highly recommended, even if you're not a particular fan of anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"I already have Cowboy Bebop vol. 1. Why on Earth would I want to shell out another 30 bones just for \\"cleaner\\" animation and \\"enhanced\\" sound? I don't know either. The show had a good run, but the constant rereleases, boxsets, and best of sets *coughcheapgimickscoughcough* are starting to kill my interest in the series. This is just Bandai milking an aging franchise that should simply be laid to rest"},{"rating":"2","title":"simply glorious","review":"I've always been a big fan of Cowboy Bebop but until now I hadn't bought any of the dvd sets. Well I am glad I waited. These remixed episodes are amazing. The audio takes full advantage of a 5.1 surround system. That being said, if you don't have 5.1 and you already own a prior release, you probably shouldn't bother as the picture, while much better than the perfect session's release, seems to be the same as the original dvd releases. But if you do have 5.1 or you don't own any of this amazing series, then you need this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great DVD for a Great Series","review":"Cowboy Bebop is one of those anime series that seems to get better and better over time. The premise is fairly simple to explain: In the year 2071, humanity is spread across the galaxy thanks to the advent of Gateways. Our heroes, Spike and Jet are two bounty hunters who are on the neverending quest to make a living. Over these first five episodes Spike and Jet tangle with a drug smuggler who uses his rage inducing product to protect himself and his girlfriend; a thief who has stolen a strange mutt; the curvy thief Faye Valentine; eco-terrorists; and a menace from Spike's hidden past. Excellent music by Yoko Kanno. Fantastic visuals, including some of the best use of CG and cel animation I've seen. I recommend watching it subtitled, but the dub isn't bad. Best episode on the disc is the 5th - Ballad of Fallen Angels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect DVD!","review":"...You get the first five episodes of Cowboy Bebop in English AND Japanese! The extras are the best I've seen on an anime DVD. These extras include a music video for the opening song \\"Tank!\\", trailers for other anime, and character info. Spike (the main character) has the most unique fighting technique I've ever seen. He instantly became my favorite anime character. These 5 episodes are so cool, you'll want to buy the other 5 DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent TV series for all viewers","review":"Cowboy Bebop is a well drawn, and well written anime TV series, by far some of the best anime I have seen in years. The plot writing is solid, and even the dubbing is done quite well (I still prefer the subtitles though).For those of you who don't know anything about the series, it chronicles the adventures and mishaps of a bunch of bounty hunters as they travel to different planets tryin to make a buck. The animation is excellently drawn, a great mix of CG with regular drawing techniques really draw you into the Cowboy Bebop universe. One of my favorite things about this series are the songs. The soundtrack is composed of mainly upbeat jazz style tunes and it totally rocks!Dont be put off by the title, I know I was at first. This series is first rate and is suitable for all viewers. There is some violence, mostly comical, some of it serious. I couldnt really find anything offensive in the series, which sometimes tough to find in an anime series."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite action-adventure Title!","review":"This is a great combination of music, action, great stories and extraordinary characters.

The strap that came with my 5DMKII is perfectly suitable in this regard, albeit lacking some padding. When I sling my camera over my back using the OP/TECH strap, the buckle ends up right over my shoulder. Not good. It's a sturdy strap, but it could use some improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was expecting a softer padding","review":"I returned mine today. I was looking for a much softer neck padding with rounder edges but instead got a stiff one with straight edges. Perhaps the padding will get more flexible with use but I just can't wait for that to happen. I will try to look for something with a softer, \\"foamy-feel\\" neck padding.

The middle part was also very comfortable on the neck. I bought this one for a friend and it seems like the connectors are a little more firm than mine, which is great.

I met a photographer on a recent trip who was using the Op-Tech USA system. She had me hold her camera to judge the weight and then put it around my neck. It didn't feel heavy. My order was placed as soon as my husband and I arrived home. I have been using my camera strap now for nearly a month. I hope I don't ever have to go back to the strap shipped with the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera strap, just a little too short","review":"I like this strap. It's comfortable, and does a great job distributing weight and bounce. The only thing it lacks is a little bit of length. If it were a little longer, it could be easily slung over your shoulder. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative strap","review":"Using it on my Nikon D90 with 18-200 lens. Suits the heavy camera + lens well. The loop fastening system is very easy to use and the detachable clasp that lets you shorten the strap if you are using it like on a tripod is a great idea. The lack of bright lettering makes it low-key and does not attract attention. The length is also just right for me. Only minor drawback I can find is the edges of the foam on the back are not rounded so if I am walking around with the the camera wearing a collarless shirt, the edges rubbing the back of the neck is a little uncomfortable. All in all this is a great strap and did not dissapoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO SAD IT WAS SO BAD","review":"I was very eager to get this dvd and yes, it did take a couple of weeks to receive it.

Linda knew it based upon the feeling that she puts forth in these standards. Riddle's arrangements are impeccable. He arranged beautifully for the string section but used some outstanding soloists in Bob Cooper (tenor), Plas Johnson,(tenor) Warren Luehning (trumpet) and Chancey Welch.(trombone) to embrace Linda's solos. Welch's solos are tastefully played with a smooth, mellow tone. He represents the epitome of an artist playing the trombone. This is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standards updated","review":"By far my favorite version of Someone to Watch Over Me. Everyone else just pales in comparison.

Instead of competing with everyone else, she decided to do an album of old standards with Nelson Riddle. She did three albums like this, and this is by far my favorite. She would have benefitted from not following this up with two others, which are not as cohesive or strong as WHAT'S NEW is. Nevertheless, I think vocally she sounds great on these tracks, and she makes them her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT'S NEW got old in a hurry","review":"I have been a Linda Ronstadt fan for a long time, but I don't like everything she's done. In fact, after GET CLOSER, I went seven years (!) before getting another new album of hers. WHAT'S NEW, while it garnered a great deal of attention when it was released (some very positive, some far less so), has not aged very well. Yes, it's a well-meant attempt to revive the standards of the big-band era in the age of MTV. But she probably lost as many fans as she gained by making this album and the four that followed, and I almost became one of them.

Some of is sounds nice and much of it is dark. Much more is very nasty. I guess that is why he has such a large Goth following that pays attention to his every move. Recently Gira has created a lot of folk music and good tunes. He has embraced narratives and told stories. Much of this album is vocals and acoustic guitar. Not much of the dark vibe can overpower these songs. \\"The Kid Is Already Breaking\\" is a song about Devendra Banhart. There are plenty of songs about children and time passing. Gira uses mostly the Akron/Family as his backing musicians on this record. Of course there are some frequent collaborator like Siobhan Duffy on here too. There are plenty of new sounds on this record. It is a good place to start listening to his music. Michael Gira will always be an American musical genius.

The earth is all but destroyed. The reclamation requires further devastation, in the short term, and that's where the story takes place.It just does't come across as strongly as it should have. The good guys are poor but honest farmers. The bad guys' downfall is their greed for gold. Sarah's transport from one episode to the next is the comic sidekick, just a little too eager for the next dollar. Good stories can be made from such ordinary pieces, but it takes a little more skill than I saw here.The line drawing is competent. In fact, the scenery stole the show in most of the underground panels. There appears to be some ink-wash drawing in the first few pages. Sad to say, the coarse half-tone screen lost all of the subtlety that the artist put in originally.\\"Mother Sarah\\" is readable, even enjoyable, just not memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album Gone Unrecognized","review":"The third album of the brilliant Comsat Angels is a must-have. Recorded in 1982, it sounds like it could have been made last year. This band was not given to the electro-pop trends of that era, instead producing music with a sound all its own that has stood the test of time. Noteworthy on this Comsat album are After The Rain, Now I Know, Don't Look Now and What Else? The re-release also includes several singles not originally on any album, including It's History. As with each of the Renascent CDs, this comes packaged with a slick booklet featuring plenty of photos, an album synopsis and quotes from front man Stephen Fellows. Yes, the calendar says this album is 24 years old, but it was made for the iPod era.

After watching the bottle work I realized that after the water was emptied out of the tube the air that took its place was not going into the bottle to let more water down into the tube. So I had to sit there for half an hour shaking the bottle every 30 seconds to keep the water flowing for my Degus.

I thought it wasn't a problem--I mean--you can just stick it back in. But for some reason that I cannot figure out, it stops giving water after my cavy's first sip. After every drink--I had to shake the bottle in order to get it working again. I've tried putting the tube back in loosely, tightly, and everything in between--nothing helps.

Midianites were descendents of Keturah, Abraham's second wife, who was descended from Ham. In addition, Moses was a black man who had been passing as Pharoah's son. For the author to state that Moses was white, when the Hebrews were black people, a \\"mixed multitude, resembling the color variations of modern day African Americans, is ludicrous and laughable.

Moore certainly has a feel for language but too often defaulted to cliche in her characters. As a result, the points in the plot felt random and badly emotionally justified (by the characters).

Timmy has a few adventures which add interest, but this is not a plot-driven book; rather it is to be read and enjoyed for the journey.

Though this sequel was not as good as the first book, it was still captivating! The plot was extremely exciting, filled with action and mystery. Jason Bourne was on his A-game throughout the novel. Also, bringing back D'Anjou was absolutely brilliant. Ludlum has a way of making you fall in love with specific characters, despite the flaws they may have.

Robert Ludlum is a story teller, not a writer. I finished it out of pride, not desire. It has a nice plot, but the writing is poor, disjointed and a lot of the story is implausible. For instance, Jason Bourne travels all over Hong Kong and into Chi Com with a briefcase full of money and no one catches on? Wouldn't the briefcase be in the way when he was doing all that fighting and stuff? Marie's escape and flight was interesting, and the described chaos of Hong Kong is believable.Do I want to read any other Ludlum books? Not unless I don't have to pay for them and I have nothing else to read. Evidently this book was a best seller for weeks and weeks. Must be an East Coast thing.

Ludlum's writing is of a style I can't stand, I've learned. He uses lots of italics, lots of exclamation points, his characters' inner thoughts are beyond cliche, and attempts at romantic dialogue are laughable. But still, somehow, he grips pulp fiction espionage enough to make one want to finish his books. While I didn't hate this, I couldn't say I liked it. Mostly bad writing saved by some cool ideas and fun action (though neither as good as the first of the trilogy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Ludlum Blockbuster","review":"The Bourne Supremacy is the second in the Bourne Trilogy. Robert Ludlum has captured the scenery of China to a masterpiece of danger, excitement, and thrills during every page of this book.Jason Bourne, a paid assassin is back in China. Or is he? A man who still is not quite sure who he is goes to China and murders begin to happen. Could Jason be the killer? Or is there another Jason Bourne? Or maybe even a different murderer who wants everybody to think Jason is the killer?This is definitely an excellent sequel, and I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane","review":"Maybe the great movie has inspired all of these positive reviews for the book (which has a plot that is nothing like the movie's), but the writing in this book is terrible.

Don't bother. Just like a movie sequel, this book was written for no other reason then to crank out something to please fans and hopefully make a quick buck on the coat tails of an initial success.The Bourne Identity was a fantastic read and held my interest from page one to page last. This book wanders, has a week plot, is hard to follow, is missing pieces of the story which I guess we are supposed to assume but which only make it confusing, and overall lacks the sophistication of the first novel.If you're a Ludlum junkie then you're going to read this book regardless, but if you're like me and first became aware of Jason Bourne after the movies came out and your simple looking for a fun, gripping spy novel, then please take my advice and skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOURNE SUPREMACY -- ECELLENT BOOK","review":"One of the reviewers did not care for this book because it did not pick up where the film \\"Bourne Identity\\" left off. He had not read the book \\"Bourne Identity.\\" \\"Bourne Supremacy\\" does in fact pick up where the BOOK \\"Bourne Identity\\" left off. The film, however, does not much resemble the book. I saw the film twice (I had forgotten that I'd seen it before it was so bad) and thought it was terrible and everything that happens isn't even clearly depicted. I read the book and it is excellent. It doesn't resemble the bad movie at all. The only thing the movie has in common with the book is the title. It's like they bought the right to use the title but only used a few concepts from the book.\\"Bourne Supremacy\\" is an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bourne Identity movie fooled me BAD","review":"I was REALLY impressed by the movie \\"The Bourne Identity\\" and made the mistake of thinking the excellent story line was due to excellent writing by Ludlum. Apparently, this is one of the few examples of a movie that's better than the book. This sequel is WAY too complicated to make any sense at all, and it's easy to tell the original book was the same way - the movie had improved on the book by paring away all the excess story lines (Jason Bourne would have had to have lived about 6 life times to have had all the past history that's documented in this series, and he's not even an old man.) OK, I finished the book; it wasn't so bad that I was going to stop in the middle, but I'd suggest you don't get started on it to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Read","review":"After reading the book you may find yourself back to page one to experience the same action and suspense once more. Ludlum writes with such great detail and tone, that the reader may feel as though they are part of the story. I really enjoyed the amount of action that the author was able to fluently link throughout the book. The plot was so involved that I often found myself attempting to guess what Ludlum had in store next. The character development was great as well as the detailed setting location. I could not put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bourne bore.","review":"Ludlum's writing leaves much to be desired. The Bourne Supremecy has a good plot and opportunities for good action sequences, but Ludlum fails time after time to carry them convincingly. Many things are also implausible: Jason Bourne carries hundreds of thousands of dollars, all in cash, in a briefcase with him all through the story. I would think it would get in the way while fighting all the time. I can't imagine how it remained on the top seller list for week after week. Must be an East Coast thing.

Other reviewers mentioned it does not put out any heat (which was not a concern for us), but we found that it put out a little warmth - perhaps not so much if you are camping in cold weather though.We really enjoyed the ease of use and the \\"campfire\\" ambiance this little fire provided. Smores came out perfectly, and campfire stories were hilarious - Much better experience than sitting around a lantern or a few candles after sunset!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good unit","review":"I purchased this because in Oregon you can't have open campfires during the summer in wild/scenic and other outback areas. The unit worked well. It's pretty small, but still throws a good ring of fire.....enough for 7 folks to sit around after dark in the glow of something other than a lantern. The logs are a bit cheesy, it seems like they will break easily, but they did last through 4 days getting loaded on/off a raft.

The movie did not even touch on foreign competition as well as even mentioning pressures from the US Govt.

And how!","review":"I went into this book (given as a gift) with an open mind, but my impressions quickly turned negative. It incessantly promotes materialism and money as a measure of success using mostly-unfounded claims and blatantly prejudicial statements against all other career paths than the one described and, it seems, anybody who has done Mr. Hedges wrong in the past. It appears to be a small-minded book aimed at easily impressionable people. My favorite passage: \\"How about happiness? They say it's the one thing money *can't* buy.

The author was supposedly the inspiration for writers such as Wilkie Collins, Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, etc. That's like calling a cave painting the inspiration for the Mona Lisa. The story was clumsy, totally unrealistic, and melodramatic even by Victorian potboiler standards. I kept expecting Snidely Whiplash to appear, it was *that* hokey. I can't even attribute the book's silliness to age: it was published in 1880, a time when there were lots of good mystery writers around. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Strange Disappearance","review":"I love mysteries. This book should not be classified as a mystery.

It's interesting to read Robin Knox Johnson's book A World of my Own and compare the two. Knox Johnson is certainly courageous and dogged, but one wonders even though he won, who's the bestt sailor. Wonder whether he should have left the brandy and other tipples at home...Also can't imagine swimming under my boat in the Southern Ocean without a lifeline...Derek Lundy's Godforsaken Sea about the 96 Vendee is also among my favourites. Almost a thriller in its recounting of that race. Another good one about the 2002 Around Alone, which Knox Johnson now runs, is Sea of Dreams by Adam Mayers. It follows the 3 Americans and 2 Canadians in the small boat fleet. A terrific tale especially since Brad Van Liew won in such convincing style and the Canadian Hatfield became the story of the race when he rolled over at the Horn - untethered! and not only survived but went on to finish. Unbelievable.John Aubrey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I've been sailing for four years and have read many books on sailing adventures. This is without doubt the most pointless sailing book I've read. I'm astonished by the glowing reviews on this website. There is almost no explanation of why he decided to continue on and not finish the race. There is little to no context which explains what the race is and who the other racers are (better read up on that before starting this book). Nearing the end of the book I can only believe he wrote it for the money. In the appendix he even describes ways you can support yourself as a full time sailor and one of his hints is to write books and articles. There is little to no philosophizing in this book. No great writing. It's mostly a ships log of wind and waves. A huge waste of time for the reader. Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Courageous, but not exciting.","review":"This is the story of Bernard's (the author) circumnavigation of the world, solo and non-stop.

I read the Logical Route and was bored stiff. I bought this because I'm interested in taking up sailing and was intrigued why he gave up winning the race and sodded off to Tahiti instead. Unfortunately it's more of the same: dreary 'logical' daily accounts of boring sailing log details interspersed with equally dull, repetitive, shallow, wispy musings on nature. There's some soft rant against the 'machine' at the end. No depth. No passion. No excitement. No philosophy. No adventure. No LIFE.If this is what Zen posing, bearded frog cross legged sitting on deck contemplating your navel, waves and stars 16 hours a day does to you I think I'll pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great account of struggle with the sea and soul.","review":"This book must be read in the context of the other two about the first ever single hand round the world race in the early sixties. Though Bernard isn't much of a writer,he is so consistently devoted to the sea--even when it's nasty back--and his struggle to find his place in the world that the account leaves you admiring this man's courage and single vision.Among \\"cruisers\\"--i.e. those devoted to blue water sailing above all else--Bernard is known as the uncontested expert. He is famous for \\"surfing\\" his boat in heaver weather, a feat few sailers want to experience, much less purposefully seak out.

However, the days are coming to an end where pure philosophy has any legitimacy weighing in on such issues as consciousness and the brain. These are becoming issues to be dealt with by science (neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology) and not armchair philosophy. The mysterian approach that Mcginn adopts is defeatist at the outset. He doesn't even really try to make himself aware of all the work being done in neuro and cognitive science. He starts from first principles, like the philosopher's philosopher that he is. All in all this is good for those swayed by intuitive philosophical arguments but for those of you who actually care to know anything about consciousness, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consciousness In A Godless Universe","review":"It only takes very few words to sum up this book.

The resulting conflict and bickering that ensued between them was so awful it became almost unbearable to read.

Unfortunately very few health professionals are aware that smokers very often suffer from hidden or asymptomatic conditions. This book begins to touch on an emerging area of study that holds much promise for the dependant individual. Why 4 stars and not 5?

I know how Jessi feels about the car accident because last May, my bus, Trans 1, was in a bus accident and a car crashed into the side of the bus. It was a shortened day on a Friday (because of prom) and I was really scared. Also, the play was good, and it was really funny when that one kid went and flushed paper towels down the toilet when Mary Anne was baby-sitting. And Jessi's family wouldn't stop fighting! Will they ever make up? Jessi's stressed out! If you want to find out, read \\"Happy Holidays, Jessi!\\" Really. I recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was heart-warming, funny, and sad.

They must have changed writers because instead of the interesting, thoughtful crime solving they are getting into \\"touch-y feel-y\\" drama which is not only annoying but disappointing on many levels. I particularly don't like the writing they've done for the new team member Jo (Sela Ward). She's given to all manner of 1970's style feminism. It's dated and old. The investigative format of the first 6 seasons has also been replaced by Rambo-like action of its lab techs and chief MacT. There's a lot of childish theatrics. I don't understand why they changed the format of the program but it is disappointing to say the least.As always, the acting is good but unfortunately the actors don't have a good script to follow. I watched the first 11 episodes of Season 7 and will not watch the remaining 12 or 13.Needless to say, I will not purchase season 8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"This is an excellent series and I liked the addition of Sela Ward's character, Jo Danville; to the cast of characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever hear of RED SKELTON & DON RICKLES?","review":"I will never purchase this collection 'cause my main man RED SKELTON wasa no-show 'cept for a couple brief clips with Lucy as an afterthought.

It is replete with British cynicism that ironically reinforces the gap between \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" culture that it purports to condemn. The examples he uses to support his claims are frequently taken out of context and ultimately do little to further his arguments. Simply put, this work reflects poor rhetoric and therefore rides the coat-tails of scienece and cultural anthropology to furnish his points (cultural anthropology, by the way, he presents as science; i.e. - as objective truth. God knows a cultural scientist brings no subjectivity into the process. *note my sarcasm*).

But this \\"professor\\" can't do it. He contradicts himself, not just with the denouncement of the arts, but also when he brings in religion. So he doesn't just shoot himself in the foot with ignorance, he castrates himself too!

Tops among them was getting a one-night job as a baggageman on a passenger train that he had NO qualifications for, screwing up then getting chewed a new behind by a veteran conductor. He blames the conductor!He also makes armchair quarterback comments about how bad the Illinois Central-Gulf, Mobile and Ohio merger was. He bases that opinion on what?

I counted five, my favourite (I'm English) being the 'Untied States'. Clearly a spellchecker from the last century was used here.I have been in touch with the chapter's author, Al Rosenbloom, and he very affably explains that the fault lies with the publishers. This makes sense. My grouse is that text books shouldn't contain any typos, least of all those that address the computer-driven future of commerce.

You will rot in hell if you have sex before you are married!\\" Instead, it gives equal reasons of why to have sex and why not to and then describes all the means of birth control.

However, as I read (and wanted to study) the book, I was severely disappointed by the lack of \\"meat.\\" There are opportunities with each of his works for Mr. Hammond to share his \\"nuts and bolts\\" working knowledge of how he accomplished what he accomplished in each painting. Instead, he gives vague text, that if one has read many books on painting instruction, this same text can be found in the \\"Introduction\\" of most painting books.I truly looked forward to receiving this book and wanted to learn more about the workings and techniques for producing light in my painting. The one thing I did learn however, is that in the future I will be wary of books produced by this publisher as \\"instructive.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This pillow has worked well for my family member.","review":"I bought this for my grandmother who was always looking uncomfortable and squirming all around in her wheelchair.

This movie has it all: Rodney crashing into the Christmas tree on his stationary bike, Joe Pesci giving his armpits a quick trim, memorable quotes, great writing, great acting, and a fantastic soundtrack.

AND the book ends in the middle! Buy March to the Sea to find out how it ends! I probably will buy it but not retail!I would suggest, if you haven't already read them, Pournelle's earlier Falkenberg books as being much better examples of the military SciFi genre (however, steer clear of his collaborations with S.

When I got to my weekend of leading music, I could NOT keep the 12 string tuned! I got half-way through the first song in my set and I was already out. Forget the capo. Each time I used the capo it was a disaster. the capo somehow sent the small G string into orbit and threw the entire tuning out.
