The Christian world has given him mixed reviews because many of them are strict \\"six day\\" creationists, which Van Till is not.

The frightening thing about this nut is that she makes other loonies like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson look lucid. Her hatred of everything besides white-bred Christian folk is loathsome. Jesus himself would be alarmed by this tome. Not so alarming is that most of the readers praising this book are hampered by poor grammar and bad spelling .

It's based on no supportable evidence and is completely prejudiced. The author, Rebecca Brown is a fundamentalist who interprets almost everything in the Bible too literally and coupled with her personal prejudices, this mix can be lethal indeed.

If you are looking for an unsensationalist but sober and faithful, knowledgeable book about true deliverance, read Unbound by Neal Lazano.

However, that does not subtract from her conviction in what she believes nor her courage in telling the World about it. I respect her, I think she is legitimate both in her opinion and as a Christian--in her faith. For even according to the scripture, \\"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual* wickedness in high places\\" (Ephesians 6:12).I can say I have learned a lot from these two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This book is awesome and easy to read.

Cult leaders have been known to do this for years.If anything, this book is a good study of just how far one person can take a belief.

I grew up seeing my family adoring Our Lord and quoting many times from the Holy Scriptures. So this author and others are narrow minded and ignorant as a bigot. I am sure some New Age teachings are wrong (the operative word here , being some) and of course be careful of these things. Religions are not perfect..they are man made. If it weren't for the Church we would not have the Scriptures. Who do you think translated the Bible from the Greek to Latin? A Catholic ; Saint Jerome!

The book is an elaborate allegory that depicts the timeline of certain charismatic/pentecostal developments in the U.S., Canada and Great Britain during the latter portion of the 20th Century. It goes into some detail about Benny Hinn's influence of the modern music group U2. It attempts to debunk Dake-Bonoism and instead bolsters the cause. I give my reserved endorsement.The biggest advantage of this book is it's discussion of the contemporary variation on speaking in tongues called clicking. This involves cupping the mouth with your hands while praying in tongues quietly under your breath. The reason it is called clicking is that a slight clicking sound is made with the tongue and soft palate.This book explains it better than I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies and delusions","review":"Rebecca Brown, \\"M.D.\\" (she actually had her medical license taken away for deliberately addicting patients -- including \\"Elaine\\" -- to drugs) is either mentally ill or a liar.

Dr. Brown offers intriguing insights to her beliefs, although the book was intended as a guide, not an explanation of what she believes. What many should find very interesting is that she beleives (nearly) all non-Christian religions, are Satanism in disguise, which is easily seen by the way she refers to religions such as the Hinduism, Ti Chi, and Withcraft as being the same. Also, she makes references to what seems to be a vast underground of Devil Worshippers, although she groups these people with people who are definitely not Devil Worshppers. It's interesting, although tough to imagine what a world would be like if many people actually took her seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its war time","review":"This book is a good tool for deliverance ministry.It was a slow start due to the story telling but it helped to set the stage.

Yet in reading Rebecca Brown's book, I find certain extremes that are not biblical. For example, she advises that Christians who are married to unbelievers sanctify themselves a certain way before having sex with them. Yet the Bible plainly states that \\"marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled\\". There is no Biblical counsel given by Jesus or the apostle Paul forbidding sexual relations with an unbelieving spouse or having to go through a certain purification process. On the contrary, the believing Christian is to love their husband or wife just as they would if they were Christians, including in the area of sex. That's the only way to truly win them to the Lord. Also, why give the devil so much credit for everything? Jesus has power over him. We need to be careful that while exposing Satan's devices, we do not give him more power than he has. Jesus is STILL Lord!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Use for examples of the rhetoric of the literalists","review":"This book passed my way via a weekend at a friend's house, and it both amused and horrified me.

In his own story, MORGAN, he unpleasantly continued his overbearing ways.I found him and his treatment of the heroine to be overly brusque, and I wanted to slap his face off in the first 40 pages. I had a very difficult time finishing this book as he continued to be an oversexed version of a teenage boy, who could say and do anything he pleased without so much as a real peep from the heroine.This man is why the expression \\"chauvanist pig\\" was created, and why romance books today still get a bad rap.Skip this loser and read books 1, 3 and 4 in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS AWFUL!","review":"THIS IS AWFULI have never felt so cheated.

He guides you through detailed source material and presents thoughtful conclusions from the biblical text. When his opinion is voiced, it is clear how the conclusion has been reached, but he leaves the reader to make up their own mind concerning the material.Pawson is a man of strongly held beliefs and isnt afraid to tackle tough subjects - in this case challenging the reader to think about the topic of \\"Perseverance of the Saints\\" - are Christians unconditionally and eternally secure in their election, can they turn their back on salvation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader should make up their own mind?","review":"How about this, Mr. Pawson? How about specifically outlining the differences between justification and sanctification, which are two separate issues when it comes to eternal security?

As one rater indicated, it's not for practitioners but, rather, managers who are new to the process, along with university students.

The concepts are discussed in a very vague and shallow manner, and it appears that Mr. Beitler merely conducted research into other people's theories. Although he claims to have used these concepts with his own clients, and he very well may have, their applicability to today's business world is not at all clear. There are many other books on this topic that are of more use to practitioners.I would be weary of the vague five-star reviews on this page - they all look as if they have been written by the same person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my first choice","review":"I'm sorry to say, mr. Beitler appears to be a really nice guy, but the book is often basic, broad and opinions are not always well fundamented. It is a great source for a lot of researches others did on OC related subjects, however, this book is for a large part no more than a summary of research findings of these others. This book, since it provides a lot of findings, can be helpful for writing a masters thesis. For people who never read about OC before; buying this book can at least give you some helpful insights and a lot of advises for concrete action.

This CD is mainly a meeting of African talking drums, tin pan alley and electronic music and most of it is pretty simplistic and boring stuff. The main work is the title track, which is 22 minutes long. I wonder if the enthusiasm for it is part nostalgia as I don't find it especially rivetting. I wanted to hear it to find out what the fuss was about and am disappointed. As a lover of improvised music I find John Zorn's work much more interesting and enjoyable - if you like experimental music in the manner of Sun Ra(though I accept that Sun Ra is a \\"one off\\") then check out John Zorn's soundtrack work for Japanese films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Or Noise?","review":"Depends on your taste of course. What is music to one may be noise to another. To me this is noise - an atonal, arhythmic sonic mess for the most part. Here and there you get glimpses of melody, but it limps alongside murky, inarticulate accompanient, and goes nowhere in the end. The whole sound is so murky and ill-defined that it's hard to tell who plays what, and what song they are on. This will probably appeal to fans of Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy *was* from another planet!","review":"This album has two halves: the first consists of 5 excellent short pieces involving Sun Ra, horns and percussion. Some of them are almost funky, a foreshadowing of the stuff Miles Davis would be doing within a few years.The second half, and indeed the highlight of the album, is the title suite. Ra goes mad on the his \\"Solar Sound Organ\\", providing a highly dissonant solo that builds into an intense climax. (Think Pink Floyd's \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" without all the catchy bits) Then some manic big-band playing enters, and the last minute of the suite presents a neat surprise.This album is highly recommended to adventurous music listeners. It will appeal primarily to free jazz types, though some space rock fans will like too. Beware that the sound quality is extremely poor: sound is muffled, and during the title suite you can hear footsteps and voices in the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pharoah live - how can you go wrong?","review":"The energy on this album is amazing.

Despite the length and depth of \\"Little Dorrit,\\" I read it in much less time than any other Dickens work thus far. So much is so good here: vivid narrative description, 3-D characters, subtle moral lessons, twisty plot with solid resolutions. When I first got to know Amy, my first thought was that she was too good and pure to live all the way through the novel. Then, as I came to know her better, I vowed that if Dickens did kill her off, I'd read no more of him! Needless to say, I was pleased with the way things turned around, so that Amy ended up back in the prison -- but in such altered circumstances!

But it's a great novel, reaching across the levels of society, and with Dickens's facility of invention reined in by moral seriousness.

The 19th century idiom can be difficult to understand, but don't let that deter you from reading a novel full of deep characterizations, vivid descriptions and sparkling wit.

And Amy's devotion to her undeserving father is frustrating.The good: 1) Dickens' mockery of progress-throttling government bureaucracy; 2) fascinating, fully or partially deranged, good and bad characters.This must be Dickens' most experimental literary effort, one of the most challenging books I've ever read.

The print is very small (I realize it has to be smaller because the book is so long), but the text has about a one inch margin on each side. The other Vintage paperbacks I have have smaller margins and larger text. Also, even though the margin is large, I will still have to crack the spine to be able to read the center portion of the book. I think maybe they should have had a slightly larger page.

Keene has done a masterful job of storytelling by using fiction as a vehicle to express the collective rage we all feel about social injustice, while at the same time using his informed science background and grasp of Eastern philosophies to make some sense of a sometimes senseless world. By tapping into the timeless realm of the collective unconscious, where archetypes of light and shadow engage in the eternal struggle between good and evil, Keene has personified these forces in the fully developed and complex characters of Emaly and Roger, bringing them to life in the readers imagination. The author successfully juggles multiple plot lines, while simutaneously weaving narrative and dialog in a seamless flow of ideas, images,emotions and action that carry the reader aloft on the white wings of redemption and across the black abyss of the Permanox."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Quake of '06","review":"Bay Poetics is a marvel. It's like poet and editor Stephanie Young climbed an immense circus ladder with all eyes upon her, gazed steelily from the platform, and jumped into space assured a trapeze would be there to find her when she reached out. 2 years in the making, and published just in time for the earthquake centenary, this anthology shakes up all lines and schools to offer a unique stratigraphy of San Francisco and environs at the edge of the 21st century. It's a collection no one else could have assembled, but one I think people will be looking back to for years to come. Here in San Francisco it already feels indispensable for anyone seriously involved with poetry. I hope it breaks into the sunlight of wider attention to prove what you've always suspected: that the Bay Area's really just a collective state of mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works As advertised","review":"Straight forward installation, works as advertised.

There was not sufficient space and they were too close together in length. Once I put it together, there was no way to fit it onto my table without possibly breaking it or the table. It stuck at a ridiculouly high angle and would not go any further. I hope I have better luck with the next brand I try because I hate the 5' tall rolling highchair that we got as a present.

The first time we tried it use it we were disappointed that it is only for thin picnic tables. We live near National Forest land, where picnic tables are a good 2 inches thick. So we put it away and made due with our laps while we ate dinner. The 2nd time we tried to use it I followed all the assembly directions and attached it to the picnic table. (At this campsite the table was 1.5 inches thick.) My son started screaming so I went to get him out. It is difficult to remove your child because there isn't much space to use your hands to unbuckle him/her. When I took the chair off the table one of the pins that holds the bottom frame to the rest of the seat broke in two pieces.

It travels well, folds up nicely, and stays secure. I never had a problem with the straps or my children falling out of it. However, the seams came apart after only a year of use. We did use it daily instead of a standing high chair, so I suppose if this seat were only used for travel, it may last longer. I actually ended up going through two of them because I ordered one, used it until the seams came apart, then received one from a relative who wasn't using hers. I've had it for less than a year, have used it less, and the seams are still starting to come apart. I guess it wasn't just my bad luck the first time! I also wasn't thrilled with the lack of support in the back. It wasn't until my daughter was tall enough for her head to reach past the top bar that she seemed to sit comfortably.

Also, the hooks on the bottom weren't even touching the bottom of the table! It was tight, yes, but we were able to wiggle it right off without a problem, not safe at all. And very flimsy - the metal bars that hold the chair together were very loose and the whole construction of the chair would shift from side to side - just scary! I guess you get what you pay for - I have no idea how anyone else had better luck than we did!

It would be great for once in awhile use, but it is so difficult to clean with everyday use.The puffy cover comes off and you could clean that, but the rest of it does not. The cloth arms get so messy, and food gets caught in the crevices. I wipe it out after every meal, and hose it in my sink every couple of days, but it doesn't keep it clean. If you could remove the cloth to clean it would be fabulous. I plan on looking for another seat that is simliar, but easier to wipe down. On positive side, it is easy to hook up, the seatbelt is a 5 point harness so the child stays in securely, and it adjusts to a variety of table widths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good if looking for a chair you take and use anywhere!","review":"I was excited about this purchase because of the cost, look and child restraints.

I think you'll find (like I have found) that most dining tables (whether in restaurants or in other homes) are thicker than this. Also, even if the tabletop is only 2 inches thick, the underside of the table still has to be free and clear for this chair to work. Most tables have another wooden support immediately under the tabletop that also renders this chair unusable. This is only a safe purchase if you have a single, specific table in mind and know this chair will work with it. If you're looking for a universal high chair you can keep in the car and take anywhere--keep looking!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so easy diner chair","review":"I was pretty excited to get this chair because I was tired of tripping over my 12 month old daughter's high chair. It was going to be nice to have her eat right at the table with us. I had some trouble attaching it to our table. With our style of table (hidden leaves) I couldn't attach the chair without having at least one leaf up and in use. Once she sat in the chair, she sank to the back. There is absolutely no back support. It was like having her sit in a plastic bag. I rolled up a towel and put it behind her and she was a bit more comfortable. Needless to say, I returned the chair. It just wasn't worth the hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very compact high chair","review":"This chair is very sturdy and we keep it attached to our table as my son's only high chair. I love how little space it takes up compared with a conventional high chair. However, I bought this chair because by about 9 months my son would climb out of anything. I thought a chair with nothing under his feet might give him less leverage. Even with the shoulder straps as tight as they can go, he can wiggle out of it and stand up in the chair. If you are looking to downsize your baby accessories and you don't have a climber - this is the chair for you, but if you have an escape artist - this chair is no better than typical high chairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A for function","review":"This chair is quite nice.We had the more expensive Chicco chair, but this is just as good for its purpose.This fits our table top because of its adjustable handles and doesn't make our kitchen/dining area look like a childcare.If you are on a budget.

The Regalo portable hook-on chair has been our answer to this problem! We can now take our daughter to restaurants and know that she will be safe and secure (not to mention clean) in her own chair. Some of the other reviews have stated that they have found that the chair does not hook on to all tables. We have not personally had this problem -- we've been able to use this chair everywhere we've been. The only places I could see where you might have a problem would be restaurants with long table clothes.

I have a 1 year old and nanny two other babies during the day so I was desperate for something to make mealtimes a little easier. I opened the box and put the chair together only to realize that the arm pieces of my chair didn't match the pictures in the direction booklet. the lower arm that is supposed to sit under the table is welded so that it pokes up higher than the upper arm - it's impossible to use as the arm position propels the chair at a freakish angle and won't latch onto any surface. (I tried to attach some pictures to show this but it won't let me). After messing with it for an hour trying to find any way to make it work, i took it apart and packaged it back up. I'll be sending it back this afternoon. Such a disappointment. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Seat too complicated","review":"This baby seat was very disappointing. I was not expecting it to be so complicated and time consuming to attach to the table. I bought it to take out to eat. It would be very difficult to handle if you were holding a baby and a diaper bag. It can only be attached to a table that doesn't have a wood piece attached to the table top. It has be be screwed on to the table also. I gave it two stars only because the material was sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"I think the chair would serve it's purpose for a little while but the way the arms go together and fold for storage/travel seemed way too cheap for me. The paint on the metal was scratching off when I twisted the arms to fold it. I only tried it on a counter so I can't say how it works on a table with a skirt but I returned it and spent more money for a better made chair by Phil & Ted called MeToo. The Phil & Ted chair folds flatter than this one and is lighter but doesn't come with a travel bag where this one does. I can live without the bag for a chair that seems safer to me. And the MeToo chair does go on my table with a skirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"seat is too low!","review":"This chair didn't get the child high enough above the table.

It is portable but it DOES NOT FOLD up. You have to dismantle the arms. I would not have bought this chair if I knew that beforehand. Otherwise, it is good alternative to a high chair. I forced the arms to close and stripped the metal. It broke but Regalo sent me a new one with great customer service. It is very sturdy once on our counter and easy to get her in and out.

The second time we used this when the adjustable arm that puts holds the seat down had the fastener just completely pop off.

If budget is a major constraint for you, then yes, it does work. But, it became well used looking and ragged far too soon. It doesn't fold up small enough to reasonably be carted to restaurants and kept in the car. It is small enough to haul to a friend's or relative's once in a while, though. It is too big to for airlining, as it would take up precious luggage space.I prefer the Chicco travel seats, or even better, the Phil and Ted's travel seat.Unlike other reviewers, I have to say, it DOES fit on skirted tables. My table has about a 4\\" skirt and it works. However, getting it on is a puzzle. It's not a hard one, but the first time it took my a minute or two to figure out how to wiggle it just right to get it on.This is decent enough to be passed along as a freebie, but even with careful, limited use, it's not nice enough now to resell. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work on most tables","review":"This won't work on most tables that have a skirt or that expand as the skirt and the slide rails for expansion get in the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chair But...","review":"The chair is secure and safe, but had to return because the child sat VERY low in the seat (almost to chin level).

My baby doesn't fit comfortably in restaurant high chairs, so I was looking for something more comfortable and safer. The fabric is nice and the chair is well padded. The straps are great and secure. BUT I couldn't get it onto the tables. I tried 5 different tables. If the chair went on, it was difficult to manuever. Most tables just didn't work because the table skirt was too big or because the surface under the table wouldn't accommodate the chair. I returned it because it was too frustrating to drag it out and have it not fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"This chair is amazing!!!","review":"We received this chair yesterday and have used it on 2 different table types already. We have a dining room table with a 3 inch apron and it works well. The leg openings are more than ample for our 2 year old grandson (who is large for hie age. We also used it at a local restaurant last night. If you install this chair properly if will NOT be able to come off of the table with a child in it. Some have commented that it is flimsy. There is some movement in the arms when attached, this allows it to be folded and put into the bag for travel. If, as some have reported, your child falls out do not blame the product. It has a 5 point harness system and there is no way that a child could fall out of this if they are properly strapped in. We run a small in home child care and we plan on purchasing several more of these so we can do away with the bulking, space consuming highchairs.

The fabric is very cheap feeling and it felt like it wouldn't hold up well to lots of use. The Chicco traveler chair is more expensive but a lot nicer in terms of ease of fitting ot the table and the fabric. There is also more padding for the LO. If you are only going ot use the chair once in a while this one is probably fine, but if you are looking to replace a traditional high chair for full-time use, I'd say splurge and get another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this high chair","review":"This high chair came bent so it would not attach to the table. The top bars need to be parallel to the bottom ones for it to attach, and a flaw in manufacturing made the top bar at a 45 degree inward angle.

I contacted to vendor to tell them about the problem, but they never responded to me to help me in returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe! Dangerous! Beware!","review":"This past Sunday, our daughter (6months) fell out of the chair. The seat gave out and swung backwards so that she fell fowards, first hitting her chin on the table, then completely forward/down. Because she was strapped in, her legs were still in the harness and she was hanging upside down from the chair. She then continued to fall to the ground face first.The harness was propperly attached to the table and never moved. But the fabric that makes up the seat wraps around the harness via velcro, and the velcro became undone. I would really caution parents using this chair, we were scared to death when it happened. If you already own this chair, I would at least recommend re-inforcing the velcro on either side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"I also saw the great reviews and thought for the price this would work great. It's terrible!!! My 11 month old daughter, that only weighs 18 lbs. fell right through the seat within a couple of minutes. The sides are just attached by velcro....yep velcro. Luckily, we didn't trust this product and stayed right close just in case. Ya, we gave it the benefit that it was built better than it looked but it's not. It was also extremely hard to hook to my countertop (with no lip) and it didn't sit flush on top which means little fingers could get pinched.

It was welded improperly so that there is no way it will fit on any table. It doesn't matter how thick or thin or skirt or no skirt. I owned this exact model chair from 2003-2007. It was better quality fabric and the metal was welded together properly. It did eventually break, but after 4 years of hard use.

Having a similar Chicco chair we expected this one to have the same level of compatibility as we have never had a problem with hooking up our other chair to any table. As it turns out this chair does not work at all with table tops that are either too thick, or have a lip near the edge. This is a huge issue, and although the chair looks reasonably well built it doesn't matter if you can't actually use it. Needless to say we will be exchanging this for a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't support my grandchild","review":"I was very excited about having a portable high chair for my grandchildren. I had a different brand for my own children and loved it.

Two months into the use of the chair we all sat down to dinner and half way through our meal my grandson was laying on the floor under the table screaming. The stitching had let loose on the cross strap and he was dumped on the floor. He scraped his face on the way down and I was horrified.

They are able to sit independently and are average size 10-month-olds. They don't mind sitting in their regular high-chair at home, but the second we get these things out at a restaurant they start screaming. I'm so disappointed - I really wanted to use these to keep my babies out of filthy restaurant high-chairs and to have baby seats for visiting friends/family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regalo Easy Diner Hook on high chair","review":"It does not work on any table. The top and bottom pieces that attach to the table look like they are backwards. Cannot get a baby in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work tables we tried.","review":"I bought the Regalo high chair to use when we took my 9 month old to visit his great-grandma. Needed something compact and portable since she lives 20 hours from us. It has a draw-string bag to carry the chair in and lays flat; it packed very well in the vehicle. We first tried it on the bar counter but the clearing underneath the counter was too short for the arm underneath to mount. So we tried it on the dining table, didn't work at all because the table has a decorative wood border that hangs down below the table top - there wasn't enough space between the chair's bar that sits on top of the table and the bar that goes beneath the table - if the table was completely flat without that part hanging down, then I'm sure it would have fit and worked very well. I was extremely disappointed that this chair did not work for our use. It looks like a well made, sturdy chair. Need less to say, I returned it, was a waste of money for my use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad it Doesn't Fit","review":"Nice product except for the fact that it doesn't fit on our table.

When i told my husband I was going to purchase it, he didn't really see the need. Now it's a permanant fixture in our trunk and we don't dine out without it! Our son loves it, and we can finish an entire meal in a restaurant with him in that chair. So now, I give it to all of my friends as their shower gift. They may not &quot;get it&quot; at first, but they will love me for it later!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So convenient when dining out","review":"We just got this chair and tried it last night at a restaurant. It was so easy to use and my 7 month old loved it. She is just now learning how to sit up on her own, so the shoulder straps were wonderful. Also, it is nice not having to use the public highchairs because you never know how clean they are. The only thing negative I have to say is that the listing for this item says it's a web only purchase. I paid extra for the shipping, but went to Target today and they have it on the shelf. But as for the product, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit on many tables","review":"I bought 1 for 3 different people and it only fits on 1 table! It's hard to get on and off also. If your table has any sort of lip on the edge, it likely won't fit. It also won't fit tables more than 2\\" thick. It is more flimsy than I expected also. I have a hard seated one that is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring the baby to the table","review":"We bought this for our grandsons.

It folds up flat, so it is easy to transport and comes with it's own bag. I use this seat almost every day. I haven't yet tried it on a table with a wide skirting, but looking at it, I think it would fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seat cover falls apart","review":"This is a good idea, poorly executed. I had a similar seat for my kids, so was happy to get this for the grandkids. However, this one is larger to travel with than my original seat, it doesn't adjust to fit on my own kitchen island due to the thickness of the counter top edge, the seat cover is padded, flimsy nylon, which is impossible to keep clean, and the seams raveled out almost immediately, leaving large holes. It did fit on my son's granite counter, and they have used it, but an internet search yielded no results for a replacement seat cover. The company never responded to my request for availability of replacement seat covers, so we will soon be throwing it away. My advice would be to look for a seat that has a more durable cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better options available","review":"As a mother of two with limited space in my kitchen the hook on booster seat is the perfect option. However, this Regalo seat is not compatiple with my table, countertop or those of my mother or 2 sister inlaws. After trying this in 4 homes we decided it wasn't worth the hassle. The problem came where there wasn't enough clearance on our table for the chair to fit securely, or the lip on our breakfast bar was too thick for the safety levers (?) to even screw on. Also, there is a 5 point harness which in my opinion is overkill. We ended up purchasing the GRACO and loving it. simple 3 point harness, fits ANY table we put it on, can take it out to dinner and it is appropriate at all restaurants we have tried. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's not right!","review":"My friend has this chair and we use it alot when we visit her for my son.

The whole series is amazing, this book especially.It centers around a girl named Suzuki, who chooses to go to an all-girls school solely for the reputation of the tennis coach there. He is known as the best of the best, and she felt lucky she could be trained by him. But when the coach starts saying inappropriate things to the team, touching them in places he shouldn't, etc. Suzuki gets more than angry. She can't sleep, eat, or concentrate. And when she finally tells the school, they don't believe her. The odds are really against her in her fight against sexual harrasment.I recommend this book to just about everyone over the age of 16, it's a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT his screenplays","review":"This is a book of photographs, which I wish it said on the cover or the description.

I have all the stuff that Verve has released, and I find myself listening to this disc more than any other of Anita's releases on that label.

The text is pretty terse and there are a surprising number of a screenshots for a book so small. The book starts with an introduction to testing. It then gives a high level architectural overview of JUnit, along with it's API. There is a short digression into the history of the framework. Then it's into putting a front-end on the tests both on the command line and embedded into IDEs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly planned book","review":"For a pocket guide, this is poorly planned book.

This is not my complaint about the book however, as obviously when the book was published, 3.8 was the latest version.The book is just poorly organized. It lacks a logical flow. It is just snippets of information. You could argue that a pocket guide can't be expected to give a completely in depth coverage of a topic. However the author finds room to talk about the history of how he and his buddies conceived the idea for the framework on a flight. There is plenty of usage of \\"I\\" and \\"Me\\" in the book as he brags about his achievements and his testing philosophy. Most of the examples are only a few lines of code, as opposed to a complete java class. You have to figure out yourself which classes have to be imported etc. Ok, so that forces you to think for yourself.

On many occasion I had to empty some extra water from the unit into a bucket, then wait 10 minute for the unit to work.-The manual is very vague, and probably on purpose due to poor quality and design.If I did not throw away the box I would have returned it.

It does a great job of regulating itself; I came back after vacation and it powered through one filling in under a day to bring the humidity back up and then settled into its usual pace of two days per filling.

There are three separate sets of instructions and it's not clear at first that you have bought one product and not three.

The lush scenery and beutiful, and the sleek, curvy figures make it a great read. The main character makes a brief appearance in the aforementioned Elementals. Again, very adult content. Not a normal comic book. A tad violent in places. Willingham is currently working on Coventry, which is of a similar quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smilin' Billy, Bias on Woodwinds; a very beautiful thing","review":"A very melodic and bouncing album. Gary Bias plays overdubs on woodwinds and shines on the classic 'John Coltrane'. Sweet music by one of the greatest drummers ever.

The production design was uninspired and the costumes/makeup were insipid (could have borrowed from \\"The Fifth Element\\" Anyone? Anyone?). What was the shakey-cam for? Finally, 2 hours-plus seems a long time to spend on such a weak story. \\"Running Man\\" and \\"Logan'S Run\\" bear some similarities but give the viewer more story and more entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand New Condition?","review":"Noticed DVD package was shrink wrapped but did not contain sealed sticker on case.

The storyline is interesting but left me wanting for more. Now for the movie. I've read lots of reviews that say the movie was close to the book. Wow, not sure what book they are comparing it too as the movie did not follow many of the stories described in the book. The movie does not develop the \\"relationship\\" with Gale. The death of Rue, followed by the district 12 three finger salute (which would never have been aired by the Capitol) and the revolt/uprising in the movie do not follow the book. The movie makes it look like District 11 revolts, but it's actually District 8 that revolts. There are too many inconsistencies for an ok book that makes the movie not enjoyable. I would recommend not reading the book as this might not bias you opinion of the movie. Glad I watched this as a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MOVIE","review":"Although the acting was pretty good by not all, but most of the actors, the movie itself is heinous, and a true teenagers blood bath.

How much different is it than the WWWF????????I think Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone), Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson are, ALL, really good actors (among my favorites, actually) and they all were good in this movie. That's the best I can say. The story line and script are so poor, Good is all that can be expected. The special effects are not special--they are poor, also. This was highly recommended to me.

It is, however, a decent adaptation of the book and was enjoyable to watch. I really think Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent actress and have thought so since seeing \\"Winter's Bone\\", so I was glad she was cast. Woody Harrelson is my hero:) Some of the other casting choices, well....not so good. This isn't like the HP series where every single character was perfectly cast. I still love the movie though, and I've seen it twice already since I've purchased it (five times total!) I love the reaping scene so much! I can't help but shout out \\"Primrose Everdeen\\" in Effie's voice when that part comes -- every time I see it.

A potentially great movie is buried in this watered-down adaptation of Suzanne Collins' futuristic bestseller. Despite a memorable cast and imaginative production design, the filmmakers lack the hard edge and tight pacing to deliver the goods. Director Gary Ross' reliance on shaky camera work (combined with his choppy editing technique) evades the novel's harsh violence and dramatic tension for a safe PG-13 rating. Rather than going for the sociological jugular, \\"The Hunger Games\\" pulls its punches. Hopefully, the 2013 sequel will benefit from stronger direction and less filmmaking by committee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to read the book to fully understand the disappointment of the movi","review":"I read the series and if I hadn't this movie would be a lot more confusing. There is no real explanation and character information. The books were much better and easier to understand what was going on. I wish we could have enjoyed more of the grandness of the game preparation. The transitions didn't work well and were too quick, but the movie seemed long because they dragged out scenes that made no sense to those who didn't read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"Good read.

It includes adapting the screenplay from the book, casting the kids (and adults), shooting the film, post-production, and music and sound effects.

For those that love this movie, this is a great Blu Ray to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent film, good action and acting. Strange plot.","review":"This film had good action and a main character that was fun to root and cheer for. This film had no cursing or sexual inuendo, which I thought was great and surprising. The plot was strange and a tad unbelievable, which was a distraction from otherwise very entertaining action and dialogue. I thought this film, which had taken a lot of steam from John Carter at the box office would be grander, and deeply engaging. It really wasn't. John Carter had better twists and overall theme, thanks to Edgar Rice Burroughs.

Once I focused on the science fiction aspect, I relaxed and got into the story. Many of the characters seemed over-exaggerated, but that is how the story needs to be told. The horror of it all permeates through the callousness of the characters in charge in the city.The movie is well acted, has beautiful cinematography, and a good soundtrack. I am anxious to see the rest of the trilogy. It was not quite a 5 star movie for me, but still well worth watching and owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"The thing was amazing for the amount it was it worked like it was new!!

There was a lack of action, the sound editing was horrible, and they skimmed over some very important character development. Watch it if you must but it's not worth ruining your reading experience.

Not alot of developement of the interrelationships between the characters. When I gave the movie another go, I found it to be alot better than the first viewing, and if you're a fan of the books, you'll probably want to have this in your collection.

As frequently happens (Lord of the Rings being the exception), the movie doesn't do justice to the book. Highly recommend reading the book before seeing the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Sure the movie is not exactly like the book, which I loved, but there are elements to the movie that imagine things that could have happened but we didn't get to learn about in the book because it was from one point of view. This is what I like most about books that become movies. I have found that I really enjoy seeing the things that weren't in the books and look for those things in the movies. It is also cool to see how others interpret the characters and scenes. Sure, I still have my own visions of how it all played out and how the characters looked, but I still love the movie and the movie maker's take on the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie but has a bit of tokenism","review":"I liked watching this movie, there were some interesting underlying statements. The ending,however, was predictable. There was insufficient background on the \\"parachutes\\" and how and who got them (should have expanded on that aspect), you will have to see it to understand this comment.There was some tokinism I did not appreciate, but all in all I liked it. Not worth seeing twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"The movie was close to the book and did not take away form what I know of the story.

The actors and characters of the movie were well played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"The future is the past in this Movie, only the Arena has been replaced by open space, and the gladiators are much younger. Amazingly the suggestion of a Socialist regime running work communities under militaristic control is something many are fearing today as an ultimate result of elitist power grabs. This theatrical presentation provides the viewer with the ever present specter of Hope as shown in the reaction of mine workers, to the triumphant raising of a victorious hand signal. if the series of books of which there are three continues in Movie production, they will be received by appreciative audiences as was this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Appetizing...","review":"Joyless, predictable, and silly! A rehash of what's come before in different forms from comic books, movies, television, and even video games etc. THE HUNGER GAMES is depressing and not fun to watch. This reviewer just didn't care for any of the characters either. Just put on the superior THE RUNNING MAN with Arnold Schwarzenegger and enjoy the ride. At least there's humor without a bunch of whiney brat-packers running around, and it doesn't take itself too seriously!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I thought it was disturbing that people could find entertainment in something like this. The story was sad. In a world where we have violent school shootings and we find those things so terrible it is amazing to me that people could sit down and find enjoyment from children in the same age range brutally killing each other. I also had a hard time with the enjoyment the people had while they watched the killings and how worked up they got over it. Maybe I missed the point of the whole movie? Maybe I was just distracted by the brutality and far fetched costumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"Does everything have to be a fairytale of love that's over-rated.

I would definitely reccommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard Japanese Ripoff","review":"Hunger Games. I liked it the first time around when it was called Battle Royale. It amazes me how people think this film is such a unique and cool movie when all the producers did is take a Japanese classic film and clean up the blood so they could release it to a mainstream audience. It is really annoying that nowhere in the film do they give credit for Battle Royale and for stealing the concept entirely. Sure they added some nice wrapper material and even got Walter White to help out but if you want to do yourself a big favor, buy the original Japanese film and you will enjoy it a lot more, I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"uhhhhhh..............","review":"Very bad, a pathetic movie at best.

Everyone's a bloodthirsty sociopath in the near future except the Everdeens & Peeta, apparently. The anti-violence message is delivered with leaden earnestness while showing us gobs of good old ultra-violence, as is so common these days. But mostly the 'you are there' shaking camera style ruined it for me. Did Cloverdale make money? Ugh! Who finds this entertaining? Who doesn't get dizzy trying to watch a lurching image for longer than a few seconds? It's one thing on America's Funniest Videos, quite another when you've paid dearly to be entertained and get nauseated for your trouble. I'll skip the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was better","review":"It was ok, i know most people raved about her, but idk I wanted more from it. The book was better. Maybe it's Hyatt the kind of story better told in words than pictures. I felt they lacked in portraying done of the more emotional moments.

I am not usually put off by science fiction, fantasy and/or violence, but the absurdity and evil of randomly selected teens to fight to the death every year for 75 years in some futuristic totalitarian society's version of the Roman coliseum was too over the top for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it","review":"I am not a huge fan as many people were surprised I hadn't seen it yet.

My kids thought it was good enough to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hunger games.","review":"I loved the book and the story it told of a futuristic society. I thought the characters were well developed and portrayed and that the dogmatic nature of apocoliptic societies was well construed. The movies seemed flat and poorly constucted. It seems hard to be a good actress when the script has been diluted and hollywooded."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disturbing. and an excrutiatingly painful ending","review":"I wish I had never watched this. It is made pretty well. But this movie's representation of populous control, propaganda and general despotism is far far far too close to the current day reality to enjoy. I guess I am not surprised that none of the other reviewers that I read seem to appreciate this, however, like this movie, I find it extremely disturbing... in the same way I am extremely disturbed that the majority are so easily manipulated into thinking that our government consists of a \\"two party system\\" and that we only have two choices to choose from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This movie was kinda rush but you have to expect that with any movie and it wasn't really was that voilent which i was expecting.

Where was Richard Dawson?","review":"This storey is mediocre at best and completely derivative. It doesn't make sense, is poorly written with no continuity. Katnip bungled her way around and Peeta (Peter?) is a wimp. The whole relationship issue is contrived and not at all believeable.It is childrens entertainment.Post apocalyptic style was done much better in Mad Max. The futuristic glam was laughable.It wasn't a waste of money but it is NOT Oscar material. Far from it. In fact it really sucked the big one, and I'm a lifelong Sci Fi reader.This movie is basically Hollywood spin trying to capture the MONEY that was so rightfully earned by the Harry Potter franchise. Hollywood thinks that they can tell some sappy storey and make bucks from it. This movie sucks on so many levels......................If this movie makes any kind of Oscar buzz then the Academy is B******T!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature","review":"Lousy acting wasn't has dark as had hopped. just like all the other popular teen crap think Twilight and all that other boring stuff"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Stops Working by Scene 13","review":"I shop on Amazon all of the time, but I never write reviews. It just seems as though the quality of the products I have bought recently (DVD's and CD's) have not been good. My daughter opened The Hunger Games DVD that I purchased for her on Christmas day, and we decided to watch the movie about two days ago. We were able to watch the movie up until the part where Cinna was preparing Katniss to enter the games, and the DVD just began to skip. My daughter took the DVD out to see if there was any dust in the DVD player, but there was not. Thereafter, she wiped off the DVD and tried to play it again, but it continued to skip at scene 13. Afterwards, we tried to play the DVD on the three other DVD players in our house, but the DVD would not play passed scene 13.

I was a little reluctant to see the movie in theaters because of the subject matter. I am a mom, after all. I did eventually go see the movie with my teenager and I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie did have its tense moments but there was nothing gratuitous about it. I felt that everything depicted was very appropriate for the PG-13 rating that the movie received. That said, when the movie came out on blu ray, I was happy to purchase it.

I have read the books, and personally think this movie is for those who have.

It provided provocative insight concerning the transparency of governments, the telling of history by the winning side and the impact of those choices on the populace. I appreciated that the story was told without excessive language or immodesty - it allowed me to focus on the governmental questions and the way government politicos attempt to manipulate the people whome they are supposed to serve. Now, I need to read the book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe at Any Age","review":"Although its mish-mash of various genres ultimately makes it unqualifiable, I suppose you could say The Hunger Games is primarily a slasher film for young teens, with the scary beings who jump out at you with blades being those terrifying older teens. You have to be a grown-up to know how offensive it is in using child soldiers and portraying dogs as weapons.It could also, however, be seen despite itself as an allegory for young people being forced by their societies to compete desperately for places in universities, for jobs, for housing, etc. -- in a world where there's never enough to go around. If the film had given me any sense that it was aware of its potential in this dimension, I could give it more than two stars.Otherwise, it's a film for young teens. My favorite part (I saw it in a theater) was the vocal audience participation when the girl kisses the guy. This was a Big Deal for our audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Unadulterated Crapola","review":"The books, all three, were fantastic reads. The only thing the movie and books have in common is the name. Nothing else. The movie is pure unadulterated crapola. If I were able I would rate the movie a minus (-) ten (10) stars.

Some scenes of the movie were too graphic for me and I closed my eyes. I just don't need or want to see people hurting and dying!I DID think the actors did an incredible job. But that's the only good thing I can say about it. It was too drawn out. I kept waiting for it to be over. It did end with a pretty good cliff-hanger.

A few minutes watching Battle Royal, and I am writing this bad review for Hunger Games. I thought a post apocalyptic movie where people off each other was COMPLETELY unrealistic, not good art because it teaches NOTHING, and is crap random entertainment. Like watching it is worse than watching reality tv garbage.

I have since read the first 2 novels in the trilogy (The Hunger Games and Catching Fire) and I am enjoying them a great deal. Even though they are intended for a young adult audience, it is mature enough material for older adults (which most certainly includes me!) I have one recommendation regarding the film. If you have not read the books, watch the film first and enjoy it in its own right, then read the books. If you do the opposite, I think you may find the film disappointing. It stands on its own as a very good film but as is typically the case, the film pales when held up to its literary inspiration.

I did feel the story was a bit rushed, but I don't think it would be as noticeable to someone who didn't read the story prior to seeing the movie.This movie is definitely worth seeing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie","review":"I have read all 3 books and this really followed the story in the book.

She's watching it for the 2nd time already. It will be three times tomorrow. Good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Movie is good - saw it with the kids two times in the theater, and got them this for Christmas. It's violent, but much of the violence is left to the imagination (a la Hitchcock). The story is based on the premise that each year two children are selected by lot from each of twelve districts, and then they fight to the death for the entertainment of the ruling class. The distinction between the haves and have-nots is clearly developed - perhaps exaggerated. People who remember Woody Harrelson from cheers will love his performance. Much of the movie is shot with a shaky, hand-held appearance that bothers some viewers, but I think it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good","review":"Media overrated it. I don't know what the hype and controversy was all about. It wasn't that great. Just good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just rewatched this again...","review":"Yeah, there are always \\"the book is better\\" comments, and you know what, the book was better. But, in light of taking a 350+ page book and make a movie, the crew did a FANTASTIC job with this one! The main themes and heart of the story are still there in the movie. Some parts are as haunting as the book. So, read the book and get all that it has to offer then watch the movie and see a great adaptation of the written work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunger Games Movie","review":"I like it.

I am so pleased with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunger Games","review":"As someone who read the book first, I felt connected to the characters, emotional, and very excited. I know that when books become movies, it can be hard to appreciate it because they don't end up being as similar as I want them to be. However, this movie did a pretty good job keeping things accurate to the book. I think they did a *very* good job making certain scenes heart-wrenching. The actress who played Prim was particularly good at her part. I enjoyed it a lot. There was at least one thing I was upset about not being properly included in the movie, but other than that, I'd say this was quite a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunger Games","review":"THG movie was a very good adaptation of the book (I've \\"read\\", but have not read the book series myself).

Wouldn't watch again, and won't be watching the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my rental credit","review":"A futuristic, orderly, but sick society.THX-1138, Rollerball, and about 50 episodes of the Twilight Zone did it better. Far better. Part of it was the cast. I didn't like any of them except maybe the girl, and just when I realized this, Woody Harrelson walks in. But I pressed on, for about 5 more minutes. I probably would have liked Donald Sutherland, but I turned it off before he had said much of anything.I think if Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves had a child, that child could not grow up to be as bad at acting as the lady in pink.Not the best review, but I've watched a lot of movies lately and this is the only one I turned off.Update: I decided to watch the rest the next day while cleaning up my computers' file system. It was less unbearable because my expectations were so low and I was only half watching.

The way the actors portray their desperation, anger, fear, and love is vivid and well done. However, this is assuming you read the book, because otherwise you will miss out on some of the best parts of the film that are not explained entirely. That having been said, these are only a few scenes out of the entire movie, and are not critical to understand the plot of the entire movie. Overall, this is a fantastic film, and I recommend it to everyone, whether or not you read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing little story","review":"I watched this movie with my daughter, who is 13, and we truly enjoyed it.

There's always danger in book-to-film adaptions, but for me, simply but this was a entertaining flick. Somewhat teenie-bop, but (of course) the subject matter wast pretty serious and the effects visually stimulating enough to keep my attention.

As everyone knows, when you read the book first the movie is ussually a dissappointment. Not so in this case. The movie managed to capture the essense of the book--the \\"feel\\" so to speak. Jen Lawrence was perfect as Katniss--totally nailed it. Woody Harrelson absolutely great as the mangy, cynical, secretly wise Haymitch. I wasn't too crazy about the kid who played Peeta--very bland and he's supposed to be better looking. They also changed around a few things that I thought would be fine left the same way as the book. But they put more emphasis on the head game keeper, and showing how the games are manipulated, than the book did and that was cool! All and all, really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are we headed for this?","review":"Let the UN take over and this book may come to pass.

I've been hearing so many people referencing this book, so I decided to see it. I've not read the books, and from what I've seen from the movie, I don't plan on reading them.This movie was very slow in building up any story, and the so called upper class looked like someone threw-up skittles all over them.

Half of the movie was done very well, but half looked like an amateur attempt at screenplay,direction and editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure and Simple Kiddie Pornography","review":"If I could give this movie fewer than one star, I would. As if we haven't seen enough films showing adults killing each other, now we have to be subjected to teenagers killing each other. This is pornography. This is obscene. From the first moment at the beginning of the game to the last, we see body after body of children murdered by other children...and, several times, we see children murdering other children. No one is saved from this, even our hero who kills without thinking twice. There is no merit to this film. Parents, if you let your children see this film you should have them taken away from you. Sure it is simulated killing by actors, but simulated sex by actors is considered porn, too, and you wouldn't want your children to see that, either. No excuses. No one should be proud of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video damaged","review":"The video skips 18 minutes (as far as I viewed). I am very disappointed.

I really only watched it because i liked Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone and X-Men: First Class the film contains Horrible special effects(watch when Jennifer and Josh are lead on the platform with the audience cheering about 30 minutes in), RIDICULOUS hairstyles, i mean really, Did Stanley Tucci have to have blue hair? And what about Elizabeth Banks? Stupid. When the \\"tributes\\" are trying to attack Jennifer while shes in the tree, why weren't they worried about killing each other instead of her? Several other dumb moments like that. Woody Harrellson and Donald Sutherland are in this but they basically have bit roles and don't really add anything. All in all this was 2 and a half hours of my life i wished i couldve spent better. Pretty boring, not worthy of the hype at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I watched this video because my wife read the book. I had not read the book. The movie was technically wonderful. The acting was quite good and the special effects were stunning. However, I was very disturbed by the premise that teenagers, raised in, generally, good families would kill each other with so much enthusiasm and with no apparent remorse. This feeling stayed with me for days. I am rather older than the average person to whom the books are targeted but this was my emotional reaction to the film. If I had children still at home I think that I would not recommend that they read the book or see the movie. Perhaps this was supposed to allegoric, like \\"Lord of the Flies\\" but it still hit me in a way that \\"Lord of the Flies\\" did not.

It took me multiple days to get through the 2 hr 23 min film and finally when finished was left disappointed. I thought for all the hype the casting could have been better and I thought the filming itself left a lot to be desired - at times reminded me of the Blair Witch Project.

So with that I am glad I waited to see this on DVD instead of going to the theatre to spend $4 dollars at the matinee, it didn't really make that much sense to me at all. I even heard one other critical reviewer on a radio show say \\"Who wants to go see a movie about a bunch of teenagers killing other teenagers\\", for the sake of surviving members of the human race in order to win at a game show?

However, the movie/disc got \\"stuck\\" when Katniss was in the tree and we had to go back to the main menu and start again at the next chapter. I returned my copy frustrated because I felt like we had missed something important. The copy I later bought at Wal-mart did the same thing.

Why is society split between psychopaths with crazy hairdos living in the year 3000, and seemingly normal people living in the 19th century? Is that Will Smith's son or is that a girl? Oh, I guess it doesn't matter now because he/she is already dead. Are the CGI computer dogs computer generated by the computer forest or are they supposed to be real dogs made by the computer forest? And if the CGI computer dogs are CGI then is the CGI city a real city or a computer manifested city? Is this like the Matrix? The computer dogs must be CGI within CGI because the deer at the beginning was real. At least it wasn't as bad as the equally overrated Battle Royale.

It also does not go into detail about her past with Peta and the bread. The books are great and I enjoyed every one. The books also go into a lot depth about her life, and the movie does not. I have read countless books in my life, and this one i will remember.I liked the Transformers movies much more. The writers got the long history of the war and Megatron and Optimus Prime with out it being the focus of the movie.If only they had managed that with this movie.If you have not read the books ye, do that and forget this movie.

HUNGER GAMES has just TOO MANY elements from the 2000 Japanese film(and book) BATTLE ROYALE. While HUNGER GAMES entertains and has been very popular, I just wish the larger public could see what I believe is the source material.BATTLE ROYALE is a classic- a metaphor for the cut throat, hyper-competitive state of Japanese education, and the state of today's youth casting off and rebelling against traditional Japanese culture.

I'm aware it's hard to make a movie from such an outstanding book such as the Hunger Games series. With that being said, I was VERY disappointed in the movie. It was a VERY poor example of what might have been done with that book. It covered such a few actual chapters of the Hunger Games story line and much of the information was incorrect (e.g. Madge gave Katniss the mockingjay pin NOT Prim). The actors were poorly chosen from the mental description from the book (e.g. Woody Harrelson as Haymich. PLEASE!!! How insulting). I'll not watch nor purchase any other of the series books movies if they are made. The books were AWESOME!!! I compare the accuracy to the movie made of Clan of the Cave Bear. It was ALSO a poor example of a GREAT book by Jean Auel!!!! I've not talked to even one person who really liked the movie compared to the book and they are also not willing to purchase another butchered movie!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, poor execution","review":"After hearing so many people rave about this series, I felt I had to give it a try. While the premise was good, I felt the execution was lacking. There were so many dismal holes in the plot, I felt that it was a disservice to the young adult market that they were targeting. The author didn't give the young adults any credit for intellectual reasoning. I have read many young adult books that were handled much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Children killing children was disturbing","review":"The movie was well made, exciting and a little bizarre, but the biggest impact it had on me was a theme of children killing other children for the entertainment of the elite classes, and to win food for their very deprived colony, was disturbing at best. Ultimately the victory of a representative of the \\"mining colony\\" which they go to great lengths to have all colonies other than colony one (whose children are trained for the games their entire lives), is rewarding, but the movie ends with the evil leader of the planet upset over her victory, and you know it's only going to get worse in sequels. I will never watch it again, because the images of children killing other children, primarily for the entertainment of the ruling/elite classes was so upsetting that I don't consider that to be \\"entertainment\\" that I enjoy and would watch ever again.The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hunger Games","review":"I thought the movie was lacking in a lot of areas.

I knew nothing about it nor recognised any of the listed staring actors. At a $3.99 rental fee for an evenings entertainment at home I figured what the hey. What a delightful surprise. Once into the movie I recognized some very fine costars and supporting actors and actresses in Donald Sutherland with superb but very little screen time, Woody Harrelson, who also put in a fine performance,the always enjoyable Stanley Tucci who is just absolutely on fire in Television and movie roles, and Elizabeth Banks (The 40 year old virgin and Seabiscuit.

If you want to see more realistic, non boring proper version of what this series was copied from both the novels and movie check out Battle Royale 1/2. Far greater films, way more fast paced and doesn't tale 45 mins to get started. Hunger games is like a watered down, twillight infused, boring version of Battle Royale. Nothing worth watching more than once, and compared to the book unless you read the book you wont undertsand have the weird crap going on all over the place here and there are parts of this film that will have you facepalming it's that dumb.

The movie was released on 8/18 and with items I have previously pre ordered they arrived on the release day. This time the movie did not ship until 8/21. I will not recieve it until 8/24.

So, a week later I decided to read the book and ah ha:-) , this is where you get to know them. I enjoyed the book so much, that I bought and read the other two as well, because I just couldn't wait to find out what happened in the end. I went back and watched the movie again, understanding and relating to the characters and their situation and it was so much better. I eagerly wait for the next movie to come out. 4 stars because people who haven't read the book, won't enjoy the movie as much. Funny, its usually the other way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hats Off","review":"My daughter and her friend read the books, and I had as well. I loved these - even as an older reader. I was following the development of the movie and was a little critical thinking the actors would be too old - based on the book, and how it made me feel.BUT - books are books and moview are movies. I loved this and really enjoyed my daughter and her friend being able to discuss their views. It had action, drama, romance, and I can see how part two is called for. Loved Leny in there, what a treat.It would have been nice if there was, for example, and old wise person speaking some lifelong philosophy to drill in deeper thought - but perhaps the overarching series will do this. Very interesting how this movie (and book/s) came out just before the uprising in North Africa and the Middle East. I may be looking to deeply - but can't help but feel some coincidental parallels. Fantastic timing."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"The movie was boring and for it to be 2 and a half hours long, there could've been more details from the book to incorporate in the story line....everything happened so fast that it seemed to leave out the descriptives of why the different scenes were actually taking place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunger games","review":"This was mindless teenage drivel.

This movie was great - can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A difficult job...","review":"I read the Hunger Games long before I saw the movie. The premise was the sort I loved as a young man but seems more implausible today. Nonetheless I forced myself to \\"get into it\\" and enjoyed the book adequately enough. But because of the restrictions forced by a movie of about two hours, hardly any book can be presented on screen in its entirety. And, in the case of Hunger Games, that restriction is fatal. Too much like using a cartoon strip to depict War and Peace. So if you stay away from the book, maybe the movie is passable (for example, I loved Avatar). But Hunger Games is a story that requires more depth than a movie can hold."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smash Hit","review":"This film was a phenomenal film. I was glad that I pre-ordered it so I was guaranteed to get it. The only thing that I did not like was that I did not get it on the release date. I had to wait a few days after that.

The fact that this movie actually follows the book blows my mind. I loved the book series and was hopeful when I heard about the movie. Well, I wasn't disapointed, Jennifer Lawrence delivers and is perfect as our Herione. Also, can I just say, I'm a grown woman and I totally think that Josh Hutchenson (sp?) was such a cutie! Well played on both parts, I can't wait to see the next movie! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunger Games","review":"While I felt Hunger Games was a good movie, having read the books first (who hasn't????) I missed what I felt were certain key elements that were not included in the movie. I also did not feel \\"gripped\\" with the movie as it moved too slowly in the beginning. It only reached the \\"I'm holding my breath\\" stage at the very end, but it wasn't a slow build to that state....it was a passive enjoyable watch until the last 20 minutes or so. Woody Harrelson was underused....Stanley Tucci was superb, and Donald Southerland appropriately lurking evil. As for the \\"kids\\" themselves, they were well cast and well played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunger Games YES, Donald Sutherland NO!","review":"Hunger Games the film is a good movie based quite closely on an enjoyable book. The fact that it IS a good movie is the reason I would recommend the DVD. However the additional features on the DVD and BluRay are a mixed bag. No commentary, which depending on who was doing it could be good or bad. Donald Sutherland apparently found all kinds of political depth to the story beyond what is there in the story itself. And he really goes on and on......and on. I guess that that might have been the bad part if there had been a commentary....they might have had him talking and my oh my he must be missing making the movie MASH.The politics of Sutherland could sink the film for you if you were to watch the few shorts first.But extras (or lack thereof)aside, the movie itself is quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Fantastic movie! Definitely not for anyone under 15, but overall fantastically done!

I was disappointed seeing such big names as Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson in the trailer, but they turned out to really make the part. And Katniss -- purrrrrfect!Purists may complain that the movie didn't follow the book exactly. But what do you expect? 20 hours of movie? I recommend reading the book so you can fill in the gaps while you're watching. But don't get hung up on the few things that may be different. Just sit back and enjoy.

Overall a good watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie- Great acting","review":"On vacation last spring, I visited my grandsons who were so excited about the coming release of this movie. They wanted me to take them to see it. But first they made me read the book. I ended up reading the whole trilogy. I find it really hard to put a book down and not know how the story ends. Anyway, the book, I felt, was a little too old for them with the violence in it but, It was so well written that the violence was secondary to the story that was being told. So, I took them to the movies to see \\"The Hunger Games\\" and enjoyed it immensely. The actors were superb (every one of them) and it was done very tastefully. Cant wait for the next to come out. I will plan my next vacation accordingly so I can take my grandsons again, my treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most over-rated films of all time","review":"I never understood all the hype behind this movie. It was \\"Good\\" at best. It was painfully slow in parts and the acting was muted. This movie was clearly meant to appeal to the Twilight crowd. As a thirtysomething, I guess I am too old for what amounts to a teen movie, despite a somewhat twisted plot. Thats all I wanted to say..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad concept","review":"Kind of a sick concept when you think of it. Kids killing kids .. Come on people, what is the mass appeal here"},{"rating":"1","title":"None of the characters looked hungry to begin with.","review":"I finally rented The Hunger Games. There's two hours of my life I will never get back. Horrible cinematography (would have liked at least ONE steadycam shot), the viewer was not given a chance to feel much of the emotion (which means no emotional inventment at all), and, finally, unlike the book, I didn't really want Katniss and Prim to win.I will not watch the rest of them. Oh, and by the way, Mr. Director of Photography, give your people room to BREATHE. Closeups and dirty-overs were so restrictive (and there were too many of them), that the whole thing could have been filmed at the park across from my High School (which is one block square). I give it 2 stars out of 5. The second star is to fatten the one-star, because not a single character looked hungry to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids killing kids","review":"Its a horrible movie teaching children violence and killing is ok.

She noticed some differences between it and the book, but she was so excited otherwise. I was quite impressed as well. Can't wait until part 2 is made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent But Deadly","review":"The movie was great. There were a few small details I would have added from the book but every movie has a time limit. Many parts of the movie was in complete silence so don't expect some all out war. Also do not get disappointed by the lack of emotion from Katniss. While in the book she sort of falls for Petta, it seems like only an act and just that for her in the movie. Be prepared to fall for Rune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged dvd","review":"After reading the trilogy, I was anxious to pre-order the dvd. I finally received the movie, early in fact, and couldn't wait to play it. Right in the middle, it stopped. I couldn't get it to move forward or backward. At one point it jumped to about 3/4 of the way through. I was so disappointed!I used the return print-out & sent it back. I was pleased with how amazon.com dealt with the whole transaction of immediately returning my payment, with no shipping cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra-Violet Digital Copy is GARBAGE!","review":"It's a complete shame that my girlfriend wanted this movie to watch at home, because if not for her I would have NEVER purchased this movie with this Ultra-Violet \\"Digital Copy\\" it's the worst thing EVER.

So much so I wanted it for my home collection. Unfortunately, the DVD had a flaw which caused it to freeze up in the middle of a scene, and I was unable to advance the film from that point. I tried this on a several different DVD players (the two on my home TVs, and on 2 different computers) with the same problem each time, so it was not the player. I requested a replacement rather than a refund, but was refunded instead. While there was no problem returning the item, since I purchased it with points, I lost the points with no replacement, as points are not reinstated with a returned item. Unfortunately, I have now lost both the physical DVD and the points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving over hyped junk.","review":"Terrible movie overhyped slow moving they hacked apart the book waste of money. hard to follow real bad script and the casting was terrible. the only actor worth a salt was donald Sutherland and he had a bit part.

You can feel the society fabric is going to fold by looking at its controlling class garishly overdress ill-fixing costumes, pancake makeup, die-jobs, manicured breads, wastefully and lavish meals verses the working class who wore the basic clothes, shoes, hair, people living hand to mouth, everything had a function and nothing wasted.

Expressionless faces, \\"old\\" actors playing children, non believable portrayals. maybe donald sutherland was reasonably cast as Snow. I think some of the details might not make sense unless one had read the book, but I\\"m not sure since I was too distracted by the innappriate cast.

(my instant video got messed up too and kept saying I had only 6 hours left even though I just purchased a 24 hour rental)."},{"rating":"1","title":"As shallow as a fashion magazine","review":"I enjoyed the book, the movie was too pretty.Even though the inhabitants of impoverished district 12 look like WWII refugees and wear frumpy frocks, Katniss sports a to die for outfit -- well-fitted leather jacket plus those marvelous boots -- while hunting a deer. No way would she ever gut a deer in that outfit! This implausibility made me laugh out loud and took me out of the movie at the very beginning instead of gaining my interest. And the laughs just continued...Sorry guys, but I got tired of close-ups of Katniss. The irony is that this vain fashion magazine approach is contrary to the theme of the book. How did Hollywood not get it? (Sarcasm, folks.)The characters lack depth, the ending lacks closure, the scenes are mere snippets, the romance is cold, special effects border on cheesy, yet it's mildly entertaining. For some reason, I liked seeing W. Harrelson and L Kravitz in their roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Battle Royale, by any means","review":"Unfortunately the writer has many similarities the amazing work done in Japan. The material appears to be stolen although the author claims to have never heard of Battle Royale.

Why does everyone think this is so great?","review":"I was board to tears with the slag teen acting and redundent scenes. The direction was inexperianced. The story was unfocused or at least the screenplay. The concept is so perverse. Children of all ages killing each other for the wealthy's entertainment while they're parents starve and work in sweatshops. That's sick! It's no different than ancient gladiators fighting and dying to make the local royalty smile. I'm disgusted with this and found no honor nor seriousness to it what so ever. Last thing.

Jennifer Lawrence is good though.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great story ruined by stupid photography","review":"The epic struggle between \\"The Capitol\\" and \\"The Districts\\" is matched only by the struggle to see what is happening in the story because the camera is incessantly zoomed in too close, jiggled, pointed off-center, etc., until it is simply TEDIOUS to watch. If the same morons run the cameras in follow-on movies, they will not be worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was out of my age range","review":"I recommend this movie to today's youth.

I expected the movie not to fall in line with the book as they normally don't, but it gave no time to build up compassion or interest in any of the characters. I felt it left out anything of worth about the actual story."},{"rating":"2","title":"We loved it!","review":"I got this series as everyone said how great it was!! after reading the series the ( 3rd ) time i must say i was not sorry i got it. I have loaned it to our kids ( all are grown ) and they love it too. jack"},{"rating":"1","title":"So.... this was one of the \\"best\\" movies of the year?? Really??","review":"Ok I'm going to review this movie as a movie and not a book, for you fanboys of the book I'm talking to you. A good book doesn't equate to a good movie and this one is a classic example of that. I'm seeing a lot of 5 star reviews of this movie which after watching it and reading some of your reviews makes me seriously question whether you're giving those reviews for the book or the actual movie.The cinematography was crap, the chick that played the Katniss character was ok, other than that the acting was pretty terrible, the direction was garbage, the storyline is flat, plots are uninteresting and the characters are incredibly boring. The romance was very cheesy.On a personal note I almost fell asleep twice, no movie has done that to me since I watched Eragon lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hunger Games","review":"This movie was flat out BORING! It dragged on for far too long before the action began, which was also BORING, but somewhat less so. Some people, including myself, would see this boring too long beginning as time used to develop characters in the movie. It succeeded in doing so for the main character, whatever her name is. As for the rest of the characters, it did a poor job.I don't want to characterize this as a bad movie, it wasn't. It was just BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hunger Games","review":"Have not recieved the Hunger games, very disapointed...

Where we were staying had slow internet, so could not digital copy until got home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most enjoyable movie","review":"Overall, an excellent film. The production is first rate, as is the cast. Jennifer Lawrence is able to continue on with the same type of strong, protective character that she so mastered in \\"Winter's Bone\\". Without her, the movie would not be the same.Given the star-crossed lover theme that's a part of the movie, I can't help but wonder how many recognized the first four notes of the love song from Zeffirelli's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", in Katniss's mockingjay whistle code to Rue in the forest."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read the trilogy you will love the movie.","review":"I read the trilogy and the movie brought all those characters to life.

The acting by one and all is stellar and the action kept me interested all the way through even though I knew the outcome.

Think \\"Running Man\\" meets \\"Twilight\\". A terrible screenplay and huge plot holes. Just one example: \\"Half of you will die from cold, thirst and hunger!\\". Really?

Second, it was a very boring movie! I was hoping that maybe the next 10 minutes will be a little more exciting, unfortunately that did not happen. I'm mad at myself waisting 142 minutes of my time watching this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunger Games:the movie","review":"I read this series of books prior to the release of this movie and I was looking forward to seeing the film. Though it followed the plot of the story well, the direction leaves a little to be desired. I found it annoying that the director focused on symbols, like clasped hands, when I, as the viewer, was more interested in the action. It often felt as though the movie kept stopping to make a point that was obvious.In my opinion, Jennifer Lawrence was perfect as Katniss Everdeen. Perfect. I also found the costumes and makeup to be excellent and in keeping with the mood and flavor of the story and very instrumental in demonstrating the disparity between the Capitol and the districts. I'll look forward to the next film hoping that I can view it through the eyes of a different director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good movie.","review":"I enjoyed the movie.

Still worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the book","review":"I thought it followed the book but also elaborated a bit more where it was helpful in preparing for the next one. Loved the NC scenery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploring the Malthusian Myth in an Unexpected Way","review":"Why was that myth created?What is the legacy of that myth?Why do the rich and powerful continue to perpetuate that myth?What is the future of that myth if humanity does not extinguish it once and for all?I was astounded how much better this film was than I expected. I also had no idea the books dealt with such a deep and important subject matter. You do not need to know who Malthus even was or what horrors have been wrought in the world in his name to get the point of this movie. You will get enough taste of it without needing any background. You will probably want to know more afterwards, though.I am still reducing the rating by a star because the pacing of the ending is off for some reason. The climax just doesn't quite feel climactic to me. I also never really felt there was any chance the protagonist wouldn't make it. Otherwise, I think this film is worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"hunger games rocks","review":"it is an epic movie that has reach epic proportions. you never know whats coming next . i love the hunger games. it touches your heart. it is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hunger Games","review":"This was a very interesting movie. The concept is frightening, to think this may come to be. Movies have a way of predicting the future. I did have a problem with Children killing Children not only used to punish communities for their uprising against corrupt governance and to keep any future uprising suppressed but used for entertainment for the \\"good, compliant people\\". Disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If I had not read the book first I would have been lost as the main topics jumped from highlight to highlight.

Great for any child 10 or more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did not disappoint!","review":"I usually dislike adaptations from books as they very rarely do the originals justice. This was not the case with The Hunger Games.The cast for this movie was stellar. Jennifer Lawrence epitomized Katniss Everdeen. Her performance was gritty, vulnerable, and strong. She was everything that made Katniss such a joy to read. It was just as good watching her come to life on screen.Josh Hutcherson, while not necessarily what I pictured in my head while reading, became my favorite performance during the course of the movie. He turned what could have easily have been a cliched character into someone who displayed grace, strength, and a rare spirit that should have been crushed by his situation. He won me over and I couldn't picture anyone else as Peeta Mellark.Lenny Kravitz and Woody Harrelson gave excellent performances as well.I really enjoyed this film and now can't wait for the second installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunger games, Great Movie, high Replay Value","review":"I've watched the movie a few times now, and every time, it still brings the same feelings. For me, that is what sets a good movie apart from a bad one, a good movie will make the viewer feel emotions about the movie. All the gut-wrenching feelings that occurs within the viewer while the Hunger Games is absolutely intentional. it is a very dark movie, not the greatest for kids, but worth it. This is one of those movies with a high replay value, as in every time you watch it, it is still just as good as the first. I also like the fact that it explains what the book doesn't, while it doesn't rely on the book either. A must see, and a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the book.","review":"A good movie, which captures part of what the book is about.

This version didn't just come with the DVD and digital copy, but also came with an Amazon Instant Video copy as well. So, now we can watch it literally anywhere, on any of our devices.

Unlike most book-movie adaptations this one was pretty successful. While the book focuses on Katniss's point of view, her feelings/thoughts/fears, the movie focuses more on the games themselves. Skipping over the romanticism and the relationships among the characters as well as the history of panem.

For teenagers maybe this movie has an appeal but I don't think it works for more mature audience, myself included. I really can't find anything interesting about this movie. The storyline is flat, plots are weak and the characters are dull. A bunch of kids and teenagers are prepared into fight-to-the-death survival games, and hardly we can see pyschological battles inside each of the characters. Although the story may have an interesting premise to begin with, but the whole production is half-baked and lacking in so many areas.If this is supposed to be a suspense movie, I really can't feel it. The romance part is cheesy and the actions are lame. Many scenes are so superficial and do not make sense. The shaky camera work really makes things even worse.So is this a really bad movie? It is for me. But really, there's no accounting for taste. Just watch it and see if I have summed it up to your favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad that this is what the youth of America see as entertainment.","review":"To begin with, I had not read the book even though I had purchased it some time ago. Several of my much younger friends, 12-25 years old, had suggested it after knowing I had read and seen all of the TWILIGHT series. The HUNGER GAMES is in no way anything like the TWILIGHT series. Twilight is all about fiction and not a premonition of what the world could be in years to come. The idea of killing people for national entertainment is beyond disturbing, and even more disturbing is that this type of material is watched and enjoyed by people. The violence is not so much what is on the screen but rather the implied violence. Donald Sutherland does an outstanding job representing inhumanity. I was offended by the material and very sorry that I spent the money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan, after seeing this.....","review":"Watching this made me feel that I had come into the story already past the halfway point, and that I had missed why the society was the way it was. What a ripoff of so many better stories! It's bland, tame, and passionless compared to the actual history of the Roman Empire. None of the characters rise to the level of being either admirable or despicable, and Donald Sutherland is utterly wasted. I will NOT be watching the sequels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hunger Games","review":"Terrible acting. A ridiculous story.

But she should be renamed Lustniss...which rhymes with 'must miss'-- which is my advice for anyone thinking of wasting time on this drivel.Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn cool","review":"Didn't know if I would enjoy this because the hype was so big, but it definitely wasn't a let down. And, now, I really have no idea where it is headed from the end of the movie, so I can't wait for the sequel.

However, I felt that the story was extremely sad in the fact, that isn't there enough violence in the world and in the movies, that an author wrote such a story about killing children as a game, why did you write this story, is my question? The movie and actors was done well, but I will never buy or watch another movie like this again, awful idea for a book and movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Kindle wouldn't download it","review":"Think I would have loved this as I loved the books but tried many times in the 24 hours I had rented it and could never download it.

Hesitant to rent another too if I will just lose my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great visuals, roughly pieced together","review":"Beautiful actors, greats sets, weak story line.

The books were great, and \\"the movie never lives up to the book\\" is an understatement in this case. No character development, slowly moving plot, and important facts left out from the book made this movie a dissappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunger Games -- Needs More Meat on Its Bones","review":"I read the Hunger Games in a day and it took me about three days to read Catching Fire. I'm planning to read Mockingjay to finish the trilogy. I didn't plan to see the movie, but decided to take a look. I thought the visual look of the film was well done. The casting was also well done. The only problem with the film was that the story was flat and seemed to just string together choice scenes from the book. Not much time was spent on character development. So it was hard for me to root for the characters. Maybe it is an editing problem because some scenes are too long or some scenes jump ahead that it seems something was missing in between. If people that saw the Hunger Games haven't read the book yet, I'd definitely recommend that they read the book to fill in the blanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech. Good book, terrible movie.","review":"Six months ago (roughly) The Hunger Games movie arrived in theaters. At that time I had no idea what the movie was about, but that there sure was a lot of excitement surrounding its release.

A 2 1/2 hr snoozefest, many other reviewers have said much better then I can, but I'll give it a go. I thought the movie seemed to long and yet for the length of the film you never really get to know or care about the characters.The cinematography was well to my mind just plain horrid, I hate *shake-cam*.Now for all of you, who would tell me to read the books. I ask you, why should I have to read the book first to 'get' the ins and outs of the story?

I look forward to the sequel now being filmed in my own backyard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Decent Movie","review":"If you loved the books, you'll appreciate the movie. If you didn't read the books, you'll probably still enjoy the movie. It seems fairly hit or miss, but as someone that read the books, I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it captured the key moments of the story. My fiance watched the movie with him, and having never read the books, still thought the movie was entertaining and easy to follow. He's looking forward to the next movie coming out."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!!!!","review":"I have read all three books in the Hunger Games trilogy and I am OBSESSED! I couldn't WAIT for the movie to come out. I was there on opening night and I am one of the few who went into the movie not expecting too much violence. I knew since it was a PG 13 movie that it couldn't have as much violence as the books. SO, because I went in with that expectation, I LOVED the movie! The only complaint I have heard from people who have read the books is that there was not enough violence in the film. I personally thought they did a fantastic job with the movie. I still like the book better, but it's rare that I love a movie more than a book. I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to EVERYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunger games","review":"The hunger games was really good but had just finished reading books so of course so much left out.

If you were a fan of the books I'm sure that you would have loved this movie. I did not read the books and was considering not watching this since I knew the storyline. Well I came very close to turning it off. I found the story very very disturbing and hard to watch. It actualy bothered me to think about how popular this story was and that people brought their children to the theater to see it. Call me old fashioned or over protective, but there is no way I would have let my children see this. Bottom line is this is about children being forced to kill other children and I do not call that entertainment. I gave this video to my best friend and she felt the same way. We both agreed that we do not want to see the sequals. This is my personal opinion so if you are hating on me I really don't give a crap.

And it owuld have to a lot of background. Never really understand why Peter joined the \\"evil alliance\\" or why Rue did not kill the heroine when she had the chance. Had Rue already made up her mind? Just too many inconsistencies and unfinished or disconnected plot lines to make the movie believable, and I am not talking about the basic premise. That part I understood and accepted going in. Also, nothing explaining the difference between the \\"emerald city\\" dwellers and the districts, etc. A little more on that an some less scrubbing and bikini wax moments would have been useful for thos that have not read the book. Yes, amovie cannot go into all the detail a book can go into, but a poorly done movie will not motivate anyone to buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should of been made a tv series","review":"Loved the books.

I asked him to watch it and he did, after he agreed completely with me, it is an amazing movie that does an excellent job of conveying vulnerability and the goodness of people, no matter how cruel the world. Such a powerful story and with such depth, even without reading the book!The Bluray/DVD contains plenty of extras on how the film was made and gives fascinating insight on how different things were done for specific reasons to keep \\"the feel\\" right.

Let me just say the part in the story with the \\"beasts\\" coming back with the players' faces!!! Wow! If you loved this movie, make sure you pick up the book and read it.

As the cast of Catching Fire is being announced I know I will be reading the books again since the sequel won't be out until November 2013.

I was able to watch it thru amazon prime before the hard-copy arrived, which was great.In regard to the movie, it does a good job sticking to the book, but does omit a lot. What they DID do, however, pretty much painted exactly the world I pictured while reading the book. Overall, very happy with the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 11 year old daughter loved it.","review":"We watched it together despite her reluctance, but she loved it and said it's now her favorite movie. She then watched it again the next night and again on our iPad since it had digital copy for iTunes. I wasn't all caught up like she was, but it gave me a chance to talk about the significance of some of the issues brought up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Follows the story but leaves a lot to be desired in developing relationships between characters. Shaky camera is awful and she in no way looks like she's scraping by or had a hard life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunger Games left me hungry!","review":"Hunger Games, the movie, didn't come close to the book. It left no impression on me and I can hardly remember the actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunger Games","review":"We watched this movie on Amazon and enjoyed the story line. Acting was good. I will watch the others when they come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Cast and Well Directed","review":"Didn't read the books, although now I'm tempted. I am still a bit haunted by the overall storyline concept. Looking at society today it feel all to possible. Not for the faint of heart. Let's just hope some kids don't think it's cool and try it out. I look forward to the next movies for closure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over Done","review":"I saw the movie in the theater and loved it! The books were phenomenal and the movie stayed pretty true to the book. Since I have an \\"at home\\" theater, I tried out the movie with 3-D & surround sound and it was AWESOME. Better than in the theater, if that is possible. Anxiously awaiting the sequels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"You had to have read the book before watching it. It helps to clarify reasons for different scenes and the significance of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hunger Games","review":"I thought this story line was terrible. The thought of teenagers killing each other was repulsive. We need more love, not hate in this world.l"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"Not only was this movie just plain stupid, it was too easy to guess what was about to happen. I didn't connect with any of the characters and the killing was largely useless. Also, the long, drawn out crying bit in the middle had me rolling my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating","review":"I believe that this movie should be rated at least R rather than PG-13. The violent nature of this film certainly should fall under this rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disapointment.","review":"What kind of mind thinks up a plot of adults expointing children to hunt and murder each other using food as the motivating factor, a disturbed one!I had not read the book and rented this flick based on the hype and advertisements for it EVEYWHERE. Donald Sutherland once again proves why he is not in many movies, he cant act.The ending just, well sucks.. not leaving us wanting for more but wondering why we bothered.If you have not rented it dont, wait for it to come out on HBO or one of the other premium movie channels and even then you will be disapointed that you wasted over 2 hours of your life watching this flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever","review":"I had to see this movie I had to.I have read the book so I felt like I needed to when I saw the movie it was so good.5 stars I give it but I want to put more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating, Spastic Cinematography","review":"This entire production is a series of jumps between clips of 1 to 7 seconds duration - usually about 3 to 5 seconds from one viewpoint and then JUMP to another camera. It made me physically ill. This kind of spastic \\"cinematography\\" is what I would expect from a 6th grader with ADHD. For a \\"major motion picture\\" to be produced so badly is an insult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunger Games review","review":"It was a great movie. Of course, book better but movie definitely worth watching. Maybe not for children under 14 but it does have a message too."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER","review":"Best move I have ever seen. Surpassing everything I thought it would be. AMAZING!!! No words for it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got popcorn?","review":"You can't go wrong by watching the incredible Hunger Games movies. They are full of excitement and thrill. Get your popcorn ready!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed The Book, Enjoyed This Movie","review":"I thought this movie followed the book, for the most part. Evenso, we're never going to get the detail in a movie as one does from a book. The sequence of events were in line with the story, and it was great to see how all the characters were dressed out and portrayed, vice having to use one's imagination when reading the book.Overall...great movie, and looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO disappointed","review":"The book was AWESOME. I eagerly awaited the release of this movie and boy was I let down! The movie left out WAY too much. I understand needing to shorten things- but not at the expense of flat out ruining the movie. This movie should have been another 30 minutes long AT LEAST if it meant maintaining the quality of the character development and story line. What a waste- I felt jipped. Really doesn't leave me itching to see the next 2. I hope there is an improvement with the next 2 movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad and pointless movie","review":"this movie features a lot of useless killing, and very little of anything else. The plot is weak to absent outside of the kids having to kill each other to survive. This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen in years. In place of good camera action and character development there is overdramatic death scenes that just seem to be created out of this air without reason or plot flow. And then it just ends, no real plot tie up just"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"(1.) Story of people being hunted, either by themselves or by others, has been overdone these past 30 years. A cheap, marketable script for a ready made, marginally intelligent, Twilight audience.(2.) The forest cameras and little balls with enclosed items hanging everywhere looks good on paper but made as much reality sense as a walking/talking goldfish. Looked like a cheap aluminized plastic prop.(3.) Cheap visual effects and props. Some sort of tent structure with a lot of aluminum camera cases as props.(4.) Dying scenes, when shown, were shown quickly so as to not make the cheap blood effects too apparent.(5.) Acting was Nickelodeon TV level teen superficial. Female, supposedly highly skilled and hunt experienced, archer seems to not know to tie back her bangs to stop them from constantly distracting/fluttering in her eyes.(6.) Predictability was so over-the-top, it was embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"1 star only because i can't rate lower, has anyone that rated this higher actually seen it? It is a terrible story. Don't waste your money like I did in the theater with my wife and 12 year old daughter. This movie has a terrible story, why would anyone want to see it or recommend it to a \\"friend\\", after sitting through this we all said the same thing, why? and what is the hype? Terrible Terrible Terrible ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie sucks","review":"Phenomenal box office opening and hype and then you have it: an overlong, boring, no-climax and compromising movie. And do they really need a triangle love story in every movie? The shaky camera was totally annoying and unnecessary. The only redeeming quality was Wes Bently and his beard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but too much in common with another book/movie","review":"The book and movie bear a lot of situations with a book/movie out prior to this. Check out Battle Royale by Koushun Takami.Battle Royale: The Novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Sunday Night Flick","review":"As any of you could guess this was an amazing movie, didn't feel like it dragged on at all. And there was much more graphic violence than I would have guessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunger Games","review":"Follows the book so close that readers will be pleased. The story line is very belivable and I was impressed how the director stayed so true to the book. Personally I can't wait for the next movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunger games","review":"Was a very enjoyable movie, the storyline and the photography were awesome. I have watched the movie a few times since purchasing it and enjoy it more each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it!","review":"I had been waiting for this movies since I read the trilogy several months ago. I found it very entertaining and very true to the book (as much as a movie of this length would allow). My husband watched with me (he didn't read the books) and enjoyed it also. We're both looking forward to the rest of the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"I read the books and loved them. I wondered how they were going to actually create a lot of the characters, action and scenery. The movie blew me away and surpassed my expectations. I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"adventurous","review":"Was a good a good movie, expected more because of all the hype. Great movie to watch with family preteen and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl is in everything it seems","review":"I don't think I would have liked the movie with a different actress. I never read the books but she made the movie a good movie and not just a movie you watch because you liked the book. The movie did good on standing on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing, dumb, and waste of time.","review":"First off Pita was cast by some whiny punk kid from Zathura....need I say more. Katniss was a fine choice with Jennifer, Stanley Tucci did a great job, Woody Harrelson was lame, most of the other characters were okay except for the kids. This seems to be about as cliff notes of a book to movie as one could really get only touching on about 30% of the content that was in the book. I was very excited to see this movie and left the theatre wanting my time and money back. Everyone is raving about the movie but I feel it is just poor acting and bad script writing. I could only see lame Twilight droolers loving this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunger Games fail to entertain","review":"I almost stopped watching the movie. First of all, it was shocking to see that the theme of punishment from previous rebellious sectors was carried on from one generation onto innocent subsequent generations. And then when twelve years olds were being slaughtered, I was shocked. The hair, makeup and costumes of the establishment were ridiculous. The idea that people would watch children fighting for their lives on teleivision was nauseating. I would not recommend at all. It was terrible!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the hoopla about?","review":"This is such a letdown of a movie. A dreadful plot--haphazard direction--cheap art direction and design and a cast of solid actors overacting. Big movies just can't keep on being this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"Don't waste your time watching this 'B' movie. Could not have been worse. The story (yes I know it was a book) was rushed and therefore leaves you wanting more depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for price","review":"This item is just what I expected for great price. A great gift and inexpensive gift for Christmas. Awesome movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book to Film Adaptation Ever","review":"This movie captures the horror of being drafted into a hopeless battle perfectly. I have read the books, and the movie changes only a few minor details. Jennifer Lawrence is incredible (as always). I can't wait for part 2 and 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK MOVIE","review":"I was disappointed with this movie. After all of the hype about it I found it to be a letdown and not very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment Dujour","review":"I was so excited to see this film finally...what a disappointment. No where near as good as the books. No emotional attachment. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and disgusting.","review":"The premise for this movie is disgusting, especially in light of recent tragedies in this country. Why must good writers and good actors choose the ugliest and most violent themes for \\"entertainment\\" ? Even though we all know evil exists in the world, must we focus the eyes of our precious youth on such ideas? I bought this for someone else, and I will not be giving it to her. I will probably put it in the trash where it belongs..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Dumb Movie","review":"We watched this because of all the hype.... it was not good, it was just dumb... and I certainly understand all the hoopla."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really poor movie","review":"I was expecting much more. This is at best a ho hum flick. I'm really sorry I purchased this. I would strongly suggest that you wait until it's free. That shouldn't be very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"This is an alright kids movie but it's an Adult story, written at a young age reading level, adapted into a kids movie with no I dunno, substance. So a great idea but watered down with each incarnation."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my thing","review":"Didn't care for this .There was alot of action but I didn't like the \\"dog eat dog\\" message.Plus I felt there was to much build up about it.
