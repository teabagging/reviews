The letters to the title of my review add up to 23!!)","review":"Unfortunately once again the modern era of complicated movies with twisted endings delivers another disappointing film. I was really geared up for this one when I saw the trailer but this film nearly lost me at the 45 minute mark. I'm glad in a way I decided to stick it out to the end because the film does get a little more interesting from the half way mark to the end, but it's a shame we have to sit through the first 45 minutes to get there. Of course this film does appeal to a certain genre of people out there who do have a fascination with the number 23, Jim Carrey being one of them in real life from when he was a younger man. I think it's only those people who will really benefit from this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"They misstated Ted Bundy's death date. Unforgivable.","review":"Don't waste your time and money on this film. It is absurd. The filmakers didn't even bother to check their facts and that in itself makes the movie look dumb. They got Ted Bundy's death date wrong. He actually died on the 24th day of January, 1989, not the 23rd. A little research goes a long way especially when your movie is dependent upon it. How ridiculous it is that no one caught this mistake as it greatly discredits the entire film. They were obviously desperate for some 23s, so they invented some. I can't believe they thought no one would notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I had to get back in the review game!","review":"This is an atrocity, an insult to taste and intelligence.

It frightens me to know that they walk among us, and often without special helmets or close medical supervision. But I think I know what you're up to; you simpletons are positively shocked that more than half of us thought this movie was rubbish, and you feel the need to review it to try and defend your bad taste.

The story stretches out well, only to be very rushed at the end (and the ending was sort of weak overall). Throughout the movie, the main character is reading a book and they play out parts of the book while he is reading it, now these fictional flashbacks are just cheezy. The only good part about them is that Rhona Mitra (Who is amazingly good looking) is in them, but that does not salvage horrible film making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow -- Couldn't Finish Watching","review":"The plot sounded interesting, but the movie is so slow I gave up and didn't finish watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I think.. that this movie is definitely worth watching.

Someone needs a life!","review":"As you can gather from the title after getting a book as a present the number 23 appears over and over in this guys life. You see numbers like 599 on signs through out the movie. 5+9+9 You get the idea. They tell you lots of cool facts about 23 too. Ronald Wilson Reagan has 6 letters in each name = 666 divide that number by 28.95652 and you get 23. OK thats not in the movie but isn't it freaky? the number 2 is the smallest even number, 3 is the smallest odd other than 1. Just think of how many numbers can be worked down to 2 or 3 or both.I am sorry I bought it. I am sorry I wasted two hours of my life watching it. This guy is freaked about the number 23 following him around? I'll introduce him to a letter that has been haunting me for years.

The movie ended up keeping my intrest all the way threw to the very last scene which doesn't happen that often. But I would tell people to see this movie least once in their lifetime because will open up your mind to new possiblities and other stuff. Plus buying the unrated edition you get more for your money. So if your looking for a movie that will keep your intrest all the way threw as long as you keep your mind open and willing to give the actor a chance to show you he can do more then comedy movies then this movie will do you good and watch it with your friends or a night were you got night to yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"The Number 23 was quite a disappointment; so painfully slow, it failed to catch my attention all the way until the very middle, which was when I just gave up and turned it off.A dog catcher (slightly reminiscent of Ace Ventura) reads a book his wife gets him for his birthday about a detective who is obsessed with the number 23 and so he too becomes obsessed with that number. ZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzIn short, the acting is all right (though nothing great, Jim Carrey is same old Jim Carrey i.e. boring), while the plot and the dialogues are below average.Though the potential for a good movie was there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers and the poor choice of lines and weak plot.No masterpiece here..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"The transformation of Jim Carrey from bored animal guy to obsessed book reader wasn't believable at all, and was mostly hidden behind long, sex-filled flashbacks.My wife and I hated this film and turned it off before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw up 23 times.","review":"This movie is really bad. To start off the movie is really really slow. By the time the movie picks up somewhat, you will be extremely sleepy and confused about the muddled plot of Jim carrey's character trying to figure out why his life is so similar to a book. After you get through the confusion and finally start getting answers to this pointless movie you will be at the conclusion that this is one of the dumbest movies you have ever seen. The only plus about the movie is the cinematography was decent. But every other aspect of the movie was terrible. Avoid this movie at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Rhona Fans","review":"I only bought this movie because I'm a Rhona Mitra fan.

Populated by wooden characters; infused with barren description; steeped in empty, simple and inane dialogue; the book reads like the work of a middle-schooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"A change for the worse","review":"I couldn't agree more with \\"avidreader\\". Peril is unrecognisable as Thomas H. Cook novel. The prevous books I've read, The Chatham School Affair, Evidence of Blood, Mortal Memory, and Instruments of Night are the work of a master storyteller. They are filled with atmosphere, empathy, and often sadness, but written with a wonderfully engaging style that few authors can imitate. Then along comes Peril - a plot full of cliches, caricatures and coincidences. Hopefully its just an experiment and we'll soon have the \\"real\\" Thomas H. Cook back writing great stuff again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put this down","review":"Yet another great story by Cook - this one not as dark as previous works. I liked the way each chapter is from one of the characters point of view - it gives the reader different perspectives of the same scene. Very, very fast read - a change from past Thomas Cook novels. Only minor problems are characters: one is WAY over-the-top (the bad guy), while another is under-developed (the heroine). Otherwise, a terrific book for a short weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete departure","review":"I just want to ask the brilliant author: Why?? This book is a departure from the writing and storytelling in his previous books. He has impressed me tremendously so this book was a real letdown. In fact, I decided half way through I didn't want to finish it, I just didn't enjoy anything about it. There are multiple characters, with the author flipping back and forth. Sadly, none of the characters are worthy of spending time with...and the storyline is....well, boring. I just wonder where this book came from, did Mr. Cook decide to experiment with a new style? I was befuddled by his partnership book with Larry King, which was also very bad. If this was the first book I ever read by this author, I would never read him again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I'm Blind.....","review":"Other than the fact this movie was horrible I simply see things really odd in the world, I will never look at piercings the same nor a simple glass of pop.....I seem to see everything in a twisted black and white eclipse, I beleive this is the worst movie I have ever seen.....Horible storyline aka Plot, the thing I hated worst was those two girls....I wanted to strangle them both what exactly was the main thing in this movie either I missed it or there really isn't one, So the director or writer couldn't even think of something a tiny....Little bit better? huh?

In this movie they do drugs, talk back to their parents, fail school, party and to top it all off they constantly hang out with black males and in fact have sex with them.

I was excepting more realistic things in the movie, but as a story line, it was really good. And since I'm 19, it probably seems less realistic than it would have if I watched it when I was younger. I'd say this movie was OK, but I dont know if I'd watch it again. There were good parts in it, and some so-so parts. My neighbor borrowed it and said it was just OK and that she was expecting more from it. I hope this helps some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood teenage mutant girly trash.","review":"A decent movie if u want to get to know what average teenage american girls can get into according to Hollywood. Decent acting from all the characters esp Tracie's mum. I believe this movie to be unrealistic and overdramatic in most parts esp the end when Evie turns on Tracy and makes out that she was the bad influence on her. If u r an adult, u would get bored half way trough this film like I did because the point that Tracy's life was spiralling out of control was over emphasized. It was supposed to shock but it doesn't because u have probably seen something similar before. It is believable in most parts, pathetic and unrealistic trash in others but very watchable if u have the time. Rent it before u buy it(if u want to)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.....","review":"While Thirteen is in no way a bad film, it does not by any means deserve the continous praise that fellow reviewers are giving it. While it tackles a rough and very real subject, there are ultimately only 2 reasons to watch this film: Wood's and Oscar Nominee Hunter's performances. Hunter is utterly heartbreaking in her performance, and although she does not deserve to win the Oscar for THIS movie,( that honor should go to Patricia Clarkson)she definitely deserved the recognition. Overall a hit and miss forgettable film, by no means a classic or a 'great' drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touched a nerve","review":"When I asked my parents to rent this movie for me, they were hesitant. \\"Are you sure you want to see it?\\" the asked.I did see it and I'm glad. Painfully true, Thirteen made me remember a period in my life when I was angry, depressed and wild. Pretty much everything that happened to Tracy happened to me. Shoplifting, drinking, drugs, selfharm, promiscuity......I felt like I understood Tracy, inside out. Before that I played with dolls and vowed to never even smoke a cigarette.That all happened when I was fourteen. Now I'm seventeen, and all that's left to remind me of that period in my life is a few faint scars, a pile of stolen CDs and the knowledge that the teenage years are not a golden cheerleader dream; they are frightening, exciting, horrible and wonderful all at the same time. This movie embodies the very essence of adolecence, as I remember it. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie I've seen in years, by far","review":"I'll have to admit, the only reason I ever dreamt of renting this movie was because of the great reviews I kept reading about it. The critics, who can sometimes be a bit biased, we right on the money here. I'll have to say, Thirteen was one of the best movies I've seen in recent years. The acting was so good, that at times, I swore it was real. The storyline jumped around a little bit, and sometimes you really didn't know what was going on, but it all came together perfectly in the end.I see no reason why this movie shouldn't have won \\"Best Picture\\". It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Real","review":"This film showed exactly what it is like to grow up today. I was thirteen 6 years ago, and this movie pretty much sums up what my peers and i went through. Parents should really check this movie out if they have a daughter. Take it from someone who was just there, this is what a thirteen year old girls life is like."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"What an incredible movie. I didn't even know what it was about when I picked it up at the video store. I was shocked to find out that the movie was brave enough to explore its important topics. I think it was an eye opener to a lot of parents who are totally blind or even those that think they know whats going on in their teens life (I know mine dont...).Definitly check out this movie.If you are suffering with depression/drug abuse/self injury,etc I would suggest watching the movie alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing as hell","review":"I seriously think this was full of realistic and gut wrenching performances, no doubt but it just bored me and I got depressed. Holly Hunter and Evan Rachel Wood are excellent, especially Hunter as the mother who has to deal with her daughters transformation. Also starring a laid back Jeremy Sisto, D.W. Moffett, Nikki Reed, Kip Pardue and Deborah Kara Unger. This echoes into the realm of Larry Clark's masterpiece KIDS, but it gets lost in my mind. It has some pretty hard to chew in your face moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden deleted scene on the DVD!!!","review":"On 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment's release of the teenage drama 'Thirteen' the studio has added a deleted scene, hidden from immediate view.

On the following screen highlight the menu entry 'Making Of Featurette' and then press the 'Right' directional key on your remote control to highlight the number '13.' Now, press 'enter' and you will get to see a deleted scene of improvisation from the intervention."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIRTEEN- A GREAT DRAMA!!!","review":"this was the best movie i have ever seen. it still remains my utmost favorite movie. Being a teen like tracy i can really connect to what she is feeling and why. For some reason adults either like it or they dont, i think the only ones who do like it are those who can relate to children who are lost whether it be there own or anothers child. anyone who says this movie is a load of crap must have no heart or understanding. It tells nothing but truth in a teens life (well not every teen, just the ones who get into tracy's situation). The person who made the film has great honesty and bravery for making this film and thats what makes it different from all other teen movies. It has a cliff hanger ending making you want to know what happens with them which makes it even better if you like that feeling of suspense and drama. A great movie for teen and adults alike, most likley you will get attachted to tracy and can relate, very true and to the point movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the All-Time Best Movies ever made","review":"I am a trained actor, having been in the business for some 20+ years. This is without a doubt one of the finest acting performances ever filmed. While most sheep follow the flock of computerized, digitized 100+ million dollar movies and consider them great. A well acted, well writen story about human struggles, to me is the most important. Evan Rachel Wood is wonderful and deserves the Oscar for her performance, which she will not get because the movie was not a overwhelming HIT. It's to bad that society hates to look at reality in films, but will stop traffic to see an accident. I was so affected by this movie, I felt ill when it ended. A Wonderful film. I suggest you see this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dig. Vid. Genius.","review":"All shot on digital video, often with stripped down colors and shaky effects, 'Thirteen' is a hard hitting, realistic drama about Tracy, a 13 yr old middle schooler who gets caught up in drugs, [adolescence], and crime at too young of an age. Meanwhile, her brother is on his own pot escapades, and her mother is concentrating on her AA meetings and her coked up boyfriend.'Thirteen' is the epitomy of realistic teen dramas. It sets the stage for all that will be coming in this rare, but exquisid film. Go see it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best of 2003","review":"THIRTEEN is a raw, uncompromising drama that ranks as one of the best of 2003. The energy in the quick, low budget, shoot comes through in the film.( On the commentary track, director/cowriter Catherine Hardwicke says Fox Searchlight didn't get involved until after the production was completed. )Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood, snubbed by Oscar) desperately wants to be accepted by Evie (cowriter Nikki Reed) , the coolest girl at school. Evie accepts Tracy and the two become friends, but Evie introduces Tracy to sex, drugs, and self-destructive behavior. Complicating matters is the fact that Evie has no home life and Tracy's mom (the excellent Holly Hunter) , a recovering addict, can't appreciate the seriousness of what's happening.THIRTEEN is a snapshot of modern American pre-teen life, and I came away from the film thinking about the importance of communication between parents and children. This is a film that families should watch together.

(i think those who have seen Requiem and have seen this afterwards will agree). i know this is reed's true story, but i think she has made a little over the top. the only part of the movie i would watch repeatadly was when they are running around in the sprinklers. brilliantly shot, and the music is mesmirizing. unfortunetely, that is about the only brilliant and mesmerizing part of this movie. if you want to see a good movie dealing with drugs and teens.. see 'kids', 'bully' and 'requiem for a dream'. all three are amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, but don't buy the DVD","review":"Compared to the movie I saw at the theater, the DVD is poor quality and missing information in both the widescreen and full screen versions.

Thirteen year olds taking drugs, having sex and behaving HORRIBLY really is not that entertaining to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"So hardcore and realistic","review":"Thirteen reveals the situations and conflicts that rarely any parents or adults are aware of. Most parents would not expect teens this young to be engaging in such events such as oral sex, various drug uses, and other serious crimes. This movie offers an inside view into the lives of young teens these days that they are probably to afraid to tell, or just doesn't want you to know. Although some may view this film as controversal and disturbing, it is actually a wake up call. With this new knowledge about what your teen faces in life these days, use it to help them and keep them from going down the path Tracy went."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to review...","review":"Many parents probably don't trust their kids and think they are like this. Let me tell you, no thirteen year olds do this. None. There may be a few, but they probably don't have parents.The problem is, this movie tries to be over the top. First, 13 year olds don't look like they are in their late teens. I mean cmon, no thirteen year old looks like that. Then there is the whole prostitution/drug thing. If there are kids like that, it's a result of terrible parenting. But the fact is, I don't know anyone who has so many problems at age thirteen. I mean cmon, who goes into prostitution at age thirteen?Many people are naive and say stuff like, \\"This movie truly showed me the light!\\" Wrong, don't believe it. It tries to be over the top and stereotypical that teens are rebellious and do all this crap. The fact is, this movie is far from the truth, and many can't see that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad influence","review":"Teaches kids irresponsibility, promotes smoking, teaching them brutality, drug use, theft, comparison, superficiality, premature sexual activity, lying, bad behavior, cussing, corruption, self abuse, self cutting, underage drinking and defeats its own purpose of showing what bad influence can do in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh...","review":"At the beginning, I thought this movie progressed really well. It showed how a girl struggling with family problems and trying to fit in would do anything to feel accepted by her peers.Towards the middle of the movie, it started to seem like this movie was pandering to guys who would rather see 13 year olds having sex than actually sitting down and watching a movie that had some actual substance.Towards the end, the movie got a little too artsy. The fight with her mother was long and drawn out, especially the crying. The end was all summed up by various time-elapsed shots of the girl and her mother sleeping in bed together, and culminating in her spinning around on the merry-go-round, looking at the sun, and giving out a loud scream.All in all, a very disappointing movie. Do yourself a favor and rent this one before you decide to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tough year","review":"A bright 13-year-old \\"good girl,\\" Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), is drawn into the orbit of the \\"bad girl\\" Evie (Nikki Reed) and begins a self-destructive downward spiral. The film is very good at chronicling the boys, the drugs and the stealing, but I felt that it was a bit slim in showing what motivated Tracy to star down that path. I realize that fitting in and being popular is of vital importance at that age, but I wanted to the movie to make me really feel that need rather than rely on my own memories of it. Holly Hunter turns in a powerful, raw performance as Tracy's mother--I really appreciated her story more than that of the girls. Nikki Reed also co-wrote the script when she was thirteen herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes you think","review":"saw this with my wife around a year or so ago and this movie is still fresh in my mind. had heard lots of buzz about it, and after watching it, can say that the buzz was justified. The way they show the \\"downfall\\" of the lead character, and her desire to be liked (and to get a reality escape from events at home) has been done very well, and it feels very real. We could empathize with her as well as her mom, and talked about this movie long after the credits rolled..She's justa 13 year old, who wants to be cool, hip like the other girl(s)... this movie kinda shows that one of biggest obstacles for young teens are other teens themselves (not drugs or sex etc.). you don't know whom to blame - moms, friends, brother, the absent dad or just the fact that protaganist has noone left to confide to except her \\"best\\" friend..a must-see.. This is a movie which will make you think and wonder, and that's a good thing considering the major crop of movies that we get nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"this the most beautiful movie ever.it explains what is going on through a teenagrs mind so beautifuly."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Lifetime Movie...","review":"My expectations weren't terrifically high. If, as reported this was written (in part) by a thirteen year old, then she did a fine job. However, as pure cinema...This flick is highly overrated.So, she slept with guys, did drugs, shop-lifted, and wore slutty clothes...Again, it's all Lifetime quality fare. I found nothing compelling about the characters and I wasn't the least bit invested in their outcome...In fact, while watching, I found my attention wavering, quite a bit.After Kids, films like this just don't have the same shock-value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood \\"Honesty\\"","review":"This is pure Hollywood honesty as opposed to the brutal honesty of a movie like \\"Kids\\". Yes some kids are bad, Yes some kids grow up too fast but this movie is almost comical in how evil they make the 13 year old girl. I can actually see the writer sitting on the set thinking up more ways to screw this girl up in the film. If you can take it for what its worth and not a social commentary on kids these days then you'll get a few chuckles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catalog of ills of teenagedom","review":"This movie is not worth watching. It feels very long, has no real point, and pretends to portray the experience of every teenager while failing miserably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly Real","review":"To say the movie doesn't contain real shocking pieces of teens' lives would be an understatement. The movie literally pulls you out of your chair and spins you into a world so crazy and fast it scares you. Showing this movie to teens all over the world should be required because showing it to my teenage cousin (she was 17 at the time) made her think twice about her life and actions. It literally scares the hell out of you! For storyline, camera, and performance i give it a 5/5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this movie it is definitely one of my all time favorites. I actually saw this movie a few years ago on t.v. and I had to get it. Before I started online shopping of course because everywhere I went for the dvd it was not in stock. Even when I worked at a retail store we couldn't keep it in stock either. But thanks to amazon I got a good copy and it is a great movie for teenagers and up. It is definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Frightening Movie for Parents!","review":"This is a very frightening movie for any parent whose children are about to become teenagers(like me). The movie gives you the feeling that your childrens' personalities change quiet a bit during puberty. In this movie, the girl goes from innocent doll-loving family girl, to run around the town flirting felon. The down-hill change is almost too quick to be believable, but it is chilling to the bone. The mother of the young girl, played flawlessly by Holly Hunter, is an interesting character. She is ultra-permissive but has a heart of gold, kind of an interesting combination. It's very interesting to see how she deals with all the chaos surrouding her.This movie is a wake-up call to what drugs and corruption can do to an innocent and curious teenage soul. It may be unpleasant to watch, but it may take away some of the naivety of parents who are having martinis with their republican friends while their kids are snorting coke in the family room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Overwhelming","review":"This movie shocked me to the core. I didn't know weather to be angry or horrified. The girls portrayed in the movie knew more about the world than most 50 year old adults I know. But I guess all in all it was a movie and not all thirteen year olds are like that. (At least I hope they aren't) Another thing I couldnt figure out if this was based on a true story or fictional. I was left in a state of duh for the rest of my evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie robbed me of precious hours","review":"How this ever got funded, I will never know. THe storyline has more holes than something with a lot of holes, like that kind of cheese that is full of holes. The characters are more like schizophrenic manic depressives than developed roles. I distinctly remember one scene where the main character is amazingly mad, and the day later she's repented and dressing normally, without explanation. The conclusion, or lack of, is utterly anticlimactic. The only reason I've even taken the time to write this is so that others won't make the same mistake, and lose a valuable or or two of their lives. I can never reclaim those hours, so im sacrficing another 5 minutes of my life to preserve countless others. P.S. IF you directed or produced this movie, I have a great script about a catfish, and a suicidal broomstick, I swear its good buy it off me."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic","review":"I watched this movie last year when I was 17 and I thought it came off as really contrived and overly dramatic. It surprises me a lot to hear people talk about how \\"startlingly real\\" it is. Everyone I know who's seen it found it laughable. She pretty much transforms into a bad girl overnight. The most inexplicable part is when she cuts herself, she doesn't seem to actually be depressed or have any reason it just seemed (as with the whole movie) like they were trying to capitalize on all of the possible bad things that a teenager could do and so decided to throw them all in one after another really unconvincingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Movie , Different Decade","review":"Everyone in this film is painfully hip and beautiful. Even the parents. Why is that? Why don't they make a drug film involving unnattractive people? Everyone in this film looks like they stepped out of a rock video. This is tried to be explained by making the mother in the film a beautician.This film has been done time after time. In black and white it was \\"The Days Of Wine and Roses\\" and \\"Heroin Fiends\\". In the eighties it was \\"Less Than Zero\\". The plot never changes. The only changes are the clothes, hair and soundtrack.I am sorry there is nothing new in this film, nothing to shock, nothing to suprise. When the daughter breaks down in the kitchen towards the end of the film, she is suppose to be hysterically crying, look close there are no tears!Holly Hunter stars as the mother and as usual gives the only worthy performance, typical of the films she appears in."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated film in the last ten years.","review":"A really bad ABC After School Special.

I can't believe that so many critics liked this pile of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightening and Real","review":"It is amazing that a young person wrote this movie! The story is truthful and frightening. I was a bit worried going into it that it would be over the top but I feel it was kept within the realm of reality.Rachel Evan Wood is frankly amazing as is Holly Hunter. I was not as impressed with the acting ability of the girl who portrayed Evie (who I believe also wrote the story originally) but she does look the part.The only issue I had with the movie is actually the way it was marketed. It was targeted as something you should watch with your teenagers. I don't agree with that assessment but I do think people should realize that the adults in the movie are not your typical \\"middle-class\\" family. There is more going on than an out of control teen."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie, must watch at least once","review":"I see that some people have called this film, \\"un-realistic\\", \\"over-dramatic\\", or done for \\"shock value\\". This is not the case, only the sheltered, ignorant, or persons in denial will walk away thinking this.I wanted to see this movie so I could compare it to my teenage drama. It reminded me how scary those years can really be. One day you're an innocent child, the next you're addicted to drugs, stealing from people that are close to you, selling drugs. Its real and it happens even in the nicest suburbs.The acting is phenomenal and is emotional intensity is high. The cinematography is nice as well. There is not a lot of character development, but the film still pulls it off.Are there a lot of curse words and degrading situations? Yes. But, this is the reality of teenage emotional rollercoaster. 8/10 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thirteen is right on the market.","review":"Thirteen is an explosion of reality to all those parents out there that either know or don't know about what there kids are doing during their teen years.When I first saw this movie I rented it and I found it so good and interesting that I had to a buy it and show my parents and you should too.The movie explain's a young girl name Tracy who pretty much has a hard time with her life because of her parents split up and other things, so Tracy notices that she wants to have more fun and attention in her life so tries to impress the most popular girl in her school name Evie. But soon after you can tell that this girl has deep problems of her own but are never reveal in the movie which makes it more real.The main point of this film is the things the two girls go through which is shocking and intense that you have to watch it more then twice to truly understand each detail.A must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated.","review":"Thirteen plays like an after school special with nudity.

Sure, I guess its possible, but these girls would have been a thousand times more believable as 15 or 16. Its very stereotypical, the \\"I have a bad mom and I don't fit in so I cut myself and destroy my life to fit in, feel bad for me\\" type of movie.

I can understand someone's intention of wanting to try and save a marriage and honor wedding vows, however, this movie is quite proposterous in displaying such. Graham's character is clearly unstable and not represented well. And the subplots do nothing to support the film. I even cringe at the fact that Summer Phoenix (sister to my favorite actor, late River Phoenix, and Joaquin Phoenix of Gladiator) is a part of this mess. But, bygones eh! I'm glad I caught this movie on cable, rather than wasting my time or money to purchase it. The only thing one can gather from this film is...if you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Committed should Never have been Permitted","review":"COMMITTED is pretty much a movie without a story or at least a story I was able to follow. Heather Graham does nothing here that would attract anyone's attention providing that she even could. Graham seems to have flaunted her talents in obscure and nondescript films such as this.

I decided that anybody who actually bought or rented this movie should be committed. The cover should have warned me right off the bat. But I was mildly intrigued by some prurient interest I suppose. I grant you, this movie is different. It's bad but it's a different sort of bad.

And not even a good student film at that. Plus, anytime someone uses the word \\"cute\\" to describe a movie that isn't animated you should know to steer clear.Anyway, it's dull, misguided and a bit sexist. Your husband leaves you, you see him making out with another woman, why on earth would you be spineless enough to want him back? Sure, more power to keeping your committments, but how could you ever be committed to someone who isn't committed back?

This movie will definetly keep a smile on your face whether your laughing at Joline (Heather Graham) or with her. Basically it's a story about a woman who is so utterly commited to her vows to her husband that she'll do anything to keep him safe and sound. All the characters you meet along the way are awesome!! Gotta love the friendly neighbor of her husband played by ER doctor, Goran Visnjic. Just trust me on this one you'll love it. If you don't buy it, rent it, or borrow it, just watch it once.

As usual, it fails miserably. Heather Graham stars as a woman who will do anything to keep her marriage intact. This includes stalking her husband once he has left her. The movie is a complete mess. IT never decides what it is. Characters come and go for no apparent reason. Luke Wilson as the husband is attractive, but he's given nothing to do. There's a romantic subplot involving ER's Goran Visnjic, but that goes nowhere. Visnjic is the best thing in the movie. His car seat seduction of Graham is the best scene in the movie. However, This movie is a real mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upbeat","review":"I don't tend to like romantic comedies but this one was different. Heather Graham plays Jolie a night club owner who never fails to keep her promises. When her husband asks for leaves her, Jolie starts to go to great lengths to convince him that she still loves him.What really makes this film work is the character of Jolie. Some romantic comedies stretch creditably to the limit to ensure a happy ending. In \\"Committed\\" it is the fact that main character sees everything in such a positive light, despite what is happening to her, that makes it refreshing upbeat. Jolie is a wonderfully, engaging, proactive character and I haven't watched such a loveable character in long time.\\"Committed\\" is a great little film."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grew on me, so I bought it","review":"I saw this movie a few times on HBO or Showtime (can't remember) and it definately grew on me. Heather Graham can be hard to watch in the wrong role (bad: \\"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,\\" and \\"From Hell\\" ... good: \\"Boogie Nights\\" and \\"The Guru\\").

I found her to be very good in this film, the only actor that I really didn't care for was Luke Wilson because he acted like he was reading the words straight from the script with no emotion. I find that is what you come to notice after seeing him in many films. Graham was charming, but the scenes with Casey Affleck stole the show.

I still think that \\"Voodoo Chile\\" & \\"Life Without You\\" should have been on this collection instead of \\"Give Me Back My Wig\\" & \\"Empty Arms.\\" I strongly suggest the Greatest Hits albums released a few years before this, as well as last year's \\"Essential Collection.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Still SRV, but not enough new material","review":"Everything you can find on this CD somewhere else, except Mary Had A Little Lamb(which I haven't heard yet).

In the first year I owned the watch I had to have it repaired three times for this problem, finally I asked for a brand new watch and the problem occurred all over again. It is not like I wore the watch doing construction work either, I am an office professional! Very frustrating.Also, the WHITE dots on the face of the timepiece, which have a substance in them to illuminate the face in darkness deteriorate over time and turn BLACK (within one year)!

However some of the characters just don't ring true somehow. Its hard to follow up a sequel that uses none of the original cast, but I think its more of a plot issue than an actor one.

So I really had no idea what to expect but I bought it because 1) I'm a POTO fan and 2) Andrew Lloyd Webber.In short - this is a tremendous show. Buy it immediately.I disagree with those reviewers that say the music is nothing special. I love the music (and have bought the cd). Several songs in particular stand out: 'The Beauty Underneath' (a visual feast and a wonderful song sung by the Phantom and Christine's son, Gustav), 'Devil Take the Hindmost' (Raoul and a spectacularly sinister Phantom), and 'Love Never Dies' (Christine's signature song which always brings tears to my eyes). Don't take me wrong - I don't think there's a bad song in the entire show, these are just my favorites.I could go on and on but I won't bore you.

Sitting there watching this, I must have looked like an audience member watching \\"Springtime for Hitler\\" in Mel Brook's The Producers. If thie hadn't been linked to Webber's THE PHANTOM, I might have enjoyed it as an incredibly tacky spectacle, like the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

Maybe it would have been better had I seen the show in person first, but it was painful. As someone who has seen the Phantom of the Opera musical over 10 times on stage and who loves the movie version featuring Gerard Butler, I was really hoping to fall in love with Love Never Dies. Not the case. Very disappointing to see how Andrew Lloyd Webber saw the story continue as that's not how I would have liked to see things turning out after the end of Phantom of the Opera.

Just for starters, if Christine is \\"the soprano of the century,\\" then why is it that New York is the only place she can come to be paid to sing? And why did Raoul go from hero to zero?

For me, a Phantom Phan, I loved seeing Phantom and Christine together again... even if they play a little loosely with the original POTO ending. It's a great \\"what could have been\\" story and well worth seeing.

Raoul has certainly gone downhill fast. Also, it appears that the Phantom did a bit more to Christine then just sing to her. You'd think that she might have figured out he was a man and not an angel a bit faster in the original. In any event, except for \\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\" the music wasn't all that good, and I liked neither the plot nor the ending.

I believe \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" can never be duplicated. It's one of those things (POTO) that everything came together and the magic happened. \\"Love Never Dies\\" to me is a more darker and Andrew Lloyd Webber hits the darker side nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, poor storyline","review":"I have been looking forward to seeing this play for several years now, and was sadly disappointed by it. Andrew Lloyd Webber does not disappoint with his music, but the storyline leaves a lot to be desired. I will not spoil anything, but I find the story inconsistent with the original, which really bugged me because I love the original play so much.

I updated my blu-ray firmware etc and the problem still persisted. I returned the second one and got a refund. I'll wait a few months and try again.

This was not the quality we expect from the works of Andrew Lloyd Webber. This video seemed more of a way for him to capitalize off the anniversary of the Phantom, not a quality work that could stand on its own.

The progressive alarm is pleasant to awaken to. I like the large D-cell battery. The alarm is a little heavy and bulky if you were to travel with it, but if you want a dependable, non-electric alarm this fits the bill. I particularly like the illumination option so at night you can turn on the lighted display (and see the large numerals) without glasses. During the day you can turn off the light and conserve the battery. I did not have a problem with the battery door. For the money this is a good little alarm clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too heavy for travel","review":"With the required D size battery installed, this alarm clock weighs 8 ounces! That hardly qualifies it as a \\"travel\\" alarm clock. That it would require a D battery indicates that it is a lousy, power hungry design.

It's supposed to have padded protection for the laptop but the flap that closes the sleeve is not padded - which means if the laptop hits a surface on that side, there is no protection.3.

Other songs, though, are blah -- espcially \\"Assassination of Sweet Lou Diablo.\\" Which doesn't make this CD any worse than most other CDs where artists shuffle some crap into the mix in order to fill up a CD, but on a CD where some of the songs are SO good, it's just a little more disappointing than usual.Still, I'd recommend buying this CD. I'm a 37-year-old songwriter with a 17-year-old son and this is one CD we can put in and listen to together (the explicit lyrics are social/political not personal attacks directed toward any group).

The print quality is surprisingly good. While the color is a little faded, the picture and sound is crisp and clear. If you're like me [over fifty] you probably watched this film on television over and over again as child.

At first, the kids were groaning because the movie is so old fashioned and corny, but by the end, they were cheering.

Also, it often gave the wrong answers for multiple choice questions, resulting in such inaccurate assertions as \\"The statement that firms in competitive markets are price takers means that average cost equals marginal cost at the minimum of average cost.\\" It contradicted the book as well, defining the long run average cost curve as the straight line running along the bottom of the short-run curves when in actuality such a curve is the minimum average cost curve, and it bizarrely defined the real product wage as the marginal product divided by the product price. This last error wasn't exactly a typo, because it appeared twice.

I must say that I disagree with her suggesting not to wear micro-braids. I have had great forutune with my micros and they have grown my hair out tremendously.

If you want a book that actually teaches you how to STYLE natural hair, this is not a good book. There are a few pictures with no illustrations on how to create the styles that are pictured. Generic instructions are given for say, an Afro, but no picture of what the result will look like once you follow the instructions.

How can that be, when he has a heart made of stone? He was so cold and cruel towards Heather. And she was no better herself, accepting that sort of treatment from him. Even the local ladies didn't stand a chance against that icicle of an heart. Exactly WHAT did these women see in him anyway?I usually enjoy Nicole Jordan's books. One of the better ones are Prince of Pleasure, Wicked Fantasy, and yes, even the most recent one, Fever Dreams. At least the heroes had FEELINGS. And they weren't hypocrites like Sloan was, using another woman as a sex object even as he was supposedly still honoring his deceased wife.I would highly recommend Petals on the River by Kathleen Woodiwiss, which has the same plot (widower in need of a wife), but with much warmer characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story & characters are good but to much extreme sex","review":"I enjoyed the story &characters but she had to much extreme sex & inappropate words in reguard to the sex .Very offencive."},{"rating":"2","title":"SLOAN AND HEATHER,WHAT A ROMANCE!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the first Nicole Jordan book I have ever read, and I am in the process of puchasing every book I can get my hands on by her.

I know that it is about God's grace for us ragamuffins. Some people will say that that is old news. But as Brennan says, we might believe it in theory, but deny it in practice. We can never hear too much about God's grace. It is incomprehensible, and when we truly accept it into our lives, it transforms us. This IS the gospel. If we take time to really look at ourselves we will see the ragamuffins that we really are. But if we accept what Brennan says, or the Bible for that matter, we will learn to accept and forgive ourselves as God has done in Christ. It truly IS the gospel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manning Knows Grace","review":"Brennan Manning writes an intelligent treatise of the subject of God's grace.

Our group had a revival!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LIfe Changing!","review":"Very occasionally a book comes along that doesn't just provide you with all the right steps to improving your life, but enables you to grasp something you previously didn't. Ragamuffin Gospel is such a book for me. For years I've known what grace was, could define it, even taught about it; but prior to reading Ragamuffin' it was really only \\"head knowledge\\". I just recently read this book for the third time and couldn't put it down. It has been one of the most powerful and liberating books I will ever read, no doubt. Thanks to B. Manning, my life has been changed. I have been freed from a life of legalistic, tortuous service that was only motivated out of duty and a subconscious desire to earn favor with God. If you are plagued with self-doubt, live in the shadow of your own sin, feel like a total failure, or think you will never please God or measure up to what you perceive to be his standard for you, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace- The Only Starting Point","review":"What an excellent book! I've read many reviews and am not surprised to find that people generally love it...or hate it...with not much middle ground. As Madame Guyon says \\"For everything there is a beginning, a middle, and an end. Without a doubt GRACE is the only place of begining, and Mr. Manning brings us there magnificently. The problem for some is that he doesn't move us much further along the continuum ...towards the obedience that begins to conform us to the image of Christ, and moves us closer to the oneness that Jesus prays for in John 17. But I don't fault Mr. Manning for that. For a secular and religious culture that is so deeply infested with a works-righteousness mentality, just getting us to the starting point is a phenomonal accomplishment...well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind blowing revelations from this book","review":"Furious Longing was the first Manning book that I picked up and I fell in love with the profound simplicity of Brennan's writing.

And to fall happily into Abba's loving arms.However, having been programmed and driven by dogma and fear for so long prior to reading, I often lived to \\"make up\\" for my mistakes. I created an identity out of fear of failure, and out of \\"proving\\" to others that I was \\"good\\". The book removed that need and drive, and for that I am ruined. I no longer have ambitions to prove anything to anyone. In some ways...I'm much lazier.

Its frighteningly close to reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Those who expect an answer to the questions volumes 1 and 2 have promised would be solved in vol. 3 may be disappointed. The whole book concentrates more and more on the war between the Marines and China, and nothing else. As readers we have been waiting for three books, and then we only get a few lines of information about the aliens/ancestors at the end. The Alpha Centauri plot in the middle of the novel ends abruptly and is never continued.The good action and story of vols. 1 and 2 has now been institutionalised and the fighting gets boring. It is not conceivable that the nations on Earth would behave like this in face of such an enormous discovery. Maybe this book is the preparation of volume four, money has frequently generated trilogies with more than 3 volumes. But if this is the case, we as readers expect more tension and more substance. This book is weak in comparison to the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOO disapointing...","review":"I loved the first two books in the Luna Marine Triology. Ian Douglas left so much to hope for with the end of the second book. Find out who the Hunters of the Dawn were, a final battle for supremacy in the galaxy. This had the potential for a really good story! Unfortunatly, it looks like Mr. Douglas wrote the book only to get it on the shelf. It barely tracks with the two previous books. A main personality from the first two stories is barely mentioned! The only excuse for this is if Mr. Douglas plans to write a fourth book. By what I read in Europa Strike, that is just what he plans to do. That or leave many readers SOOOOO disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Europa Strike","review":"For pure escapism within the military Sci-fi genre the three trilogies by Ian Douglass are at the top of a very short list. Why I say short is because other authors fail to bring real physics (as we know them today) and weave them into the story line. Excellent work may he write many more!Lance"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fairly interesting scifi tale about war and aliens","review":"The three Heritage books are really just one long novel. It wouldn't make much sense to read any of them individually since none is a complete story. Anyhow, this was kinda two stories in one. A fairly interesting scifi tale about aliens visiting our solar system. And then (as a bonus) the other story is about a war with the UN and then later, China. Together they make for a pretty good story. I especially liked how Douglas explained the science behind the weapons and technology and described the underlying discovery in the 20th century. On the downside, I coulda used a little less marine comradery and a little more about the aliens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting combat, but overall a feeling of impending doom","review":"Mr Douglas is very adept at grasping the essence of both the common soldier and officers' feeling and conduct in a combat situation, his glimpses into the mind of the enemy are also valuable. The technology utilised in space and on Europa seems to be a not too distant derivative of that available to our forces today, and his historical paralells are well drawn, and quite possibly the inspiration for the book as a whole. I was dismayed that the real malevolent foe was not revealed until the end of the novel, but there are obviuosly future campaigns ahead for the Space Marines. Any disappointment at the lack of a neat final ending to the book must be tempered by an anticipation of the series continuing."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Is there anything we can provide?\\" \\"Send us more Chinese!\\"","review":"\\"Europa Strike\\" is an excellent finale for the Heritage Trilogy and lead-in for Douglas's Legacy Trilogy. Some of the alien mythos developed in the first two books come together, but yet again, more questions are brought up than answered.Once again, the combat is fantastic. The story provides interesting parallels to both the Battle of Wake Island and the Korean War (Chosin Reservoir in particular).Despite taking place 25 years after \\"Luna Marine,\\" Douglas once again manages to use characters from the previous two books while introducing new ones. Unfortunately, this is the last time you'll see any of them, as the next book takes place another 71 years into the future.If you enjoyed the previous two books, this one probably won't disappoint unless you're looking for all your questions to be tied up perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real world sci-fi","review":"Ian Douglas (AKA William Keith, Jr.) has managed to capture the feel of what it is to be a Marine in this trilogy. Combined with his talent for writing fairly realistic science into his work, he has easily created the best military sci-fi since Jerry Pournelle's Falkenberg Legion series or David Drake's Hammer's Slammers. I eagerly awaited this book and wasn't disappointed at all. As for comments about the conclusion not wrapping everything up, why? Mr. Keith's website indicates that a second trilogy is on its way, that will take the Marines to the stars. Why wrap everything up when we have the chance to enjoy a long-running series with an epic sweep?For an example of just how enjoyable Mr. Keith's (Douglas') series can be, I recommend you read the Warstrider series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audra McDonald Lifts Quality of CD","review":"When it opened originally the show didn't do well, so it seemed anodd choice to revive.

The CD captures her musical abilities well. I've been following her since I saw her in Carousel years ago in NYC. Well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"This show was a stinker","review":"I saw the NY production a few months ago. Huge disappointment. I recall there was one good number in the second act. Everything else (music and otherwise) was tedious and completely forgettable. If I hadn't paid so much money to see the show, I would have walked out at intermission.I would like to listen to an old recording with the large choruses as others have mentioned. Perhaps that would make a difference.What's the fuss about Audra McDonald in this show. She's a great dramatic actress, but her voice is rather shrill with an unpleasant tone. She should just stick to speaking parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite show","review":"Oh wow! The music in this show is beautiful and fun. The cast is loaded with amazing voices with Audra McDonald shining above all. Her \\"Raunchy\\" number is outstanding and keeps a grin on your face from beginning to end.

Low quality video, and smaller frame video size; poor mp3 low-quality audio (low quality audio usually have less range of frequency spectrum playback, while with a hissy, noisy, offensive sizzles.

I recommend anything by her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MINX","review":"Julia Quinn is a good writer and I've enjoyed so many of her books. I ordered quite a few through Amazon and was pleased with the promptness of getting them.I found the plot a little awkward. It was more like a Eliza Doolittle character -- from a masculine type heroine transformed into a lady. Enjoyable but contrived and predictable. Loved the hero, William Dunford.But I enjoy all romance books, even the ones that challenge my ability to believe the romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just really didn't like the heroine...","review":"My book reading buddy LOVED this book and I think this is probably the only book we haven't had an agreement on.Anyway, \\"Henry\\" drove me nuts!! While I am all for the un-ladylike heroine that becomes a lady, I just couldn't get into Henry's character...she was to overbearing and a bitch and very unlikable to me. I stopped reading the book when I kept finding myself wishing she would get the boot off the estate. I don't know, I didn't feel the chemistry and didn't understand how Dunford could keep Henry around when it was with-in his rights to send her packing...yes this is a romance novel, but I really wonder if I would have liked the story better if she had gotten the boot.Anyway, I'm a big Julia Quinn fan and looking forward to the next novel she will publish, but I can't recommend this book, especially since I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice, lovely read.","review":"This book, the last of the series (Splendid, Dancing at Midnight), is an enjoyable read. Dunford and Henry (Henrietta) are wonderful together. I totally agree with some of the reviewers that the last 50 pages could have been skipped. I thought that the character of Hen, rather innocent from the start, turned out quite differently at the end of the book. The friends of Dunford are funny and entertaining. Minx is a nice, lovely read but is not as good as Splendid, but still a MUST read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly did not like","review":"I am not a great reader of romances and the part about the mistress did not bother me. I just really didn't like Henry's character and found the book quite boring she was not a character I could come to care about. She didn't have any confidence and I think that's why I didn't appreciate her. I know that there arguments why she shouldn't have the confidence but Jane Eyre's life was much worse and she had confidence. Just did not enjoy the characters. But I really loved Splendid."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"This was one of my favorite regency romances of all time..

If you enjoy Minx, definitely check out the Bridgerton series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This was an enjoyable read. The first part of the book bothered me because I thought the heroine was somewhat irritating. But once I got over that, I enjoyed it. I have to say I do not like women with men's names. Referring to Henrietta as 'Henry' really bothered me, especially since Dunford was always called by his last name. That made me think every so often that he was the one being talked about. But really that's a minor negative. Again, Julia Quinn's books sparkle with humor, really allowing one to imagine the conversations actually taking place. I loved the misunderstanding at the end of the book and how it was handled. I enjoyed Dunford in Splendid and Minx, and was so glad that he got his own story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for romance lovers!","review":"Tender, sweet, funny and beautifully written.

Dunford and Henry are both memorable charcters...and their sparring is so entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's All The Fuss About???","review":"I know this is one of Julia's earlier works, but this book is far from being the charming read that others claim it is. While \\"Henry\\" the heroine is likeable enough, sometimes she's just plain irritating. She has a way of prattling on and says the most random and insipid things at the most initimate moments, that it makes you want to scream! I know this is supposed to be a part of her charm, but it's mostly just annoying.Dunford the hero is--well, bland. We're told he's charming and a bit of a rake, but we never really see it, so he's not terribly convincing as a hero.I also agree with some of the other reviewers in that the book was about 50 pages too long. I didn't even read those last pages because the story naturally ended when he proposed to her.All in all, this is not a terrible read, but from what I understand, the author has better written and more enjoyable books to chose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST JULIA QUINN NOVEL EVER! (sorry for the dramatics)","review":"I am so angry at Mrs. Quinn right now. Her books, especially the Bridgerton series, have always been fairly lighthearted and some of my favorite romance literature. Minx, however, was COMPLETELY RUINED for me because she had to throw in an elaborate \\"big misunderstanding\\" at the end. Not a little misunderstanding; her characters had to wallow for like two months because of it. It brought down the book irrevocably, and I've never felt so let down an author.EDIT: Heh, so as you can probably tell... I was pretty angry when I wrote this review. Basically, I was very frustrated because the major falling out between the protagonists was dragged out so extensively. It really ruined my enjoyment of the novel.

It is simply a report on a tedious academic study that produced very predictable results. The 100+ page book is summarized in one page where the author spits out the predictable results.

The first was Flyy Girl, which I found entirely too sophmoric. Flyy Girl was a good read for a teen in high school. Single Mom was an excellent read for a sho'nuff grown up! I found the character of Brock to be a strong one, and Walter was truly a momma's boy. When I was a single mom, I would have loved to meet a Brock! However, when it came down to the wire, both men, to the best of their abilities, came through for their sons. For the most part I liked Denise. Having been a single mom at one time, I could identify. All in all, I would have to say that I am more open to reading books by this author than I was after reading his first effort.

I was wrong. This book was so...preachy. Almost like he was trying to convert all wayward confused women who make bad decisions about their life into emotionally strong women who can always see where they are going wrong, and can stop themselves from making mistakes, with this one book. I tried real hard to get through the whole book, but in the end I just couldn't do it. It just didn't speak to me. There are too many books in the world, to waste time reading a poorly written one.

Besides this Denise also has to deal with a man that wants to marry her, and she doesn't think that she is ready for the commitment.

Most people will find it easy to use. It describes fewer plants than I normally expect a good botanical book to cover, but in spite of that I was surprised at how large a fraction of the flowers I searched for are covered by the book.My only real complaint is that the index needs more work (e.g. Desert Pincushion is listed only under Desert, not under Pincushion)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring on the Death of Rats!","review":"Well, I've not really read this book yet (just ordered it, though, which is why I'm here in the first place) but I'm sure I'll agree on the 5 stars after reading it, as Terry (I call him Terry) is the most brilliant writer of this, and quite possibly the next, millennium.

The meshing of the Death/Bill Door and Windle Poons storylines, along with all of the side characters, was great--at times in some of Pratchett's books I find the dual storyline approach to be disjointed and disorienting, but it worked well here. I loved the exploration of life from Death's perspective--the idea is so interesting, and the execution is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reread it again and again and again...","review":"Read the other reviews for the deep analysis, but this review is just a \\"trust-me-on-this-one\\" recommendation. You simply NEVER regret buying this book EVER. Read it, and you'll know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Of the discworld novels, and that's saying something. Brilliantly witty, mordantly funny...it almost makes one think that life is better off dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"the spectacular adventure of Bill Door","review":"this is certainly among Pratchett's top five books. It's a wonderful work...full of understated humour and philosophical observations which give a slightly different slant to the way we view our own world. The humour is laugh-out-loud funny, and there are some lines you just want to keep in your head forever, remembering with a smile.Pratchett's writing humour aside, is also quite brilliant. It is eloquent, elegaic, and his descriptions are amazing. Simple things such as a grandfather clock, or a scythe, or even just daylight, are seen in a different way after being put under the microscope of Pratchett.the plot is brilliant, as are the characters. it rides along at a fair pace, with Death at the head of the cast. (My, and many others', favourite character).This is an excellent addition to the series, and for fans of Mr Pratchett comes very highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death takes a holiday","review":"Death becomes a well-rounded character in this book, and, in the audio book, Nigel Planer depicts him in all his dimensions. Reaper Man is a many-faceted story, including an odd romantic twist with the humorous touches of theology, sociology, and adventure always present in the Discworld books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best Discworld novel.","review":"While I have read all of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels and enjoyed most, none are as moving and funny as Reaper Man. Pratchett succeeds here in doing what many authors attempt and at which few succeed--using parody and satire to convey a powerful emotional punch.Pratchett's hilarious and poignant picture of the anthropomorphic characterization of Death entices the reader into a false sense of security and then, when you are least prepared, unleashes a devastatingly insightful and positive message about the human soul and condition.While I suspect Reaper Man may be somewhat inaccessible to those unversed in the context and language of the Discworld, it remains one of my favorite works of any genre. It is worth reading the entire series for this one title alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reaper Man by Terry Pratchett","review":"Laugh out loud funny. This is Sir Terry at his best. Swear words that materialise as strange creatures above the Arch Chancellor's head - I could visualise it without difficulty; a bit sad that the rest of the people on the train couldn't share, I might have locked less like an escaped loony!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Apart from \\"Guards! Guards!,\\" the finest work of Pratchett","review":"The only reason \\"Reaper Man\\" didn't score a 10 was because respect must be paid to Pratchett's best work, \\"Guards! Guards!\\" Join Death as he takes a holiday in the country, abandoning the harvest of lives for a harvest of wheat. But what happens to the world when death doesn't do his job?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitly a must for Pratchett fans.","review":"A hilarious parody of action films and westerns. There maybe a shade less Death in it than most people would like (atleast, any fan of Death would like), but it keeps youlaughing all they way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story is Azreal as any story could be!","review":"Another good attempt at philosophy by the leading fictional writer of our time. Terry P has given new meaning to the words 'Reaper' and 'Man'. They now mean 'You won't stop reading' and 'Until the book's done' respectively. If the images were the only things right, it would still be a good book. If the jokes were the only things right, it would still be a good book. If the characters were the only things right, it would still be...enough of that: IT'S A GOOD BOOK! READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing Death with a smirk","review":"Reaper man is probably the definitive work about DEATH, and pretty hilarious to boot. Terry Pratchet does make you laugh about the concept of Death, join Death in It's journey trough unemployment and down to earth living (xcuse the pun), after reading Terry's antropomorphisation (phew, long word, he.) of Death you'll never have anything but sweet and funny dreams about It (nightmares are really something reserved for other author's Imaginary Universes. If reality was made of imagination, Terry Pratchet would be the sole owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Pratchett","review":"Interesting reading in the unique style of Terry Pratchett. If you haven't tried him, you should...Terry's books have great insight into humans and their interactions in an entertaining and off beat approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pratchett is priceless","review":"Pratchett's Discworld series has been positively reviewed times beyond counting, so let me just add my voice to the chorus. Reaper Man reaches his usual high standard of funny, with an extra soupon of depth and insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blurry lenses","review":"It is uncomfortable and possibly damaging to ones eyes to look out from this mask. The real Darth Vader has bionic lenses, and sadly this inexpensive mask doesn't. But anyone wearing it does bear a striking resemblance to Darth Vader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great realism for the price","review":"I recently picked up one of these babies at a Target for $9.99. For the measly 10 bucks I walked out with an extremely accurate, perhaps the best Lord Vader mask ever made available. I am now more than satisfied and you all know who I'm going to dress this Halloween."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Wonderful..Wonderful","review":"Home is quite possibly my favorite episode. A little graphic, but very entertaining. Also, it has been banned from T.V. so you might as well by the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Herrenvolk an interesting plot thickener, Home however...","review":"Considering there are already plenty of in-depth descriptions and summaries of the episodes already, I'll stick to my oppinions.Herrenvolk was a good episode. Intriguing. Any episode involving mulders sister and the smoking-man ahs got to be good. Plus it helps out the over all plot of the show. 5 stars.Home however... is utterly horrible. I was disgusted for a good hour if not more after watching this episode. Disturbing is a mild way to put it. If you have a weak stomach, I highly UN-reccomend Home as a good episode of X-Files to watch. And it's deffinettly not a good way to introduce a new-comer to the series. I would tell you how many stars, but I was too busy gagging after watching this episode to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product at all very disappointed","review":"I got this cap for my volkswagen cabriolet.

It's travel size too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Same as in the Picture","review":"I really liked the looks of the clock, the numbers, sort of nostalgic, but when I got the clock, it is not the same.

(See additional photo.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"While I chose this clock for it's look, I still wanted a good clock to use as an alarm clock. The clock is very flimsy, and is easy to knock over. Also the alarm would not wake anyone up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable - - - battery is easily dislodged","review":"The universal standard for a clock is reliability. The single AA battery is easily dislodged, stopping the clock. Although I like the fact that it's analog with a retro style, it is poorly engineered and shoddily manufactured. Additionally, it took over six weeks for delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work from the start!","review":"Hi everybody,Though I like the looks of this alarm clock (still do), it hasn't worked reliably from the start. I kept putting in new (brand name) batteries, but that doesn't help. The clock keeps stopping, e.g., when the clock gets moved slightly (picked up to operate the light, for example). Obviously, I end up not using it because I don't feel like I can rely on it - kind of the opposite what you need in an alarm clock! I'd like to return it, but I won't because of the hassle... so, at least I want to warn potential buyers that this was NOT a good purchase! In fact, a waste of money. I strongly recommend *not* to buy this alarm clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke almost immediately","review":"I was so pleased by the appearance of the clock when it first arrived. But within the first 24 hours, the sweep second-hand had broken off, and within 48 hours it no longer worked at all. I tried playing around with the battery placement after reading others reviews, but I got nothing. It LOOKS great, but it is very shoddily made. I'd return it but I threw out the packaging. I would not purchase it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap....the worst alarm clock I've ever owned.","review":"Extremely poor quality. The alarm function doesn't work!!! I know it's made in China, but this is so cheaply put together it couldn't get any worse. The worst ever. Just in case I didn't make myself clear....this clock is the worst clock I've ever owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Clock is pretty cheaply made. Front looks fine, but back is cheap plastic. Plan to put a new AA battery in if you forget to turn the alarm clock at 6:00 am and it rings at 6:00 pm. I have never had an alarm clock that went through batteries like this (I am on my third AA).Looks cool, wish it made better."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute, just don't use it to tell time","review":"We love the look of this clock, but it will simply stop running without warning. Not slowly loose time. Stop.Got it 3 weeks ago and have put at least 4 different batteries in it thinking they were dead. Batteries are all fine. They power other items.Something is wrong inside. Battery fits tight so it must be beyond where the battery goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Flies, This Clock Crashes","review":"Behold the World's Worst Timepiece. If you are like me, you are probably searching for a cute, inexpensive but fairly reliable clock. You are endeavoring to disregard the negative reviews and pin your hopes on the positive. Don't kid yourself, and don't buy this clock.As soon as I extracted the timepiece from it's box, I knew something was terribly wrong. It was disturbingly light, even with the battery in. The backlight consisted of one microscopic bulb located at 3. The body was loose, flimsy, and rattled when jarred.The battery being installed, the second hand ticked erratically for less than a minute, then stalled, alternating between two positions. I re-wound the clock, adjusted the battery, tapped, and pleaded to no avail. I earnestly believe it is incapable of working properly.In short, run. This clock certainly won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth to the Adage","review":"You get what you pay for. The clock costs less than $10 and is made in China, so..... it is light-weight and flimsy, but from the other side of the room, it looks cute.

The alarm is not at all alarming - if you are hard of hearing or need a loud noise to rouse you - this is not your wake up call."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crooked face but I'm keeping it.","review":"I needed a small cute looking clock in brushed nickel for our bathroom. This is the best I could find. The metal of the clock is nice, and looks substantial. The face of the clock is pretty. Unfortunately, the face is crooked, turned just a little bit (like the equivalent of a minute or two) to in the clockwise direction. This is annoying as it makes an otherwise nice clock look cheap. Still and all, I decided to deal with it and keep it because I like it overall. I have not used it as an alarm clock so I can not comment on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT as seen in picture!!","review":"The first photo that was listed for this item was NOT what I received. The subsequent pictures (which I had assumed were customer uploads of \\"similar\\" clocks) were of the product actually received. The price is fair for a small alarm clock but it should be noted it's not retro like the photo suggests. The outer design (top button and feet) are the same but the face looks entirely different and far more modern that what I had expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"Clock is small. Keeps good time. The problems I do have with this clock is the alarm is not loud enough. The alarm hand is almost as big as the second hand so if your looking at it during the night (and that light is a joke) you can get confused. I would say don't waste your money.

I love this clock it's simple and stylish, and looks absolutely great next to my bedside lamp. Yes it may be a little flimsy - however not so much so that it interferes with its functioning. Unless you are literally pounding or stepping on it - it should hold up to everyday wear and tear. Besides for the price it's a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but doesnt work","review":"Love how this clock looks. But it doesn't keep time...every week or so its behind twenty minutes so I would not use it for alarm purposes.

And yes, I've changed the batteries many times to no avail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"I read the reviews, but trusted the description. Mistake. The product specs are incorrect. This clock is so small, it is the size of a travel alarm clock. The clock part, minus the button on top and the legs is about 2 inches, at most 2 1/2 inches. Not made well, mostly cheap, fragile plastic. It is difficult to get the battery in so that it will work, I was afraid I was going to break the casing and door.

And this nice looking little clock was perfectly fine for about 3 months. Then I noticed that I always happened to look at the clock when it was 8:32. I thought that was a pretty funny coincidence until I realized that the clock was just stuck at 8:32. You can see that it's trying - the second hand attempts to keep ticking, but something is holding it back...fear? Anxiety? Well, whatever the reason, this little clock just won't get going.

Even though the book covers only Season 1 & 2, it was still so fun to read! As you read through Nurse Debbie and Joe's entries, you relive all the exciting episodes of the first two seasons. In some ways, you get to know the characters more through reading about them than you do watching the series. Very entertaining and insightful -- pure mindless fun!

Yet it also felt intimate, in the way Long Island communities are clannish, somewhat corrupt, and duplicitous.While exploring controversial issues of youth sexuality, it wasn't done in a tawdry way. Less provocative than Larry Clark's KIDS, but more cohesively structured and less seemingly exploitative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ew.","review":"This movie was so entertaining while being completely disgusting albeit not graphicly so.

But this is a wonderful movie about a controversial subject--intimacy between a teen and a an adult. Paul Dano gives an excellent performance and a very believeable one. (He is a handsome young man too.) On the surface, people may miss the point that this movie is really about friendship and not sex and gives a redeeming quality to the older man (Brian Cox). This movie is not to edify pedophilia, or make it okay. But what is wrong with with caring relationship with another human being that doesn't have to focus to sex? I'm glad this film was made to present another reality of life that really exists. I gave this movie a 4.5 which isn't possible by this rating system, but decided not to round up. The only thing I didn't like was the Hollywood ending--why does someone always have to go to jail and/or die to make a movie? Definately an under rated film that should be viewed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie changed my life.","review":"There are so little movies that live up to that name which means to move you into a different stage of thought. With this movie, it connected with my soul, moved me and made me want to live a better life. I'm not gay and I'm not a pedophile (two main aspects of the movie) but if you look through what is on the surface, this movie is about a struggle of a lackluster parent figure, changing between people, who your real friends are, and also toys with the question: Is being gay a choice or something we just gain through experience. Paul Dano is one of my favorite actors from this movie where he was just a kid. Last night, he was at the Academy Awards. It's safe to say I'm not the only one moved by this movie, watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally Disturbing","review":"I found this movie seriously emotionally disturbing and upsetting. Whici is why for me the rating is so low. I did not deal with it well. But trying to detachmyself form the emotional asspect of it. It was an interesting perspective that we don't often see. I think it was effectively filmed and the dialog was well written. It took a lot of courage to make this film. If you find yourself very disturbed by this type of subject matter as I am, I don't recommend it, you'll be sorry you went. But otherwise I'd definitly say its worth a viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rorschach Test In Morality","review":"I actually found this in the local public library and seeing that it was new (at the time) I took it home with some other new movies.

If you're turned on by child abuse, you'll probably like it. If you're into watching little boys masturbate, you'll probably like it. If you're anyone else you'll be sickened.

The first part of his sexual discovery is innocent. Flirting with his best friend, masturbating, and constantly thinking about boys. The second part of this sexual discovery is where the movie isnt fun anymore. An old man preys on the young teen and an initially good movie becomes a sick and disturbing movie. This movie actually becomes very hard to watch as u witness an old man preying upon a young teen. The old man is obviously a pedephile and all of the reviewers who claims that this guy is not a pedephile are obviously sick themselves. so be warned, this movie is very sick especially in a time around the world where sick adults constantly abuse and molest children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing touch of human ambiguity...","review":"L.I.E. takes place along the Long Island Expressway on which many have lost their lives. The main character Howie is not an exception, because he has lost his mother along the L.I.E.. He is severely neglected by his father who is has legal, financial, and emotional struggles of his own. In addition, his delinquent adolescent friends provide the only source of attention, but their affection is built on a chauvinistically skewed male perception. L.I.E. is a unpleasant and disturbing film that provides moments of distress. However, the story also displays Howie's search for caring affection which he needs in order to find himself. The film will provoke the audience, yet it will also affectionately touch them with human ambiguity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally positive news","review":"This is a wonderful book. After hearing about all the things my son wouldn't be able to do, and how he'll never fit in etc. Here's a book that takes those \\"bad\\" traits and shows me how he can be sucessful with them.

I have nothing against Andras Farkas he may be good violinist and his band is not really bad, but the fact that he's been living out of the source of the hungarian gypsy music is notable. Some tracks are good, but time to time is really [weird]. To those who are interested in this kind of music I recommend some Sandor Lakatos' albums (better Sandor Lakatos than his son Sandor Deki Lakatos), the album Hungarian Folk Music with various artists or Csardas - Hungarian gypsy music by Ferenc Santa (is the same type as this one but several levels up).I have more than 30 CDs of hungarian gypsy music and Andras Farkas' are one of the worst.

Having the DVD in your own home to entertain yourself when you are looking for something unique and humorous trust Reggie to get your attention and make you forget your own daily grind."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greatest Television Series EVER: CENSORED!","review":"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin was simply the most inspired, profound, brilliantly written, and painfully truthful series ever to find its way onto television. This was something rare...TV for smart people! Chaucer would have loved this, and Shakespeare would have stolen plots from it.I happened to have been in London and saw Leonard Rossiter on stage in Loot a few nights before he died (during a performance.) He was a great actor, and in PERRIN was supported by a brilliant cast. The humor cut to the core of society's hypocrisy unlike any other show, before, or since, and was a weekly beacon of hope for the jaded cynics whose senses of values were daily buffeted by this maddening world.So what does the modern day Inquisition do? It's been PC sanitized for our protection.END CENSORSHIP! DON'T BUY THIS.

All I have is my very poor quality VHS taped from PBS years ago, possibly 20 years. I love all the quirky characters and situations on this show, along with the catch phrases. I know many British comedy lovers who have never heard of this show that would really like it. Leonard Rossiter is Brilliant City, Arizona. Rossiter starred in \\"Rising Damp\\" after this series; I think the writing for the Reggie Perrin series is much, much better, and the show has a larger cast of talented actors. This is my favorite British comedy show of the 1970s."},{"rating":"2","title":"This set contains abridged episodes","review":"This is NOT a complete series. I have an unabridged copy of season three. It is about nine minutes longer than season three on this set. Four of the episodes run under 30 minutes and are complete. Three of them run over 30 minutes, and scenes were cut out to shorten the total time. Some very funny bits have been scrapped. Moreover, the story would have better continuity if the purchase of the neighboring houses were shown.I have seasons one and two on VHS tape, but haven't compared them to the dvd yet.

There are so many relevant situations to man's or woman's common downfall of society. Too many people hate there jobs(Ha). This show lets you sit back and laugh at the people you know you see everyday at work. The show has been called dark British Comedy or in American terms heavy on the sarcasm so If your the person in the room that says \\"I don't get it?\\" alot, this DVD may not be for you.

I have loved all her other books I have read. The relationship between Lyon and Christina seemed forced and contrived, not natural at all. When they kiss for the first time it didn't even seem real and I don't think Garwood did a good job building up the story to get the reader involved with the characters by that point. The characters were poorly developed, the dialogue crap, the plot really confusing. I felt like this was maybe a story she had written before she got \\"published\\" and then came back later and reworked it to publish it. It just didn't seem consistent with her other writing, like Honor's Splendour, Saving Grace, Ransom, The Prize, etc. I was wondering if I was even reading the same author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book!!!","review":"Well, maybe \\"hate\\" is too strong of a word for any Julie Garwood book. She and Judith McNaught are my favorite authors and I have read almost every one of their books. However, I really didn't like this one. Christina just seemed too loose for me. I liked how in Garwood's other books, the characters were married before they had sex. Christina seemed to always throw herself at Lyon and she had no inhibition whatsoever. While I liked the fact that she was totally self-reliant and could take care of herself, she had no caution, for example, going to the tavern by herself. I either didn't like the characters or were indifferent to them throughout the book. Of all the Julie Garwood books, this one is one of the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!!","review":"This is the first book by Julie Garwood that I have read. I was sorely disappointed with it. At first it was OK. The idea of a white child being raised with Indians was good. Once she gets to England it gets boring. I felt the book just dragged and dragged. It's obvious that Christina and Lyon are attracted to each other from the beginning. OK, then what???? We don't reaad of her father until the very end. All this build up about him and he has only a few pages in the end of the story. And what about her Indian family?? She could've at least gone and seen them. She sure had enough money to. So much for loving your family as she proclaimed to. I just couldn't get into these characters.

I gleefully cringed through the opening sequence of brain surgery (sans operating room). I enjoyed the descriptions of the maniacally brilliant killer. I even enjoyed the mix of sci fi and fantasy with the horror theme. However, this one eventually lost my interest by bringing in far too many unimportant elements. DARK MATTER just never comes through with a punch. It delivers gore to the max and has a potentially fiendish villain, but it fizzles before it really gets to the point. I was, needless to say, quite disappointed.One of the cover reviews for this book describes it as \\"a character portrait of a copletely amoral serial killer to rival Thomas Harris's RED DRAGON...\\" Do yourself a favor: read RED DRAGON instead; it's beautifully written and amazingly chilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the album!!!","review":"For everyone who has just discovered these gorgeous blokes, buy the whole album when you get the chance. \\"Don't Cry\\" is one to check out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silicone was nice, but not much else","review":"This product looked like a much larger pan than I actually got.

The entire game only took me one night of play or a few hours. I'm not a big HSM fan but I'm sure that for most fans hearing the songs and the character's face will be the only pleasure in this game. I would only recommend this game for kids only 10 or younger because they would not really care about the game but enjoy listening to the game.HSM fans might demand to have this game and love it but as a unbiased player I don't love.

The music is great, and as you get along you play with different characters from HSM. As far as I saw, the game (at least in the beginning) is based on reaction.

It is a great book and a must as an ongoing resource.I did not, however, agree with everything Randy says. Everyone has a bias and Randy's own history as a church 'pastor' shows with his seeming assumption that the institutional model of church is the only valid one worth focussing on. I found his teaching on tithing in particular lacked the same Scriptural credibility to the rest of the book with some bold assumptions made.He also lumps 'healing theology' in with hyper-prosperity teaching which I felt was unfair and generalised.That aside, I still think Randy's book is potentially life-changing particularly to Western materialistic Christians and commend him on tackling a touchy subject!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth comes Out","review":"From page one to the very last page, Randy Alcorn is in tune with what God's Word has to say about how we handle money and possessions vs the way God wants us to handle money and possessions.

The commmon phrase they say in this is \\"we don't wanna drown you with information......\\" I see it like this, if I paid 1,000 bucks for a keyboard that's difficult to operate I'd want you to drown me in as much information as possible.

The boot is a little tight, so if you have medium plus calves, get a 1/2 size up. The boot is pretty comfortable given what it is, but it is a stiff boot, not high quality leather. However, given the low price, you get what you pay for. Overall, I think I'll get a lot of use out of this simple boot until I can afford something a lot nicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT recommended for 2 year olds (as indicated on the box)","review":"My 2 year old daughter was very excited to play with her new guitar, but as she reached for it while the guitar arm was wiggling, the plastic hinges on the guitar gave her a very bad pinch and black and blue mark!

Unlike the rest of The Wiggles toys that use actual sound clips of the familiar Greg, Murray, Anthony, Jeff and Captain Feathersword, these are not authentic clips. In paying for a character themed toy, I expect them to sound like the characters. This is disheartening.

Susan has been having nightmares about Rachel, a young girl who vanished in 1889 from a nearby mansion when her parents were killed by bank robbers. The siblings make friends with Billy the old reclusive cousin and soon began their search for the treasure as well as find out what happened to Rachel. Wished I could have dvr'ed it but it was half way through and did not have another scheduled showing. Story reminded me so much of the fantasy stories so popular now for that 9-14 age.

Plus, I wanted to see if it was any good before potentially buying. She watched it once, while I glanced at it every now and then while doing housework. Since I missed some parts, I played it again to catch the parts I missed even though I wasn't very impressed with what I saw. As I put the DVD in the 2nd time, my dd said, \\"No, not this one again!\\" Obviously, my 3 yo has good taste too! We own the 2 original movies, and a few DVD's of the episodes from the 80's and she MUCH prefers those. She'd watch the DVD's from the 80's over and over in a row if only I'd let her! I didn't care for the annimation style or the story plot. Plus, since when did they make Funshine a boy? I thought Funshine was a girl?! We won't be adding this title to our collection.

Their old movies (as well as the tv series) were very creative and have taken so much thought to make. This movie was lame. The voice actors don't know how to act, the songs were so annoying and ugly, the Care Bears have also developed a hostile sense of humor and they don't seem to respect each other. On top of it all, Funshine bear used to be a female bear, now they've transformed her into a male. This movie is not a good example for children and it lacks creativity! Lucky for me, I just watched it when it was on the Disney Channel instead of wasting my money on it. I really think the animation was horrible, the plot was didn't make any sense and it is a shame that there's going to be a new care bears movie just like it on October 18th."},{"rating":"1","title":"whats up with the animation?","review":"I was a little behind the original care bear \\"generation\\", im only 16, however i watched the movies a few years after their debut and absolutely loved them!

However, I recently saw the new animation and to be honest i was creeped out.

I was NOT impressed with this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew! Be smart and buy the original.

They are all avid Care Bear fans and love the old cartoons. After the initial five minutes where the Care Bears all appear they lost interest. Except for Funshine Bear, you hardly see the other Care Bears as most of the plot takes place in Joke-A-Lot; a land full of grotesque creatures who are neither amusing or cute to look at. Where are Hugs and Tugs, The Care Bear Stare, Beastly, Shrieky, Lord No Heart? Don't get your hopes up for the CD either - there are 3 songs in the whole movie so I'm sure it will be a waste of money as well.This movie had great potential - its too bad they blew it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy, Scarey, made my child cry!!!","review":"I taped this movie off of the Disney Channel so that my daughter could watch it after her ear tube surgery. BIG mistake. This movie was dreadful, creepy, mean, and only a few minutes were spent in \\"Care-A-Lot\\". Care Bears are supposed to be fluffy, happy, sweet, and caring and I expected a very sugary sweet movie to make my 3 year old, a huge Care Bear fan, smile. Instead she was crying half way through, begging for them to let Sunshine go back home, asking me where did Sunshine's friends go etc.. so I fast-forwarded to the end thinking it would show Sunshine back in Care-A-Lot, but no, just traveling back but no real closure for my traumatized toddler. I give this movie 0 stars. I agree with the other reviewer, who was this movie intended for? Toddler sociopaths?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Bizarre..","review":"Okay, my girls, 2 and 4 discovered the Care Bears recently with the Oopsy Does It video. They *loved* it. Sat completely silent through the whole movie just glued to the screen. Wow. They didn't seem as interested in the tv series, so when I found this movie, another with computer-generated Care Bears, I thought it would be a hit. Wrong. This movie is bizarre. Bizarre. It is a little scary, as someone else mentioned. Not at all light, happy and funny like Oopsy Does It. This was darker, eviler. Like this episode was directed by Tim Burton or something.

The illustrations are beautiful depictions of nature.The book is non-sectarian but some readers may find the reference to God as a \\"he\\" to be problematic.

Check out this picture book in the Smithsonian Institution's science education series.

Included in the conversational text is information on various types of dogs as well as their behavior, senses, life cycle, communication, and distinctive talents. Although the book is not meant as a guide for keeping a family pet, it does mention considerations for deciding whether to add a puppy to a household.Top-quality color photographs are a strong point of the book. No captions are included; for a few photos it would have been helpful to identify the breeds shown, but this is a minor matter in such an informative and attractive book."},{"rating":"2","title":"full of neat info","review":"This book is a wonderful introduction for children to the world of the dogs.

I remember seeing it unfold on PROJECT GREENLIGHT. I recall WES CRAVEN saying it was a bad script. Hmmmm. I recall thinking the director was dillusional and this movie will crash and burn as a low budget mess. Guess what... this movie works! And it was low budget under 2 million. If you like horror movies you know there is so much crap out there. These guys at least tried to put some new spins in their writing. We've all seen the monsters hunting peole trapped in a small space a hundred times before...ALIENS, ALIEN, DUSK TILL DAWN etc. But the dialog was witty and funny. Their were a few twists and turns on who died...it's all there. FILM snobs never like anything, ignore the bad reviews. Politics probably kept this out of the theatres. This movie is fun scary and have you on the edge of your seat...okay thats a bit much but you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I saw this in production on Project Greenlight and waited forever for it to be released. This movie is what I like to call a \\"one timer\\". Some of the actors were so dead serious it was laughable. It takes place in a dirty old bar out in the middle of nowhere (Evil Dead 2). An annoying couple suddenly burst in and announce that they are being chased (now we know where those costumes wound up from \\"The Village\\"). They go into the boarding-up-the-bar routine while the body count increases. I thought the project greenlight show was 10 times more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"FEAST (UNRATED)","review":"The movie was sent in a timely fashion.

The film didn't give its viewers a chance to actually take in what was going on. At least that's how I felt when watching it. I think if they'd have slowed it down a bit (during the attacks) more people would have gotten more out of it. There were times I just felt it was being run in fast forward.I have to give it four stars for action though. This movie did not lack any of it. It's worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 99% of theatrical garbage","review":"How could they put this directly to video! It's so much better than the studio garbage that makes it to the multi-plex. If you love fast, fun, gripping, ultra-violent horror (see Evil-Dead, Re-Animator, etc.) you'll love this!

The movie took itself to seriously for what it was... a horror comedy. I found myself laughing at it more that anything, and there was no build up to the action. It just seemed that these silly creatures came outa no where, humping and eating everything in there path.Also... this movie just seemed to rip off \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\", which took away from its originality. I suppose there is worse out there but if your looking for a laugh mixed with an occasional scare then this is your movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great condition","review":"The movie its self is an awesome film.

That is actually what made me check it out in the first place. Unfotrunately I have to disagree with all the praise. For the most part this was just a gorefest which had so much potential and fell way short.The idea of the movie was great. I loved the whole concept of all these people being trapped while these man eating creatures lurk outside doing anything to get in and feed. The only problem was it was made a bit too comical. I was hoping for more of a scare then a laugh. Well except for the little creature that humped everything, that was well worth it. As for the creatures themselves they were really cool looking, once they were finally revealed in the last 15 mins. I wish we would have had more time to see them without their coverups on.Overall I would have to say this was wasn't nearly as good as I expected. It did have it's moments but just wasn't enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure fun","review":"There have not been a lot of good horror movies out in a while. Usually all we see nowadays are re-makes that don't do the originals justice. Well I'm happy to inform you that this movie is non-stop fun from the beginning. There is more blood and gore than you can handle, the characters are interesting, and the action is non-stop. I was not disappointed with this film.About the story:A couple runs over a small monster looking creature and their car crashes. The small creature was the offspring of two big monsters, so they go after the couple. The couple seeks refuge inside a bar, where they try to keep these monsters away. From there there is a lot of action and intense moments. Another little creature manages to get inside the bar, at which point they kill it and the big monsters go berzerk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.....","review":"This movie would have been a lot more enjoyable if they would have slowed down the action scenes so that you could actually SEE what's going on! It became quite annoying but not as annoying as the freeze frame stats on the characters. Funny at first but made me roll my eyes after awhile.It, to me, was a wanna-be Quentin Tarantino \\"From Dusk 'til Dawn\\" esque film. Some of the characters were VERY annoying to me to the point I couldn't wait for them to get offed. *Possible spoiler* The ending bit with the creature getting \\"arm choked\\" was such a rip-off of the old 80's \\"Just Before Dawn\\" classic ending. SOooo unoriginal! I gave it an extra star just for the fact that I was entertained somewhat enough to finish watching. It takes a lot more than gore or cinematic tricks to get me to rate higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total crap.","review":"Horror is my all time favorite genre, so I've seen A LOT of horror movies, including a lot of cult/indie stuff that was well done, disturbing and creepy, and still maintained a good storyline. This movie, however, is complete and total crap. If it were possible, I'd give it zero stars (wouldn't process the review.. I tried).

As far as the monsters and plot goes this movie was not original. But this movie was HILARIOUS. The little captions created for each character made it farsical rather than scary, evil dead style. Each character had a real personality, and wasn't driven by the plot. I didn't expect to see a seriously scary movie when I rented this, but I was pleaesently surprised by how unitentionally funny and clever it was.

The movie really exceeded my expectations and was better than I had originally hoped. This may sound crazy but what I thought was unique was the dialogue. What dialogue you ask? There was a ton of cursing, but the reality is that's how many people talk, especially in stressful situations. I also thought the director really brought some unique aspects to the film that I've not seen elsewhere. Yes as others have noted, the movie was somewhat \\"formulaic\\" but there is plenty of cool and unique aspects. Bottom line is that it was a very FUN movie with some great laughs peppered in with all the gore. I own a copy and recommend others buy it, but if nothing else, it's worth a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome unpredictable gorefest!!","review":"Rent this one for Halloween, so many twists and turns, cool effects, scares, gore, laughs, and you never know what will happen next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Think big, think pink","review":"In this laaarge book you will get trough the pink panther history divided in five decades, from the sixties to the new millenium.

I tought THIS was a sondtrack from Above the Rim, BUT HOW COME THE TWO BEST AND MOST IMPORTANT SONGS OF THE MOVIE AREN'T IN THE SOUNDTRACK??? The worst thing is that I've searched about three hours in the net for the album where these two songs are, but EVERY resource of Tupac Shakur discography says that PAIN AND LOYAL TO THE GAME ARE IN THE ABOVE THE RIM SOUNDTRACK AND THERE IS NO OTHER DISC WHERE THOSE TWO SONGS ARE RECORDED.

I think it is pathetic that Pain wasn't on there for selfish reasons I suppose. For those that have never heard this song you don't know what your missing. Pain is one of the most important and very person, emotional songs of 2 Pacs career. You can really feel his Pain in the song..For Real! The beat is timeless unlike some of his most popular material. I was jammin this on cassette when this soundtrack first came out. I was hoping it turned up on \\"Better Dayz\\" but it didnot. I think this soundtrack is incomplete and by a long shot. Alot of the other material sounds dated now with the exception of \\"Big Pimpin\\".

I can think of no better singer/songwriter around today.It's hard to pick a favourite song from this album as each in turn is unique in it's own way, but if I had to choose one it would have to be the title track, it's the first one I heard and the one that I played at least a dozen times before I listened to the rest of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Surprise","review":"I have to say that I loved the original release of Richard Marx's Days In Avalon and was even more thrilled with the import. I loved Marx's version of N'Sync's \\"This I Promise You\\" it was extremely touching and poingnant, a nice change from the original. I also enjoyed his sweet ballad \\"I Can't Help It\\". This is definitely a musical effort worth your time to listen to. Every song is rich in wonderful melodies and tasteful, catchy lyrics that will reel you in. I can't wait to hear his next work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGNIFIQUE !!!!!","review":"Richard's best CD so far !!! Every single song is great and shows how Richard has evolved over the years, both lyrically and musically.

I have been listening to Richard Marx from the start and I do recommend this fantastic CD ! (as well as the others if you guys don't already own them !).

The shelf's demensions at its largest ponits are: 29.5x72x12, but the actual shelfs are: aprox 25.5x11-which left me wishing the shelfs were a little larger. The quality of the wood shelf is good, but I wish the wood was of a more denser type (I think it's pine). And I wish it had a built in wall anchoring attachment added to the rear of the Bookshelf-it is a bit tall. The shipping and packaging by the company is Outstanding!

Holt briefly addresses the slavery argument, but only as a counterpoint to his own thesis. For Holt, it is not slavery but rather the actions and misdeeds of politicians who ultimately bring about war. Certainly politics and policy-makers steered the nineteenth century to 1861, but a handful of men did not alone divide America. To point to Abraham Lincoln's presidential election and the Southern states subsequent succession as an indication that poltics explain the coming of the civil war (as Holt does) is like blaming World War II on the assassin of the Austrian archduke. Precipitants are all too often confused for causes. Holt does provide great insight into the politcal dynamism of the nineteenth century, but ultimately falls short of a persuasive argument."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephanie J.

Anyone who has done this knows how tough of a hike this is on your feet due to unusual rocky conditions. My feet were cushioned and felt supported in all the right places.

I had to have something, so I bought Konriko's. And I've never gone back. I now have to order it online at unheard of prices because the grocery store no longer carries it, but I do so because it really is the best. It's the perfect blend of salt, spiciness, and FLAVOR.

Have been only using it a week. The handles are not extra long for better leverage. If you don't have enough hand strength you will soon tire of this device. You have to cut the lemons into quarters and not halves. It will not turn the halves inside out. A rim forms that keeps you from pressing all the juice out so you have to flip it over and repress. Cutting the fruit into quarters works but if you are not careful you will get misted by the lemon spray. So squeeze slowly.

I fear the S & H costs of returning it, so I am forced to keep this useless product. I could have bought a better design, in my local Mexican store, but I fear the metal with which it is made.

It needs to be larger around and shallower. I have a somewhat similar lemon juicer which gets an incredible amount of juice out of a lemon so I had high hopes for this. It's expensive, especially since it doesn't do the job. I can't quite figure out all the 5 star reviews. The do show it with a lemon and a lime so perhaps it is not meant for juicing oranges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nor Pro Stainless Steel Citrus Press","review":"I read reviews that state the press squeezes out every drop. In reality, it leaves most of the juice in the fruit. It's sturdy stainless steel, but also does not invert the half of the rind as stated.Squeezing with one's hand & using a spoon to get out the rest of the pulp works much better.Very disappointed with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"$24 after it being made in China??","review":"I understand that things are made cheaply in China, that is why there is no production in America.

No wonder the unemployment is so high, and many Americans can hardly afford to put gas in their cars or food in their kids mouths. I researched this product on the Norpro website and it made me believe I was buying an American made product. Everett Washington.? since when was Washington located in China? The residents of Everette must be proud.

I don't use prepared mixers like Sweet and Sour but prefer to use fresh ingrediants and was looking for a quality hand press. I did not want one of the cheap yellow and green plastic ones. I came across this and decided to give it a try. It works very well for both lemons and limes. The caveat with lemons is that the huge ones are too big. Enough force can be exerted that you get all the juice out of the fruit. The citric acid has not marred the stainless steel. It is not the cheapest squeezer but I would buy it again. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Efficient and effective","review":"Works better when you take the time to cut off the rind. Without the hard rind the juice press can more effectively and with a lot less hand pressure squeeze out the juice from lemons and limes. It only takes me a couple of minutes to shave of the hard rind and expose the soft pith with a sharp ceramic paring knife. The high quality stainless steel construction makes it durable and easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"heavy duty KISS juicer","review":"Keep It Stupid Simple heavy duty stainless steel juicer, works well, get it.Replaces a similar design design plastic one which broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Juicer!","review":"I don't care where it's made, it works great.

(10second to juice it, quick press)* lots of juice (it looks like it provides more juice than the electric reamer juicer)* Nice looking (Something you could keep out for display, but actually useful as well)The only disadvantages I can see are:* Would be nice to have a bigger one to also use for large oranges/ Grapefruit* The metal isn't as thick as the picture looks- seems strong enough thoughI would definitely recommend this over an electric citrus juicer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Juice Press","review":"I use this every morning for my warm lemon water and cayenne and love it so far. A big step up from the wooden juicer I was using before!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a handy tip for squeezing","review":"This isn't immediately obvious, and indeed somewhat counter-intuitive, so I thought I would share. To prevent the juice from squirting up into your eyes, and to achieve proper extraction, you need to place the lemon or lime half with the cut side pointed down into the press, not up facing you, which would seem to fit better. The squeezer will get every last drop out, and in the process invert the skin of the citrus inside out, leaving you with only the skin and no juice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might serve as a good grape press, but.....","review":".....it's definitely not sturdy enough for frequent use on lemons or limes. After just a few squeezes the handle bends to the point where it will no longer completely extract all of the juice. In fact, in order to effectively squeeze out all the juice, it's necessary to, after squeezing the first lemon pile a second lemon on top of the first and squeeze again. It takes three limes to achieve the same result. The handle can be bent back into position, of course, but that only lasts a few squeezes and then it's back to bending again. It's hard to count the number of times over the two years or so I've owned it that I've had to mount the thing in a vise and bend the handle back to where it should be.PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ACTUALLY EXPECT IT TO WORK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Citrus Press","review":"This is an excellent product. I am a little arthritic, but find it easy to use due to the weight and balance. Using thin skinned lemons makes them easier to squeeze, however.

Sturdy construction is a major plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norpro Stainless-Steel Citrus Juice Press","review":"Buying this juice press was the best decision I have made in a very long time. It works much better than anything I have ever used before. The long handles make it very easy to squeeze anything to the last drop without a mess. The stainless-steel will last a lifetime and more. Can't imagine anything comparing with this wonderful tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this juicer!","review":"I don't know why it took me so long to buy this juice press...wish I'd done it months ago. Great weight, size, and workmanship--and it's very comfortable in the hand. Perfect for those times when you just need the juice of a lime or lemon or two (in fact, lately everything is getting a dose of citrus). Also does small oranges. I make a lot of Thai, Mexican, Indian, Mediterranean, and Costa Rican food, and all my own salad dressings. Never going to be without this user-friendly juicer again!2/22/12 update: Used it for the zillionth time yesterday and I'm still impressed.

Unfortunately, Quigley's own book, Tragedy and Hope, lacks even one footnote of corroborating evidence!Readers who want to know about the Round Table and the CFR are well-advised to try a different approach -- do your own research.

This book provides six different girls as examples and explores how they arrange their rooms, their clothing, cosmetics, kimono-style, whether they prefer a bath or shower, what they wear to bed, and many other details (there are even examples of how they paint their nails!). Almost all of this is illustrated in detailed, full-color images, many of which are looking through more than once.Overall, this is more of a guide for a for someone who has already grasped the basic drawing concepts of manga.

There are some of the girl's stuffs ( so that you don't know really and exactly ) And my favourite part is \\"the 10 musts in bishojo character design\\".

She's written another brilliant novel that touched this reader on a deeply emotional level. While correctly classified as a family/medical drama and not a romance novel, it was sweetly romantic in its hopeful and life-affirming message. The vividly described details brought the setting and situation to life, making them very real and tangible. I adored Lainey: Her tenderness, her strength, her unwavering belief and faith, her devotion and level of commitment, her coping mechanisms. Evie and Alice were such wonderfully supportive characters. It was fascinating to be able to \\"listen in\\" on Jay's thoughts while he was in the coma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic and moving","review":"This is one of the few books that have brought me to tears... tears rolling down my face, dripping across my nose and onto my pillow. Elizabeth Berg never handles a situation like you'd think it would (or probably should) be; she handles it in the way in which it would truly happen. What would I really think if my husband were in a coma? No really, what would I be THINKING? It's an incredibly complicated concept, even more heart-wrenching than other books about actual death that I've read. She has a wonderful, intimate way of bringing the same hurt, confusion and intensity of emotions her characters experience into the mind and heart of her readers. It's a very genuine thing that keeps me reading her stories with open ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I thought that I had read everything that Elizabeth Berg has written. This is one that I missed. I enjoyed it immensely. It's one of those books that made me sad when it ended. This book is unlike any book that I've read for entertainment.

Elizabeth Berg has a way of making her characters seem so real, as if they would be someone that you know or would like to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Draggy prose or excessive introspection?","review":"The author has Lainey spending too much time revising her inner thoughts. There is excessive introspection, and her dialogs with the ghost woman seem really forced at times. Also, the side-story (her neighbor's affair) is distracting and quite frankly, a bit corny.Another point that annoyed me was Lainey's visit to the man whose wife was also in a coma. Lainey, who subtlety is portrayed as unselfish, borderline holy, passes some serious negative judgement on this guy. Why? Why jump on the moral high horse now?In summary: somewhere between contrition and a made for TV movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as moving the second time I read it","review":"What a beautiful love story, and what an amazing gift of descriptive narrative Elizabeth Berg has.

There he remains in a coma. Lainey brings Jay's favourite things from home with the hope that scents, sounds, smells and feel of familiar things will help him come out of the coma.The book seems to drag on forever and the characters have absolutely no substance or realistic quality. They remind me of wind-up toys going through the motions (maybe that is what prompted the title, \\"Range of Motion?)and feeling nothing. Lainey's best friend, Alice, adds nothing to the book and the ghost of a woman who previously lived in Lainey's home is just too bizarre and far-fetched to be believable.

His preaching style was unique, powerful and pointed. He was a master at turning a phrase, using humor to set up a point and then driving the point home like a sharp two edged sword.Every Christian should read Vance Havner. His sermons are as fresh today as the day when they were written. Dennis Hester has done the Christian community and the church a favor by working to get these sermons in print.If you love A.W. Tozer, you'll love Vance Havner. He was one of God's gift to the church in the 20th century. His ministry and his preaching needs to be heard in the 21st century. I hope this is the first in a series of books of sermons because Havner had much to say - more than can be contained in one single book.Michael Catt"},{"rating":"2","title":"When God Breaks Through","review":"I am only half way through this book, but it has stirred me from the beginning.

It's the first book I've read by the author and I am now inspired to read more. There are few really insightful books out there on Voodoo and this is one of them. It begins in Jamaica, recounting her experiences there but then quickly moves to Haiti. The section on Haitian politics of the time was the least interesting section of the book. It is brief however, and she quickly moves on to the Haitian people, Voodoo as a religion, and secret societies.This is a crucial work in the study of zombies as well. Zora met with one and photographed her for the book. She also provides valuable insight into the phenomenon of possession as well.For an outsider, it is difficult to understand the intricacies of Voodoo. This book is an excellent place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinly veiled nationalist revisionism of the Balkans","review":"After reading this book it is not hard to understand why Tudjman is considered the foremost ideological hardliner among the multitude of former-Communist-turned-nationalist leaders. Facts are often doubtful and interpretations have frequently been ammended or changed to suit current conveniences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!","review":"Croatian version of this book shows real Mr. Tudjman who uses words and phrases that nobody understands (probably including himself, too).

It takes place in Whitby Ontario during the Second World War. I live in Whitby, so I recognised some of the places in the book. This is the first book I've read by Eric Walters.

His work is an intellectual treat not to be missed, even if you think you disagree with him. If you are curious about Rorty's ideas and have some taste for philosophy, this is the book to read first. Having read all of his book length works and compilations of papers as they have appeared, I can recommend this as giving the best overview and summary. In particular the first several chapters are the best available summary of his current thinking, and a very stimulating encapsulation even for those who have been immersed for some time in this man's work and the reemergence of pragmatism. If you start with this book and read no more than this, you will have a good summary of his ideas. If you find it interesting and want more, you can begin reading his other works and have this as a touchstone of his current views."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Development Thinkers and Practitioners...","review":"Although Rorty calims that this book is for a 'normal' audience, it is not. The text requires knowledge or, to say the least, familiarity with philosophy. I found myself lost more frequently than I would have liked, possibly missing out on a copule important implications of the author's ideas. Still, from the point of view of a development practitioner, his ideas about human solidarity as the zenith of human achievements are powerful and innovative. They provide a cohesive view of development that can serve as the missing link between the apparently contradicting views of anthopologists, economists (Hirschman, Rostow, Lewis, Rodrik, North) and other social 'thinkers' (Brenner, Khan, Marx, Sen, David Landes... etc.). Highly recommended for those interested in development... even if the philosophical jargon looses you a bit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst film ever made","review":"This has to be the worst horror film...no wait the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life, the acting was terrible the villian was forgettable, and if you didn't guess the end, before it ended you need a doctor.

Avoid this at all costs, this is a very stupid movie, I rather watch Lake Placid 2 again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"This film is very entertaining if you like horror movies.

The Carver family consists of two brothers, one a red headed invalid bartender who is half retarded and his obese, useless and totally retarded brother who likes to wear gogles as he kills people. This movie presents the well worn plot of 4 very unlikable 20 somethings who stop their pointless roadtrip long enough to cross the 2 retarded serial killers. The end result is lots of blood and over the top gore with very little plot or empathy derived from the audience. I found myself nodding off on a couple of occasions during the movie which proves that ripping off a man's package with pliers isn't enough to cover for bad moviemaking and predictable crap acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Bloody","review":"I enjoyed this movie quiet a bit.

Extremely boring, bad acting, no plot to speak of, and the list goes on and on. Some of the torture scenes are interesting at most, but alot of this stuff has been done in movies like \\"Saw\\" and \\"Hostel\\". I've read some of the other reviews and for the life of me, I can't figure out why some of you are giving this movie 3 or 4 stars. You've obviously not seen a decent horror movie before. If you really want to see some good, and I mean Good horror movies check out Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original), Wrong Turn (If your into the hillbilly stuff), and House of 1000 Corpses.

I personally don't want to find out. I'm always on the lookout for weird and disturbing slasher flicks and Carver did not disappoint. It's your basic kids in the wood getting hacked up by the locals, sure, but it's got a little something more to it. It's a bit smarter than the average micro-budget horror film. The gore FX were truly cringe-worthy, and there was some real suspense in moments. It also had a heightened style through most of it that you don't get in a lot of these straight to DVD jobs.All that said... it's got its flaws. Plenty of them really, from a few technical aspects to some hit or miss acting. However, I think its good points were enough to outweigh most of these, and I quite enjoyed it overall. Definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Running Finger Nails","review":"on a blackboard, is how some of the scenes make me feel in this film. Awesome horror. It's up there with Hostel.

Heck, they don't even sound Cuban. The CD was recorded in the Nanary Isles, which may explain the poor choice of backup singers. Totally unauthentic.They sing too fast, and poorly at that.El Guyabero and his tres are great, as always. But adding that noise in the background (it's not fitting to call the background music, as it detracts grom the real music played by Faustino) is criminal.Get \\"El Guayabero\\" (that's the cd's title) which is far more authentic.

It is very predictable with little character development. There are turns it could take or possible surprises, but it is a typical romance novel with very little real BDSM happening.

If you are looking for a shocking and arousing BDSM book, this may not be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's better books out there","review":"This book came highly recommended, but I did not enjoy it at all. I found it very unrealistic. The heroine was supposed to be an intelligent woman, she never appeared that way to me at all.

Definitely not worth looking at anything else by the author in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Hot","review":"One of the reviewers said she couldn't understand why these two fell in love. I think the story explains this well. Kris and Jack have both been attracted to each other for sometime, but have thought they were not good enough for the other. The island resort provides the opportunity to explore this attraction. Ms Black writes alpha males very much like Ms Feehan does. They are possessive, aggressive and passionate. Jack definitely fits the bill. Kris enjoys playing the submissive for Jack, but only for Jack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"This was on a recommended list for bdsm romance, but the bdsm was practically nonexistent. If the book were longer, or free, I would have given it a higher rating, though. It's a very short read, not giving much time for any character development or to even become attached to them. The sex was okay but nothing special, though it had the feel that if the author put a little more effort it could have been very hot. Jack referring to his member as 'him' was a little weird, as well, and pulled me out of what was going on. Overall, though, it would have been a good read if it were longer and more fleshed out, or at least had a lower price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a keeper...","review":"The characterization is extremely limted.

Check this one out if you like your erotica with a little love and tenderness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not great","review":"I was surprisingly impressed by this book.It's enticingly fantastical, you do have to suspend your disbelief for this one.

Dates, directions, system topology, and more...nothing jibes with the actual facts -- even such seemingly minor things as referring to Washington DC as a \\"state capitol\\" when I think that many people are under the impression that it is the national capital of the USA...or referring to Ontario as a state when many in Canada, and elsewhere, believe it is still a province.

While at camp, I had the opportunity to read several books that were in the camp \\"library\\". This is one of 3 Len McDougal books I read during my stay. I was disappointed in this book as I feel the author was not all that isolated and in fact had way to many modern tools and conveniences at his disposal. Being able to drive into town at will was just too much. I don't think the early homsteaders had that choice. Modern firearm, tools, and other top of the line supplies made his \\"adventure\\" so much more pleasant that it was for those who had to do it for real. Had he stuck to the tools and hardships of others before him then I might have been impressed.One thing I noticed is someone mentioned in the book actually has a review here too, in fact a number of reviews of Lens books.

After playing with the doll 3 OR 4 times the doll appeared very dirty and you CAN NOT clean this material. To top it off my daughter was fascinated by the squishy/rubbery head and was constantly pulling at facial features, she pulled on the nose and it came right off!! There is no way to fix this.

The face is a lint magnet. The dog walks by and the doll needs a bath. It is not interactive. It just goes through a babble, crying, staring cycle.

Holly Hunter is always a 'hoot', but her role is especially funny when paired with Robin Williams. Great casting and great fun!Chrissy K. McVay - Author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Comedy","review":"This dark comedy starring Robin Williams is actually pretty entertaining. I don't know what expectations some people may have had for this, but I didn't really expect much, and I was therefore pleasantly surprised. Tim Blake Nelson is particularly funny in his unfortunately small role in the film. Giovanni Ribisi does well with the role of the insurance claims investigator. If you are expecting a typical Robin Williams comedy, or even something along the lines of his roles in Insomnia or One Hour Photo, you will be disappointed. This movie is nothing like those roles, and if dark comedies are not up your alley, don't bother. If you have enjoyed other dark comedies, such as Death to Smoochy and Fargo, I don't think Big White is as good as those, but it is definitely funny and especially worth the low price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a kid but this movie was made by one","review":"Terrible acting. Whoever said Christopher Lambert can act should be forced to watch this movie over and over again until the truth is made quite clear: HE CANT ACT. Take what could have been a great movie like \\"The Sicilian\\" where Lambert plays the title role. He is so bad and so unconvincing as the character. I laughed out loud when he tried being emotional because he completely failed at it. As far as this movie goes Lambert sounds like he has laryngitis through the whole movie (even more so than his other films). He has the same expression through the whole movie. I was expecting a bad movie but this is really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar, hasty adaptation of a decent novel","review":"The Heat of Ramadan, Steven Hartov's first novel, deserved a better film adaptation than this low budget, poorly edited disappointment.

Also odd, the entire book is lacking for CIA or FBI references and stories, something that played a great role in Cohen's life. However, at the time it was written, it followed the pattern of mob bios with one exception - Mickey Cohen was behind its publication, something unusual for a mob boss, almost unheard of and criticized by his cronies around the world. Still, it is often referenced as one of the only books available that pretend to show Cohen's voice, excepting Hollywood's Celebrity Gangster, The Incredible Life and Times of Mickey Cohen, by Brad Lewis, a newer take published in 2008."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect companion to \\"Sounds of Summer\\"","review":"If this had included the songs \\"Girls on the Beach\\" and \\"Caroline, No\\" it would have been perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Of Summer It's Not","review":"Don't be confused by references to the great Beach Boys CD \\"Sounds of Summer.\\" Although the tunes are extremely well remastered and edited for excellant sound quality, they are much more obscure then the songs on \\"Sounds of Summer.\\" I am a Beach Boys fan and I only recognized a third of the tunes on this CD.

I tossed these 2 PPA cards into the garbage, and replaced them with an IOGEAR Model GIC251U. This card works great, and is made to USB standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I can only agree with the other reviews. John B.

Frame and other components are sturdy and will satisfy the needs of the buyer. Very happy with the Quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired","review":"This is one of Miles' best albums. His soloing is inspired and exciting. The sound of the music is fascinating--the mix of electric pianos, bass clarinet, multiple drums/percussion, soprano sax and guitar is still unique. The fact that Wayne Shorter was still in the band and playing great soprano sax solos adds a lot to the music. Despite what other readers have said, I do put this on at the end of a long day to relax, and do not find it particularly disturbing or dark. Compared to other music before and since, it is relatively accessible and conventionally enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bonus Bummer","review":"The original album was great music in any genre. Although largely improvised and then spliced together by Miles and Teo Macero, the finished product was finely crafted, because \\"Miles knew what he wanted once he'd heard it\\", as John McLaughlin said. One advantage of the ensemble playing, is that even when one instrument takes the lead, everyone else fits in behind - it's not one person going off in his own direction for 5 minutes. This was an exceptional double LP on initial release, and the music is still a work of genius.So why one star? The first 6 tracks were a balanced whole. If you want to listen to the outakes, buy the Complete Bitches Brew Sessions. Even then, you probably won't listen to CD's 3 and 4 more than once. Sony have trashed it with the addition of Felo. I'm ticked because I wanted to buy it as a present, but the extra track is an artistic disaster. How soon can we go back to the 24-bit version without someone messing with perfection?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Idea","review":"Miles is a genius, but every genius has a bad idea,and this is very surely one of them. I'm petty sure he convinced this all-star cast of musicians to contribute through his rather weighty reputation, but that' no excuse for putting their stamp on this sonic disaster. Listen to it once or a thousand times,it doesn't make any difference. It just sounds like a group of patients all suffering from some degenerative neurological disorder who have been given unfamiliar electronic instruments for some type of bizarre therapy.Every one of these guys has made some pretty incredible music on their own; I suspect some of the younger cats learned from this experience but that certainly doesn't excuse the sum total when it comes to this unbridled catastrophe. Two stars for the pedegree of the performers, otherwise zero....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific - mindblowing!","review":"Not for the light hearted or easy listener. This music demands your full attention - and it must be listened to several times before you can fully grasp and appreciate it.If you like this, try out the band \\"iceburn\\" (especially their last few albums) - they are heavily influenced by Miles, and are extremely creative in their own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This is an amazing recording showing what miles can really do when set free from the boundaries of conventional jazz. His work with John Mclauglin is amazing and shows what can happen when two great jazz/fusion legends work together. The person who gave it one star is stuborn and cannot get over the fact that this is different from a normal jazz or fusion album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and badly........","review":"I remember listening to this album when it was first released. The hippie heads told me this was \\"jazz\\". Well it really wasn't then, nor is it now, and time hasn't been very kind to this album either. It sounds very dated in 2005; hell by 1973 it sounded pretty badly dated for that matter. This might have been a soundtrack for the Woodstock kids who finally made their way home from the festival, but to the rest of the world this should be little more than the link between Miles' classic 60's acoustic jazz and his fusion classic Jack Johnson released in 1971 and his other electric fusion work in the 70's as well.I can't even imagine buying this album in the expanded box set either. Why would you want to? I mean I have a ton of respect for Miles Davis, but Bitches Brew was a product of its' times, and those times are long gone. Contrary to what Columbia tells you on those stickers found on every Miles re-release....this is NOT a \\"classic\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, you can hear the damn thing!","review":"I previously owned the 1987 CD set, and it suffered from really muffled sound. This remaster improves on that a great deal, and is a lot cheaper than the 4 CD box set of the complete sessions. The bottom end, the drums, the piano, Bennie Maupin's bass clarinet -- you can hear everything now.On the minus side, purists will probably be offended by a pretty radical remixing job. There were a few parts where I did a double-take from the difference. (Particularly some of the echo trumpet on \\"Pharaoh's Dance\\".) I personally don't think the differences matter though -- this album kicks a** through and through.If you're getting this album for the first time, make sure it's the 1999 edition. Buy it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from others... but still great","review":"Yes, other reviewers are correct. It takes a few listens to get it, especially Disc 1. This album is a different style of Miles, a more \\"plugged in\\" sound than most of his previous material.

Herbie Hancocks\\"Headhunters\\" and numerous other jazz/fusion groups that went on to enjoy worldwide regonition.

I hated it. Then, one day, I was riding the subway home and Pharoah's Dance came up randomly on my ipod and it was as if a light had gone off and everything in the music and in the city made perfect sense (it's hard to describe).I went on to explore the other tracks and have really grown to love and appreciate this album. It is very gritty and urban and, like a group of graffiti-covered tenement buildings, is so \\"ugly\\" that it's beautiful. If that makes any sense to you, then you will come to love this album, but expect to hate it at first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work of Art...Ruined By Ham-Fisted Echo in Remix","review":"It infuriates me that apparently nobody seems to notice...or nobody cares...but if you've ever heard the original version of this album on vinyl, or on the original CD release, you know that the echo on \\"Pharaoh's Dance\\" was originally one of the highpoints of the entire album. I mean, it was even mentioned in the liner notes. In this remixed version, however, the echo effect is hopelessly out of sync, rhythmically incorrect, and sloppy sounding.The losers who remixed and remastered this important work of art should be ashamed of themselves. It seems that they completely disregarded the way the echo was applied so tastefully on the original, and have just sort of slopped it on in a horrible way on this new version. And now of course this is the only version you can find (on disc anyway). If they weren't smart enough to get it right, they should have left the track echo-free. Miles would be furious.Why not just paint a mustache on the Mona Lisa?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense masterpiece","review":"This is Miles Davis' true masterpiece.

Miles combined afro caribbean vibes and made a funk opus, cause this is funk maybe Miles was behind the times but he caught up and took jazz to a new direction very few can comprehend, yes this is hard to understand for some if you are not open minded but one listen i caught on,just picture jazz from a egyptian-cuban vibe i can expain this all day but still this ia a classic.

This album is *literally* a collection of random noise, and not much more. Whether not it's \\"music\\" or \\"art\\" depend completely on your definitions of music and art.If the noise a busy city makes is music, then this album is music. If paint splattered randomly on a canvas is art, then sure, this album is art. But be forewarned; most of this album lacks any discernible beat or key. You will not be able to tap your foot to it, and when each song is over, you're not going to know whether or not it ended on the tonic.I don't personally consider this album a work of art, or a collection of music. Sure, the timbre of miles' trumpet or the keys can be pleasing to the ear just for their own sake; but there is no musical organization in the traditional sense to be found anywhere on this album, and like the reviewer above me said, listening to this album is more of an endurance test than an enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD could have been improved with a good trumpet player","review":"Do not be intimidated into pretending you like this recording because you might not look cool. The main problem with this CD is that it is boring. Here's the formula: Take a has-been trumpeter who has lost his ability to play and add tons of reverb to his anemic solos. Add a bunch of great musicians who are all ten times better than the leader, but intimidated by his horrible personality. Let everyone jam without any direction. Give the CD an ugly cover and a stupid name.

My understanding of Miles Davis was that he was great at taking other people's ideas and using the superior marketing etc. at his disposal to make it sell. So many blind Miles fans just can't hack the fact that some of his stuff wasn't original, or even that good. If you really love jazz then move beyond this drivel - try some Albert Ayler or some Sun-Ra if you really dare to go out there. But then this is Amazon, and you probably have to buy a Coldplay album too, just because it was recommended to you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really???","review":"If you are a neophyte in the realm of jazz please understand one thing, the \\"detractors\\" mentioned in these reviews are right. Fame is not the same as quality. Bitches Brew is famous crap, anyone not quite in the same league as Miles would have rightfully been run out of town. There were advantages to being Miles and this release is the evidence. As one character in the film \\"Christine\\" observed...\\"You can't polish a turd.\\" The elect few get it?

So much critical and popular opinion (about 99% positive) has been tossed onto this album that there seems very little left to say, so I'll just point out how LISTENABLE the whole thing is. Despite the complexity and the multi-colored arrangements and expanded song lengths, this is still something you can feel comfortable tossing on during your next cocktail party (wouldn't hurt your hipness factor, none, neither).

Miles and his electric/jazz orchestra created something truly magical and brilliant that weekend in August 1969 and the world of music has yet to recover. Mmmmmmm, Wayne Shorter is soloing right this second....Awesome. To call \\"Bitches Brew\\" the first shot fired in the Fusion War is a gross understatement. To say it's the most challenging, ethereal, frightening and ingenious music ever recorded (just hear Miles' intro on the 27 minute title cut) is more like it. My life has never been the same since I first heard it 15 years ago, and I'm truly better off for the experience. A MASTERPIECE."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Journey!","review":"This album set the stage for a revolution in Jazz music. One that was very much needed in the late 60's. The invention of this new musical form was indeed a challenge to traditional jazz artists and listeners alike. This album also signalled Miles' movement away from bebop and into a whole new musical journey. As noted in some of the reviews on Amazon.com with this recording, some people just didn't like the change in Miles. Those who want to listen to Miles should start with his early recordings and then hear him evolve as some may be disappointed with this. I found it was a change for the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles behind","review":"After listening to this the first time, I thought Miles had gone mad. A few more listens later I still think that Miles was mad when he made this record. The first CD is pure noise. The second CD though is somewhat better.

I have read several of Mr. Lerner's other books, notably \\"Jewish Renewal\\". There, and here too, after overcoming the sea-sickness his prose style begets, I have to wonder: Is his focus on selflessless real? Does He find God in everyone he meets, as he suggests? Something about the tone of tenacity and endless loquacity in \\"Spirit Matters\\" has the quality of protesting too much. Lerner is exhaustive, yes, fine: but the writer is equally: Exhausting.

If you have no need for multiple sized spark plug sockets, there is no need to buy this set. The size I used was the 5/8\\" socket. The first spark plug was no big deal, worked great. After that, every other spark plug that I replaced the rubber stopper inside the socket very easily slipped off and stuck to the spark plug. When you have a spark plug that is located in a place you can't reach with your fingers, this poses a big problem. I ended up using a different socket to finish the job. I would have sent these back, but the cost of shipping to return it would have cost me more in the long run. Also, the box arrived damaged and wide open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Rubber don't stay in the socket and would get lost when sticking to the sparkplug!

I knew him first as a member of the \\"Hellcasters\\" C&W; instrumental trio, but he's every bit as good- or better- playing the jazz manouche music of Django Reinhardt. Turns out (according to an interview in Guitar Player) that his fascination with Django's music goes back decades, long before his involvment with the Hellcasters or Elton John or any of the other pop names he's played with.And this love of Django and the Gypsies has translated into a feel for the music that few non-Gypsies can approach. Combine that with Jorgenson's astounding technique, and you think you're listening to one of the great old timers. If that wasn't enough, he's added a number of new tunes to the repetoir that capture the essence of the manouche style.A must have for fans of the genre, and for Jorgenson fans, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty","review":"Does the job.

No thanks! I'm happy with the direction this album has gone in. Funky and Smooth!On Xavier's voice and the music sounding the same. He sounds like Xavier and the band sounds like Tahiti 80. What's bad about that? It has the same amount of electronic production as previous albums except it simply sounds more prominent on this one.Overall... just think of their previous songs... but funkier and smoother. Less rock and more relaxation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ginger Lacey","review":"The endless courage and luck of this pilot who survived WWII gave me the inspiration to get in to a plane (glider) and fly it when I was 14 years old.

I couldn't have been more disappointed. The conversation is predictable and ridiculous, and the qualities the characters display make you began to wonder why these people would have anything to do with each other. I really wanted to like the main character, Jane Lawless, but she is someone that cannot be related to and who too often has events conveniently fall in place for her. Her actions make you think she feels entitled to do what she wants by believing in her excuses for constantly putting aside basic principles and expects the other characters to believe her excuses too (they do). These are the kind of people you steer clear from in everyday life, in all situations possible, and in books.I had always thought I would rather read anything rather than have nothing to read...I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book","review":"I rated this 1 star because there were no lesser options available. a minus 3 stars would be more appropriate.I am sorry I wasted my money on this book. I bought 2 books at the same time because someone highly recommended them...A Small Sacrifice and Wicked Games. the first was absolutely stupid. I forced myself to read 3 chapters and had to throw it away. then decided to try Wicked Games. the Prologue started out o.k. but when I got to the chapter about Jane Lawless not letting the alarm wake her sleeping woman companion, I had to stop.

Some might prefer more demonstrative playing, but the slightly laid-back approach here is highly enjoyable and sounds totally valid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Disco/House Compilation","review":"Here is one of my favorite CD's from the sm:)e label. Known for house, hardhouse and techno, this label brings many facets of house to the public for consumption. This title although generic at first glance is a fine addition to any house collection. The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because of the mixing style of the DJ (who by the way is not listed anywhere on the CD). Some of the mixing (or lack of mixing) brings this down a notch on my list. The choice of music is very good. The cd starts of furious with some real funky Disco. By cut 4 the house kicks in and goes along o.k.. The two highlights for me are cuts 11 & 12 \\"Orbit\\" and \\"Disco Cubism.\\" Fortunatly the DJ decided to mix these two beats together the way it's supposed to be done. Title 7 \\"Live @ the CBGB\\" is the only one I may occasionally skip when listening to this cd. Otherwise this is some seriously good Disco/House and should be sampled at least once to see what its like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmitigated Noise","review":"This album is nothing but unrelenting noise that grates on the senses. I can't believe an online \\"professional\\" reviewer gave it 4-1/2 stars.

I love these songs, and I have them in mp3 format, so I've heard them all. It includes all the Saints' (Bronze Boys) theme songs... (Golden Heart, Dragon Blood, Diamond Dust, Nebula Chain, and You're Phoenix)... Includes Saori Athena's theme song Lullaby, and the fight songs... This is the ultimate collection. It's a must buy.

INCLUDING not starting software until the light stopped blinking. It blinked for a LONG time, and nothing. I was figuring I had a bad unit, but then tried starting the software to see if it would respond at all. Soon as the software started it went on steady and I was able to scan. Too picky of a start up which is why I only gave 4 stars. The quality is EXCELLENT. I was very hesitant to buy this at first, but am SO glad I did now.

However, if you are like me, and are using it as a workhorse to scan thousands of slides, be forewarned that the process is slow.I have scanned perhaps a hundred slides or so up to this point, but am returning it, for two reasons. The first is an annoyance, whereby the machine mistakes the slide carriage for the negative carriage, leading to a lockup of the device, which requires a reboot.

I was told my Konica Technical Support that the manufacturer acknowledged a problem with the holders. They sent me new holders. Not any different than the originals.

Too much noise and grain, and color loss.

I'd set up the contrast parameters, save it as a \\"job\\" description, and try a batch scan. It would ignore the saved settings use the (too contrasty) default settings, producing very harsh scans from B&W; negatives.As others have noted, there is no tech support.

The characters are boxy and the dialogue is comicbook jargon... there should be little bubbles for dialogue and boxed cartoon images for every scene instead of chapters.I can appreciate the attention to detail where the technological aspects of the book are developed, but there is so much that has been left out. will there be more in this series and will it be more of the same or is there some hope that future tomes will improve?

The product initially worked well, but it broke after 3 uses, and after looking at other food mills, I can see why it broke.

As it turns out - not much. If you look at some nicer, stronger mills, they have a brace going through the top center of the hopper. That brace forms the load bearing axle, then a second axle formed by a free-rotating hole at the bottom for support in 2 places. This mill would only be any use for extremely light duty. Once that center rivet goes (and it will) there's no fixing it.How could anyone give this a 5 star review without using it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with this Food Mill","review":"I bought this food mill and there was a defect (center hole was punched off-center) so I returned it.

Progressive rock? Fusion? I am leaning towards progressive rock. Keith Relf's vocals and harmonica fit on this release. Great musicianship, great songs. It's too bad this was a one album release.

What this album does is take the blues derived hard rock of the 1960s, cranks the guitars, and gives the music a much more crunchy vibe.But the crunch does not obscure the phnominal playing, the syncopated drumming, or the amazing dynamics such as Reef's harmonica on \\"Past and Future Changes,\\" an amazing halfstep workout that uses Miles' \\"So What\\" as a blue print, but kicks strong as a mule, and as strong as the best 1970s metel.Get this now."},{"rating":"2","title":"overlooked 70s prog-rock classic","review":"Some of the other reviews of this album are excellent and far more knowledgable and detailed than I could be. I just wanted to add that many people interested in prog might go to this album. It is quite heavy, with the band's basic rock set-up, but the use of instruments is quite innovative (the bass sound is truly unique, and I believe he was a pioneer of bowed bass) and the lyrics quite mystical, even though there's a toughness in them. There's plenty here for people who might be attracted to King Crimson's Red, for instance, or Peter Hammill/Van der Graf Generator. Relf's harmonica playing gives a really different dimension to the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Time","review":"Had been looking for this album on CD for long time.

The quality of work by Keith Relf, Martin Pugh, Louis Cennamo and Bobby Caldwell is, well, ELECTRIFYING! Relf's vocals have never sounded better on any Yardbird recordings. Pugh is a definite guitar wizard; check out \\"Buzzard\\". Cennamo and Caldwell provide an excellent beat throughout this amazing disc. \\"Silver Tightrope\\" is a song that should be a part of any best of Rock collection!The sad part is this is the only recording by Armageddon due to the electrocution of lead singer Keith Relf. What a statement this lone recording is though. If you like the Yardbirds, Iron Butterfly, Capt. Beyond, Steamhammer, or, many other hard rockin' groups from the early to mid seventies TRY THIS OUT!

At sixteen she was aware that she was being manipulated, and with desperate courage organized her escape, and eventually the escape of her 'brothers' and 'sisters'.

She makes an anonymous call.I was at about page 56 when I was thinking, this chick is awful. She really dislikes everyone. Even people who are trying to be nice to her she's sort of abrupt and short with. It's common courtesy to be polite. Yet, Lily isn't. I get that she went through something before Shakespeare but come on. It just makes the story hard to swallow and not fun at all.I vote to skip this one next time.

But now, in order to read it I have to go through preparations that involve moving my computer from one room to another, digging up a DSL line so that my computer is directly attached to the network, then getting a separate USB line and hooking up my e-reader so that I can read it.I really wanted to read this book.

I almost wanted to give up (but had already purchased the whole series) so I kept going and I am glad I did because it did get better. I think the writing is good it is just that I don't really seem to like Lily all that much. I just can't seem to relate to her.I do love mysteries and just about had this one figured out. I was on the right track but didn't have it completely solved. I will say the thing I love about Harris' work is that it is a quick read that doesn't have alot of filler.

It shows too, in the resulting viewing experience. This version is choppy, doesn't make a lot of sense and makes the whole production look amateurish and completely miscast.The full version allows you to experience the life of Ernest Hemingway, whatever good or bad that may involve. He was a man who lived life hard and reflected it in his writings. In this edited version, you don't ever even see him writing! All the passion and emotion of the original is gone, and the power of Victor Garber's performance is totally lost.I would love to see Beverly Hills Video release the complete version of this film, and I would gladly pay more for it than what is being charged for this shadow of a film.

While the thing might look good in the dark on Halloween, upon closer inspection it is very clearly a flimsy, cheaply made knockoff that has absolutely no business sporting a $30 price tag (though realistically with Lucasfilm's ridiculous royalties, this may well be the cheapest you can find!) Do yourself a favor and if you're looking for a decent sith lord helmet, be prepared to shell out at least $10-$20 more on amazon.

And that's what you get from these stories, small tales of fantasy that are just as engaging as those painted on a much broader canvas. Yes, you get bogies and Fair Folk and other creatures out of legend, but you also get deft interpersonal touches in the relationships between Conor, his wife Eithne, and their adopted son, and that's what breathes life into these stories. There's more here to enjoy than magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bavgate goes hard on thiz album","review":"Cop it while its hot. Thizz knows what beatz to bring to da table wit thiz one.

Such is the case with Savage Weekend. I first saw the film several years ago at a drive-in theater in Georgia. I vividly recall that there were several nude and racy scenes and some fairly graphic violence, as well. Well, if you buy this DVD you can safely play it for the kids because all of the \\"adult\\" content is missing!! Also, the picture quality is absolutely dreadful and grainy and looks like it was copied from a very poor quality source; such as a copy made on VHS at home from a poor cable t.v. service!! Maybe one day Anchor Bay or someone else will give this film the treatment it deserves and release it in the original, complete, unedited and uncensored version. Also with decent and clearer picture quality, too. As a fan of actress Caitlin O'Heaney (aka Kathleen Heaney), this DVD is a real letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transfer and censoring don't matter","review":"Normally I would slap someone who said what I did in the title. Just about every film out there deserves to be restored and viewed the way it was meant to be seen. THis is the exception.

Not scary, not creepy, just AWFUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"This DVD release of Savage Weekend is not the complete movie; it's a badly butchered, heavily censored version.

Movie is well made with decent acting, but if you are looking for an action filled movie exhibiting acts of heroism by U.S. troops you will be disappointed. The primary focus of this movie is the negative physical/psycological challenges some returning troops face. My primary criticism is that a wide brush is used to paint all returning troops as head cases and does nothing to honor their sacrifice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie moved me","review":"I found that I was gripped by this movie from the beginning, shouting at the screen (\\"It's am ambush! Get out!\\"), and ignoring my scheduled project. That has happened to me like three times in my life. The movie was wonderfully well-crafted.I found Sam Graham's review disturbing. The movie didn't explore the themes he thought should be explored. Instead, it explored the personal experiences of a bunch of soldiers.

This film's title was taken from a powerful war movie made approximately fifty years ago, same title stared Lloyd Bridges, Steve Brody, Frank Lovejoy, Jeff Corey, and introduced a fine young afro-american actor named James Edwards. However,this film is like some of the other movies trying to enlighten the public on the aftermath of war with little impact. America has a short memory; right now everyone is in \\"Support The Troops\\" mode. Just wait , once the conflict ends, let's see if the country has the same feelings about our brave young men and women who will need care and understanding.

Why? I have a son who is a vet from Iraq. He had been \\"exploded\\" several times, been in firefights and did things to others that no young man should ever have to do. He came home in one piece but with 40% disability. He won't talk about what he did. In watching this film I felt as if I was watching my son and trying to realize what demons come to him in the night. For those who think you can blow people apart and it not affect you, you are insane! WWII vets will still weep thinking of what they did.For me the film shows that those who are on the \\"outside\\" will have a hard time understanding and helping those that suffer. But the truth is that (and the film shows this) the person has to WANT to get help and deal with those issues.Great film. It will make you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"When they lie on the back of the box in order to get people to watch your movie, no one should! That is exactly what was done. \\"When a mission in Iraq is derailed by an explosive ambush, a small band of U.S. soldiers find themselves fighting for their lives.\\" That happened in the first 15 minutes of the film, and although if you want to argue philosophically that the rest of the movie also fits this description, I don't agree.Perhaps if the company was honest about the film and told the truth. That after leaving Iraq four soldiers go crazy and have to deal with their mental problems, leading to a doctor becoming an alcoholic who rips out his son's lip ring, another invades a business and holds a group of people hostage until he's shot dead, another who lost her right hand, dumps her old boyfriend because of her hand and finds a new one and the last one after smashing up a car re-enlists because all he can do is work at a movie theater.The acting was credible but the movie put me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF I could give this movie no stars I would","review":"As a vetran of the war in Iraq I was particularly interested in how this movie would pan out. I was sorely dissapointed. It was cliched melodrama that makes made for tv movies look like oscar winners. What really offended me was that the story-lines in this movie are the blatant sterotypes of what civillians think of the military. There are so many real issues that they turned into a lifetime movie. It disgusts me and it cheapens the memories of my friends and fellow soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of crudely made, second rate, art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curtis '50 Cent' of horrible acting!","review":"Who the heck ever told somebody that '50 Cent' can act? He is horrible. It is a damn shame that there are actors out there that can't get a break and this piece of wood is getting roles in major movies. He is horrible. Samuel L. Jackson is so overrated it isn't even funny. He gets so many roles and apparently turns down nothing. It isn't that he is that bad, it is just that he is not THAT good. Jessica Biel is good for one thing and that is to show off her body. She looks awful in this movie and she can't act so what is the point of even casting her. I know this movie was trying to make an important point but it just wasn't very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it all on purpose?","review":"I am a Field Artillery officer in the US Army. It's funny to watch films about the military and notice things that are wrong with the uniforms, weapons, radio chatter, etc; but it's usually small infractions and doesn't ruin the movie. I am fairly positive that the director went out of their way to make the most horribly incorrect film about the military, let alone Iraq, I have ever seen. Obviously having correct uniforms and whatnot is not necessary for the average audience, but it was more than just that, everything was just so wrong it caused me to laugh out loudly a few times. The plot was also as cliche and stereotypical as one could imagine. I'm actually getting mad writing this, just don't see it, it's possibly the worst movie ever made and I sort of want to point at the director and just laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the \\"Coming Home\\" movies","review":"There are far superior movies that don't have to do with the war in Iraq or Afghanistan, than this puker (e.g. The Best Years Of Our Lives). They carry the same message of coming home from war better than this one [tried]. Oh, Samuel L. Jackson was pretty bad, as was Jessica Biel. 50 cent acting \\"ain't worth a plug nickel\\" (thought I'd throw that in) even if he got acting lessons from the late Lee Strasberg or Ice Cube (who isn't all that great, himself), it wouldn't help. But when I see 139 of these DVD's on sale for .75 on Amazon, that about sez it all. You'll be part of \\"The Home Of The Brave\\" if you buy this stinker.

This movie obviously takes the side that all war is bad and that it creates unstable soldiers. Everyone in the movie has severe issues with dealing with life after combat. This is not the case with all of the marines and soldiers I know who have been through a lot in service of our country. The movie makes soldiers look like a bunch of whinny, problematic individuals, who are caught up in self pity.

So, not only you have to spend $25 on this, now you have to cough up the money to buy his cds as well. What he does in the included cd is to play bits of the songs slowed down in tempo, a lot of talking of obvious things if you pay attention to the notation, makes wide measure leaps and you wind up totally confused since even after hearing this \\"master class explanation\\" you won't have an idea of what the piece is supposed to sound like.

I would recommend Emerald's flavored peanuts (clearly labeled with seasoning) instead--again you don't get much peanut taste, but peanuts are a lot cheaper. If you persist in desiring these Ranch nuts I'd encourage you to check out your local supermarket for a lower sale price. But you'll always be paying too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like onion flavor and can tolerate MSG","review":"I am addicted to Emerald's Cocoa Roasted Almonds. They're a delicious alternative to a candy bar with the same amount of calories as regular roasted almonds. Note: they are not sweet, so they are probably best for dark chocolate fans.I was delighted to find the plain Emerald Roasted Almonds for my husband who cannot have chocolate. We were both somewhat surprised to discover they tasted like onions. Yes, onion flavoring and paprika are in the ingredient list. I should have read the label before I bought them. I like these nuts, but they're not for the spouse who omits onions whenever possible.Note also: these nuts have MSG as an ingredient.

It works on both accounts! I can look at this screen for hours before my eyes start to feel tired.

The resolution is fine. Details in photos are clear and accurate.

The base is designed to accept my HP keyboard underneath the monitor, thus saving space on my desk.

Brand new batteries wouldn't last more than 10 minutes, no joke. I contacted the manufacturer and they offered to send me a new one if I send back the old one. While Hasbro was wonderful about replacing the Video Now player, the replacement was not as wonderful. The replacement player would work fine for about 1 minute; after that, the picture starts to jump and you hear tons of static. I paid full price for this last christmas and it is a joke. I ended up buying an inexpensive portable DVD player and it's worth every penny. No wonder the price has dropped on the Video now players and I see many stores placing it in the clearance bins!

Blow your breath on the damn thing and it will skip...(see other reviews). The sound quality sucks, and really the picture isn't the best either (but both are suitable for a toddler).

When I called Hasbro, they suggested totally removing the batteries and reinstalling them. I tried that, and it didn't work.

First let me say that my son ABSOLUTELY loves this toy. It makes him feel like such a big boy to have his own little tv, and he figured out within a week how to open it and load the pvds all by himself, which made him very proud. I love it too cause it gives him something to do on car rides besides whine:). I think he would watch it all the time if we would let him.HOWEVER....What has it been, a couple of months since Christmas, and we are already on our second one. The first one started getting lines through the screen and fading in and out within a month of his getting it. It wasn't a battery problem because you could put brand new Duracells in it and it would still do it. Luckily I still had the reciept and Wal-Mart was nice enough to exchange it for us.

If your child is 4 or older, and listens reasonibly well to directions, I would reconsider this purchase and consider getting a portable DVD player. The limited variety of discs available for this player and their increased cost make this item not as attractive an option as a portable DVD player. Also, if your children are fans of Disney Channel, none of their favorite shows are available in this playing format. My daughter enjoyed watching shows she typically doesn't see, but, with the exception of Clifford, the shows were not entertaining after seeing them 5 times.

To make matters worse the sizes vary so that the measurements drift in and out. For example over a 12\\" span each measurement may be too large, or too small or right on making these absolutely useless for measurement. All the tapes I have purchased from different companies have this problem. They all have been manufactured in China where apparently the quality control is terrible.Save yourself some aggravation and don't buy these.

There are 2 holes on the underside of each finger so that smaller hands can fit through and not have a bunch of bulk material. Also, there are straps under the fingers that you can fasten to make it tighter around smaller fingers. And, as the picture shows, there is a string to tighten the glove around the wrist.

While the Tony Jackett, Ginny Binder and Jay Critchley stories were interesting, the rest was junk.

Mr. Manso's feelings about the gay people in Provincetown is made abundantly clear, ad naseum. I wont rehash it here. Instead, he chooses to glamorize small time crooks, drug smugglers and adulterers as the heroes of his sordid little book. His chapters about Jay Critchley, a sort of mea culpa for the hatemongering that comes before and after, don't even begin to flesh out a human being, let alone a strong gay man. He manages to reduce the extraordinary down to the most common of stereotypes.Your best bet would be to get in your car, and head up Rt 6 to see for yourself.

It is loosely put together from a \\"pile\\" of essentially useless information, most of which comes from \\"conversations\\", rather than well researched documentation. The first chapter should have been the tipoff to quit reading. The description of the renovations to a house by a wealthy couple is so vapid, that I found myself wondering why they let the author use them in the book; and the relevance to the rest of the book is so obscure, that it is almost nonexistent. This book does a beautiful, historic town a grave disservice by presenting a skewed, smarmy overview of the lives of a very select group of people who live there.

Prepare to be proved wrong all those who think (like I did) that a book about the Battle of Hastings will be boring.The author has done an excellent job of combining fact with fiction in such a way that will make you want to keep on reading. The battle scenes are described so vividly that you could almost be there.After reading this book I certainly want to visit the site of Hastings, knowing that with the authors attention to detail, I will be able to imagine how it must have looked and felt to be standing there ready for battle in 1066.I thank Mr Brown for not only providing me with a very good read, but also for teaching me a bit of history about my home country.I look forward to any future books that Laurence J.

The story itself is riveting, with overwhelming historical significance. How different would our world be, had the Norman invasion met a Saxon army that was rested and up to strength? We know the outcome, so the suspense must derive from our concern for individual characters. This is the novel's strength and weakness: intriguing portraits of the doomed Harold and an admirable hero, the housecarl Ranulf, are diminished by sideplots involving characters that seemed either too modern or entirely irrelevant.While I enjoyed the book, Housecarl would have benefited from better editing, not to mention decent proofreading and typesetting. There was hardly a page that didn't contain a typo, missing indentation or line space, or some grammatical glitch.

It is well worth reading and enjoying. However, it has some flaws as a book on kundalini yoga. \\"Tuning in\\" is not given, although this is an important thing to do before practice. If it were just a few exercises, this would not be important. But one full set was given and so were some meditations, so tuning in should have been given also. Since kundalini yoga is done in sets of exercises, and this book mostly just has single exercises, it gives a slightly slanted picture of kundalini yoga in practice. Kundalini Yoga by Shakta Kaur Khalsa and Kundalini Yoga for Mind, Body and Beyond by Ravi Singh are much better books for practice.

Even so, this biography does not give a full picture of the president as a person and much of his past (for example KGB) is not mentioned in great detail (that's why I took off a star) and does not give a deep insight as the book implies. It is a very whitewashed biography of Putin. In fact, I don't recall reading a negative thing about him in this book!! This aside, and all considered, this is an entertaining read and a good introduction to Russia's President; but certainly missing a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"First person is an easy and interesting book to read.

It's better with each playing. She is a terrific musician and songwriter.I just saw her perform at a small venue (less than 1,000). She rocks in concert!

I've seen her in huge venues and they overwhelm the sensitivity of her performance.Go see her in concert!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda Been A Contender","review":"Tracy Chapman continues to write some of the most heart wrenching songs ever. She's got it down pat, let there be no doubt about it. But you know what? On her other releases there were always one or two numbers that were slightly downtrodden but uptempo that caught your ear and made you want to listen again. There is nothing here that will compel you to listen more than once. Well, maybe twice, just to verify what you thought about it the first time. And she certainly will not win over any new Chapman fans with this cd. Even in this era of the less bombastic (Mraz, Gavin, H.Day, et.al) rock anthems, this music is just a little too lo-fi. I bought this one and I'll probably buy the next one in hopes that she will return to earlier form."},{"rating":"2","title":"What we need from Tracy","review":"Where you live is simple in its musical execution and, as always, brilliant in its lyrical depth. Tracy is as vital a song writer as America has.The musical framework is a textured, understated mix of blues and folk and, after so many years of quality music, her voice shines through every song as strongly as it ever has.The album seems to start off rather slowly (after the obligatory mid-tempo rocker, Change, to open with) then seems to pick up steam and settles into some of the most beautiful music Tracy has ever done. America, Love's Proof, and Before Easter are brilliant in my mind. There are no weak cuts, however.A new Tracy Chapman album is a cause for celebration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing....","review":"For years Tracy Chapman continues to amaze us with beautiful lyrics and astonishing songwriting abilities.

Another problem was the main actor who kept whining 99 percent of the time. Is that funny? After someone whines for a while it becomes annoying. The story had moments that could have been taken out and nothing would have been lost. I really think that most people watching this movie would have liked their money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"a definite must see","review":"One of the best movies I've seen in a while.

The librarian at Southeast Kentucky's Cumberland High School finally gave me the tattered book. It's the most complete and believable look ever at the daily life of American Plains Indians in the 1800's--how they lived, how they loved, what they admired and what they were afraid of, how they fought, what they believed in and respected, and what they worshipped. And most of all it's a real-life experience with them and the one thing they loved most: their land.

I watched this film with little knowledge of Cash's life and troubles, but walked away moved by his and June Carter's commitment to wrestle with life.As so many have pointed out, the acting in this movie is stellar. Phoenix is one of my favorite actors of this generation, bringing depth and intensity to his roles. Witherspoon has always been a natural on the screen, but she truly shines in this story. The cinematography is also fantastic, capturing light and mood in a beautiful balance.I walked away from the movie challenged by the artistic drive of the characters, touched by the fearful acceptance of love by two hurting people, and wanting more Cash. What about the next 35 years of their lives together? Surely there's more rich material in this couple's history.Now I too shall speak highly of Cash to my children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold, Hard Cash","review":"Despite a glossy \\"Movie of the Week\\" vibe that hangs over the proceedings, \\"Walk the Line\\" utlimately succeeds due mainly to the powerhouse performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who manages to capture Cash's paronoid, pill-poppin' pathos without pandering to posterity or pratfalling into parody. And he can sing, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, excellent, excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"After viewing this movie, it is beyond comprehension to me how it was passed over for Best Picture nomination at the Oscars. It was one of the best movies to come out last year. The acting was superb, the music added more depth to a movie that was full of it already and the cinematography was great. You really felt like you were back in the good ol' days of Nashville.

IMO, it was more enjoyable than last year's Ray. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD TAKE ON CASH!!","review":"This movie biopic merits praise simply because Hollywood Movies these days are nothing but garbage. This film is stunningly photographed, though the direction could have been better. Everything is done at a shot and clip pace which is a little distracting. But the actors and their performances outshine the film's flaws. Joaquin Phoenix deserved the Oscar for this performance in this film!! He is incredible and I feel he was robbed. Reese Witherspoon, is a charming, perky, sassy and pretty June and while I certainly agree that her performance is Oscar noteworthy, I feel it should have gone to Joaquin instead if they were going to choose one over the other. Nonetheless, the performances especially during the music scenes which are fantastic, give us a great take on The Man in Black and His Woman!! Well done!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Movie.","review":"I grew up listening to Johnny Cash - not because I was a fan, but because my Dad listened to it all the time, so it was always playing in the house. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did a wonderful job portraying Johnny Cash and June Carter. I think Joaquin Phoenix is just a terrific actor, and Reese Witherspoon really impressed me with this role (I never liked any of her other movie performances). This movie was enjoyable and I'm really glad I went to see it. Having said that, I didn't walk away feeling like it was this AWESOME movie. It sort of had a \\"formula\\" feel to it, I guess. I did enjoy this more than Ray, but I suspect it's because I'm more familiar with Johnny Cash than I am with Ray Charles, and I'm a bigger fan of Phoenix than I am of Jamie Foxx. All in all, this was a good movie. I wish there was a little more singing, but I still enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They had more substance than their portrayal!","review":"I thought that there was something wrong with this movie. Johnny Cash appears one-dimensional, and the story kept jumping from one incident to another. If they kept a bit of continuity, (like showing how he gained acceptance in his field rather than cut from him making his first record in a country store to being a spectacularly famous singer with a spectacular following) it would more cogent and more enjoyable.I remember Johnny and June Cash as people with more substance than this movie shows. The movie was a poor attempt to capitalize on the memories of these two performers who are still in the minds of much of their public."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 2006 Oscar for best male actor went to the wrong actor!","review":"Joaquin Phoenix was DEFINATELY overlooked for the the Oscar he so richly deserved in this film...He not only learned to play the quitar, he learned to sing and did a GREAT job of it!What the heck WAS the academy thinking when the Oscar went to Witherspoon (she DESERVED it!) and not to Joaquin?Without Joaquin Witherspoon would NOT have won her Oscar!It was the acting of both stars that made this movie!I also loved Waylon Payne's redition of Jerry Lee Lewis.Any old time country music fan simply must add this DVD to their collection.It not only tells the story of Johnny, it tells the early days of Sun Records and the Nashville Music scene.Both Johnny and June are gone from this earth, but I think they would have both said yes to this story..Joaquin to you---I am deeply sorry that you did not get the Oscar you so richly DESERVED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply GREAT","review":"The acting in this movie was absolutely brilliant!

This is an excellent movie with Oscar winning performances by both actors. If Joaquin had not been against Copete, he would have won because he was Johnny in person and up close. I can't believe they even sang! Incredible! This movie is one you just can't miss. You don't feel sorry for Johnny as I thought they might try to portray, you understand him and June better. Great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The love story of John and June.","review":"Walk the line by Director James Mangold (I love all his movies) is a gorgeous tale of the love affair between Johnny Cash and June Carter. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are well-suited in their roles here. The film focuses mainly on how John and June met and toured together through the years and the start of their affair while he was still married to his first wife. Also talks about Johnny's addiction to pills and his unhealthy relationship with his father. Witherspoon received an oscar for her role, a much-derserved award for this talented actress. Phoenix is wonderful as well, he sure has Cash's mannerisms down to a T. John and June would eventually get married and spend 35 years in wedded bliss til their deaths took form. Walk the Line has solid writing, terrific acting, and a positive message that anyone know matter rich or poor can overcome old demons and survive. Beautiful love story, buy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"The way this film starts out and how it chronicles the life of one of my favorite performers is really good and turns out to be better than I had thought it would be at first.It follows as Johnny Cash starts out and progresses to where he was in Vegas and after a show, June caught him taking his pills and then she started regretting her involvement thinking him to be addicted, as it would turn out after that night's show, he took too many and something happened and he passed out, then all of that leads to him going to Mexico and as he looks for more medication and turns out to be a dramatic trip that changes the way he relates to his own performances and his fans.The acting here is terrific and I have been impressed, Reese Witherspoon won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress along with many other recognitions, and Vivian and June's roles are both played extremely well and contributed to making this film as enjoyable as it I found it to be.

The onscreen performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were dynamic, nothing forced or false. The story line and acting captured the emotion and feeling of the time and lives of these people. The music was entertaining and might actually have made a fan out of me. I haven't felt this satisfied about a movie in a very long time. It is well worth the time and money to see this movie at least once. I'm looking forward to the Oscar results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Be Beat","review":"It was a toss up for me between Capote and Walk the Line.

Good acting but the story was just another star on drugs and recovering.I was also distracted by the unfortunate scar on Phoenix's face. I know he can't help it but it was very distracting to me watching \\"Johnny Cash\\".My assessment will be in the minority but I didn't come out of this movie thinking \\"gee, great acting\\" \\"wow, inspirational story\\". When I came out my thoughts were, I'm glad I saw it and glad it is over except I may buy the CD. I won't buy the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood version of Cash","review":"I've been listening to country music since I was a little girl and the visual portrait I have of Cash is a solemn one. He wore black as a somber statement of the state of the world. Sure, he could joke and cut up, but the picture I have of him is not goofy redneck. Phoenix's performance has been hailed as genius, but I wasn't impressed. After all, it was basically a reprisal of his character in \\"U-Turn\\" in which \\"Ring of Fire\\" plays each time he appears. This is, of course, a crowd-pleaser and I know many people LOVE it. I hated it so much that I actually walked out of Walk the Line. I understand that this isn't supposed to be a documentary and perhaps I would have enjoyed the portrayal of Cash if I hadn't already had a preconceived notion of who he was.

I have since been back to view the movie again, purchased the soundtrack and am eagerly awaiting to add the DVD to my collection.

At the literal heart of the movie is Cash's longstanding and long-unrequited love for June Carter (the ever ebullient Reese Witherspoon finally being allowed to put her Nashville accent to good use) and the trials and travails he must suffer before finally settling down with the love of his life. From the foot-stomping power of the very first scene, music is the thread that binds these two restless hearts and what makes the movie even more remarkable is that Phoenix and Witherspoon did all of their own singing!(Originally published on the website of author Teresa Medeiros at www.teresamedeiros.com)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joaquin Was Cheated","review":"I cannot fathom why Joaquin Phoenix did not win the Oscar for best actor for his role in this film. He did an amazing job capturing the personae and the sound of the late Mr. Cash. While I like Reese Witherspoon in the Legally Blonde series to me she looks like a high school girl who likes to play dress-up in all of her films and this one was no exception. Johnny Cash was complex and driven by many demons as this film shows. I did not feel that the onscreen chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon revealed the true nature of this great love affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was all the fuss about?","review":"Another movie that got me with the hype.

By contrast, Phoenix delivers his usual good acting that gets lost in a pretty mediocre film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reese Witherspoon movie","review":"I was expecting a Johnny Cash biopic but it was Reese Witherspoon as June Carter who makes this movie shine. I've been spoiled by movies like \\"Ray\\" where the actor actually has you believing he is Ray Charles. In that respect this movie is a little disappointing - Joaquin Phoenix does not look like Johnny Cash and does not sing like Johnny Cash so it was hard to believe this was a Johnny Cash bio movie. Of course the movie is totally saved by the incredible acting of Reese Witherspoon making this a very enjoyable journey through the trials and tribulations of the life of Johnny Cash. I liked this movie very much but couldn't help think what a terrible bore this thing would be if it were not for the contribution of Ms Witherspoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk the line review","review":"Ordered for Christmas, therefore haven't watched it yet.

Both Joaquin and Reese did a super job. Actually, not really being a Johnny Cash fan, I would have to say I liked Joaquin even better than the original.

Luckily, my fears were never realized. Walk The Line is an exceptional movie (much better than Ray, a movie that always demands to be compared with WTL). Joaquin Phoenix completely nails Cash, and vividly and effortlessly depicts Cash's struggles and triumphs. He creates an empathy for Cash that few movies can rival. Reese Witherspoon is spectacular as June Carter; she brings to light the extreme impact her friendship had on Cash, and plays an important role in saving him from his drug addiction. Overall, this is one of the most enthralling non-fictional movies I have ever seen, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"where's the sequel","review":"Where's the sequel?

I didn't like Ray at all so I was prepared for the same reaction with Walk The Line. However it's a great story with a great ending. In my opinion Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of June Carter is spectacular and very deserving of the Oscar she won for it; to me her performance helps make the movie as powerful as it is. Not to downplay the performance of Joaquin Phoenix because he was also very captivating and gave an incredible performance. I also love the fact that they did all the songs themselves, they did a great job with the singing also. Overall, great great movie; so much better than Ray. I totally recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Bio Pic","review":"My husband and I are Johnny fans, and we eagerly awaited this movie. The songs were good. Reese, in my opinion, was the standout performance. She did a wonderful job portraying June, in both happy and down times. I wish Joaquin could have done a bit of a better job exhibiting the light-hearted, likeable aspects of Johnny's personality. But boy does he do a good job portraying a drug addict. I like watching movies that take place in the past, and thinking about how my grandparents lived through those times. From that perspective, the sets and wardrobe were wonderful.I've seen Brokeback, Crash, and Walk the Line... and though they all had their merits I strongly feel Walk the Line should have been nominated for Best Picture, and should have won. It is the best of the three, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cashes in a Silver","review":"Johnny Cash may be known for many things; music, outlaw/rebel personas and more, but his love is as concrete and true as all his other images. The \\"Man in Black\\" with a \\"Freight-Train Voice\\" displays his life-time joys and sorrows that propelled him up inot the music status of Icon. Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Pheniox both gave a Grammy knock-out preformance, that either has yet to top (I think Joaquin was still in character during Lettermen), in this true tale of love, addiction and music.

Joaquin Phoenix is Johnny Cash without a doubt and Reese Witherspoon makes a charmingly sassy June Carter (not to mention they sing all the songs themselves and sound really good to boot). They should both get Oscar nominations along with the film itself. I liked Ray as well, but Walk the Line is a better film in my opinion.

Immense artistic talent mixed with shyness and a desire to make up for past faults, all within the context of the rise of rock and roll, makes Cash's a story like no other, except for perhaps that of Elvis.

The film is good and at times the film is great but at times you want more with the film. The film is about Johnny Cash and his love for June Carter but that's about it. I found there could of been more of a story then there was. the acting is good from Joaquin Phoenix who doserves his oscar nod and he might win, Reese Witherspoon shines (she shines in everything) and she might win an oscar too (I found soem of the other actress in the catoagory better then her).

Here are some of the things I didn't like about this movie.1- Struggle between man and woman relationship. This movie comprised too much of Reese Witherspoon's character. I would have preferred the focus remain on his music and the birth of his fame and events to follow.2- I would have liked if the movie went beyond the 60's and looked at him in the 1980's and so forth.3- I didn't think the father and son relationship was focused enough on and why did Johnny Cash not better defend himself against a heartless dad? His dad was not a good dad but he is not even in the middle of the picture, not until the end.4- Reese Witherspoon , though a good actor, has become rather dull in her approach to acting and quite predictable. I was getting annoyed with her about mid way thru the script.Sorry, but this movie isn't as good as those who \\" walk the line\\" say it is. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh? What?","review":"My thoughts exactly. The pacing of movie was terribly slow. I was moved a single time during the movie: when John's father cruelly told him that it should have been him who died.

Johnny Cash was more talented that this movie protrays! June Carter was the angel that probably saved his life and made him famous so why not dig and little deeper into their marriage. Come on HOLLYWOOD! He gave much more to entertainment than this movie leads one to believe. Why not start with the beginning and end with the respectable life he led instead of just the beginning of his career. Can't believe his son, John Carter Cash would let people by with this one!

I thought this Johnny Cash dude was some rebel, troublemake, and a man in black that has bad intentions. To look within this movie is to look within a man that I would of never guess him to be. How through all the trouble he went through he survived. \\"You're saying I don't believe in God?\\" Didn't even know he did Gospel tunes! Johnny story is a great story of survival. I even bought Gospel Road by Johnny Cash. I must say that this is a man that I wasn't expecting. He has great character and inspiring intentions. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job! Reese, also a great job! This movie is awesome all around!!! Hope you all enjoy this movie as much as I did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!","review":"I LOVED this movie!!! It was powerful and so great! I truly Loved the performances by Resse Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix they were definetly Oscar worthy, in which I HOPE they both win for their pending nominations!!!

All of us loved it. I had a hard time buying Joaquin Phoenix as Cash at first. But as the movie rolled I saw think he captured Cash very well. And Reese Witherspoon astonished,us all with a superb performance. We loved the sanpshots of Elvis and others including Jerry Lee Lewis. See it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie worth watching!","review":"Walk the Line sheds light on the life of the well-known singer Johnny Cash.It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.The only major setback is in relation to Ginnifer Goodwin who is not that great as Vivian Cash.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent....","review":"I throughly enjoyed this biopic...Joaquin and Reese were beyond awesome in this, I love their singing!

I highly reccomend buying this movie for yourself, and for anyone you know that is, or has ever been a fan of Johnny Cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!","review":"This is an astounding movie and portrayal of Johnny Cash and his wife June. Yes, this movie is a biography, but many may not know-unless you've seen it- that it's a beautiful love story. The love these two people shared was incredible and amazing! It's brought to magnificent life by Phoenix and Witherspoon who both deserve every award under the son for their performances.They both sang the songs-no mouthing the words to the original recordings- which makes their performances even better.I can't stress how great this movie really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk The Line Review","review":"This movie is the best movie ever!!

Both Reese and Joaquine do an amazing job portraying Johnny Cash and June Carter. However, while this music is what i prefer, its not even close to the original Johnny Cash and June Carter songs. If you don't mind that the music is totally different, than by all means enjoy this great movie of a musical genius's life, cocaine and all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extras Disc is Terrible - just buy the cheaper movie only edition","review":"The \\"extras\\" are all out-takes and posed pictures of Joaquin and Reese in-character. Very disappointing as some historic pictures and video of June and Johnny could have added some rich context for the movie.I actually wish I had never seen them - as it just cheapens an otherwise great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upset","review":"I thought that Juaquin Phoenix did a fantastic job as did Reese Witherspoon..but had it been possible to yank Shooter Jennings off the screen and take him to the shed for a pants warming I would have done it.I was appalled at the way he portayed Waylon...I knew Waylon, we were born just 7 miles apart..He did have some bad years, but to rake him that way was unforgivable...but all-in-all it is a great movie..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Film Drags on Forever","review":"Grade:CWho forgot to tell these directors that you can only sit and watch people muck up their lives for UNDER 2 HOURS?Yes, you read correctly. Johnny Cash mucks up his life for an entire 2 hours of the movie. Well, maybe 110 minutes.Plus, the photography switched from looking like an amateur hand-held job to looking like Joaquian Phoenix (sp?) was a mad bull released on the set and the camera guy had to keep a closeup on him while J. Phoenix ravaged the set.However, this movie did give you a much better understanding of the late Johnny Cash. While I didn't care too much for parts of the movie, he is still a great singer and Reese Witherspoon and J. Phoenix do a good job with their roles.I also believe that Reese Witherspoon's Oscar for this movie was 200% deserved and -although I didn't see CAPOTE- I think Joaquin Phoenix should have won here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We bought this movie expecting to see a movie about Johnny Cash's life. And it had some decent parts, but this movie only tells about part of his life, in typical Hollywood fashion. My whole family is a fan of Johnny Cash, and the way Hollywood portrayed the Man in Black is almost sickening. Yes, he had a rough life, but he turned around. BIG TIME! If you are a fan of Johnny Cash and want to stay that way. I wouldn't recomend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Biopic!!!!","review":"I'd just as soon watched paint dry than see this movie again!! It was horribly slow!!I enjoy Johnny Cash's music. I also enjoy Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon's acting abilities and felt they both gave great performances in this Johnny Cash Biopic, but felt the screenplay and narrow focus of Mr. Cash's life made the film unbearable.The movie did a complete overkill of Cash's alcohol and drug addiction, overkill on the poor relationship Cash had with his father and need for his father's approval, and overkill on his hot pursuit of June Carter. I think it would have been nice to incorporate other aspects of his life too."},{"rating":"2","title":"walk the line","review":"I'm overseas and haven't got to see the move as of yet. But I've have seen the CMT video. I've never seen to actors more right for the part. They sounded exactly like the Cash's. I listened to country music all my life.

Can't wait to see the movie and buy the video.Regards M.L.T."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar's all over this one...","review":"Phoenix will get best actor. beautifully filmed, emotional and smart. and i don't care for cash' music. SEE THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry this is disappointing","review":"While the acting of Phoenix is very strong, he did not convey the endearing side of Cash, and that is more the writer or directors mistake, and I must agree with J Whitney that the two actors just don't have the chemistry either. And, while the cinema realite is very internal, I think the end of the film was wanting, because Mangold chose to ignore Cash's Nickajack Cave incident, which was his lowest point and his struggle with God... and as a result, it missed Cash's epiphanic moment.One thing Hollywood won't get is the heart of evangelical religion.Cash took it all to the edge to show that life is a messy conflux. That is why he is loved by people of all sorts, a very rare type.Three stars are missing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I thought this would be no good because there had been too much hype. Boy was I wrong. This is a great movie. The acting is really axcellent, with J Phoenix and R Witherspoon turning in spectacular performances as Johnny Cash and June Carter. The actual singing is excellent and the music, under the direction of T Bone Burnett, is really great, very close to the original sound. A must see for music fanatics everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and practical","review":"This journal is gorgeous. It is the perfect size, and I love the pocket on the inside back cover. The pocket is a great place to put photos, cards, etc. without having to tape thaem into the journal.The cover is beautiful, with a few gold metallic accents, and there is a paragraph at the back with information about the design.I only have one tiny complaint... After a while (a month or so) the cover started peeling at the corner just a little. I think it is only because I carry my journal with me everywhere I go, so this didn't keep me from giving a 5 star review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for the ebony peacock","review":"I bought this for my wife as a present and it's more beautiful in person.

The songs are intricate and very listenable, and the musicianship is absolutely incredible.My personal favorite is \\"Perdoname\\", which has an awesome percussion solo break halfway through that could almost be in a latin rap song.

But one thing I noticed though was while playing certain games (Galaxy, Brawl) I forgot it was even there. On the other hand games that rely on ambient music to really set a mood, it proves to be a distraction. Other than the noise issue everything else works great. Installation is very simple and it doesn't look too out of place sitting on the back of your Wii. All in all for 5$ its hard to say no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud but works","review":"People that are unable to turn it off need to know how to hold down the power button until the led turns red...it is louder than i thought it would be, but does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money? read the review.","review":"Hi my name is Sean and I'm using my Dad's screename.I was just surfing amazon looking for things to buy and I saw NINTENDO WII INTERCOOLER. well later I decided to check it out, I read what this product would do 4 your wii. it cools it just like the name. I didn't care but I kept reading about it. it said that your wii has a cooler a much smaller, weaker , more ineffective cooler than the item.turns out after about 7 monthes your wii cooler breaks down and you won't be able to use your wii for more than 1 hour. and if it really gets overheated it WILL break.Why spend 300 bucks for a new wii? just get a cooler for $15????IT IS WORTH THE MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like having x-ray vision but getting cancer from it.","review":"The Nyko Wii Intercooler does what it says it does - cool down your wii, even when it's on standby - and it's very good at that. There is one huge problem that I have with it, which made me plug it in once, then take it out and never use it again - the noise it makes. It's extremely loud and makes a high-pitched buzzing noise. It is very distracting and I can't even pay attention to the game with it on. I will never use this again, I'll probably sell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"L-O-U-D!","review":"Works well enough it's just way too loud. I'm not sure the decible rating but if the stanard noise from a Wii is a 10 out of 100, I would say that this thing bumps it up to a 30 out of 100. I thought I would use this to prolong the life of my Wii but it's so loud that I have had to disconnect it.A special note of interest is that this runs even when the Wii is in offline/lowpower mode connected to Wii forecast and news (you know, when the amber light is on). This of course is a huge minus for those who leave their Wii in this mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"S'Wii-t","review":"Keeps your Wii nice and cool. Like most have said, the main defect of Wii's is that the internal fan does not adequately cool the Wii. And this lil guy does! Yeah, it's a lil loud the first week or two, and sometimes when you fire up the Wii is sounds like it is grinding...just turn the Wii off then back on, or jiggle the fan itself...no biggie! Again, as for the noise of the fan, i am usually listening to music or playing with friends so it is not an issue...but keeping my Wii investment nice and cool is an issue. And that's why i got this lil guy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"buy it if you like a noise and want it to break in about a year","review":"this was a really great item for the first year. it worked great. but then after about a year and a half it stopped working. this is also a really loud device. so if you want to buy another one in a year and you like noise i would recommend this product to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Item..","review":"This intercooler fan is EXTREMELY LOUD! I have to literally turn the Wii off after gameplay because it's soo loud and it interfere with gameplay because it is soo loud!! I'm trying to find a fan that's little to no sound and still works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan is too loud","review":"Because I live in a hot climate and because I have WiiConnect set on, I decided a little extra insurance against overheating would be a good thing and got the Nyko Intercooler. (I have and am satisfied with the Nyko Charger). Attaching the unit to the console was a simple task, but for me the fan is far too loud. Granted, I have a small house, but the unit is so noisy I can hear the fan from other parts of the house.If it had been more expensive I probably would have returned it, but I decided the refund wasn't worth the cost of shipping it back. As I still want that extra insurance, I'm making it work for now by powering off the console between play instead of using standby mode. It's too noisy, though, for me to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the investment","review":"I have owned my Wii for almost a year now, and have had it repaired twice due to heat related damage. This time I invested a few bucks into this cooler, and have not had any further problems with the console overheating. Yes, the fan is a bit loud, but if you do not leave the WiiConnect 24 feature on standby it's not an issue. During game play I can hardly hear the fan. I would rather spend a few bucks on a loud cooling fan and save my the rest of my money for games, instead of repairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good results for a good price","review":"I ordered this accessory online to boost another purchase over $25 (to get the free shipping). I liked that it was cheap and that the other reviews were good. Be warned, this product looks extremely dinky when it arrives, as it only covers the fan opening in the back of the Wii (maybe 2\\" x 2\\"). However, it is extremely effective in keeping it cool, and should add life to your system. Definitely worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep it cool","review":"This product does exactly what it says it'll do. It keeps my Wii nice and cool even after long hours of playing. My only complaint is that when you are not playing, if you leave your wii on (even in stand-by mode) it can be a little noisy. Totally worth it though...why not save your Wii for just a few dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Story...","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Let me tell you, Duncan is TOO good to be true! I wish my husband would have at least one romantic bone in his body. With all the carrying Duncan did with Madelyn, I sure got jelouse.The only thing I didn't like in this or any other Historical Romance books, is how the authers make their heroins seem dumb when it come to the realization that she is pregnent. It's always the husbant who has to clue her in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, funny ..oh so lovely!!","review":"What can I really say? It's the first book I've read that didn't have those ANNOYING misunderstandings between the hero and the heroine! Duncan was really sweet and Madelyne! ..she was just so adorable ...so very innocent and clumsy (which was so adorable!!) I love both the characters so much. I thought it was just so sweet how Duncan never took advantage of her when she was sick. The way Madelyne kept bumping her head on his chin. Okay, so I'm not over the book yet, but it was just really THAT good to me. I HIGHLY recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid !","review":"Classic Julie Garwood style with a heartwarming (and feet warming) heroine and a fantastic hero.

One star deserves passion, and I can't muster up the energy to hate it that strongly.I enjoy Julie Garwood's contemporary stories--they aren't that complex, but at least I find them entertaining. Her historical romances, on the other hand, just don't have enough substance to hold my attention. I keep thinking I'll give her another chance, but I think this is the last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"charming","review":"This was the first Julie Garwood novel I ever read and I loved it. The plot was good. Baron Duncan steals Lady Madelyne from her brother, Louddon, in retaliation of(?) Duncan's sisters rape by Louddon. Well, you know how it goes from there (love abounds:). Madelyne wins over Duncan's whole family, who initially hate and distrust her, and finally wins over Duncan. After a hasty marriage to Madelyn, Duncan works his hardest to keep Louddon from stealing her back. The characters were good, but I didn't really like Madelyne all that much. Her idiosyncrasies, which I suppose Garwood meant to be endearing, were just a little bit annoying.

Was I surprised to find to find several wonderful references to my favorite book this term, The Odyssey? Wonderful, yes! Now I can claim I was studying for my final by reading a wonderful touching romantic novel! I already owned one of Ms. Garwood's book, but I will admit I never read it. My husband bought it for me as a gift but I never opened it. One day I bought this book and I fell so much in love with her characters and writing style that I read it in two days. Needless to say I picked up the other one (The Lion's Lady)and read it right away. I finished it one day! Her stories are wonderful and she has a superb flair for keeping the reader interested much like Homer! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you value good writing, skip this turkey","review":"I am absolutely baffled by the five-star reviews for this book. This is only the second book I've read of Julie Garwood's and it will be my last. Her characters are cliche, inconsistent and annoying. Her writing is stiff and staccato with uninteresting and repetitive dialogue. I usually find the reviews on amazon helpful, but they let me down with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put this book down","review":"I could not put this book down, it was heart warming and funny, i laughed throughout the entire book and was so sad when the book ended.

It reminded me of a paint by numbers process - one empty sentence after the next.If you want to be spellbound by the warrior the Black Wolf, read Judith McNaught's \\" A Kingdom of Dreams\\". For other good writers check out Susan Carroll's \\"Dark Queen Trilogy\\", and Sophia Johnson's \\"Risk Everything\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh* Never again.","review":"This is the second, and last, book I'll ever read by Julie Garwood. I gave her a second chance because we all know that even the best author can turn out a crappy book (see The Reluctant Suitor by Kathleen Woodiwiss). I just do not like the way that Julie Garwood writes a conversation. It seems to me that she is one of those authors that sacrifice quality for quantity. Her books are completely forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like an old friend","review":"This book was amazing the first time I read it, but each time I do...is like visiting an old friend. The characters, humor and romance is simply wonderful. This is one of my favorite books of Garwood (along with The Secret). I truly wish Ms. Garwood would write more historical romance. Her books are like candy.....sweet, indulgent and all-around tasty. I can't recommend this book enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it Over, Over, Over, and OVER Again!","review":"If you like the goofy side of romance, the cutesy, the funny heroine, please read this. It was sooooo enjoyable for just the plain, clean fun romance that I look for in a book. My sister has read this seven (7) times in the last two (2) months, she won't give it back! I had to go and buy my own copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honor's Splendour","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read. I could not put the book down and regreted finishing because I wanted to just keep reading. The main male character was what every woman dreams of in a strong man.

Which is why I was so dissapointed with this novel. It is her worst novel yet. I couldn't even finish it without skipping parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderfully Touching Love Story","review":"You will absolutely adore the hero & heroine of this story. Madelyne, a gentle, compassionate beauty who has known mostly cruelty from her brother, is the prize captured when Duncan, a fiercely proud warrior and Baron of Wexton, retaliates against Madelyne's brother. The story is set amid the turbulent times of feudal England. It is interesting reading w/exciting passion & genuine love that develops between these two. The characters are so likeable w/Madelyne being loving & compassionate & Duncan being the hardened warrior who falls in love w/her. Madelyne's humor, honesty & gentleness cause Duncan's heart to be lost to her, but he really falls in love w/her in the very beginning when she warms his near frozen feet against her in a totally selfless act. I also enjoyed learning about the Greek legends she so enjoys.Julie Garwood is one of the best writers of romance today & Honor's Splendour is one of her best efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started Out Good","review":"This book started out good but the character started wearing thin on me. I am half way through and don't even care if I finish. Madelyn is really bugging me. She cries all the time. At first, it was ok. She was experiencing a lot of real trauma but then she started crying over everything and her character became really insipid. Duncan started getting pretty boring, too. I don't understand the great reviews. The chemistry was good at first. After awhile, of all the \\"holding back\\", I didn't care if they were together or not. Oh, and she starts becoming very clumsy. Huh? I don't get it. Because she is finally free is the explanation. This causes clumsiness? The author doesn't dwell on this but I'm so bored with this book I think I will just go buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost The Best Romance Ever","review":"Fantastic, sensitive, romantic...one of my all time favorite novels that periodically I go back to just for the joy of reading it.

I've read all of historical romance novels and I think that this is one of her best so"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish","review":"Julie Garwood is a good author but I admit some of her books I do not like. What spoiled this one was the heroine, who claims she is a gentle maid yet makes out with her captor the first night. She throws tantrums, whines about her captors not liking her, and while at times she seems to have a spine, too many times she does not and you just want to shake her. Gentle maid or an idiotic one? The rest of charactors are pretty standard but good. The handsome and fierce hero and the evil villain who lusts after above maid.

It's has a nice sturdy feel and loads of interior pockets to help organize your stuff.

But there are also many creative ideas and unique projects that a more experienced person would enjoy. Why spend outrageous sums of money for the overpriced soaps you see at boutiques and specialty stores when you can make it in your own home at a fraction of the cost? So if you are looking for a soapmaking book that has an excellent mix of basic instructions for the uninitiated and more advanced concepts/ideas for people with more experience, this is the book for you.

To make matters worse the sizes vary so that the measurements drift in and out. For example over a 12\\" span each measurement may be too large, or too small or right on making these absolutely useless for measurement. All the tapes I have purchased from different companies have this problem. They all have been manufactured in China where apparently the quality control is terrible.Save yourself some aggravation and don't buy these.

In that book, he noted that he had become incresingly concerned about the prevelance of catastrophic illnesses among some elite athletes. He indicated that an alarming number of long distance runners ended up with cancer or heart disease because of the strain it placed on the immune system and heart muscle. I was a runner for years -didn't smoke or overeat. I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in 1995 and which has become quite common among former runners. There's no doubt running and other forms of aerobics get you fit but the damage it does to the body is considerable. Beyond cancer and heart disease there are knee, hip, and foot problems from overuse and repeated pavement pounding.I think you can get all the cardio benefits with weights and no impact actvities such as bike riding."},{"rating":"2","title":"I look forward to trying this book","review":"Easy read and it makes sense.

You are starving yourself and losing heart health in the process. 1200 is the bare minimum you should consume.

If you are eating around only 1200 calories a day you will lose a lot of weight even if you are sitting on the couch all day.

I myself dropped from 195lbs to 165lbs doing 3 days of weight training and 3 days of cardio per week while consuming approximately 1800 calories a day. At 165 pounds, I hit a plateau. I lost another 40 through a combination of interval and weight training while consuming around 2000 calories a day, more on Saturdays when I had a 3 hour workout. I once tried to stick to 1600 calories a day (this was without regular exercise) and after a few days I began waking up in the middle of the night, ravenous. So to set one calorie goal and assume it's right for all women is wrong and potentially dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ok.","review":"the diet-1200 calories a day forever- is not maintain-able. Most men and women have resting metabolic rates of 1400-2000. That means that the person burns those calories even if they lay in bed all day, as calories are burned from digestion, respiration etc. If a 1200 calorie diet is followed for too long, the body will preserve the fat and slow the metabolic rate. As for the workout..it is vague at best. Bands are ineffective in the long term. Weight training should be done with heavy weights to build muscle, with good form. (even in women) I highly doubt much progress past a few weeks will be possible without adding heavier weights in the form of barbells, dumbells, pullups, squats, etc. Another problem is that the body needs not only strength, but endurance. Cardio is a way that the body develops that endurance. Cardio exercise reduces blood pressure and heart rate, and also helps to regulate insulin."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total rip off","review":"This book is a joke I have lost 50 pounds in the last 2 years and have kept it off I have done my research about dieting and exercise so this book caught my eye and I just had to see if he had anything realistic to add.

I'm not a dieter but the food section was a bit of a \\"duh\\".

I loved logic games and puzzles, things labeled as \\"math games\\" but I hated \\"math\\" -- arithmatic is totally lame. This book completely bridges the gap between logic games and mathematics and submerses the reader in a whole new, wonderful world.

It had the 90's sense of humor.Mainly because of the quick wit and energy of the talents of David Spade. I have to believ a lot of what he did - or rather the way he did it - was improvisational. He had to have made it up. John goodman is good as the innocent bistander and who could forget Ertha Kkitt as the evil temptress. Konk is very funny too.The story is simple, the action is funny and the situations are amazing. (Tittle song by Tom Jones himself!)The DVD Extras on this film are wonderful. The behind the scens of storyboarding and record the voices and music are great. Even Sting is on this one.The technical aspect of putting this together must have been a challange.

I never saw it until I rented it for my kids. It was far from a masterpiece in story telling or character development, but it is truly one of the funniest Disney films to date. David Spade, John Goodman, and Patrick Warburton turn in extremely hilarious voice performances of their characters, especially Warburton's angel/devil act. It is lighter than the average Disney, but still ends on the usual morale high note. Kids will love it anyway because it's animated, but adults will find it unusually funny for Disney.

Peru is very different from Mexico and they have to respect the history of each country."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMW","review":"I normally praise Disney's animated movies, but I've got to draw the line somewhere. I can't believe the average review for this movie was 41/2 stars. I found the characters in this movie annoying, even more annoying than that suv commercial where that guy walks out of his house and parachutes off the cliff. I urge you to buy Treasure Planet, any Disney Pixar film,Tarzan before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about baseball instead","review":"This movie stars David Spade as a \\"llama.\\" Who cares about a llama? Well, he does not start out as one. The movie is about an emperor who gets a spell cast on him. This movie is lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Unlike the other reviewers I do not like this Disney film as the main character is not someone you can indentify yourself with. In my opinion the love of the public for the main figure (Pocahontas, Tarzan, Aladdin, Belle, Simba, Nemo, Dorey, etc.) always is the key to the success of the film. In this film I do not have any moment I feel pity of the character or do I really get into the story. Like Lilo and Stitch this is a film very unlike Disney and in my opinion worth to be forgotten very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"ok. when i went into the cinema, i thought that this movie would be a good one. 1) everyone said it was amazing 2) disney movies like toy story always are not that bad but this one really disappointed me.it irratated me. and even my younger brother almost fell asleep. it was not touching, but tried to make ppl feel sorry. and finally, i didn't find it funny but instead, annoying.anyways, i would say that it was not a good movie at all. nothing to expect from."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise From The House Of Mouse on DVD!","review":"What a difference a DVD makes! As much as I enjoyed watching The Emperor's New Groove on VHS, it is much more fun on DVD. I really got a kick out of some of the extras the disc provided, notably the game that involved changing Emperor Kuzco back into human form. Another interesting element was the deleted scene from the film. Fortunately Disney opted to do this, since the destruction of Pacha's village had a rather dark edge to it. As for the critical reviews, I would like to clarify that my local newspaper's critic David Elliott did like the film, giving it three out of four stars vice the two I mentioned in my pervious review. Although Groove is not in the same realm as Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid, it can still be enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney is going \\"against the grain\\" that it created","review":"Disney is known for movies with strong morals, a seemingly impossible pair that fall in love, and its festive musical numbers. \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" totally breaks free of the squeaky clean Disney's image and can only be described one way: \\"Cutting edge\\". David Spade does a spectacular job of playing the snobby and spoiled Emperor. His endearing sidekick is the true hero of the story. There is no enticing female role that the main character desires, in fact, this movie seems to totally drop traditional Disney gender roles. The woman is the bad guy, she has a dumb male right hand man, and not all of the men are ONE thing, either are the women. It was a wonderful new innovative movie for Disney, and I think it will open up a lot of doors. I knew from the moment the Emperor yelled \\"BOO-YAH!\\" that this was not what I had expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Emperor's Groove Rocks!!!","review":"Based upon the glowing reviews I read at Amazon, I purchased this DVD sight unseen. After viewing this movie several times with my 3-year old daughter (she calls this, the \\"Llama\\" movie), my family loves this movie. Another Disney classic! It just puzzles me why Disney never really supported this movie. By all means, go out and buy the \\"Ultimate Groove\\" DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T BE STUPID!!!!","review":"Don't be stupid and waste your time reading this and just buy this movie. by far my favorite and funniest movie made by disney to date. I've seen it many times and it just keeps getting better. Whoever gave this movie a 3-star review was just using big words and trying to sound smart, so don't listen. This movie isn't a \\"oh one line was funny\\" movie, it's a \\"My god I can't remember all the times I was laughing movie\\". I won't explain the plot because you should have already bought it by now and you'll be seeing it soon. what makes this so great is the fact that all the scenes are funny and get funnier as the movie goes on (last scene will stick in your head for a long time). If none of this has made since to you, it's because it's hard the write well when you're still laughing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slapstick Genius","review":"I love Disney anyway, but actually wasn't that excited when this film came out, nor did I hear anything spectacular about it. That was probably only because my friends at the time were all college students without kids and nobody had seen it, oh but when we did... we laughed ourselves hoarse! It's just one laugh after another, pretty much non-stop until the end of the movie, at least it was for the 6 20-somethings I saw it with. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good for words!","review":"This movie is great for kids of all ages! I'm fifteen and i still love this movie with all my heart.

I confess, I have watched it so many times i know all the words by heart and can recite it to you. But thats okay since all my friends know the words by heart too! Never have i seen someone who watched this movie and didnt like it. The best thing is that it never gets old. It's one of those movies where everytime you watch it you notice something new. You will not regret getting this movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids and adults and everyone in between!","review":"This movie is really a \\"buddy\\" comedy in the best sense of the word. Kids love it and it makes teens and adults grin and laugh out loud.This movie has a subtle zaniness that entertains and an intelligent humor quotient that is sure to grab just about everyone.The plot is well... plotted. The cinematography adds superbly to the whole package. The voice actors are all absolutely perfect in their roles. My favorite is probably Patrick Warburton (from Fox's short-lived \\"The Tick\\") as Kronk. Absolutely hilarious.Smart, fast, and funny.Plus, any movie that has Tom Jones singing a song written by Sting... I mean, come one! :) If you're looking for traditional Disney fare, this isn't it. But if you put aside your preconceptions about what Disney normally produces, sit back and just soak it in, I believe you WILL enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wacky adventure about working together","review":"First of all, the voice cast of this movie is amazing. Eartha Kitt is the heart of the movie, at least for me. The spoiled selfish emporer Kuzkoh gets what was coming to him.

So we just popped it into the VCR and we were going to chat while my son watched it but WE couldn't keep our attention off the movie!! It was SO cute!! We really just couldn't quit laughing! One of the lightest, funniest films Disney has made. Very entertaining movie and my son just adores it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced movie","review":"Emperor's new groove is a break from the traditional Disney animated features. This movie is more like the studios animated shorts. \\"The Emperor's new groove\\" is a fast paced slapstick movie about a vain emperor, named cuzco, who is turned into a Llama by two servants. He recieves help from a large kind hearted peasant named pacha in returning him back to human form. The movie is pure silly and never takes itself seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I wasn't expecting much from this movie since it seemed to have disappeared without much hype from the theaters. I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to find that this is one of those Disney movies that not only appeals both to kids but to adults as well. In fact, it compares very favorably to both Shrek and Aladdin in this regard. The movie is perfectly cast, with Patrick Warburton (Puddy from Seinfeld and the Tick) as Kronk, a big oaf sidekick who hums his own theme music and talks \\"squeakety-squeak\\" language to squirrels. Most amusing.I bought the collector's edition, and while there are plenty of extras included on the second DVD, I'm not entirely sure that they're worthwhile over the regular DVD release. Of the 3 deleted scenes, only one is animated - the other two are mainly storyboard composites with audio tracks from stand-in voice artists. If you're like me and jump all over deleted scenes, you'll probably be disappointed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your \\"DVD Regions\\"!","review":"Nice DVD, however I would have prefered a big, fat, WARNING written in bright red letters that stated that this disc was for non-US REgions!

I have seen several Disney dvds with problems such as sound and video skipping, poor transfer quality, and failure to run at all. This release is no exception! I've tried two different copies on different players with problems every time! If you share this disappointment, let Disney DVD know that you actually care that your movies play correctly.

But this was one of the funnest movies I've ever seen! David Spade does a wonderful job as the voice of Emperor Kuzco, and Yzma's Dim-witted helper Kronk steals the show. Also, the ending was very satisfying. <Unlike Hercules and Pocahatas> If you want the humor and sacastic remarks made popular by Warner Bros, I strongly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and entertaining","review":"Superb villain, hilarious situations.

It's filled with many special features too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needless and Unnecessary Release!","review":"I am upset about the \\"New Groove Edtion\\" of The Emperor's New Groove DVD release.This is for the most part the same DVD as the previous released.Down to the content and even the menus.The only thing really new is 2 more deleted scenes.I thought I would get an upgraded release of the film (hinst the name \\"New Groove Edition\\")However it is the same old same old.I am totally upset about this situation.I can not return DVD's to the store because the DVD is opened.The only way I could know this was not what I wanted was to open the DVD.As a customer what do you do when the stores have a no return policy on open DVD's.Total Disappointment!Also Beware of the new \\"Special Edition\\" of Tarzan for it is not a 2-Disc DVD as advertised on trailer previews."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the last Disney greats","review":"You will laugh from beginning to end. The jokes are timeless and my friends and I are still throwing quotes from this film back and forth all the time and just laughing about them. Kronk is by far the funniest character, especially during the scene where he talks with his shoulder angel and devil and when he is chasing after Kuzco (David Spade) with Yzma (spelling?). The lovable Paca, played by Jon Goodman, adds a heartwarming element of redemtion for the selfish, vain Kuzco and in the end you just want to say 'awwwwwwww'. By far, one of the most hilarious movies, animated or realistic, and worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"On its way to becoming a cult classic...","review":"I admit to not being very old, nor do I profess top be a Disney guru, but I have indeed seen every animated film that Disney has produced, and this one is one of my all time favorites. Others were funny as in \\"Haha, Grumpy fell into the water!\\" but this one was witty. It was together. It was darned funny. It has become one of the staple movies among folks at my university, up there with Monty Python and The Princess Bride, where one can randomly quote any line and others will react by laughing hysterically or quoting the next six word for word. \\"Oh yeah... it's all coming together...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Disney's Most Hilarious","review":"EMPERORS NEW GROOVE is a great film. David Spade is hilarious as the pint sized ruler who must learn to control his selfishness, and John Goodman does a marvelous job as the big and loveable sidekick.There are so many hysterical gags in this movie (The sequences in the restaurant are priceless) that I literally got red in the face from laughter the first time I saw it.Although not as majestic as HERCULES, LITTLE MERMAID, LION KING, ALADDIN, HUNCHBACK, BEAUTY & BEAST, F2K, or ATLANTIS, it is a hilarious feature that harks back to cartoons of the 1930s and '40s, while at the same time maintaining a very current feel.While EMPERORS NEW GROOVE is very funny, it also contains a very touching and almost tearful message about friendship. The movie will make you laugh. Make you cry. And make you think.But most of all, it will make you feel good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun.","review":"This is a noisy film, but a fun one. I certainly would recommend it over one of Disney's typical cookie-cutter musicals.

It performs just as expected. I make fresh, homemade butter and put it in this butter bell. As long as you change the water every couple of days as described in the instructions, the butter stays fresh. I can't attest to the butter staying fresh for 30 days because I use up the amount in the bell in a week or 10 days, but it stays soft and spreadable. I've read in some of the reviews that folks have problems with the butter sliding out of the bell. I only had that happen once and it was because I didn't have the butter packed into the bell well enough. If there are void spaces behind the butter, chunks of butter will get suctioned out when you lift the bell out of the water base. Press the butter into the bell so there are no air spaces before putting the bell into the water base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had been wanting one of these butter keepers for a while. It had been on my wish list from last Christmas and I finally just bought it for myself. I was disappointed as soon as I saw it. You fill the bottom with water and put the butter in the top.

I ended up throwing it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a crock! Not the solution to soft butter problem","review":"I had high hopes for this to solve my sweetie's need for room-temperature butter for his bread. His daughter uses one successfully, he said. Maybe so. We tried several times, followed instructions and video to the letter, used pure double-filtered water and grass-fed cow butter. What they don't tell you: when soft, butter doesn't stay in the upside-down crock, it slides into the water. Well, that might be OK, just fishing lumps out of fluid for a while. But then the surfaces that were buttery and not underwater started getting moldy. Mold might be good on bleu cheese but, this crock is now a tiny flowerpot."},{"rating":"2","title":"ButterBell","review":"Item arrived very quickly and as described. Very happy with it.

I've been through three sticks of butter now and haven't had any spoilage or problems with the butter falling out of the bell. That may be due to it being winter, colder temperatures and all.

Overall I recommend it as a cheap solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"packaging is horrible","review":"I am now in the process of returning the second butter keeper I have ordered.

You put the butter in the lid and water in the bottom--making sure the water is touching the butter. This keeps the butter soft and fresh, as the air can't get to the butter to spoil it. Don't worry about the butter touching the water. Since fat and water don't mix, the water just drips off the butter. I can't really comment on how long you can store butter this way before it does go bad as it doesn't last long enough in our household for that to be an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great intro to British history","review":"I bought this book to use in a class called England to 1688.

Barbra knows how to pronounce a word. As she takes her times fully ennounciating each syllable- even common pronouns and conjunctions are given star treatment as they find themselves being expelled by Barbra's thick and pasty lips.I'm sorry I really cannot recommend this album. It falls short on every aspect. But I'm sure if you look around you'll find some other great Christmas albums for the holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longing for Christmas Melodies.... not Mem'ries.","review":"There is no doubt that Streisand is the greatest singer of our time, yet I also found this CD disappointing. If you don't think of it as a Christmas CD, it is an okay album, with moments of STreisand magic. But, billed as a Christmas CD, it is not what you would expect. It desperately needs an upbeat song, Christmas bells, or even the purity of her voice in songs like Silent Night from her earlier Xmas album. My kids have woken Christmas morning to her Christmas album for years. I guess we'll use this one to get them to sleep Christmas eve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Streisand's Christmas Memories","review":"One cannot deny that Ms. Streisand has been gifted with a very beautiful voice and her song renditions are almost always supherb, but really, what does this woman know about Christmas or the spirit of the season or any traditional spiritual celebration in light of her corny political views and her support of corupt politicians and their evil policies? I would be curious to know what goes through her mind when she sings the Ave Maria? Probably the adulation and the power of influence her little talent has over so many. I think this CD is as much a joke as her \\"Higher Ground\\" CD and it's dedication. Sorry, but I can't get passed the hypocrisy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells bad... very bad indeed...","review":"Regurgitated worn-out Christmas ballads. If she had paired up with Luther Vandross on \\"I Remember\\", I think it would have been meatier. I think she should stick to politics now that it is obvious she can't write or sing anymore.

Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I was very excited to see that Babs was releasing a new Christmas CD since her first one is one of my all-time favorite Christmas albums. However, this new one is uninspired and dull with little Christmas feel to it. Each time I played it, I found my attention drifting off. Compared to the brilliant Linda Eder Christmas CD full of beautiful renditions of traditional and new songs, Barbra's comes off lacking in every way. Sorry, I really wanted to love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice but boring songs","review":"I love Barbra's voice so much I bought this cd without sampling it first. I have to admit that if I had listened to it first I probably would not have bought it. All of the songs have the same general tone. They are all very soft and melodic with lots of orchestration. There aren't any peppy songs to break the mood. It's too bad she didn't experiment more. Listening to a song or two is fine but listening to the whole album makes me bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Careful The Things You Say: Barbra Is Above Criticism!","review":"\\" Christmas Memories\\" is Art:A wonderfully touching collection of songs brilliantly performed. I am convinced Barbra was touched by God and although other great voices exist, Barbra cannot be compared to any of them. Every track is superb. Listen to the beauty of each arrangement. You will experience great joy and happiness ! All tracks are treated with that same magic as only Barbra can create! Wait until you hear these wonderful new songs written for the one and only. The standard songs as well are more meaningful when Barbra performs them. I cant say enough about this uplifting, romantic collection of seasonal goodies.

In fact parts of it are simply beautiful . (Listen to \\"A Christmas Love Song\\" and \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas,\\" and \\"I Remember\\" especially). But, in my humble opinion, this album, as lovely as it is, is no match for Babs's first Christmas album, released in 1967. That album is just the perfect blend of traditional songs (\\"The Christmas Song,\\" \\"Jingle Bells\\" \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\") and a little less familiar stuff (\\"The Best Gift\\" \\"I Wonder as I Wander\\"). And I think Barbra does one of the best renditions of \\"Silent Night\\" that I've ever heard, by far. So I say you can't get this new album unless you purchase the older one as well. They are kind of must-have companion pieces. Happy Holidays and Happy Listening.P.S. There is a version of \\"Silent Night\\" on Barbra's \\"A Happening In Central Park\\" cd that is really worth hearing, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the melancholic....","review":"This Christmas album is not intended for the melancholic people spending Christmas all by themselves...This CD somehow resonantes the condition of our world...We wanted to be happy and celebrate the occassion, but the losses and tragedy that we are facing somehow hinders us from really enjoying the season. Its best that this CD be played while doing the dinner et al, where the attention is on the food, just as a soft background music or while everyone is chit-chatting... not when you're alone.This CD is a classic Streisand. She's not proving anything new, she always has this talent to select great music for her CD and the wonderful accompaniment. Her voice is like an unnamed instrument that carries itself..its original,unique and unmatched. Her voice expresses itself, including emotions which is very rare now from singers who just often belts out high notes, screaming and squeeking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BIG FAN IN SAN FRANCISCO","review":"Ms. Streisand has presented incredible music over the years. Even if you're not a fan of every song she's performed, there are most likely a few gems that would be on any \\"favorites\\" list. You'll find other such favorites on this CD, which takes holiday traditions and personal devotion and ties them together with a big red ribbon. It's wonderful to hear new holiday music. Her voice is deeper and richer. Especially reflective are \\"Grown-up Christmas List\\" and \\"Closer.\\" And, as Ms. Streisand says in the liner notes, \\"It Must Have Been the Mistletoe\\" won't leave your head -- the background vocals are perfect. The opening \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" is the weakest track -- show-off singing for the sake of show-off singing. Still, I heartily recommend this CD -- a great addition to any holiday collection. She is a wonderful singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babs strikes again!","review":"Admittedly, those who are not already fans of Ms Streisand will not agree with me, so you individuals may scroll down to the next review.I think this is one of her best albums to date. With the possible exception of the Ave Maria (generally speaking, I don't like pop treatments of sacred classical arias, especially ones I've sung myself), each song in this album is a testament to Ms Streisands perfectionism. Arrangements are clever, orchestrations stirring, variety in abundance, and vocals (as always) powerful and moving.Barbra Streisand sings with so much energy, care, and appreciation for music that I cannot feel anything but joy when I hear this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disappointed Fan","review":"There is basically no Christmas song on this album. Very strange. Nothing exceptional. Nothing on the CD resonates for the Holidays or evokes warm memories, and the liner notes are embarassing drivel. However, I'm still a big fan and I'm sure I'll buy the next one. Bottom line -- stick with the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like old times...","review":"Not since \\"The Broadway Album\\" has Streisand sounded so sure of herself. I think it's a universal opinion that this is not a \\"traditional\\" holiday collection, but any way you look at this package, it is darn good. Her last few \\"studio\\" albums were either terribly over-produced, or just plain boring. Here, she has the restraint that she displayed in her 70's recordings. This is not backround music for the Christmas holiday (that's what Johnny Mathis is for), and it is one of the few albums where she doesn't seem to be driving a \\"message\\" into our brains. Why this woman has not recorded the Sondheim songbook is beyond me! Everything, of his, she records is brilliant. I have every album/cd she has done and this is one of the best. It's intimate...like having a friend over that tells a really good story. The kind of story that loses something in translation. You gotta here it from the true source.Kudos, Barbra!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Memories-Barbara Streisand","review":"We bought this Barbara CD expecting her beautiful voice to again be coupled with beautiful songs. After several listenings it is clear the voice is still a marvel while the songs in general are poorly chosen. I would expect this album to be used as background music at a party with 100 people or more looking for white noise to lift the moment. If the songs are played apart from one another it might work. Highly recommend using the random sort button on the CD changer and throwing in some B.B. King Christmas blues. This is a very disappointing CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Festive","review":"After listening to this CD I soon realized that it was NOT very good. The songs sounded downright dull and only a handful were traditional songs! Barbra's songs were too slow, and each one sounded like the previous, I normally enjoy listening to Barbra's music, but this is one CD that i feel I wasted my money on, and I wish I hadn't bought it. PLEASE! listen to these excerpts before buying this CD, because I don't want you to waste your money too."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is not a good example of the reason for the season","review":"Help! Help! I need your help in deciding if this is a True Chritmas cd or a bogus cd. To me this is a no-none-sense cd. I'm at a loss of what it's trying to accomlplish. Let's look futher at what this cd is about.Please let's focus on the reason for Christmas. Without question the real purpose for this time of year is to celebrate the birth of Jesus. He is the only reason for our celebration. Without him there would be no celebration. Let's don't get caught up in this non-Christmas hype! We all should know better than being mislead.For a so called Christmas cd to be complete, I think we need to feature the great ballads concerning Jesus. Anything less, is just wasted effort. This cd featured very, very few love songs to the master. It seems like it somehow lost the true focus of Christmas and what it's supposta to stand for.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not much of a Christmas cd","review":"If you are a die hard Chritmas hymn fan, this cd will not interest you.

Hey, Babs, Christmas is about OTHERS. Pass on this one, gang."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad she can't sing anymore","review":"bless her heart, even with all the echo, reverb and overproduction, the flat and thin notes are incredibly evident. i admire rosemary clooney who no longer has much of a range, but can at least still sing honestly. ms. streisand wants us to believe that she can still belt and hit clear, high notes, but hides them with choirs and orchestra so we don't really hear. too bad. she does sondheim well, however. she gets credit for that. maybe she should try a little jazz with a small backup group where she can scat and stay within her now narrow range. that might be more refreshing that her vain attempt to still sell a song on vocal prowess alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake up, Barbra!","review":"I adore her catalogue of music, but this is the MOST BORING crap she has ever put out!

I played it for my husband on New Years Eve and he got really upset. I never knew exactly why he went into such a rage, all I know is we had a very bad argument that night and it all started with me putting on this CD. At first he was fine with the first song or two, then he started glancing at the stereo and furrowing his brow. Then there was this part where she sings about cookies baking, and he totally goes nuts. He stands up and starts yelling at me saying \\"Who the hell sings about cookies baking?\\". His attitude changed immediately and he got into a really bad mood. We continued to argue until he ran out the door and didn't come back for 4 days. To make a long story short, we have now been divorced for 6 months. Thinking about the whole thing still makes me very sad, because I really miss him very much. He never acted like that before and we really were in love. All I can say is be careful who you play this CD for."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Part Wail, Two Parts Shmaltz","review":"This album is over-the-top. Barbra wails through every song in a highly schmaltzy fashion. Listening to this is like being hit over the head with \\"emotion\\" again and again and again. Nothing \\"true\\" or real comes through. However, if you love to hear Barbra caterwauling, buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft is what it's all about","review":"Barbra does what she does best. She sings softly, articulating each syllable, hanging onto it as if it's more important than the meaning itself. I am certain that this album will make great seasonal background music. Unfortunately, with the exception of the last 2 tracks - 'Closer' and 'One God' - there is not much that is memorable here. For those of us who have waited long for this, it may be enough. But it lacks the energy and believability of her first album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a BORING Christmas album....should only be 1/2 star","review":"My wife is an avid Barbara fan and I bought memoirs for her to have and go along with her original BS Christmas album. We hated this cd so much we shipped it back to the store. Try to hear it before you buy it. BORING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"I don't know if the below story is true or not, but either way that is some sad stuff. Of course, I don't know why he waited until she sang about baking cookies. Granted that's lame, but I would leave somebody the second they put on a Streisand CD.And how the heck does she have \\"Christmas\\" memories???? Did she take a break from spouting her incredibly ignorant political views to realize that a holiday was going on?As a previous reviewer mentioned, having a Jewish person record a Christmas CD, especially one titled \\"Christmas Memories\\" just seems a little weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"the logic of this astounds me","review":"As a lifelong fan of Babs' acting, musical wok, and meat-factory management guide writing, I found this dissapointing. There's a fine line between verbose Machiavellian posturing and the crushed souls of the weak that infest our society, and Barbra Streisand is that line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Celine is better","review":"I think Barbara's album is borderline average, but really i preferred Celine's new holiday release These Are Special Times. I felt Barbara was at times trying too hard in some of the songs. I didn't like the way she leaves you feeling hungry waiting for that cresendo and glass shattering highs, which just well , never came. It left alot to be desired.Compared with Celine, Barbara pales in comparison. Celine not only satisfies your hunger for powerful notes, but really left you fullfilled with glass-shattering notes as well.While barbara's album was average at best, she should retire now and stop trying to sell albums only based on past reputations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Velvet Tapestry of CHRISTMAS MEMORIES","review":"Streisand performed the songs for CHRISTMAS MEMORIES with a larger-than-average orchestra. Instead of controlling it into the distance, she blended it with her vocals. This generous maneuver (a rare one from any gifted singer) coaxes the listener to target the emotional hues of the lyrics instead of the artist's Technicolor voice. A velvet tapestry of holiday imagery results. CHRISTMAS MEMORIES makes the eggnog taste creamier and the fireplace smell sweeter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Money Maker for Babs...does she even celebrate Xmas?","review":"I always like my singers to sing from their heart, not just so they can make a bundle from me and not even mean what they sing!Does she even put a Christmas Tree up in her home?I can truly recommend the new Holiday release by another superstar...VIKKI CARR. Vikki sings songs from the heart and soul, and I am sure Vikki puts a Christmas Tree up in her homes and really loves Christmas. I recommend her CD \\"Vikki Carr Christmas Album\\" to anyone who listens to Barbra...you won't be disappointed and just for the international touch, several of Vikki's selections are bi-lingual.Good luck Babs!!! Glad to read in your PR package that you do give Vikki Carr credit for including several of her songs on your Christmas CD. You are given credit for having GREAT taste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"I love Barbra Streisand and everything she does.

However after listening to it again a saw the beautiful melodies in songs like \\"closer\\" and \\"christmas lulliby\\". I love that the CD has \\"It must have been the mistletoe\\" and \\"my grown-up christmas list\\". I rarely hear these songs but they are some of my favorites. My only compaint is that the CD is almost all slow songs. I wish there were more faster ones like \\"it must have been the mistletoe\\". But all in all it is another wonderful present from Barbra to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"These glow in the dark stars and moon were what we expected and our son enjoys them.

Then i had the light on so that they could get a glow to them. I turned off the light and went to take a shower.

I wish they would glow a little longer, but they're really bright for about 10-15 minutes after the lights go out. I bought this set because it was the only one I could find with a big moon (my son has become obsessed with the moon lately for some unknown reason). We also bought 150-piece and 30-piece sets and it fills up his ceiling pretty well. I just finished putting them all up last night and my boyfriend wants some in our room now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT STICK - LOSES GLOW AFTER 1 HOUR","review":"This product comes with a tiny little pouch of putty to adhere the stars and moons to the ceiling. First of all, they do not provide you enough putty. The reason being is that you need more \\"than a tiny amount\\" as the packaging says because the stuff doesn't stick. After using only 2 tiny pieces of putty per star...it left me with about 7 stars with no putty - wasted. 30 minutes after my daughter goes to bed, she's calling my name because a star has fallen down onto her bed.To make matters worse, after an hour of being in the dark, the glow goes away.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!

The science we so often learn in school makes it seem as though science always proceeds in a straight-forward manner. This book explodes that stereotype.

After I first read about it I felt that people were being pretty hard on Mead, but since then I've changed my mind. People claiming to do scientific research are held to high standards.

Also every daft Yank in the USA appears to have crawled out of the woodwork to make up the audience, which is shown \\"getting on down\\" at every opportunity. The picture quality is not sharp either, whether this is down to cramming three hours onto the DVD and thereby sacrificing resolution, I'm not sure.

Annoying, stupid and just plain awful! The audio mix was of good quality. Go buy the CD instead. If you want to see how a concert dvd should be presented check out \\"Roger Waters In The Flesh\\" or \\"Elton John One Night Only\\" or Bruce Springsteen Live In New York City\\" If you just want a documentary on the tour, this dvd is fine but it is labled a \\"concert film\\"....misleading to say the least!

I just saw the DVD in a store and went for it, thinking that it would be about a live concert, be it: song after song until the end, that's all. I was hoping to enjoy Paul's band at their best.No. Nothing like that. Then I learned this is a TV special. Full of breaks. Songs cut off. Songs interrupted along their way. Bad lightning.

Well, the picture quality is spotty, sometimes the screen is too dark, other times it's annoyingly bright. The sound quality doesn't sound like it was mixed correctly, it has a tinny edge to it. The bass lines seem fuzzy, the percussion seems too \\"thumpy.\\"It's disappointing, because Paul is a perfectionist (as you all know), and he rarely puts out something of this inferior quality.

Awesome songs and performances by Sir Paul and great behind the scenes footage. The quality of the video shot is only OK, though. But, if they wanted to produce a concert video, then why did they keep interrupting the performance with interviews with the band, crew and fans (all of that could have stayed in a separate \\"Behind the Scenes\\" feature)? If it's a documentary about his Driving tour, then they should have shortened the concert portions and focused on that only. It's frustrating to get into the performance only to be taken \\"out of the moment\\" by them inserting some interview, sometimes interrupting a song!I'd give the music an \\"A,\\" the editing a \\"D,\\" the Audio quality a \\"B\\" and the video quality a \\"C.\\" But the frustration level makes me rate this overall as a \\"D.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"No Surprises...Another Beatle...Another GREAT SHOW!","review":"If you were/are a Beatle fan, this DVD is sure to send chills up your spine! As expected, everything is absolutely flawless. As well as the concert footage, you the viewer are taken along on the tour. Paul resurrects Beatle tunes, Wings tunes and even covers some vintage Rock & Roll. He sings a song he's written for his fallen ally, John Lennon. The most moving part of this DVD is the final song on the tour. The entire entourage is in the audience and all hold up hearts...Paul was visually moved and as tears ran down his face, could barely finish the song as his voice \\"quivered\\".Young or old, lifetime fan or \\"youngsters\\" just discovering The Beatles, this DVD will be a treasured reminder of the legacy they left for a generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used the skip forward button a lot.","review":"When I buy a concert film, I want to see and hear uninterrupted song performances.

There were at least two songs that had people talking over the actual performance. I was so annoyed that after every song I would press the skip forward button to the next song. I would then wait to see if someone was going to talk over the top of the song, if they did, I would skip to the next song. And the footage is of poor quality.

First of all, the picture quality was not that good which is understandable because some of the photography is in the dark . If this was the only problem, I could live with it but there were other detractor which in my mind were unwarrented which made this DVD a dissapointment. They could have put in more footages of the concert instead of their activities in the zoo, backstage activities and shots of movie stars. I bought the DVD to see the concert, not the other stuff.

Paul does an excellent job. Wish they would just show the whole freakin concert without all the middle commentaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I really don't know what are the some other reviewers talkin' about, the DVD is wonderful! The \\"interruptions\\" help us to know a little more about Paul, the relationships with the band guys, and let us know how a 60 years old man that has been one of the biggest pop musician in the world, can keep up singing and playing as great as 30 years ago, and even better! Thanks to shots to the crowd we can get involved many more in the concert, come on Don! if you dislike the interviews, just press the >>| button and you'll go directly to the next song ;)The video and audio quality are superb. I think I don't need to talk about the music. Simply awesome, full of feeling and Paul's voice, in spite of his age, GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY IT if.......","review":"...you're a collector of live shows and concerts!Paul is still the greatest, music-sound is fantastic but you won't be able to stand all the talking instead of music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"Having seen Paul McCartney in concert in April in Cleveland, I was eager for this DVD and the CD. While the CD is excellent, I am really disappointed with the DVD. My favorite song is \\"Hey Jude\\", and it was very disconcerting not to have the entire song on the DVD. Instead, after some filler before the song, the song was joined in progress, probably about two minutes into it. While it was great to have the entire song on the CD, I wanted the DVD to show me the entire concert as I had experienced it, not a \\"joined in progress\\" song!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all too much....","review":"Would have loved to have just the concert. Concert footage is chopped up with interviews and fluff pieces that make the video unenjoyable for those of us that weren't lucky enough to be there. The interviews just get in the way of any flow the concert probably had. (and let's not forget the plethora of crowd shots)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Disappointing","review":"The concert footage is interspersed with tour footage and backstage footage so you get a song here, two songs there etc, rather than a concert all the way through in one piece. This approach may be refreshing at first but does not lend itself to repeated viewings. Also every self-proclaimed Beatles nut in the USA appears to have crawled out of the woodwork to make up the audience, which is shown \\"getting on down\\" at every opportunity. The picture quality is not sharp either, whether this is down to cramming three hours onto the DVD and thereby sacrificing resolution, I'm not sure. Surely Macca's got enough money to have made this a double DVD set for the same price as one. That way he could have had the concert on one disc and the \\"rockumentary\\" stuff and soundchecks etc on the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE CONCERT DVD FROM MILLIONAIRE PAUL!","review":"Just can't believe that someone ... with that much money could put out a piece of crap like this!! so so disappointing Paul!!we need a direct live show NO FILM! and direct to DVD without 90%of audience... Pauls pretty taken with his old self!! nice dye job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great audio, Video disappointing.","review":"I was looking forward to see this concert video; I have a large collection of concert videos and enjoy watching them. The disc itself has plenty of interviews and special features. Sound is very good, a little heavy in surround but OK, most concert video are mixed that way anyway. My main complaint of the movie is the video. The camera work looks like it was filmed and edited by high school kids, the camera zooms and all the jumping around is horrible, looks like they tried to copy the camera work in \\"Law and Order\\". \\"Live and Let Die\\" almost made me sick. Them looks good for \\"Blackbird\\". The interviews in-between songs are annoying to me, an option in the menu to watch the concert and concert with interviews would have been great. I do agree with most posts here that there are to many crowd shots. Overall not a bad effort but not on par to the best concert videos out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This DVD, Buy Wings Over America","review":"When I saw Paul McCartney last may, I could not wait for the concert film. Because I remember \\"Paul McCartney Rock Show\\" one of the best concert films I have ever seen. The day this dvd came out I went out and picked it up. When I got home that night I pop the dvd into the player and my joy turn to disapointment. What makes a good concert cd or dvd is seeing the interaction between the singer and the crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"So you did it again, Paul","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Beatles and Paul. I attended 2002 concert and also watched TV concert film aired before. Reading others' comments for this DVD, I found that the DVD contained the exact same contents with the TV program. If it is the case, DO NOT BUY this DVD. When I watched this concert on TV, I was very much disappointed and turned off after 30 minutes or so. But at that time, I thought it was because it was edited for TV show. How can they sell this ... as a DVD title?? It was not a music film at all. It was a 'poorly made' documentary, at its best. I think Paul is not so interested in making a concert film of a good quality. GET BACK and PAUL IS LIVE VHS were also very bad! I just own them as a sort of full collection of Paul, but do not recommned as a good concert film at all to others. Paul, why are you making the same mistake again and again? Or do you have any calculated commercial intention? Look how great concert DVDs other musicians are making these days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"next best thing to going to a live show","review":"well I saw this tour concert twice in Dallas andSt. Paul. this is the closest thing to seeing theshow, but of course nothing NOTHING beats live Paul.strangely the video seems only 4:3 aspect ratiobut I can deal with that"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete Concert DVD (Excellent)","review":"This DVD is great and is a must have for every DVD library on Earth. It is a complete concert video of Sir Pauls Back In The US Tour. (I was at the Minneapolis concert so I know it is complete.) This DVD also has many extras which I thought were very good to add. It deffinetly deserves this 5 star rating. I hope he releases a Back in the World tour DVD similar to this one but with everything being from his European tour.

I suggest saving your money until they put out a better quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sir Paul could do so much better..........","review":"DVD would be great without narration and interruption. Navigation from track to track is sketchy at best. C'mon Paul I paid over $240 to see you live in concert and it was worth every penny. This DVD barely justifies 20 bucks. Get back to where you once belong, Paul."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thumbs up","review":"Recently had the time to view this DVD start to finish. I attended one of the shows from this tour too and I should mention I am a rabid Beatle fan. While most of the performances were entertaining I did not enjoy this concert video. Will someone who has an audience with Sir Paul please tell him that he doesn't have to continually remind us how great and wonderful he was. He also doesn't need to change the song credits to McCartney/Lennon. We all know Paul wrote the sappy songs. If he wants to be remembered in a positive light and not as how Lennon described Elvis in his later years (The Fat Elvis), he should show some class and stop the over self promotion. He wouldn't look good in a white jumpsuit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Musician but...","review":"I was lucky enough to see McCartney live in May on the first part of Back In The U.S. tour, and I can tell you it is the best concert I have even seen. When I heard that there was going to be a DVD of this tour I could hardly wait for it to come out. Now that its out I wish I had kept my money. The DVD was of poor quality and for the 5.1 surround sound it was very bad. They had voice overs in most of the songs, and when I listen to music I want to hear just the music, no voice overs. If you went to see the concert just savory the memories and don't buy the DVD you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource!","review":"For anyone studying Greek Sculpture, this is a wonderful resource.

Film elements from collectors and film archives all over the world have be brought together in an attempt to restore these films to this best possible viewing state. Some elements come together better than others but in all cases we are now able to see the Keystone work better then we have ever been able to before. They are now more complete and properly titled and best of all contain delightful musical scores. Also they are projected at the proper speed. Any student of early film or anyone loving the history of film will find this collection to be well worth studying. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Chaplin Keystone collection","review":"The Chaplin at Keystone DVD set is by far the best choice for those wanting to see Chaplin's Keystone films. The quality is outstanding; video and music. The set includes a booklet by Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance, with film notes & photos. They even included a teaser excerpt from the recently discovered \\"A Thief Catcher\\". Now if someone would just discover a copy of \\"Her Friend the Bandit\\", we'd be all set."},{"rating":"1","title":"RESTORED? A mixed bag","review":"I was thrilled when I heard about the Chaplin At Keystone project back in 2003. I waited 8 years for this to be complete, and sad to say it's a great let down. First off the prints are taken from 35mm nitrate originals, and the quaility is clear and sharp. However, these prints have so much negative surface wear that it takes away from the overall quaility. I don't mind surface wear, after all we are dealing with prints that have been printed away so many times that wear, even in original Keystone prints, are bound to be visible. But when nothing is done to try and remove some of the more serious wear, I have an issue. Another problem is the music scores choosen. At times the scores are down right horrible, and do not add to the enjoyment of the film. After reading some of the reviews I was expecting pristine prints. I wish Flicker Alley was more up front."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attracts more than it repels","review":"We bought this product to keep our dog off of one of our rugs.

He weaves this story full of political, ancient, cultural, and humorous themes. While this may be a \\"funny book\\" to some, to me this story means so much more. I implore you to read between and beneath the lines of this absoultely beautifully written novel. You will not regret learning about human nature in such an entertaining way."},{"rating":"2","title":"An allegory as contemporary as animal farm","review":"Most recently we were fortunate to be able see Satyajit Ray's Bengali movies, Gopi Gayen Bagha Bayen and Hirak Rajar Deshe, locally. Story line of \\"Haroun and the sea of stories\\" goes through plenty mow fish and gopi and bagha as the author borrows metaphors from Satyajit Ray and Wizard of Oz. Like Orwell's Big Brother, Walrus is watching over the sad city in the land of chup(word for silence in hindi/urdu). At the end gupwalas prevail and story water is salvaged. Being an ardent Rushdie fan I could not bear to see his most recent NY based novel, Fury, becoming irrelevant in the week of its release in September, 2001. However, if you needed any metaphors for defending human dignity, freedom and democracy, look no furhter than this book and Satyajit Ray's movies of Gopi and Bagha."},{"rating":"2","title":"his best","review":"This book is sort of the Arabian Nights + Princess Bride, with a little Alice in Wonderland thrown into the mix. When Rashid, a storyteller known as the Shah of Blah, loses the ability to tell stories, his son Haroun sets out to find out what has happened. With the help of Iff the Water Genie and a cast of colorful characters he finds out that forces of Darkness are polluting the Sea of Stories.It's all a thinly veiled allegory for Islam trying to silence the author after his Satanic Verses was published, but it's deftly handled & often quite amusing. Rushdie does an especially nice job with word plays & puns & the book requires rereading & reading aloud to catch them all, which makes it a perfect book for adults to read to older kids.GRADE: B"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good Kashmirian book","review":"This is a book where Rushdie displays his Kashmirian roots most clearly. The title itself is taken from the 11th Century masterpiece Katha-sarit-sagar, \`\`Ocean of Story'', by Somadeva."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully lyrical and humorous novel - great for kids.","review":"This is a great children's novel in the tradition ofRoald Dahl's BFG. Rushdie's sense of humor and poeticcommand of the language are both in full force, making ita wonderful book to read out loud, regardless of whetheryou have kids around to listen.

These are Rashid, Soraya, and Haroun. Rashid, the father of Haroun, is a storyteller and speaks throughout the city. His wife, Soraya, is a singer. Then Haroun is a smart young man. The storyteller looses his wife and storytelling talent. One day Haroun meets a water genie named Iff and his mechanical bird, Butt, and they take him to a magical second moon. They meet Prince Bolo and eventually Rashid there as well. So they are on a wild goose chase to find Princess Batcheat, Bolo's wife, and destroy the evil Kattam-Shud that is poisoning the beautiful story waters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bedtime Story for Grown-Ups.","review":"This book is a perfect example of Rushdie just letting all his creative juices flow out. This story is not deep or imbedded with hidden meanings of critiques of society yet is like a bedtime story for adults. He creates wonderful worlds into which our minds wander and that we visit after falling asleep reading the book. This book is fun and entertaining though it does drag at certain parts. Nonetheless the clarity with which any who read it will be able to envision this story will allow the draggy bits to be quickly passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haroun, a book to read to my children... someday","review":"Aaaah... Rushdie, a man of such wit and controversy. And I know nothing of it (yet), save for his gift for whisking me back to the warmth of simple tales when the world was just picture books and rhymes. Haroun, Rashid, and their Ocean of Notions kept a smile on my face the whole way through. There are two ways to read this book. First as a child, appreciate it for being a lush and engrossing tale. As an adult, you can draw some heady musings on authoritarian rule and freedom of creativity and learn the context in which Rushdie wrote this book. The bad guy is a sniveling, talentless bureaucrat? Brilliant! Now I gotta crack those Satanic Verses..."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Part Alice in Wonderland and part The Never-ending Story, this fanciful tale had to have inspired Jasper Fforde's Tuesday Next series. I got as much enjoyment out of this as I do when I read Harry Potter. It has the same rich imagination. Still I scoured this book for LOST clues. After all, why would Desmond be reading this? I did find one clue about an idol called Bezaban that the people of Chup worship:\\"Bezaban is a gigantic idol, \\" Rashid told his son. \\"It is a colossus carved out of black ice, and stands at the heart of Khattam-Shud's fortress-palace, the Citadel of Chup. They say the idol has no tongue, but grins frightfully, showing its teeth, which are the size of houses.\\"Sound like a certain statue?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Metaphor for Imagination","review":"I picked this book up in order to introduce myself to Salman Rushdie. I am a big fan of well written children's books because I think they keep the imagination alive. I figured that if this guy could write a good tale for children, it would be worthwhile to check out his more \\"serious\\" novels. After reading Haroun and the Sea of Stories I've decided that I will definitely keep Salman Rushdie's name in mind for future reading.As any good children's story, it is as relevant to adults as it is to children. It serves as a reminder of the importance of stories in our lives and how we need to tap into that unlimited source of imagination, that \\"Sea of Stories,\\" and not let our imaginations go stale."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAROUN AND THE SEA OF STORIES.","review":"iTS SUITABLE FOR A CHILD, NOT A 72 YEAR OLD SCHOLAR.i AM FINDING IT HARD GOING. faNTASY IS NOT MY THING. i RED ARABIAN NIGHTS AS A CHILD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long-winded","review":"This book was an okay book, with plenty of allusions, and probably if you look beneath the surface you will find a lot of meaning in this book. However, on the surface, as a kids book, this book was long-winded and repetitive. It just got boring after a while, and the fact that the story was nothing special did not do a lot to keep the reader engaged in the plot.

That is not a joke or stretch of the imagination either. My suggestion, move along and dont look back, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting and fun","review":"Interesting and fun because there is more to the tale than you first think there is or is there? My first impression was that Haroun is a pre-Pratchett fairystory but in the tradition of Arabian Nights. It is, of course, an oral fantasy, a work of fiction about fiction itself, Rushdie asking what is the point of a story if it isn't true? The point is, as every child will tell you, that fiction makes you feel better because it's fun and also brightens up our complications.In a way there are similarities between Rushdie and I in that we both use our natal country (his being India, mine being Romania) as a vechicle, as roots for the pudding of our fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"What a delightful book! The boy, Haroun, has a father who is a professional storyteller (the Shah of Blah). His father loses his ability to tell stories when his wife runs off with the dry civil servant upstairs. Haroun eventually travels to the moon of stories where he finds he must help save the princess and the Ocean of the Streams of Story, both threatened by the evil cultmaster of silence. Lots of wordplay and reflection on storytelling in general. Sort of an adult Phantom Toll Booth. Not very suspenseful, but lots of fun.

This work continues this tradition. Mid-way it is not clear where the story is going, but at the end all is resolved. This is a spoof, and names of many places and persons are puns on Hindi words. A short dictionary at the back explains some of these, but there are still little gems buried in the text. Publicity identifies this as a fairy tale for 18 years and up. I have given it to 12 year old grandson; but I have no feed back yet from him. Why not 5 stars? The story \\"wandered\\" and I put it down and picked it up several times. But, no less believable than the standard European stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Novel","review":"This novel is Salman Rushdie's funniest, yet it also talks about the importance of freedom of speech and of storytelling.

The whole book, Haroun is just flying around on his magical Hoopoe or something. The ending scene wasn't even too good. Nothing happened in the book. But poor me, i had to keep on reading it as a class assignment. I would've put it down right on the second page if i could. My teacher loved it, but the rest of my class hated it. We were all falling asleep while we were reading it. 14 year olds should not have to go through this kind of torture with Haroun.

This is a GREAT Lenny Kravitz recording. He plays all the parts, yet this rocks like a band. The songs are well developed; ''Stillness of Heart'' is a brilliant pop song. Do you know how difficult it is to write a simple, compelling, hook-laden pop song? Lenny seems to pull them off in his sleep!Another thing that just doesn't ring true anymore is the ''Lenny's nothing but his influences'' hoohah. Lenny is Lenny! His sound is defined and larger than his influences by far.With repeated listenings, the new Lenny is a gem for the ears. Sing-alongs, rockers, ballads, they're all here. If you love Lenny, you'll love this. If you say you love Lenny, and you write a nitwit ''all-the-other-ones-were-great-but-this-one-makes-me-vomit'' review, I'm calling you out. You don't like Lenny at all. Perhaps the predictability of the Backstreet Boys would be more your speed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lenny will never change...","review":"If you are a fan of any of his other albums, from the energy of \\"Are You Gonna go my way?\\", the darkness of \\"Circus\\", and the all around message of \\"Let Love Rule\\", this album won't disappoint you. Its the same good old guitar rock that lenny is known for. Yet in some songs he seems to be experimenting a little. Like track 4 is backed with a heavy trip-hop like beat, and there are less jams and more moderate to slow paced songs. And thats not necessarily a bad thing- because they are some of the strongest songs on the album. The first single, \\"Dig In\\", is not one of my favorites by him, and he could have chose many better songs to release than that one. It is one of the weakest tracks on the album. Very indifferent and boring. Dont let that song keep you from buying the album because it sounds alot like his old stuff mixed with the new. With a good second single, he should be able to gain even more popularity and even more, establish himself as a true Rock Star."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"I love Lenny's music. His album \\"5\\" is one of the best albums of the 90's. Then with the release his Greats Hits, which included \\"Again\\", WOW was the only word that could discribe the body of his later music.

Most of the songs sound the same, very one dimensional and flat. What happened? Where did Lenny lose his edge?"},{"rating":"1","title":"*&%$!@","review":"I was so disappointed in this Lenny Kravitz's latest effort.

This one took a very long time to arrive and it is a real disappointment. It lacks any real substance.Earlier albums meant so much. The message was everything. It was what powered the music. Understandably Kravitz wants to cash in. He began the process by doing a cover of The Guess Who's \\"American Woman\\" and continued with The Greatest Hits compilation(Usually the kiss of death for most artists). KRAVITZ-You should have put out a double live album! Selling out or not, Kravitz is still cool- this guy is electrifying in concert and when he is in Southern Cal, I will go out of my way to see him.

A streak of five well balanced, well written albums....incredible concerts...he stayed in his prime for a long time. This album lacks the strength and musical integrity of his past recordings, and even though there are a few good songs it seems that Lenny has finally lost his edge. This is probably just a collection of songs that didn't make the cut on older albums. Go buy \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Lenny","review":"Let me first start by saying I absolutely love Lenny Kravitz. Critics love to call him a poseur or throwback to the seventies. Well, yes Mr. Kravitz may not be the most creative fellow in the industry - but he's good at whta he does and it's fun music. His live shows are downright awesome.It's unfortunate that his self-titled album doesn't come close to touching his previous work. The lyrical content is downright childish. His attempt to use sampling and effects have left him looking silly. I'm not sure what he was thinking when he decided this album was ready for the shelves, but it is pretty underproduced.The best song on the album is \\"If I Could Fall In Love\\". It has a nice super-sonic quality about it, and the lyrics are easier to listen to than the other tracks'. The worst song is \\"pay to Play\\" - I can't listen to even 5 seconds of it.\\"Lenny\\" falls short of pleasing a devoted fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"With the exception of Pay To Play and Bank Robber Man, this CD is a good solid effort. Lenny keeps on getting better with repeated listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lenny is still great","review":"As a relatively new fan of Kravitz, he has continued to produce great music. He is still as funky and soulful as ever. Keep up the great work, Lenny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"oozing talent","review":"Lenny is truly an incredible artist. I think he gets better with each album. His last, & this one rank among the top for me.The first track is just incredible; it's bold, sexy and catchy.Many songs are quite dark in tone but still worth listening to.I really don't agree with the first few reviews at all. This album is really fantastic. Go buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.","review":"Lenny Kravitz is back with his new CD where he takes advantage of his gorgeous looks on the cover.This is not enough to save this CD, in where Kravitz has gone to the mundane.Lyrically, Kravitz is still positioning himself as a New Age Post-Hippie, with predictable banal results.Kravitz produced, wrote, and played almost everything on this CD and it shows. Kravitz needs some new influence in his musical career.Especially with the first cut \\"Dig In\\", sounds like everything else I have heard. It just doesn't jump out at you, and it surely isn't jumping up the charts.If your standards aren't unrealistically high, you can count on \\"Lenny\\" to deliver dependable blase \\"been there done that\\" rock tunes in rocks usual tradition. And if you can' dig it- well blame Kravitz he was the whole show on this blase and boring project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major dissapointment . Anyone heard \\"A Million Miles...\\"?","review":"What more can be said? I think if it's not very obvious for the casual Amazon shopper at this point, after reading so many negative reviews about 'Lenny' I will try to add my two cents here. The album brings nothing new to the discography of Lenny Kravitz. If you have heard '5' or 'Cirkus' that's it: that's the best there is, and it doesn't get any better with this album. This is the major dissapointment I have about the album, which many reviewers seem to share.The influence from The Beatles, most particularly John Lennon, is undeniable in the album, but even so, it doesn't quite capture the listener. There is one tune, though, that I can't quite decipher: I'd almost swear I've heard another version of \\"A Million Miles Away\\" but I don't know who the original performer is. Any hints?... Well, point being, the album is not really worth your money. If you can get it used MAYBE, but then maybe not."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD","review":"WOW! THIS CD ROCKS! THIS MAN IS A MUSICIAN. PLAYS ALL THE INSTUMENTS. WHO NEEDS A BAND. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD AND LENNY'S GREATEST HITS CD. IF YOU WANT AN EXCEPTIONAL CD TO ADD TO YOUR LISTENING PLEASURE, THIS IS IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LENNY DOES IT AGAIN!!!","review":"Lenny Kravitz has put another excellent \\"ear candy\\" compilation. For true Lenny fans his sound is his own and IS unique. He is a man looking for love and challenging people to rise above their own mediocrity. He is still the \\"Pied Piper\\" of peace and love...and this album proves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Lenny","review":"To me, Lenny Kravitz is at his best writing and singing about a broken heart. Songs like \\"Can't Get You Off My Mind\\"; \\"Again\\"; \\"Heaven Help\\" and most all of the \\"Mama Said\\" CD are some of my favorite Lenny songs. So for me, this CD is his most enjoyable. \\"Believe In Me\\" and \\"A Million Miles Away\\" are two incredibly beautiful songs. \\"Stillness Of Heart\\"; \\"You Were In My Heart\\"; \\"If I Could Fall In Love\\" \\"Yesterday Is Gone\\" and \\"Battlefield Of Love\\" should all ring true to anyone who has ever been in love. Of course, Lenny also finds time to rock out, with the well written \\"Bank Robber Man\\" and \\"Pay To Play\\" as well as the first single \\"Dig In\\". The other two tracks \\"God Save Us All\\" and \\"Let's Get High\\" are not favorites of mine, however they are far overshadowed by the excellent music and lyrics that Lenny displays on his sixth and most enjoyable album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile...","review":"I got ahold of this after hearing \\"Dig in\\" and I must sayit's pretty good. My two other favorite tracks are \\"Millionsmiles away\\" and \\"Bank Robber Man\\" this is one of his betteralbums... It's too bad his lastest album lacked depth passedtwo or three songs. If you have a choice between this oneor \\"Baptism\\" pick this one first... You will be glad youdid."},{"rating":"2","title":"With a little added touch of retro","review":"Lenny Kravitz proves that he continues to write, produce, and perform some of today's best rock music. He gives us a great 70's retro vibe, which gives it the added rock edge. The emotion in his lyrics are delivered brilliantly: sadness, love, anger, etc. One can feel his rage on \\"Bank Robber Man\\" which he fires back to the police officer that falsely arrested him for a bank robbery. \\"If I Could Fall In Love\\" is a wonderful love song to sing to that special someone. The smash hit \\"Dig In\\" is a very catchy party song. His emotions are also delivered in his musical instruments, which he performs most of them.Those who are looking for a great, unique rock album will not be disappointed with \\"Lenny\\". It'll be a classic in a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers beware!!! Rotten soy milk!","review":"I love the first 3 pack of EdenSoy. The second 3 back is another story.

I like the individual 8.45 ounce boxes for easy transport and portion control."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to expect in \\"God Drives a Flying Saucer\\"","review":"\\"God Drives a Flying Saucer\\" proposes that Christianity is the true religion, but that God is a nonsupernatural life form whose life span is so long because of high technology. The book makes the claim that God did create man and that Jesus was His Son and Messiah, but that His creation of us and the various miracles of the Bible and post-biblical times were achievements of scientific technology, at one point God is referred to as \\"the master technologist.\\" It is also claimed in the book that while many flying saucers may be of other extraterrestrial origin, some are the transportion/operation centers of God and His angels.I expected this book to be a mixture of \\"Chariots of the Gods?\\" and \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\",but instead found much better logic and less game playing. I still don't think he's right, but R.L. Dione did use somewhat decent logic and came up with a presentable explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy but good!","review":"This book is lucidly written and concise. It is altogether reasonable in tone. What is crazy is the premise: it assumes the historical truth of the Bible but substitutes for outworn supernaturalism the notion of space aliens with advanced medicine and technology. Gabriel artificially inseminated Mary; Jesus was resurrected like Klaatu, etc. It is subtly funny for the extravagance of it as an attempt to \\"demythologize\\" scripture while making the \\"scientific, rational\\" alternative seem even more far-fetched! In this the book is a modern example of the old Protestant Rationalism of the 18th century which had Jesus walking, not on the water, but on the stepping stones, etc. What a gem!

Perhaps I was expecting another NEW SUN. I thought the language and symbolism were presented well; however, I only read the first book in this 2 book omnibus and did not care enough about Patera Silk or his plight to read further. I did not hate the books, I just did not really \\"get into them\\" for lack of a better term. I really did WANT to like the books, but I found that I was pushing myself too hard to get through the first book of the omnibus to enjoy it enough to read further.I will probably give this another try in the future, simply because I enjoyed NEW SUN so much, hopefully I will be in the right frame of mind then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bela the Comedian","review":"Saw this one on TV and had to buy to see it all.

It gives the air of slow dance or a secluded dinner-for-two. Kings becomes a little repetitive, but it was the the track that introduced me to Toney's music. \\"Sweet Whispers\\" has a catchy melody like \\"Aphrodisiac,\\" but it's more mellow. And \\"African Knights\\" emphasizes beat and primal noises. All 'n all, these particular songs are solid. I can't really remember the other ones, but for \\"Aphrodisiac\\" alone, this album should be in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cd","review":"\\"Kings\\" is one of my favorites....it is one of the most beautiful songs.....I can listen to it over and over.... love Kevin Toney's work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"A great book for the harmonically challenged.A chimpanzee could learn with this programmed learning method.

It contains all of the production footage from the never-completed SLEEPAWAY CAMP 4: THE SURVIVOR!!! Part 4 was started and abandoned back in '96, and for the first time you can see what could have been! A true collector's item!! You can tell if the box has the 4th disc by a large glob of blood on the front stating that the extra disc is contained inside.

It is a pretty typical early 80's camp murder film, but with a few great twists. Some of the murders are pretty out there, but at least they are creative! The best part of this movie is the ending. Granted you pretty much know all along who the killer is, but the final scene of this movie is quite bizarre. All in all its campy horror at its best! 2 and 3 are downright funny!

She loves to finger paint, and I thought that this would minimize the mess. Wrong!!! It was just as bad, if not worse, since the colors don't show up--cleaning is no easy task. As other readers said, it's like painting with Vaseline. We had to SCRUB my daughter to get this stuff off, and wash and rewash her hair (she scratched with icky, greasy fingers). The kitchen table was a greasy mess, and the paint box was a greasy mess. The colors on paper were pretty, but after leaving them to dry out for a day, which they didn't, the counter was a greasy mess too.I'm very disappointed, as I do like Crayola's products, but this should be taken OFF of the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"What a mess! These paints are basically like vasoline. Greasy and very messy. Then, to make matters worse, my daughter made me some beautiful pictures to hang on the fridge, and after a day or two, everything bled together and the picture was pretty much gone.

The color wonder markers are okay, but the soft sticks are a joke too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"Although Crayola is a wonderful brand, I was not impressed with their Color Wonder fingerpaints. The time between when my children put it on the paper and the time it actually appears is too long for them, and they get frustrated.

Always chomping at the bits for her newest book to be published. But this book was quite different than her others. Too many gruesome scenes. I enjoy her other style of writing. But certainly not this kind. I was disgusted with it--child abuse, a disgruntled paraplegic with a continual bad attitude? A battered kitten who is later bludgeoned to bits in her home? Nailing live mice to the wall to slowly die in pain? Sorry but reading this kind of material isn't exactly what I call an enjoyable leisure reading. I'm very disappointed in you Nevada.Perhaps the next one will be more like your old style of writing, with adventure and suspense in the great outdoors, not something along the mentality of the Texas chainsaw massacre."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I used to look forward to the next Nevada Barr book, but no more.

The abuse of children, evil ranger poising as a dead ranger, freaky religious sect, dead animals on the bed, and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me. I've read many Barr books, and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters, it's hard to keep them straight. In this book, that was the last of my worries. I didn't even finish it, I was so turned off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncomfortable but well written mystery","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this is the darkest and most chilling installment in the series so far. It's not the sort of topic I choose to read about and I, too, noticed the relative lack of engagement with the natural park setting that drew me to this series in the first place. Neither is there much in terms of further developing the Anna Pigeon character. But that said, as far as a mystery story goes, this one was well done--enough so to give me a nightmare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling Graphic Exciting","review":"This was my first Nevada Barr book.

I kept saying \\"Oh, come on!\\" and rolling my eyes.I can't remember ever skipping through an audio cd like this. Nor have I ever written a review, but this was so bad, I felt the need to express my disappointment.I didn't find the content necessarily offensive, but certainly poorly handled and presented.On a positive note, I really enjoyed the narration by Barbara Rosenblat - she truely brings Anna to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've just read my last \\"Anna Pigeon\\" book","review":"I've read all of Nevada Barr's books. I've enjoyed learning about National Parks I've never visited, and enjoyed reading about familiar places. I love a plot with good character development. Ms. Barr's latest book has no character development, unless you count going deep into almost pornographic, sadistic behavior. This isn't a mystery, this is a head-game horror story. Hind sight shows that Ms. Barr's books have been getting progressively darker. If you're interested in just how much torture the human body can endure, how much evil can be plotted, and how every innocent thing on earth is subject to abuse, this is the book for you. For me, I've retired from Nevada Barr's dark tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I love the Anna Pigeon stories, but this one was a disappointment. The characters were disjointed, the continuity was poor....hard to say what happened here. Either avoid it, or borrow from the library instead of buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior Writing","review":"Regardless of the description of sad and 'hard truth' depicted in this book, the writing itself is inferior compared to Nevada Barr's other Anna Pigeon stories, I thought. I did not want to finish it because of the convoluted sentences, the careless dialogue--perhaps an attempt, I felt, to establish a new 'style' in her writing. The writing was off-putting and seemed thoughtlessly crafted--an attempt to meet a publisher's deadline? The bitterness expressed by Anna toward all things religious in human longing seemed out of character for the Anna I thought I knew. Perhaps marriage was not a good idea! I am so sorry, because I looked forward so much to a new book by Barr, and am so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I've come to love about Nevada Barr's books","review":"I have read every book in this series and this may be my last. I always try to keep the next book on my iPhone and can count on it for an interesting, breezy read when I have downtime. It was such a departure for her style and themes - where is Anna's support system? Paul? Molly? Why is this book going into deeply violent and disturbing crimes but treated more as a plot device? And what's with the polygamist theme on top of it? Oh and the national parks take a big step back in importance and context.I hate to write this review but honestly I was so surprised by my reaction to this book that it took me a while to realize how awful it is. Left a bad taste and I do really want to read more Nevada Barr."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, awful, awful","review":"Before I got around to reading this book, I'd read quite a few of Nevada Barr's books and loved them. However, had this been the first book of hers that I read, I never would have read another. I am sure she is trying to make a point, but must she leave us with these awful images to haunt us. The book should come with a warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and LAST Nevada Barr book","review":"This is the first Nevada Barr book I've read and I do not plan to read any more. Some of the other reviewers complained that the tale is too dark. I can deal with that. Unfortunately, the topics the author touched on are not foreign in the real world. However, what displeased me about the book is that I never felt a strong connection to any of the characters. I never felt drawn in by the writing. When I read what I consider to be a good book, I am able to experience the different emotions as they're conveyed in the story. I also have a hard time putting it down. With this book, it got to a point where I only continued reading because I'd already invested time into it -- not because I was really enjoying it.When I read a description of the story I was anxious to get my hands on it. What a disappointment! Maybe I should have picked a different Nevada Barr book to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best","review":"I've read all of the Ranger Anna series, and while the subject matter here is difficult, I think this is one of Barr's best efforts. I especially noticed that this is not the kinder gentler Anna that some may have expected when she finally tied the knot. Language is courser, (but appropriate) and the introduction of a \\"second in command\\" was an interesting twist. One expects that Barr might be priming wheelchair bound Heath (has anyone ever heard of a girl named Heath before???) for her own series of mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should come with a warning","review":"I usually read books in order, especially from favorite authors like Nevada Barr. I got out of sync on this one and wish I hadn't gone back to catch up. If I'd read these negative reviews - every one of which is spot on - I'd never have bought it. Barr isn't a \\"cozy\\" writer (thank goodness), but she's never pandered to the violent and psycho taste that seems to be growing measureably worse every year. We don't need this! I honestly think it's dangerous. I don't believe in censorship, but I hope readers will rebel and force writers to stop polluting our minds - and the minds of already disturbed people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hateful","review":"This is just an ugly, hateful, horrible book. Although I have regularly read the Anna Pigeon series, I have always found the gratuitous violence and brutality disturbing.This one, though, is the worst ever---I loathed the animal torture, the child molestation, the child abuse, and the extremely unsettling religious extremism. And, of course, Anna Pigeon HAS to be brutalized, as she is in EVERY ONE of the other books.This one was the last, however. No more for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and unpleasant","review":"I've read a few other Nevada Barr books and liked them well enough (although Ann Pigeon is far from my favorite mystery series protagonist), but this one I really didn't care for. I picked out the likely villain very early and I was waiting for an unexpected twist but it didn't come. Really there were virtuallly no surprises and those which there were didn't really matter much. I also got annoyed and very tired of her (the author, through mouth of the protagonist) harping on the one character's fatness, going on and on about it and describing him with really contemptuous language -- it gives a strong impression of someone who is rabidly \\"sizist.\\" OK, the guy is fat - so are a lot of people, so get over it. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Fiction (2.5 stars)","review":"Nevada Barr seems to be wrestling with the same dilemma that too many of her fellow series writers ~ creating a story that is challenging, interesting and believable. Like the cliff-hangers or yore, \\"Hard Truth\\" asks the reader to accept as probable, increasingly impossible scenarios. Filled with stereotypes, this was a disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best description is \\"bad\\"","review":"Each book she writes gets worse and now itis time for the once entertaining writer writer to quit. I don't mind a little horror here and there but the whole thing needs to make some sense. Quite honestly, this is garbage. I tried the book and the audio but couldn't finish either. If Ms. Barr had been pedaling this as her first book, no one ever would have published it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific book","review":"I used to love Nevada Barr's Anna Pidgeon stories with their mix of mystery, self-reliance and outdoor adventure. But her latest book is just about the most horrible storyline I have ever read. Pedofilia, religious stereo-typing, sadism, torture, you name it, this book has it. I stuck it out until a few chapters from the end hoping someone would save the situation, but when one of the abused children was left to torture a bound Anna I tossed the book in the trash and never finished it. I read fiction for enjoyment and escapism, there is enough of this sort of horror in the daily news. I am crossing Nevada Barr off my book list, I can no longer trust her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Horrific","review":"As I began this book, I was hopeful I could disagree with the harsh criticism from some of the reviewers here. But, I can not. It is hard to believe this is the same author who gave us Track Of The Cat, Firestorm, and Blind Descent. The opening pages of this story were rather choppy. Awkward sentences and abrupt changes in scene made the story hard to follow. Then the writing evened out and the story became somewhat interesting until it neared the conclusion, which was shockingly horrific. Disgusting even. It isn't that I am overly sensitive to this sort of thing...I read Dean Koontz, Stephen King and other novels with plenty of horror in them. But I come to Nevada Barr's books expecting, needing something different. I hope this was an experiment and not a trend she intends to follow in future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Anna Pidgeon has been one of my favorite fictional characters since I discovered her in \\"Liberty Falls\\". I went back and read everything to that point and have enjoyed each book about her since then. I liked them all and felt special fondness for the ones about the parks that I have visited. So, I feel as if my bubble has been burst when I say if you feel like you absolutely have to read this one...wait for the paperback...on sale. I'd understand if Ms. Barr is tired of creating perils for Anna after all these years, but it would have been better to let her ride into the sunset after her marriage to Paul than to give us this truly disturbing piece of fiction. Perils, yes; complete psychosis, no. I'd like to think that as recompense Anna will get sent to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area where she and we can recover from all the trauma in the peaceful Zen of Marin County."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibily unpleasant read","review":"I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries. The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it. It is a very unpleasant experience.The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area. I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park. Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story. The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them. This book, however, was truely repulsive. I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow down, please","review":"Nevada Barr's Firestorm is my second favorite mystery, ever. I hate to witness the decline of quality in the Anna Pigeon series. Her last two books have felt hurried and feel way off kilter compared to her earlier efforts. Before, we knew why Anna chose her life. Now, every other chapter serves as another torture room.I dislike this. I also hate it that Anna found and married Paul, only to immediately cut away - if you're going to add a character, especially one central to the protagonist, keep him."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!!!","review":"I have read and purchased and enjoyed all the Nevada Barr books...until now. I loved all of her other mysteries and will probably try at least one more, but if the next one is anything like this one that'll be all for me. I have kept her previous books in order to enjoy them again. I gave \\"Hard Truth\\" away to someone who likes horror stories and stories with child abuse. Please Ms. Barr, come back to the light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say, too dark for me","review":"Unfortunately Nevada Barr seems to be going the way of a lot of popular authors, writing books that are not enjoyable to read. It's too bad, since I really enjoyed the other books in the series. This one had too much perversion and I skimmed most of the book. I hope she gets out of this dark mood and starts writing in the style of the earlier Anna Pigeon books. I liked the light mystery and descriptions of the Parks that made the books different and interesting. After reading this one I don't even want to visit the park it's set in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciatingly Bad Ending Ruined It.....","review":"I very much enjoyed this book in the beginning--nice character development and the plot was promising. I expected some disturbing twists in the story, but where it did end up going was so over the top and unbelievable that I was yawning rather than feeling terrified. The conclusion was gratuitously violent, gory, and fell flat. Who wants to read about a young girl who barks at the command of her psychotic tormentor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant and gruesome","review":"After reading this book, I didn't read another Nevada Barr novel for years. Children being abused and tortured, animals being abused and tortured - it was horrid. Unless you are jaded or sadistic, you likely won't enjoy this book. My advice: Skip it and go on to the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous and Explicit Violence","review":"I listened to this book on audio. Initially intrigued by the interesting setting, colorful heroines, and promising plotline, I spent much of the second half of the book grimacing. Gratuitous violence is a poor substitute for well-crafted suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed","review":"This is my second Anna Pigeon mystery, and I listened to it on audio. I don't do crime books, but the first was so entertaining (and so well-narrated) and well-written, I looked forward to Hard Truth. I like mysteries, but not when they feature sadomasochistic scenes of violence, which is why I was happy to find these novels. Not now. The last two discs, where Anna is captured, are horrific to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first grade teachers review","review":"Every year my first grade students tell me this is a great story.

Both will have to be put up till she is older, because the book was not a hard book and the moose has button eyes, but I am rating this moose high, because it is so darn cute and soft and lovable. I can't wait to put it up on the shelf in her room and get it down when, she is a bit older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moose","review":"I absolutely love this moose.

The poem didn't work for me and one or two stories just missed being gems. The reader needs to be warned that the humor in this book is not tea-sippin'-dainty-pinky-in-the-air smile but gut laughs about bodily functions and outrageous points of view. The basic premise of the collection is that a plague virus, Yuppie 25, has killed or made zombies of everyone except Bubbas (who were immune because of their frequent ingestion of a generic barbeque sauce). More fun than an SUV full of yuppie zombies."},{"rating":"1","title":"One story by Rob Gates ruins the book...","review":"What could have been an okay anthology, turned down right horrible with the story by Rob Gates. Did this author pay to have his story in this book? Or perhaps someone did it as a favor? Either way, that paticular story lacked not only basic writing skill and creativity, but feeling. It was hum drum line after hum drum line going in no particular direction. While other stories in this book try to make up for it, all in all this is too much money to spend for such an amareturish work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diarrhea & the grass still didn't grow","review":"We have fairly harsh conditions with multiple dogs (all well over 100 pounds) and grass in the shade.

The tablets did not even decrease the severity of burning at all. COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE and a complete waste of my money.

The music on this CD is good, while the lyrics seem to get weaker with each album. This is a radio band playing under the facade of being a rebellious \\"against the establishment\\" band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Did the Music Go?","review":"I was very disappointed by this album. Rage's first album was the perfect musical combination of bone-crushing beats, agro vocals, thumpin' base lines and solid guitar licks. Although Morello's guitar in the Empire album was more innovative and added \\"special effects,\\" the overall feel of the album was true to its predecessor. In the Battle Album, however, Morello seems to think that the only thing he can do with his guitar is make annoying screeching sounds. The special effects don't leave any room for music. All in all, the album is a tiring hour of Zach's screaming and Morello's screeching. Where did the music go?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Rage EVER","review":"Was i ever so digusted in my entire life as when i put my BATTLE OF LA in my cd player? NO!

The self titled debut was outstanding, to say the least. Evil Empire, (the second album) was not quite as good as the first, but was still VERY listenable. After listening to Battle, however, I don't think it quite reaches the bar that the debut set. Not even as good as Evil Empire, really... But, as you can see by the four stars it's still awesome.And with all the Rage wanna-be bands coming out of the woodwork like roaches these days, it's GREAT to hear something fresh and new from the originals. They invented this stuff.If you're a true Rage fan you'll know this rocks when you hear it. If you're not..then Battle Of Los Angeles just sounds like more of the same, only not quite as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blows away the first record","review":"I've read here that a lot of folks think that the first Rage record is the best. Are you kidding? These guys are just hitting their stride. As a new Rage fan, I can hardly listen to the first record now. I find myself wanting \\"Maria,\\" \\"Guerilla Radio,\\" or \\"New Millenium Homes.\\" This is the best and probably most important band currently, and to listen to this record is just a thrill each time. I want to change the world after each listen. God bless you Morello and de la Rocha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps Rage's best yet","review":"This is a politicaly inspired album that is a great blend of hip-hop and rock with the sound and fury that can only be rage. Zack's lyrics are just as good as the self titled and better than Evil Empire. Tom Morello's work on the guitar blows my mind on The Battle of Los Angeles just as much as the other two albums. My favorite songs are \\"Testify\\", \\"Born of a Broken Man\\", and \\"Voice of the Voiceless\\". It is good to see music and political activism back together. Rage is a band with a purpose in a time when fluffy pop is all over the radio and bands like Limp Bizkit are screaming about \\"nookie\\". Great album, go buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rage with New Dynamics","review":"Rage has always been unbelievable in my mind. The shows are largely filled with hardore fans, (little panzy posers need not apply), as RATM has always been about the release and unity of the conscious mind. If you're looking for pop music, then this is definately not for you; however, if you enjoy music because it inspires and affects you, get this one and the first two. This record is more experimental then their first two and is equally powerful. Look for Morello's crazy styles and Timmy C. keeping it in line. Brad Wilk plays up a little on this record and Zack.. well.. if you know Zack then you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Evil Empire and RATM, better than anything else.","review":"The reason this CD is similar to the others by Rage is because its the same group, obviously. Which is also the reason its better than any other CD. The more a group sounds like Rage Against the Machine, the better they are.And guess what, no one else sounds like them. THey stand alone, and this CD is just more evidence of how alone they are, at the top, far above anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Evil Empire and nearly as strong as the debut.","review":"A suberbly strong album that will satisfy most Rage Fans. I particularly like the fact that the album doesn't give into some of the musical expectations that we have of Rage's music. An expample of this is with Mic Check, the first time I listened to the song I kept waiting to here a ball drop in the song and I must say that I'm very happy to hear the they didn't give into \\"set\\" musical paradigm. Morello, great inovation, Tim, bass is used more for instrumentation than support (awesome), Wilk, nice variations and Zach nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"a great alternative rock album featuring the great tom morello and excellent songs like guerrila radio and calm like a bomb.very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New CD!","review":"One word GREAT! This is a great new album. RATM does it again. I have never loved a band as much as I love this one. No one can beat this band. They rock the house on every song they have produced.

I had only liked a few random songs on it and thought that ratm had made a horrible mistake. But then I listened to it again and realized that I kinda liked a part of Tom Morello's great guitar rifts in every song. Every time I listened to it I grew more satisfied with it to the point of Evil Empire seeming as if it was just a cat in heat (It had been my favorite CD). \\"The Battle of Los Angeles\\" is the BEST CD EVER CREATED and shall always rule over every guitar strum(except of course the Star Spangled Banner by Jimmi Hendrix) and has the best lyrics (performed and written by Zach De La Rocha) ever.Buy it NO MATTER what, even if you are stupid enough to hate music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FRY MUMIA","review":"Mom, could you ask the butler to hand wash my Che T-shirt?

Morello has also defended Sudan, a government that helps enslave Christian and other non-Muslims living in the south).

I don't think it is as good as Evil Empire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars Just for Being Rage","review":"The new Rage kicks. No other band out there can properly merge funk, hip-hop, and metal like RATM. On Battle of Los Angeles, Zach finally shows his potential as a vocalist. I thought he took a step back with the release of Evil Empire, but he makes amends here. His lyrics and rappin' have never sounded better. Again, Tom Morello proves just how innovative he is. He definitely gets my vote for best guitarists of the '90's just for being creative, not to mention he flat-out rocks. My favorite tracks are Guerilla Radio, Calm Like a Bomb, Maria, and Born of a Broken Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"RATM is back with a vengeance!","review":"Battle of LA is more political than the past two records but can still rock.

Tom Morello's guitar sounds are eccentric as ever and Brad Wilk's drumming is tight. I was expecting it to have a different sound from their previous album but it's still great. \\"Maria\\" is definetly my favorite song. Its lyrics paint a bitter picture but not a hopeless one. And like the previous two albums, all sounds are made from drums, bass, guitar and vocals. That's admirable considering most bands today sound nothing like their studio cuts when they play live. Rage sounds just as good live as they do in the studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"Rage Against the Machine's The Battle of Los Angeles is my favorite Rage CD. It's perfect, from the opening chord of Testify to the last sound War Within A Breath. I can't recommend this CD highly enough.

Superb.My favorites: Testify, Guerilla Radio, Calm Like A Bomb, Mic Check, Sleep Now In the Fire, Born of a Broken Man, Maria, Voice of the Voiceless, New Millenium Homes, War Within a Breath.

It just isn;t possible not to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense mix of political issues, poetry, & full-fledged rock","review":"This album is one of the most important, boldest records of the year. Even though the vocals get somewhat tiresome & some of the lyrics are heavy-handed, the instrumentation and complex guitar work is excellent. Proving that rock music can be intellegent & sympathetic, these poetic headbangers never sounded so good together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done.","review":"Once again, Rage puts out another album that shows us how to rock. Rock politically that is. Many people do not quite get Rage's lyrics. They see past what Zach De La Rocha is trying to get them to understand. One must understand Zach's feelings and motivations to fully grasp a Rage album. This is certainly true on \\"Battle of Los Angeles\\". I would have to say that my favorite song is \\"Mic Check\\" (song #4) because it is very much Rage, and yet it is not. The political statments are there, and yet the song is very well done and original. That can be said for most of the songs on this album. They are all well done, and some may not be in the form the Rage fans are used to, but they are all good in their own ways. If you like Rage, pick this album up. If not, check out their previous albums first, to get an idea of what they are all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Battle of RATM","review":"With just 3 records in the last 7 years, you'd expect people to forget or ignore Rage. But one taste of RATM is enough to hook you!After their underappreciated 1996 effort, the team returns with a consistent and strong record! The Battle is one of the better albums to come out this year and certainly deserves the the success it's received so far!Tom Morello is one of the most innovative guita players around and he manages to coax amazing sounds from his guitar while the rest of the team is as solid as ever. Zack continues to write revolutionary lyrics and performs them with a commitment that's admirable!All in all a very good record.... nothing that's very different from their other two albums, but a progression all the same!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best overall album of '99","review":"Rage Against the Machine's newest album, \\"The Battle of Los Angeles,\\" has a much larger funk and hip-hop flavor to it than Rage's previous records, \\"Evil Empire\\" and their first self-titled album. Tom Morello, lead gutarist for Rage, keeps tradition with his additions of DJ emulations, scratching and dynamic guitar riffs. The album has a much more emotional feel to it with the lyrical bombardment from lead singer, Zach de la Rocha, in songs like, \\"Voice of the Voiceless\\" and \\"Calm Like a Bomb.\\" \\"The Battle of Los Angeles\\" is a must have for any Rage fan. It shows the musical maturity over the past decade of their existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best overall rock album of '99","review":"Rage Against the Machine throws caution into the wind with their newest album, \\"The Battle of Los Angeles.\\" Rage incorpoates more of a funky, hip-hop beat with tracks like, \\"Mic Check\\" and \\"Voice of the Voiceless.\\" Famed gutarist, Tom Morello, still keeps beat with his D.J. emulations, scratching and unthinkable guitar riffs. \\"Battle\\" has more of an emotional feel with the chants from Zach de la Rocha in songs like \\"Guerilla Radio\\" and \\"Calm Like a Bomb.\\" \\"The Battle of Los Angeles is a must have for any Rage fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commie band kicks a**!","review":"Well, although \\"Evil Empire\\" is their best work so far, I would say that \\"The Battle of Los Angeles\\" is certainly to be recomended. \\"Guerrilla Radio\\", \\"Sleep Now in the Fire\\", and \\"Maria\\" are the best songs on the CD. I felt the others were just not up to the standards of the band's previous works. This band is the best in promoting the anti-capitalist/true communist movements and ideals. No comercialist sell-outs here! When I want to hear just loud music I listen to Korn, Bizkit, or Kid Rock. When I need some inspiration and revolutionary zeal I listen to RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ever!","review":"This is truly as good as music gets these days. Zack de la Rocha lyrics embody RATM's political message, while not making it just a preachy complaint. Tom Morello's guitar sounds are truly amazing. All twelve of the songs on this album ROCK. The best ones are \\"Guerrilla Radio\\" and \\"Sleep Now in the Fire\\". \\"War Within a Breath\\", \\"Testify\\", and \\"Maria\\" are also great. What makes this album better than stuff like Korn, Kid Rock, or Limp Bizkit, is that it's more organized, not just slapped down, with all different kinds of song lyrics, it's a carefully created blend of hard rock and powerful lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the RAGE go?","review":"Deserves 2.5 stars.

Since I only listen to 5 star, top notch material and nothing less, this final studio album from Zach and Co. is a welcome addition to my collection. To be honest, the real star of \\"Battle...\\" is Tom Morello who delivers one stunning performance after another. From the swirling hurricane intro to \\"Testify\\" (a sixties-ish heavy riff that never lets up) to the Zeppelin inspired, godzilla-sized roar that opens \\"Born Of A Broken Man\\", His guitar playing scales astonishing new heights!

It's also the ideal soundtrack for your next trip to North Korea. Meanwhile, in the former East Germany, stuff like this draws big laughs.

Guerilla Radio, the first single is the rap-metal-pop song of the year, except for that incessant Falling Away From Me. It does have excellent guitar work, but I can still imagine middle schoolers across the U.S. moshing to this at their dances (not a good thing). Sleep Now in the Fire is not a good song either, and Rage has explored too much classic rock on this one. Born of a Broken Man is my favorite here, it just reflects their old sound in a new way. Other okay songs are Mic Check, Testify, and Maria. Tom Morello still has his amazing edge as a guitar player, but the band has lost much of their politics to MTV. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"same garbage as before and the guitarist is overrated","review":"Why is it that some folks are allowed to show their racism and others are not?

The Zapatistas are not terrorists they are simply a group of people who want what is rightfully theirs. If you're going to say something about one of the causes RATM supports do a little research first.P.S. the CD's great but not as good as the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Same thing.","review":"They have a few good ones on this CD, but they all more or less sound the same.

That was the best song on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"these guys need serious cat scans","review":"Ok, first off I just wanna say there's nothing wrong with rock music that has political messages or overtones in it. U2 is one of my favourite bands of all time and their music has a lot of political references. But RATM doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Their music stinks worse than that leftover christmas ham you find shoved in the back of your 'fridge around February, and their lyrics(the audible ones) are pointless and tiring. What are these guys trying to say? Do they mean anything with their messages, or just get rich in this country while going around burning the American flag? I mean ..who are these guys' influences...Marx, Lenin, Castro? As for their music style, they need go buy the new Beastie Boys box set if they want REAL rock/rap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sounds horrible","review":"You call this music?

It's scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rap Rock cd ever","review":"This is the finest release by the pioneers of the rap-rock genre. The musicianship is unparalled and the lyrics are hard hitting. This cd captures the intensity of the best live band in the world.

There are so many good songs on it, it is a cd I listen to over and over again. They prove that they are not only rebels, they are also skilled musiscians. Some of the best songs are \\"Sleep Now in the Fire,\\" \\"Calm Like a Bomb,\\" \\"Voice of the Voiceless,\\" which calls for the freedom of Mumia Abu-Jamal, and, \\"Born of a Broken Man.\\" This is definately a well-rounded cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous (2.5 stars)","review":"Rage's fire was evidently dying when they released the Battle of Los Angeles. Instead of the undeniable power one would feel while listening to their first two albums has diminished, and Rage seemed no longer potent as a band than they did in 1993.There are a few good songs here, like \\"Testify,\\" \\"Calm Like a Bomb,\\" and \\"Born of a Broken Man,\\" but many of the songs sound like as if Rage was running out of ideas for riffs and songs, and de la Rocha's lyrics no longer were inspired by any new ideas, and most of them sound like rehashed lyrics from their 2 previous songs. I'd recommend their self titled album and Evil Empire over this one any day of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly Horrible","review":"This CD is not worth any money. There is no musical value to it, and the views are slightly lacking sense. Compared with the first CD, it has not changed at all, and the same old riffs are brought back time and time again. Perhaps if Rage hates their country so much, they should move out. I wouldn't miss the noise they call music."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a damn joke!","review":"This album is a disaster.

Also, If I could give this drek ZERO STARS I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best work, but still worth it","review":"\\"The Battle of Los Angeles\\" was the last album that RATM made with original songs. Although it's not as strong as \\"Evil Empire\\" and the unforgetable debut (self-titled) way back from 1992, it's still got that catchy groove, aggressive bite, and angry poetry from Zack's notebook. Not the best album to start on if you're looking into getting to know Rage (start with Evil Empire), but once you get what they're all about, you'll find yourself getting this one soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now THIS is how to rock!","review":"Wow.

I was extremely embarrased to support this gang of commie losers by actually buying the album. Why can't they just get rid of the \\"I hate America\\" attitude and play music. If they don't like it, they can go live somewhere else. Let's see how they like it in say....South Africa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I used to hate this band","review":"To be honest with you, I haven't even heard the entire album. I have heard the three popular songs (Guerilla Radio, Testify, the other one) and they speak volumes. The band has improved tremendously since the vocalist dropped his poser b-boy stance. Now it is possible to take what they say seriously. The singer's delivery sounds natural on these tracks, not forced as in the past.I also love their \\"Testify\\" video, directed by Michael Moore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make the frat house think?","review":"Political bombast!

Undoubtedly, one of the best albums of '99, Rage Against the Machine have extended both musically and lyrically from their previous two albums. I went to go see a Rage concert at Allstate Arena. They are the best live band I have ever seen. They possess a raw sound and bombastic energy unlike any other. During the drumroll where de la Rocha explodes back into screaming \\"Testify\\", I happened to be standing in a higher part of the arena. When it exploded into the chorus, I could just see the ocean of people bathed in this bright white light jumping up and down with Zach leaping around like a caged demon a stage. It is a sight that will forever remain in my mind. Buy The Battle of Los Angeles. It is to Rage as \\"Fear of a Black Planet\\" was to Public Enemy. Other rap/metal bands should be ashamed. Forget Limp Bizkit...this is the stuff rage is made of."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Rock & Roll Band Today","review":"Rage does not pull any punches on this one. Mic Check offers a unique vibe I have not heard on the previous two. Testify is a fitting start that sets up the album nicely. They have progressed subtlely on this effort. The best bands are the bands that do not force change(U2) but rather go with where they are truly at as a band. Can't wait to see them live. Seen them 4 times and it is easily the most powerful rock and roll show out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply rocks","review":"even after a lot of years of absence from the scene they proved they can still rock .

It's been hard for me to pick which song to play, because I like them all, so I just let the whole CD go on it's own. I wasn't really sure wheter I should have bought it, and when I did I was satisfied with my decision. If you like Korn, Limp Bizkit, and all of today's Metal-Rap band, you'll also like Rage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain wicked","review":"I am a huge Rage fan but none of there albums compare to the first debut album which is definetly one of my fave top 10 albums ever. Battle of Los Angeles isnt exactly what i expected but it definetly is worth buying if your a RATM fan.

They are sharing a room at a resort while they and their mother are travelling. The elder sister meets a young Italian man and they have intimate relations with each other. [...]The film's depiction of underage sexuality, though simulated (The actresses were of legal age at the time of filming), is very explicit and I am surprised that it passed the censors. The film also contains a violent rape scene. I also think the film is degrading to overweight people as it can be though as portraying obese people as being homely.The special features on the DVD are two theatrical trailers, two interviews with the director, and a behind the scenes look at the film.This film is unworthy of Criterion Collection treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"You have been warned! It's not the graphic sex nor the graphic, gratuitous, and kinda silly violence that makes this a movie to avoid, it's the fact that it is just plain boring.

Other reviewers extole this film and Mme Breillat's brilliance.No one is indifferent to Catherine Breillat and this is surely the highest praise.

I've wasted time on two of her films now, and this will be the last.How novel: A European prize-winner has a repulsively violent ending, coming out of nowhere but laughably and clumsily foreshadowed throughout the rest of the movie. Who woulda thunk?It doesn't make a director deep simply if she makes cheap, obvious nihilism. Of course there are those \\"sophisticates\\" who think any hint of ambiguity in an ending is evidence of brilliance. Guess I'm not that soigne.And the spectacle of the obese young girl (who's seen clutching a stuffed animal in the making-of film) having to bare her [...] for a leering camera is one of the most distasteful things I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF","review":"This movie was good, interesting, until the end where it became very strange and made absolutely no sense.

The normalization chapter is pretty short and cryptic, though it provides a good introduction to the subject. When it comes to looking up specifics, the warm fuzzy feeling from reading the book slowly melts away. Trying to look up specifics becomes a real hassle (e.g. creating relations between tables), and it doesn't go into great detail on more complex issues (e.g. installing MySQL).This is a great introductory book.

Imagine trying to learn a new computer language that has TYPOS in it. You just can't get anything done.Then they say they will touch a subject further in the book, but they never do that, instead they confuse you giving code for linux in the windows section, and code for windows in the linux one.Finally they direct you to a web site that at least in my copy, not only was an invalid web site, but when you try to look for the book in Pearson Education, it tells you they can't locate the book.PATHETICAL, this book is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the second worst PC related book i've ever read","review":"Two thirds of the book are about nothing.

Every once and a while she repeats her cute expressions, and I wasn't keen on the adultery, but its definitely a brilliantly witty book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had read reviews of this book and was looking forward to reading it. It took me a 1/3 of the way into it to start to be interested, but then it sort of lost me. I kept reading hoping it would improve, but I felt it really fell short.

The first couple of chapters were good. The middle and ending of the book were slow moving and not as interesting as the beginning.

I then purchased one for my boyfriend. The ear piece it comes with bother him so he got a different ear but he loves it too. I mean it's affordable and very easy to use.

This product has such nice features I decided to give it a try. Alas, just like all the other SMC products I have tried previously, the router just freezes for no reason. I contacted tech support and they are well aware of the problem. They gave me some unreleased flash upgrade to try. It seemed much better after the update, but no cigar. As soon as I tried to print the device froze again. Save yourself much headache - stay away from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"SMC2804WBRP-G a bit better if you turn off the Timeout","review":"Unfortunately, the reviews below are spot on... I have the same complaint for the SMC2804WBRP-G -- the print server does not work well (I bought it for the print server). Per the recommendation below, I changed the Idle Time Out to 0 (in the SMC SYSTEM Password Settings page). Some improvement printing to my HP LaserJet, though inconsistent and it depends on the size/complexity of the file. The print server is VERY, VERY slow, hence the time out issue. The router will suddenly drop the internet connection sometimes when trying to print. Annoying.

Upgraded to this model and I've had trouble with peer2peer (router locks up with too much traffic, which was a problem with previous models). I've had trouble with wireless (router locks up with WPA or drops connections randomly). The only reason I've kept it and not gone back to an earlier model is laziness.

But don't count on this baby as a print server."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speed and distance","review":"I decided to purchase this product even though the reviews were not that great. I previously owned a SMC7004AWBR and had no problems, so with that it seemed logical that I would buy SMC again. I think most people that have complained are just regular complainers or just don't know how to properly configure a router."},{"rating":"1","title":"SMC2804WBRP-G a bummer","review":"I can confirm what the other reviewer has said here, that the SMC2804WBRP-G *WILL* lose connection on your wireless client with annoying frequency, and that the ONLY way to bring it back is either a Reboot from the Browser Configuration Screen (or by unplugging it for a few seconds).I had heard good things about SMC, but this product is simply not ready for primetime.Also, unlike the other Reviewer, I had a tech support person say the OPPOSITE of the above, in that they were blaming the client for this problem.

I called the customer supports and they gave me their latest (or beta?) driver, but too bad that it still didn't work. (Oh, they have very good customer supports. Very minimal waiting time. that's another plus)Overall: if you don't need the printer port or if you have faith in SMC to come up with a working driver, this is a great buy!Since I wanted to use the printer port, and it gave me soo much trouble, I gave it a 2 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid!","review":"I noticed my review was not uploaded to the Northern Tool site. This product is very poorly packaged for its given weight, size and overall quality (it is easily damaged). Mine arrived heavily damaged - twice. Also, the replacement was missing the drawer key.

After running in these I'm convinced that good shoes really do make a world of difference. I absolutely hate running, and do it only because my job forces me to stay in shape. Up until now I've always gone with shoes in the 20-40 dollar range to run. But after trying these shoes out I actually enjoy running a little more and can really feel the difference in my entire leg. I bought these from a sporting goods store and would recommend everyone else to actually put them on and try other brands. I found other shoes that seemed more comfortable while I was standing but I went with the 2120 series because I think they had better support and would be more comfortable over long distances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asics! Please change the future models!","review":"I never bought a pair of specialty running shoes until around 2002 when I was advised to buy a pair of asics 2070s by a specialty running store. That model felt great and jumpstarted my running hobby. Since then however, every model has become progressively more uncomfortable (with the last reasonable pair being the 2090). Now they have the 2120 which was uncomfortable for me with minimal exertion. They have tightened the midfoot dramatically. I was having tingling in my feet with these after 2 miles. Was able to find 2080s for dirt cheap online and did stock up but of course they are no longer available now. Asics!

How a mature girl can be so immature (or immoral) to be pregnant with a guy she meets after hours. Is this the practice in Latin girls? Where are the anticonceptives? How does she protect from HIV, STD, and other diseases? This film is a bad example for the youngsters.

This one's about a New York architect (Matthew Perry) who is temporarily stationed in Las Vegas in order to oversee the building of a nightclub. One night, he meets Salma Hayek on line for the restroom in a casino. They enjoy an assignation. She disappears, suddenly uncomfortable for no clear reason. But she suddenly turns up 3 months later, pregnant and pouting about it. They get married. Then they start fighting. . . . Does that about cover it? Perry and Hayek were both inexperienced as lead actors in major motion pictures at the time of this movie's release (1997). Unsurprisingly, it's Hayek -- you know, the one with more talent and ambition -- who comes off much better. Her natural charisma and ravishing beauty eclipses her co-star's entire presence. Oh, I sat through the whole film . . . but then, I'd sit through a 2-hour infomercial if Salma Hayek was in it. That's not a recommendation for a general audience, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disapointment","review":"I received my dvd and not only was the cover slashed, but the disc had a slash in it so deep that it only played 10 minutes and then froze.

But alas, I can't say the same for the movie itself. How Don Roos, the acidic genius of The Opposite of Sex could have written this drivel is beyond me. Ben Affleck proves yet again that he has taken over Richard Gere's reign as the most over rated heart throb working in Hollywood. Quite a feat given that Mr. Gere is still making movies! We have seen this story a million times and there is nothing entertaining or original enough this time around to keep you from doing anything but wait for the predictable last reel to finally thread up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thud!","review":"All the ingredients are there....likable stars,a engaging script, and a compelling story. It all falls flat. The storyline, a man seeking redemption for an act he feels he committed, trying to mend the lives destroyed, and trying to find meaning in his own life. It also is the story of a young mother trying to keep a family together following her husband's death. Somehow, you get the feeling Affleck and Paltrow are sleepwalking through the whole thing(when you think of Afflecks's SNL spoof of the MTV show, Fanatic as a higher point then this movie, you know you're in trouble). Bright spots are David Galecki as Afflecks's post trauma assistant, very dry, very acerbic, and seeing Tony Goldwyn in a good guy role(although, I kept expecting him to do something evil). Very disconcerting, Jennifer Grey, post nose job, you know you know her from somewhere...... No Bounce, just a thud."},{"rating":"1","title":"So predictable movie!","review":"I don't recommend you to buy this movie unless you're Paltrow or Affleck's fan.

The best scene of this movie is when Affleck cried. But for overall, everything is predictable...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was bad","review":"I don't know what people are thinking about when they give this movie five stars. After watching the trailer you would have known everything that happens in the movie except the last 10 minutes, which are easy to predict. The movie should have gone more into his alcoholism or deeper into her life after her husband died, so we would get to know the characters more. It seems they just put out a short film with big name stars they knew would make a buck. I don't think they ever intended this movie to be any good at all. It is a shame because both actors have a lot of potential.D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick Flick Hell","review":"Prepare yourself and sharpen the razor blades if your woman brings this home to watch with you one evening. This is a romantic comedy without romance or comedy. Ben Affleck is his usual shallow character we see time and time again. Gwyneth Paltrow does her best, but doesn't have much to work with. If you've read enough reviews, you know by now Ben visits and ends up courting a widow whose husband's death he is indirectly responsible for. After about an hour of this yawnfest you'll wish you had a night out with the boys instead of cuddling on the couch. The things us men have to endure for the sake of our women is tedious and sad, but this movie is brutal torture. When she brings this home, do anything you can to get out of the house or pour water on the DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is a skipper.","review":"As far as chick flicks go, this movie just doesn't measure up. The storyline is weak, and unbelievable. Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck have both been in better films.

If you want to see Gwyneth in a good chick flick, try Sliding Doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over yet ... ?","review":"Although the family hyped this movie up, I was disappointed. The good news was that I was able to go to sleep as soon as it was over because it was quite unexciting.

Sorry family ... maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, What a load","review":"This has got to be one of the biggest piles of [junk] I have seen all year. It was interesting before I saw it. 'Guy gives other guy his plane ticket so that he can get some, guy feels guilty, guy falls in love with widow, guy can't tell widow what he did'- that is how I understood it. But then a director has to come in with his 'concept' and ruin it! I really think this movie had solid actors who, unfortunatly played dumb characters. AND THEN this thing gets a two disc set? There are movies that don't even have DVD versions out yet. Why can't we give that extra disc to them. Save space. Save your money. Don't buy this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Anticlimatic","review":"This film was so boring that at about 40 minutes into the movie I came here to read the other online reviews and my boyfriend began reading a rather thick book on Caribbean history. By the time Ben Affleck's character even met Gwyneth Paltrow's, the movie was almost too far gone to save. The beginning was that morose and uninteresting. The movement of time was not presented clearly. At first, it was not obvious that a year had passed before \\"Buddy\\" decided to seek out Gwyneth. Why he did not immediately tell her who he was is not clear. Other than the brief dog mauling \\"Buddy\\" receives, \\"Buddy's\\" relationship with Gwyneth is uneventful until she finds out who he is. Overall, the film is just too predictable from the moment \\"Buddy\\" hands his ticket over to a stranger in the airport. You know the plane will go down and the rest of the story rolls on in a nice tidy predictable fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a good movie","review":"I wanted to cry about a dozen times throughout this movie!

This is an embarassing follow-up to such a good movie like \\"sex\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth any price.","review":"What a horrid little flick. I felt slightly guilty for even spending a good $3.50 to rent it. I usually like Ben Affleck, but he was boring and pretty stiff in this one. You wouldn't even KNOW that Gwenyth Paltrow is an Oscar-winner judging from this movie. The plot was contrived and had lots of gaping holes. It also jumped to quickly from event to event and things worked out much too well in the end.

This movie was a waste of a perfectly good 106 minutes of my evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive and Disturbing","review":"I had to give it at least one star in order to do a review.Ben Affleck's character is a horrible person. He only gives up his plane ticket in order to get laid, he stalks and lies to Gwyneth Paltrow's character. He sleeps with her before even telling her that he knew her husband, yet alone mentioning that he gave her husband the ticket on the crashed plane. Then-I think the worst part-he lies to her son saying that the deceased father did not express any desire to be with his son. He denys that the father said he wanted to fly home to spend time with his son selling Christmas trees. The son is obviously hurt and this lie in no way benefits anyone. Affleck's character does it out of pure malice.SPOILER::: In the end poor Gwyneth ends up with this psycho and we can assume that the poor boys have to deal with this manipulative stalker, pathological lier and selfish #@$^#&%#.

The special features, on disc two, are very entertaining, especially the gag reel and the commentaries. Ben Affleck is very funny and enjoyable to watch.

The Bounce CD soundtrack is also excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Film is Standard Par","review":"What could have been an *excellent* film is pushed into the category of a reasonably decent one. The overall premise is largely untouched on in most films and does teach some good lessons in taking responsibility for your actions, dealing with grief, and moving on with your life. Paltrow is surprisingly good in a \\"non-glamour\\" role as a working mom, and Affleck is fairly convincing. The soundtrack is reasonably decent, most particularly Sixpense None the Richer's contribution.As far as family viewing, the film is on shakey ground. Strong profanity (including deity and one f-word) sour an otherwise enjoyable film, and a short scene with implied nudity gives the last tug on a short string.

Caroline O' Conner stands head and shoulders above the rest of the cast as Anita on this recording, while Tinuke Olafimihan makes a charming, through sometimes shrill, Maria. But Paul Manuel as Tony has an irritating hardness in his voice, one that does not suit Bernstein's lyrical score or the romanticism of the character of Tony.

The only other thing I would change would be for the zoom to be 6x, but still a great camera. I bought it on Black Friday so the price was much better too:). I would definitely buy this camera again. I have some great pictures because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good enough","review":"based on previous reviews i bought this camera as it was inexpensive compared to other canon cameras and i needed to buy a camera for my 15 year old son. this camera has v. good features as all other canon cameras have though i dont particularly like its look. However it is easy to hold the camera to shoot pictures without shaking, and the digital display is good enough i guess for a first time camera for my son. I would definitely go in for a better camera (thin and sleek one, though it would be more expensive) when i buy a camera again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera Great Pictures","review":"After hearing that Consumer Reports gave the Canon A520 a BEST BUY rating, I decided this must be a good family of cameras. It has been a joy to own and use. Easy to take pictures, easy to work and yes, it takes great pictures. It has more bells on it than I will ever use. I have been very satisfied with 4 and 5 MP cameras and have not wanted to spend a fortune for more. I just need to take pictures, review them and easily download to my computer. This does that and much, much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!!","review":"I recieved this camera as a gift about 6 months ago. I have had great experiences with it. The picture quality is amazing. The amaount at which you can zoom in on your pictures is amazing. For instance, we took a picture of a police car accross the street and kept zooming in just to see how far it would let us until it got blury. We could see what was in his backseat!! This camera never ceases to amaze me. It is a great gift! And an excellent camera for the price.

Within a month after buying it, the lens cover began remaining half closed when the power is turned on. I have to manually flick open the shutter/cover. Then, the flash began intermittently malfunctioning and now the zoom function will only work in one direction (that is, it works to \\"zoom in\\" on something, to zoom back out I have to turn the camera off and back on. To my knowledge, the camera has not been dropped or otherwise physically abused to cause these problems.I'm disappointed because I do like the photos that the camera takes when it does function properly.Fortunately, I bought it at Costco, so it's going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as Good as a Disposable","review":"Trade up!

I purchased it originally as an upgrade from an Olympus. I've had nothing but problems with it and have sent it in for repair, only to have the same problem occur after they fixed it and the warranty expired. It's sensors continuously say the batteries are low when they are brand new and charged and it won't take pictures. Slow between pictures when using your flash. If you have little kids, plan on missing all the shots when they are smiling. I won't buy another Canon after this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great... for a little while","review":"I originally got this camera for a trip to Italy and Greece. And it took AMAZING pictures while I was there. A lot of reviews complain about the quality of pictures or the graininess, but a lot of that can be solved just through browsing the manual and stepping out of the \\"auto\\" option.All was well for a about a year, until my automatic lens cover began malfunctioning. Now, every single time I go to take a picture, I have to remember to flick the half open lens cover with my finger. The camera already has a slow start-up, so this is just the icing on the cake.

When I finally get the camera to turn on I am only able to take pictures outdoors in good natural light because I can never get the flash to work inside. I have tried using different size SD cards, tried different brands of AA batteries. Nothing is fixing the problem. There are much better camera's available at a comparable price. I have missed many photo opportunities because of this poorly made camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible in low light indoors","review":"First of all, I am a reporter for a weekly newspaper. This camera travels with me wherever I go. I take both newsy outdoor photos and indoor photos at social functions. It's the latter that this camera really stinks. It is programmed to wait six seconds between flash photos, which, when you are taking photos of the mayor shaking hands with another dignitary, is an eternity. I end up taking an early safety shot then completely missing the real moment. Grrrr! It also is horribly grainy indoors, often to the point of being unuseable.But the camera isn't without some merits. Outdoors in good sunlight this little camera is fine. In fact, I've taken many good shots with it. The built-in movie mode is also very handy. Both the video and the sound are surprisingly good.The A530 may be OK for light home use, but it is not for the professional. I'm still impressed with Canon, however, and I'm looking at getting a higher level Canon point-and-shoot digital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloooooooooooow","review":"There is a recall on this camera regarding the battery door which could cause a fire and drains the batteries quickly.

Its filled with car chases which was popular back then and not so much today.I have to keep in mind too that this was 1975 and low budget.Its still is a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rollercoaster ride from the start to finish.","review":"What really struck me about this movie is that it\`s very believable.

(spoilers below)","review":"This movie had me scared when I watched it back in the seventies or even in reprisals in the eighties...The chemistry between Oates and Fonda was something great, above average for this kind of movie. The actions scene were well staged, the sense of claustrophobic doom is all over the film. We can always talk about plot holes, and there are a few of them in the movie, but they did not compromise the overall joy of watching it.The only thing was wrong was the ending. Ok, it added to the notion of sheer terror, but I think they cheated the audience just for the sake of a twisting end. Why? We were led to care about the four main characters, all of them likeable people (and with good job done by the actors), only for them to die without even a glimpse of hope to escape...

One of the most exceptional of B movie directors, and sometimes more-RACE is a most amazing ride. Originally released by Fox in widescreen-RACE is full of those great tricks of the trade--especially taking a mundane subject like a trailer/camper trip into the realms of the absurd and horrible. In the manner of method and manner--RACE treds the same territory as HILLS HAVE EYES but with more cinematic flair. Never available in digital format (nope-no laser disc)--RACE is an amazing addition to the pantheon of horror and witchcraft. It works beautifully. One can only ask where is Starrett in our horror universe? He is so under repped in dvd releases. Perhaps Anchor Bay will remedy. Thank God he is finally here with rattlesnakes, chases, bizarre characters, and an ending that kills optimism in this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Comes to DVD!!!","review":"This title has been on vhs for years and it took forever to finally come to dvd!I first saw this movie in June 1975 at the local theatre and it scared me to death.I was only 10 at the time but i think what makes it so eerie is it is very realistic something that could happen because people like this do exist in our world.Great cast Fonda the late great Warren Oates Loretta hot lips Switt and the sexy Lara Parker who also used to be on Dark Shadows.Please buy this movie!It's a true gemm!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Peter Fonda Favorite!","review":"This is another one of my favorite movies when I was a kid.

Using this stop, I am able to get perfectly identical cuts on multiple pieces. I only wish that the instructions were more clear for this stop when combined with the stick-on tape measure from Kreg. Due to the slight offset of the magnified measuring indicator on the stop, I installed the stick-on measuring tape to my jig in the wrong location so my measurements are all off by a few 32nds if I use the indicator. I might have missed that in the instructions somewhere, but if it was there in the instructions, I wish it would have stood out more so I would have caught it.

I think that this book is the best resouse (after the Bible) for young adults who face the issue of what to do with their lives. This is THE survival guide for teens. It helpes you not to mess up in you teen years, and to build a Christ centered life, that will \\"go the distance\\". This is a MUST read for 16-26 (and around that age group). This book has set my life in the direction that God wants me to go. It really changed my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigotry","review":"This book has lots of good advice for those navigating the college years.

The costume was a bit big for my daughter but the age range for the costume is 3 to 7. The stethoscope was to large for her head but she was happy wearing it around her neck. It lights up and makes noise, and she pretended that she was listening to her chest/heart. My only real complaint was the size of the mask, it is much to big for most young children.

Because that's the very basic gist of it. The author just happens to write it all so beautifully. As another reviewer put it, it's a bunch of short stories woven into a novel, but in my opinion it made the book that much more interesting.

Not to say that it wasn't good- but I expected a romance novel featuring the Wilde Women. 85% of the book is about characters in the small town. In fact only about 2% of the entire book features the Wilde Women's interaction with the men who end up with them!The author was definitely very witty, the interaction among the characters in the books well represented, but from chapter to chapter there was no real continuation. It felt like a collection of short stories connected by a shared setting.

Are all of you friends and family of the author? The book I read was not at all wonderful or hilarious. In fact, it was a CHALLENGE to finish. Paula Wall is a talented writer, but this story and the multitude of characters and changing perspectives is dizzying and just plain annoying. There is very little chance to get to know any of the individual characters and I have yet to figure out why this tale of an entire town is titled, The Wilde Women when they barely make longer than cameo appearances in the text.

It seems like the manuscript has been prepared by use of an OCR machine reading of the older 1970/1997 edition. The machine, as is to be expected, has made various mistakes. These have largely not been corrected by Verso's editor. This is incredibly sloppy work on the publisher's behalf and makes for a very serious shortcoming of this book. Some of the errors are relatively harmless, but others create ambiguities (e.g. missing quotation marks). For this reason, I would not recommend using this edition of the book as a reference or for serious study purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably Lillian's easiest book !!","review":"An extremely good Beginner's Book - easy, beautifully illustrated and very practical...

The author also says to not have any mirrors in the bedroom based on Feng Shui principles. If you do have mirrors in the bedroom, it is advised to cover them when going to sleep. It is believed that mirrors can bring in negative (not pure) energy when you are vulnerable during sleep. She also talks about having certain numbers around that are more favorable than others.

The rest is somewhat confusing advice about makeup and hairstyles and where to sit during meetings at work and where to place your phone at work and the best type of corporate logos for buildings and good luck charms and things like that. And the author's feng shui advice is VERY specific to exactly what she likes, rather than feng shui principles. And the pictures for the small living space section would show a bad feng shui room as often as a good room, but never a good room to correct the bad room.

In addition I have inspired many others to purchase this book because of my enthusiasm. There are a number of business associates who have helped me in my career and I will be purchasing the book for them as a thank you gift.

But this subdued Schone Mullerin puzzles me. Quasthoff seems determined, as the Amazon reviewer rightly notes, to turn the song cycle into an \\"intimate monologue,\\" which evens out the emotional arc and deprives us, in large part, of the miller's exuberance and joy before his doomed love afair carries him toward disaster. Quasthoff's first Schone Mullerin, for RCA, was more direct, less refined.In keeping with the singer's interpreation, the excellent Justus Zeyen, a wonderful accompanist, tones down the piano part, and that too is a bit of a shame. Fortunately, almost every other Schubert recording by the superb quasthoff exhibits more energy and high spirits."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are wonderful poems!","review":"//The poems in The Lost Land trace the history of Ireland from the time \\"after the wolves and before the elms\\" to the present.In addition, some of the poems are also about language, i.e. the effect of the imposition of English on the Irish and the idea that the words we speak today contain the memory of other languages.\\"That is what language is:a habitable grief.

The poem \\"The Necessity For Irony\\" shocked me as well, and other poems such as \\"Heroic\\" voiced those nagging feminist desires to be heroic and triumphant. In all, a complex and divining collection that rings with meaning (for women, and for poets, at least) that has trouble with the short, dense sentences that can bore after awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit too self-important?","review":"While Ms. Boland's early poems were filled with a kind of daring and surprise, this latest book seems to have settled for the mock-solemnities of someone who believes she has \\"arrived.\\" What once was spark now is ash, what once was passionate engagement now is yawning piety. One wishes her writing life weren't quite so settled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Postcolonialism by numbers","review":"This is a flat and formulaic book from a writer churning out a sort of postcolonialism by numbers, smugly confident of her direct line to the hidden truths about Irish history.

Boland was already overrated in comparison to many of her Irish contemporaries, but this is easily her worst book to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lydia","review":"This watch is not as solid as it looks.

Could be that the sternum strap provides the extra support needed to take the strain off of the shoulders3. The button for the stand deployment is at the top of the backpack and there is absolutely no way to close the stand when putting the pack on and no way to deploy it while wearing the pack (unless you have someone with you to do it for you). I tried again and again to deploy it while wearing the pack and there is just no way to do it. This is dangerous.This backpack went back immediately!I returned it and got the Cross Terrain Carrier by Evenflo.

So, finally, after one of the hardest days I've had in a long time, I went and got it. And it was the best $20 spent in quite a while. It makes complete sense to me. And I don't deem myself as highly religious or spiritual. Of course, the title is quite misleading but it's perfect marketing. The section on \\"lust\\" hit me like a ton of bricks. Of course! We constantly go after something we think will make us whole or happy...like clothes, electronics, sex. And it does make us happy...for a short time. But then it leaves us empty and wanting more. So we go after more. It's a vicious cycle! Of course, it takes a lot of willpower not to give into our desires, our wants, our addictions.

To sum it up in one sentence, the same way we worship one God, we should worship one and only one partner. In other words, have sex with only one partner, in the same way as we pray to only one God!

It is easy to use, and easy to learn all the functions and I find it very user friendly. On top of that the images are amazing. The program mode is almost fool proof, and you get great results all the time if you are just taking quick shots for WYSIWYG images.For tose fearful of the woeful reports of battery consumption, just go out and get three sets of Nickle Metal Hydride batteries and a rapid charger and you'll be set.

His rule meant that the Aristorocracy could never hope to return to France in the way they ruled before the revolution. Schom basically ignores the French Revolution and its aftermath. He tells little of the social and political whirlpool that led to Bonaparte taking power. His refusal to even acknowledge the existence of the Code Napoleon is staggering and leaves this volume with a great hole that no amount of love affairs and military campaigns can fill. The correct title should have been a military biography, but little else. A grave disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"napoleon bonaparte by a schom","review":"I give it at least one star only because it was a quick read. I think Mr. Schom's Anglophile's slip is showing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book is garbage the author really seems to hate Napoleon, and think all his genius was luck, everything about the bonapartes is evil according to this author. I'd pay more for paper towels than this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"so biased as to be untrustworthy in its information","review":"This book is so biased as to be ridiculous. Napoleon is a \\"lucky\\" general who apparently didnt have any real military talent. He is also a merciless thug. Any real achievements (ie. the napoleonic code, the scientific aspects of the egypt expedition are ignored). A worthless read"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is completely biased.","review":"Schom's book on Napoleon Bonaparte is completely onesided. It is obvious that the author hates his subject since he has not one good thing to say about him. Napoleon is portrayed as selfish and incompetent. One who never did anything right or for a higher motive than his own ends. Not only is this blatant propaganda for Napoleon's enemies, its simply untrue! Schom ignores anything positive Bonaparte did and won't even give him credit for being a good soldier! His many triumphs both on and off the battlefield are chaulked up to luck! What this book lacks is credibility. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized and Disappointing -- I agree","review":"When I bought the book here there were no reviews here yet. I came back to say what was said very well under \\"Disorganized and Disappointing.\\" I fully agree with that assessment. The part about the book being badly edited doesn't exaggerate. The maps are worthless.The book would be 50 pages shorter if the useless, confusing battle descriptions were greatly pruned. This might have been used to expand on the Code Napoleon, and other social reforms he supposedly instituted, and to add more anecdotes of his behavior which might shed light on the man. I have been told of a few by a knowledgeable French informant.Disorganized and hard to follow, one won't understand Napoleon when done - just know a few highlights of his life. And you certainly won't like Napoleon, but I don't yet know if this is a fair judgement or not. This was my first biography of the man.I don't feel that this will set the standard on biographies of Napoleon Bonaparte."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak on battle strategy, hyper-critical of Naopleon.","review":"I have read numerous better books on Napoleon. Mr. Schom easily confuses during descriptions of Napoleons campaigns and battles. This is compunded several-fold by the near total absence of maps. It appears hardly credible to me that Napoleon was as stupid or as lucky as Mr. Schom would have us believe. I'll stick to Chandler or Zweig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alan Schom is an unabashed Napoleon-basher","review":"This book was terrible. Schom's biography of Napoleon was so one-sidedly critical of Napoleon while simultaneously praising the British that I couldn't finish it. While Napoleon certainly had his faults, this book seeks to construe any available fact the author was able to dig up as a sweeping indictment of the Emperor. Pages and pages of financial figures are twisted into stinging criticisms of Napoleon's excess and largess, while entirely ignoring historical context. The author wants you to believe that Bonaparte was uniquely corrupt, rather than a product of his age. Schom's tone is so overwhelmingly negative that the reader finds it difficult to believe that such an apparently incompetent person could have possibly conquered the entirety of Europe with such a \\"reasonable\\" enemy as Great Britain standing in the way.I strongly recommend you pass over this awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pathetic Joke","review":"How starved for attention and recognition can people be! But be careful what you wish for. Schom portrays Napoleon as an incompetent, bungling general who simply stumbled into numerous victories, because his enemies were even less competent and very, very hapless. Bonaparte crushed his enemies and became emperor, during some of the most uncertain times in human history, as a result of luck and some intrigue. Sounds plausible? This book is a perfect example of self-aggrandizing, revisionist scholarship. Schom wants to look big by making Napoleon as small as possible, and it's pathetic. What a waste of knowledge in pursuit of vanity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs Wellington when there is Schom?","review":"Having read other biographies of Napoleon, and having just driven over the col de Saint Bernard, I was really looking forward to this book. The details are almost all there, but coloured with such a jaundiced view that the great man has been dragged down. Schom concentrates on the gory, the downsides, neglecting the triumphs and genuine achievements or casting such a doubt on them you begin to wonder why other authors have made such a fuss. He presents Napoleon as a Himmler or Hitler rather than a Patton or Caesar. I have rarely read a biography which was so negative towards it's principal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read This If You Want A Balanced Look At Napoleon","review":"This book is just absolutely ridiculous and is proof that ANY Napoleon book can be published because he's such a popular subject. Napoleon more than any other figure in history has been the victim of a 200 year smear campaign and is held to a double standard that no other figure in history is held to. It's almost as if he was so good at everything that people treat him as some sort of demigod and judge his actions as if he wasn't a normal human being. Nowhere can that be found more than in this \\"book\\". It's obvious that Alan Schom is in awe of the emperor but feels embarassed of that fact so wrote a book in order to convince himself that Napoleon was in fact a mortal man and not the superman of his dreams. Alan Schom is just a kid writing a book and to those of us who are well versed in the Napoleonic story this is just laughable fodder.In other words its a VERY unbalanced look at Napoleon which should be avoided by....everbody."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent and readable biography.","review":"This is the best (and perhaps only) single volume covering the entire life of Napoleon Bonaparte. It is extremely readable even for those unfamiliar with the subject as I was. I found it very engaging, well documented and hard to put down! A pleasureable read that gives insight into a most remarkable individual. Highly recommended for all levels of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"After several attempts, I gave up on this book at about page 20. It reads like a high school book report."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Best thing to being with Napoleon on Campaign","review":"Schom's attains an Austerlitz-like victory with his work here. Schom takes the reader to a higher plateau, allowing one to see Napoleon. The only thing more naive than Napoleon, is Wellington believing he was great for Waterloo. This limited edition book is worth the read and your collection, especially if you're tired of just hearing \\"here was a battle, and here is who won.\\" Schom gives us something to reflect on. After reading the book, I felt lucky that I hadn't paid triple the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much on military campaigns, too little on Napoleon.","review":"Having little familiarity with the life of Napoleon, I eagerly began reading Schom's biography. Unfortunately, even after 800 pages, I do not find feel I gained much of an understanding of this complex figure. To begin, Schom largely glosses over Napoleon's formative years, giving very few details about his years in Corsica or as a student. Once Napoleon becomes an important military figure, Schom then focuses too-exclusively on military campaigns and battles (with generally useless maps) while not delving sufficiently into the social and political environment in France. The author should not assume, as he does, that readers will be familiar with many of the details of the French Revolution, and he should include some more background on that turbulent period that saw Napoleon rise to power.Thus, while providing some education on the continual campaigns of Napoleon, the author does little to provide a well-rounded understanding of this figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Dr. Schom presents an anti-Napoleon bias.","review":"Dr. Schom has no sympathy for Napoleon and does not show an understanding of the dynamics of the French Revolution and the times. He is an excellent writer despite his bias. In his book Napoleon could do no right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"There's a difference between being critical towards a historical figure and outright hating them. Schom not only makes it clear he despises Napoleon, but at no point in the book could I tell if he was even interested in the subject he was writing about. Avoid this book at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks feeling","review":"I was surprised by the weak narrative and somewhat crude writing style. The author appeared to have a dislike for his subject which leads me to ask a question-\\"Why would he commit so much of his time to write this book?\\"Complaints: Maps, over-use of exclamation points (!!!), horrible coverage of the rebellion in Haiti and the Louisianna Purchase.Compliments: Easy book to skim through.Conclusion: look elsewhere for a Napoleon biography. The only reason I read it was because a friend forced it on me and I felt obligated. Compared to Manchester's \\"American Ceasar\\" this book is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detailed but Biased","review":"Before I read this book, I knew little about Napoleon and his times other than the fact that he tried to take over the Europe and was an excellent General. This book taught me a lot of facts, but that is all I can really say.Schom is very biased in the book, and ironically he states that he wishes, as an American since America was not involved in the war(well, there was the War of 1812), to give an unbiased review. He dwells on all of the negative things Napoleon did, leaves out,(from what I have read elsewhere) crucial information, and for the most part, ignores all of the improvements Napoleon made in France and his empire such as school, canals, emancipation the Jews etc. It also seems to me, for some completely unknown reason, Schom thinks Napoleon was lucky everytime he won a battle.I give Schom 2 stars because it taught me a lot about Napoleon and is relatively easy to read. However, if you want an unbiased book I would look elsewhere. I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbalanced and unedifying","review":"I came to this book prepared to enjoy it both because of Schom's writing style and because I am not a fan of Napoleon, sharing Schom's opinion that he was a crazy little psychopath. Nevertheless, I was quite disappointed in this book. It's not just that Schom is so very hostile to Napoleon; it's that he finds absolutely NOTHING redeeming but nevertheless makes no attempt to explain why, if this is so, Napoleon could accomplish what he did. Schom merely announces events without any analysis of why.I would not have been disappointed if Schom had given us a simple narrative history and left the analysis to the reader. I similarly would not be disappointed in a hostile attack on the emperor if I hadn't been left with the clear perception that there MUST be much that is missing. Schom can't have it both ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overall Book","review":"Found this book to paint a good overall picture of Napoleon. I am neutral on my opinion of Napoleon. I never have been able to determine if Napoleon was a hero or a tyrant. It shows his good and bad points. The book does a good job of explaining his childhood and his death. This book satisfied my interest in Napoleon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schom critiques the musicians, but never heard the music.","review":"For 100 years after the defeat of Napoleon the aristocracies of Europe castigated him and stifled the democratic movement until the horror of WW1. Schom gleefully repeats the full content of their propaganda. Napoleon, with all his faults, represented the emergence of a system of government based on merit and social responsibility. While his failures are well known, Schom fixates on his vanity. I would have preferred learning new insights into how this simple man captivated so many earnest social reformers dedicated to reinventing the role of government, or how he rewrote military tactics, or how his life affected the patterns of history. Instead I droned through pages of petty gossip and puerile tales. Irritating in its naivete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Napoleon the bungler","review":"This book presents a novel and entirely frustrating view of Napoleon as a bumbling incompetent who barely knew one end of a cannon from the other. Despite his claims to \\"balance\\", Alan Schom's contempt for the French Emperor seethes through every hastily-written and poorly-edited page. Schom is probably right in his assessment of Napoleon as a self-aggrandising power monger, but portraying him as an egregious bungler stretches the reader's patience and credulity from the outset. It also signally fails to explain how this lowly Corsican gunnery lieutenant came to rule half of Europe before his mid-30s. As such, it is an unsatisfying read, ignoring the two most fascinating questions about Napoleon for the general reader - what drove him, and how did he do it? Buy it if you feel like wading through 800 pages of dispiriting vitriol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically Accurate sometimes misses the point","review":"Over all I think that the this book was one minor flaw from being great. Alan Schom does an incredible job of presenting the facts about Napoleon's career. I found the level of detail that he goes into very helpful in providing a good history lesson and in providing me insight into Bonaparte's character.The major flaw is that on a few occasions Mr. Schom forgets what Bonaparte is trying to accomplish and critices his efforts without end justification. For example when Schom talks about Bonaparte's generals he explains that Napoleon's generals often argue with him about tactics as if this is bad. The point that he is missing is that it is Napoleon's job to make the final decision and ultimately with large groups of leaders someone, several people will question your judgement. What really counts is if you win or not in the end.Just my opinion. I think that this is a great book and a worthy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"MR. SCHOM HAS RE-WRITTEN HISTORY!!!!!","review":"Well, this \\"jewel\\" kind of reminds me of another \\"factual\\" book written by Albert GOLDMAN titled \\"The Lives of John Lennon\\". Mr. SCHOM seems to be bent on discrediting everything Napoleon said, did, or touched. Boy, I hope I start screwing up and stepping on it overseas here in Germany. I may have a chance to conquer all of Europe!!! Mr. SCHOM should have spent less time on trivial mumbo-jumbo and spent more time on researching the facts. I must admit that I couldn't put this book down because It was actually wonderful entertainment. Napoleon wasn't an angel, but he sure did alot more for France than Mr. SCHOM gives him credit for. Good cannon fodder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subjective and partisan","review":"Schom assures readers that his biography of Napoleon is objective and non-partisan because being American frees him of the prejudices, for or against, Europeans would feel for the subject.Unfortunately he doesn't deliver, instead he always qualifies the many facts in the book: Napoleon, his family, and his supporters appear as the \\"devious so-and-so\\" or the \\"piratical such-and-such\\"; while Napoleon's enemies are \\"adversaries\\" or \\"unlucky victims\\" or \\"hapless innocents\\".This is annoying in a supposedly impartial book. Schom should have toned down his attacks, and frankly admitted his dislike of the subject. Napoleon is and will remain controversial. Schom could have easily made a case against Napoleon without resorting to mere rhetoric. As it is, it feels like he wants to lure his readers into his camp.One star for the impressive list of facts, and that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed book","review":"This is all around, an awful book. Slow, with numerous grammatical errors, Schom has truly written one of the great paperweights of all time! The book is good for nothing else, other than holding down your papers, or used as a doorstop. While he may have a lot of sources in the book, he seems to omit them at critical moments (i.e. the French economy) and almost make up numbers, etc., out of his own head! Warning to anyone interested: do not buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not good","review":"This books is very easy to read but is extremely long.

One final note of caution here: the supposed review posted with five stars has the same misspellings and bad grammar found throughout his website, so I presume it is only the author patting himself on the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please!!!!","review":"This book really took a beating in the translation from Japanese to English. There is so much needless repetition in it, that it is unbelievable! It was very difficult to tie anything in it to the works of Carlos Casteneda.

The writer could have easily used this medium for more than self promotion. While I sympathize with her about her obvious problems with critics it detracts horribly from the work itself. There were very thoughtful sections of the book that were highly thought provoking but they were few and far between. Sorry if this offends the author, (as it will surely disturb \\"Little Self\\") but I am your audience and my opinion does matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book for all interested in the Maya","review":"I agree with both previous reviews. Cannot really add anything other than it was completely enjoyable to read and certainly sheds new light on many aspects of how we have viewed and are now viewing the Maya and their spectacular civilzation...so nice toknow that the longer the culture existed the better off the lot of the common people."},{"rating":"1","title":"to focused on pro side of bodybuilding","review":"the book contained good exercises, but all are available in any book or from anyone in a gym you ask, the routines were to complicated and not enough attention paid to them, escpecially for beginners or intermediates, the book focused to much on bodybuilding for pro's. if your a beginner or intermediate bodybuilder find a better book you'll only be disapointed with this, especially since the author spends a large proportion of the time talking about previous or current bodybuilders, i didnt buy the book to read about other people, the nutrition section is also useless.....i recommend one of arnies books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"If your looking for a mass building book that will cover the topic completely look no further. It isn't the most recent book written on the topic but the information given is timeless. What I liked about this book was how realistic it was. Some books I've read on mass building tell you to eat 5000 calories a day and work out like an animal. This is an over simplification of the topic that is over come by this incredible text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"Necklace could be worn by woman or man...it's beautiful!

You can't help but get the goosebumps while reading this book. It's a great book for a parent to share with their son/daughter at bed time. You both will go to sleep with a smile on your face, and it will quickly become a favorite in your home (as it is mine)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every family should see this film","review":"I saw this film at a festival, and it made me cry. Tears of anger at first and then tears of joy at the end. This is the ultimate story of redemption and teaches the power of love and tolerance. I highly recommend that everyone see this, especially if they are gay and trying to come out to their families or if someone is struggling to come to grips with a family member who has just come out. This film is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"God that was awful","review":"I rented this because I thought the plot was an interesting idea and it is an interesting idea. I know it's low budget, but it could have been done so much better. If you've got talent and a good script, you can turn low budget into something great. Sadly, the writing behind this was horrible. The dialog made me cringe. The acting is just as bad, if not worse. Finally, the sound is pretty bad too. I kept waiting for something redeeming, but it never came. The only good thing about this movie is that there were a couple of beautiful shots, but that doesn't even make it worth the $2.99 rental or the time I wasted watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible on both sides","review":"I can handle the bad camera quality because i know what low budget is like. But the horrendous script and bad acting was really hard to swallow. Also, they make the religious guy so far out there that it seems impossible to relate to in any way, so unbelievable that this will never reach them in any way...i'm not sure if his acting was that horrible or if it was the script and how they were filming but it was just bad... the lesbian sexy scene was god-awful...everything...bad bad... very disappointed because i liked the idea for the movie which is why i suffered through the whole thing...sigh glad it was free on netflicks....speaking of how the heck did it make it to netflicks???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Early Australia novel","review":"This is part of the Gubby family saga - a wonderful story by an outstanding Australian author of early Australia days.

The author seems to have a bit of Java and development knowledge but not much of knowledge as a designer or DBA. His explanation of various items are rudimentary and shallow. When he talks about Cost based optimizer and the way it is used in Oracle, it is pretty clear to me that the author is very light in understanding the basic concepts. There are also a lot of technical errors in describing various constructs and utilities. I think this book will be useful for newcomers but hardly is a \\"High Performance Tuning book\\" as the book's title says. There are much better books around. Any of Tom Kyte's books will leave this book standing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very beginner's book","review":"Before you buying it, please do take a look at the content pages. I believe every oracle dba who has over 1 year experience will be disappointed by those basic topics.I would say, it might be a good book for trainning java developers, who have to write some embeded SQL codes."},{"rating":"1","title":"underwhelmed","review":"I am sure this guy knows his stuff, but it sure didn't come through very clearly. I would recommend a re-write with a new editor. There didn't seem to be a smooth transistion from introduction to the deep dive. Examples are explanations of checkpoint and latches.By the way, the Index was horrible.Maybe it is because he came from a dev environment as opposed to systems viewpoint. Anyway, not impressed with the overall presentation, which is a shame because it looks like he has paid his dues and has something to contribute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality and very sharp!","review":"After comparing reviews and opinions on this particular watch, I came to the conclusion that this would be the best to go with. I ordered it and when it arrived, I was very impressed not only with the quality of the watch itself, but the whole package. This is a nice watch and I look forward to wearing it. It would make a great gift as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not waork after a month","review":"The watch quit working after 5 weeks. Not Happy at all.

However, if you're looking for practical information on how to make basic lampshades, I suspect you'll be dissapointed. While it does offer how-to's, they apply primarily to the (mostly small) shades pictured (many requiring oddly shaped frames, with no sources for where to get them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tupperware Super crisp","review":"The lid that came with the bottom part did not fit, no matter how hard I tried to close it tightly, it wouldn't work and I was very disappointed in the product especially since I have always been a fan of Tupperware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tupperware lettuce keeper","review":"The cover does not fit properly. Even after soaking it in hot water as suggested, it's a bear to get on and doesn't seem to stay put. The insert on my old lettuce keeper somehow got tossed out with the old lettuce, so I'm using the new insert in the old container. I've had the old lettuce keeper for over 30 years and still using it - with the new insert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I, like a lot of other people had the old \\"vintage\\" lettuce keeper that Tupperware made 30-40 years ago. Also, like a lot of other people.....mine disappeared during home moves. After \\"making do\\" with containers and realizing how much I missed the lettuce keeper.....I decided to shop for another one. Unfortunately, newer is not always better. I had trouble with the lid on this one from the beginning. Tried putting it in hot water and it worked slightly better. However, when removing it from the fridge (after lid had gotten cold)....it was impossible to get it to fit properly. So....have sent it back. Am very sorry Tupperware changed this design."},{"rating":"2","title":"christmas gift","review":"Received tupperware super crisp it in great condition and in a timely manner.

Her writing was simply awful, though. I couldn't read it for more than 15-20 minutes at a time -- I got a headache trying to muddle through it.I'm amazed this book was published in the shape it's in. I don't believe there was actually an editor assigned to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish at best","review":"Another fine example of one of my pet peeves when reading novels -- lazy or non-existent editing. I wish I had a dollar for every time (1) a character looked up (or down) and grinned (or frowned), (2) characters gathered in a circle, (3)adverbs were redundantly added (ran swiftly, hid cautiously, glared angrily, etc. etc.), (4) the word \\"faint\\" or \\"faintly\\" appeared, (5)a character moved or headed somewhere. There are many more examples of creative writing 101 errors in the novel, and they pulled met out of what promised to be a good story over and over again. I hope the writing became more polished as the series went on, but this, as written, doesn't motivate me to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more could you want?!?","review":"I was in the store a few days ago and bought this book without really thinking about it. I am very glad I did! This book has a strong female lead and thankfully, Livak is not just another perfect, blonde heroine. It is nice to find such quality of writing from a new author and I will be eagerly awaiting the next novel in this series. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good fantasy book with a unique female character as the star."},{"rating":"2","title":"This needs more than five stars...","review":"Like a lot of other reviewers, I wasn't sure what to expect out of this book. At the time, i had an overwhelming need to spend my money, and my mom was in a rush to get out of the book store, so i just kinda picked it up and bought it without too much thought. I got home, and i read it. Then i read it again. And again. And again... There are few books that make me want to keep on turning the pages (who cares about eating and sleeping?) and just read the whole thing until i found out what happened. The Thief's Gamble is one of them. This book is too good for mere mortal words. All i can say is: SEQUEL! Must! Read! Sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine but ordinary","review":"This is an ok book, but it is nothing out of the ordinary. I found the characters somewhat flat and unappealing, and the concept solid but standard fare.There is so much repetition in fantasy today, in order to be worth reading a book needs to break some molds. THE THIEF's GAMBLE does not take many risks or do anything original, though it is not bad reading, it just isn't anything special."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW.","review":"I mean it, WOW. I love fantasy books, I love the genre so much, but this made me realize why people say that we're stupid and just wasting our time with poorly written swill. It sounded good, it really did, but the writing was bad to the point of, oh, the baby-sitter club books my little sister read when she was 8. Maybe the characters were well developed, maybe the plot was unique and fresh, problem was, I couldn't get there, the first chapter was that BAD. You want decent fantasy, go read Terry Pratchett or Janny Wurts, Raymond Feist, or David Eddings, Robin Hobb is good too. Don't waste your time with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"horriable","review":"i am not even going to waste my time writing a review for this horrid book.one word BORING.and a few others.... i want my 8 hours of my life back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I really loved this book. Her characters just jumped off the page and I liked her use of dtail. It reminded me alot of my favorite thief type series, the Nightrunner series by Lynn Flewelling, where standard-type fantasy characters are done better so they seem like real people insted of just the same old stereotypes. McKenna's quote on this page shows she really cares about her story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully realistic fantasy novel !","review":"I thought this was a great book, with lots of interesting characters. Livak, is perhaps the most interesting fantasy heroine Ive read about in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calling all commas","review":"I couldn't agree more with everyone who said this book is in dire need of better editing. It would appear that the publisher had a limited amount of commas and so had to spread them out, resulting in an astonishing number of run-on sentences. For that reason, or perhaps simply because it was boring, I couldn't bring myself to finish the first 100 pages of Thief's Gamble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shelly is the man!","review":"This DVD is a must for any drummer of any age! Watching Shelly play is a lesson in musicality, taste, and finess. The personel with which he surrounds himself are exceptional also. Words cannot express the learning experience you get when you watch this DVD. My only regret is that there isn't a split screen so you could always see what Shelly is doing while watching the other musicisns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good techniques/illustrations","review":"This book is fairly basic and somewhat shorter than I had expected but has some helpful detail on technique and illustrations that were key in figuring out some stitches I was struggling with. Overall it's not earth-shattering but a nice addition to my knitting library. There are better resources out there, but I'm not opposed to having several resources to refer to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste, too many calories","review":"I rated it 4 instead of 5 as the number of calories needed to get to 55 grams protien is around 500, which i think is too much for anyone not exercising too heavily....cant blame the manufacturer, as i didnt look at the nutrition info too closely before buying.....the tase is excellent, especially compared to supplement i am using now....good choice for those not too concerned with the number of calories....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Since it's the Original Version, It's Very Good.","review":"I believe that this is an exellent movie. The changed and edited versions are no match at all. I'm glad we BSSM lovers in America (and other places too :) have these for us to view. This DVD, as well as the others, are very interesting, with good animation, and of course, Naoko Takeuchi's brilliance shines bold and true! If you're a moonie, even a new one, you'll love these! I'm fifteen and i still love BSSM! I honestly think there is never an age limit to enjoying anime. Especially since the type of anime varies quite largely. So if you're feeling unsure because you think that you're \\"too old for this stuff\\" come on! Crawl outta your shell and stand up for whatcha love! This is a great DVD! Go ahead and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ExCELLENT-BEST ONE","review":"I love the heart collection of Sailor moon, and i have to say, this is my favorite of all the sailor moon DVDS out there. It pretty much reminds me of my summer of 2004 cuz basically, i spent my entire summer with my friend Liz, watching Sailor moon. Anyway, in this DVD u meet Hotaru, a quiet girl, with a somewhat depressing air around her, and Setsuna(Who happens to be Sailor pluto) a serious and hard working woman with a soft side for Chibi-usa. The episodes are excellent, and my favorite is dfiantly the second and 1st. The first is hilrious! At least in Liz and I's opinion. And the second one is SOOOOOO sad! We were crying! WE never cry over anytihng, but we were really crying! Anyway, i hope this review helped!"},{"rating":"2","title":"alright","review":"I got this recently and its cool, fairly heavy and solid. The case is a nice bonus, and its fun to use. The only reason I don't give it five is that its hollow on the inside and it sounds like a rock is trapped in their, which is pretty annoying.

This is actually a major problem because the Kung Fu form I have for this weapon involves using the handle guard in such a way that it being loose interferes with the form. I fixed this by tying some rope right up against it on the lower side. It's fine now, but I should not have had to do that.Also, the blade is much \\"floppier\\" than expected. It is more akin to a broad sword than what you would expect in a more power based weapon like this.I also noticed the blade is not continuously solid metal all the way down the handle. The handle appears to be made of two layers of metal with an open space between them. I have never seen a sword where this is the case. It's an obvious \\"money saving\\" technique.I guess you get what you pay for, and for 50 dollars, you shouldn't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"In my opinion, this item is garbage.","review":"I didn't think the blade would be as flexible as it was, but perhaps that's my own fault (my intention was to find an actual nam dao that was not for performance, although i learned that's harder to do than i originally thought).The real problem with this item is that the quality is extremely low. I actually purchased this sword to be ready when I started learning the nam dao techniques from my sifu, but when that time came, I ended up using a Katana instead because the nam do was just not good for training. It MAY be good for performance, so that if anyone wants to train for a show this could be a good sword.The s-shaped guard is loose, it shakes when the sword moves. I treat my training tools and weapons with respect (if that even makes sense lol), but in regards to this item, it is neither a weapon or a training tool, so it stays piled under junk on my floor, the same place it's been since a week or so after I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scrap metal","review":"The only reason I bought this is because I can't seem to find anything online that's made with any quality. It appears to be made from stainless steel yet brand new out of the box parts of it are rusting. This could mean it's simply coated or contaminated steel. The blade is bent (again brand new out of the box). I bought this as a gift and after seeing it I'm going to start looking for a better version after I throw this one in the garbage. I would never insult someone who practices Wushu by gifting this item. If anyone reading this can point me in the direction to get something of quality (obviously at a higher price) I would greatly appreciate it. I'm not looking for crap below $100 which is all I can find on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"Despite Mr. Moose Hole's eloquent description, Gulden's Spicy Brown Mustard is one of the best available to spice up a sandwich, a salad, or a cooked entree, for example, a chicken dish.

She helped balance him, shared her intelligent and insightful views with him in ways that were supportive and helpful, gave up much of the life she probably envisioned with him so that he could serve his country in a variety of ways, managed his domestic and financial life alone for much of their marriage, and truly loved down to her core this sometimes difficult man.This book is a great addition to our knowledge of this complex woman.

While the sessions are short and easy to comprehend, the group-building discussion questions are thoughtful ones, and the Biblical commentary has the depth one has come to expect from Martin Marty. Probably not the best choice for individual meditation, but an excellent choice for group interaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful when studying for certification","review":"I used Skillsoft to prepare for and pass all of the other exams required for Master certification with the exception of Excel, I failed the test! When I failed I got this book and it was VERY helpful it answered a lot of questions and was easy to follow. It really is good for all level of users. However I did fail the Excel Expert exam again after studying this book. It doesn't go into enough detail about XML or about the analysis toolpack so if you are studying this to pass at the expert level, you will need another book. But for use in the office, I think this is an excellent book that I plan to keep and use as a reference. After studying a third book that my testing center let me borrow, I finally passed the Excel Expert Exam and am now Master certified. However, Linda's book was definitley helpful in getting me to that point."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book on Excel 2003","review":"The first thing that caught my eye was on the cover of the book: \\"Enables even entry-level users to rapidly build skills sets\\". I was thrilled. All of my knowledge about Excel has been self-taught, and woefully inadequate.This book is well-written with wonderful diagrams and examples, making it an excellent learning tool. I love the step-by-step instructions.The book is well-planned. Every problem I've had with Excel in the past was explained and resolved inside the pages of this study guide.Congratulations to Linda on a job well-done. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the ins and outs of Excel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microsoft Office Specialist: Excel 2003 Study Guide","review":"I found this study guide much easier to use and much more beneficial than the Microsoft Office Excel 2003 Step by Step study guide.

Most examples, starting almost from the first page, will not run under Rails 2.x, as the book was written with Rails 1.x in mind.Rails is a fast advancing technology, which makes some books quickly become obsolete. This is one of them.In short don't waste your money, and try instead something likeAdvanced Rails Recipes, which I just purchased, and which was written specifically for Rails 2.x"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books ever written on this topic.","review":"Miller's total disregard for facts is only the first of many problems with this book. Disguised as a book about the history and teachings of the Baha'i religion, it is instead a twisted polemic against the faith. Rather than objecting to Baha'i teachings on theological grounds, Miller attacks the central figures of the religion with a duplicitous ferocity not dissimilar to the enemies of Jesus in the early days of Christianity. Anyone looking for factual information will do well to look elsewhere. Even the pictures and photographs are erroniously identified"},{"rating":"1","title":"The facts, please?","review":"This book is a travesty of publishing. The photo id is inaccurate along with all of the information in the book. Mr. Miller has no regard for any factual information. The book is self-serving and bigoted. If one wants to find information about the Baha'i Faith, they are sure not to find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grossly biased polemic, but here's an excellent review pointing out and refuting its misdirections!","review":"This book is a grossly biased anti-Baha'i polemic by a longtime Christian missionary to the Middle East who was embittered because frankly, despite all his efforts, far more people were becoming Baha'i than Christian. He uses lots of half-truths that \\"seem\\" to point to a certain (false) conclusion, and then allows the reader to draw this false conclusion without, of course, bothering to offer any correction or clarification to it.An excellent review of this book (available at various Baha'i web sites, including the one I'm naming below) points out Miller's use of this technique as well as highlighting some of the other defects of the book. There are many, many far more accurate sources of information about the Baha'i Faith than this book, including plenty of objective non-Baha'i sources. Detailed review is \\"The Missionary as Historian\\" at the bahai-library.org website."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERESTING TO SAY THE LEAST!","review":"As a Christian myself, I originally got this book to further understand the false foundations of the Baha'i faith since I had a friend who was such. Thus, I echo the sentiments of others about Miller and the time he devoted in the Middle East. As with any piece of literature, please keep an open mind while reading this book and do your own research to understand and prepare for those of other religions who agree and disagree with your faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"See through thine own eyes...\\"","review":"First of all, I must say, I have not read this book. However, I could immediately detect bias and incorrect information in the summary. When it comes to education about the Baha'i faith, Baha'is believe that for justice we are to study the writings of any religion ourself and make a decision about what we believe. To see the writings through the eyes of another is unfair and misleading. The highest education and the most widespread traveling does nothing to guarantee that a person has better-seeing spiritual eyes than you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where There's a Will","review":"Another great Gideon mystery! Located in the beautiful large island of Hawaii, set around the Kona area, brings wonderful memories of my time spent there. The storyline contains twists and turns with a considerable size family of suspects. As I got nearer the end, I couldn't put it down. I just had to know what pieces were missing to put the complete puzzle together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling quality","review":"This book has the air of having been written by someone told \\"Do 130,000 words with something about bones.\\" The style is not that of early Elkins books - the first half padded with extraneous irrelevant descriptions and the end in a few rushed pages. There is a ridiculous improbability in the story which can only be hinted at without giving the plot away. Just note that any pilot knows with accuracy the compass alignment of a familiar runway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obscure Wonderful Blues","review":"Although I have seen Sonny Terry in person many times, I had never seen any footage of Reverend Gary Davis. These are two of my all time favorite artists, and here they are, together on one dvd.The clips used, unfortunately, consist of each artist sitting on a stool without an audience, and just playing a little stiffly. However, this may be the only available video of Gary Davis, who knows. I have never seen Sonny Terry perform without Brownie McGhee, so this was a little different. Great stuff, though.This dvd has more historical value than entertainment value, but, if you are into acoustic blues, this is wonderful.The dvd I received, although new, did not play very well, and skipped the middle of the disc. It played well enough, though, but if I seriously want to listen to the music, I would rather play their CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"shoot me now","review":"i saw these guys live at a ludacris/rufio/walkman/phantom planet concert and i seriously wanted to shoot myself. not only do i hate girl rock bands to begin with, the singer was so annoying. their performance in general was just really really bad, i mean the girl playing the keyboard looked like she just wanted to die. they kept playing more and more songs, more than all the other bands, it was like a nightmare that wouldn't end. her voice is annoying, no range or style whatsoever, the music has nothing going for it. if u're into courtney love and all that crud, u may like this, otherwise bail on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one good song(in my opinion).","review":"I heard the song \\"The Teeth Collector\\" and thought this band was pretty good so I bought the cd.

WOW FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am going to try to sell it at a record store and if they don't want it, the trash or craigslist free section it goes.

Curious, I listened to the CD and was absoutly blown away. The New Romance is something indie music has been lacking, and should grow in popularity over time. The songs are diverse and original, the lyrics beautiful and meaningful, all while the insturments keep a fast-paced rock sound. From the beautiful \\"Holy Names\\" to the rocked-out \\"Chemical, Chemical\\" this CD is not only memorable, but once you find it you will want to give it to everyone you know. I would compare it to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, but with a little more grace. The New Romance is a CD that I would suggest to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to reinvent the wheel","review":"There is nothing really innovative about this album, and that's actually a high compliment. A refreshingly unpretentious, nonexperimental album that is remarkably enjoyable and consistent. The riffs are strong and catchy, the lyrics are solid and the vocals edgy. The music is somewhere between punk, emo, and garage rock. A great listen when you want some kick-ass straightahead rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"After two listens, you're hooked","review":"\\"The New Romance\\" will catch you offguard at first, but give it a couple of tries. If you're anything like me, you'll find it severely catchy and almost painfully addictive. The music's post-punk, yes, but poppier than say, Rainer Maria or Sleter-Kinney. Don't be taken aback, it works really well paired with Andrea Zollo's airy, minimalist vocals. The title track is sheer bliss, but the two gems here are the action-packed \\"Chemical, Chemical\\" and \\"This is Our Emergency\\", a lilting, poppier track. This album is so cool it doesn't really care if you dismiss it or not. Smart listeners will pick up on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album - I probably know where their name came from","review":"good album - towards the top of the list of 80's post punk revival. Nothing really stands out for me, but the album - as a whole - is pretty well-rounded.And to that guy that was attributing their name to the band DADA...um...maybe...but I doubt. Especially since The Smiths released the song Pretty girls make graves on their self-titled album in 1984.OR...perhaps they took their name from the source that The Smiths took their song title from. Jack Kerouac. The Dharma Bums.Now tha tI have that cleared up. This is a good album, not great, but definitely better than a lot out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full coverage help","review":"An excellent coverage of the causes and treatments of orofacial pain. Each chapter covers a single cause, e.g. trigeminal neuralgia, or a related group of causes, e.g. fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and multiple sclerosis. Dr. Shankland clearly explains the symptoms of each disorder, in some cases mentioning a specific one that can help distinguish that disorder from another. While the author can wax technical at times, the reader should still be able to finish easily. The book is well-organized and easy to scan if one is looking for particular information. Closing chapters on medications and alternative medicines provide information on a wide range of treatment options; so the reader should be able to find help she is comfortable with, regardless of one's personal health and medicine philosophy. I found the book extremely helpful in my own search for answers about my pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good American music","review":"I got this CD right when it came out a couple of years ago, on the strength of two very good live shows and their previous effort (which I also like a lot, but haven't reviewed). I think Mark Stuart has a lot going for him as a singer/songwriter. Many of the songs here are originals, and all are very well done. They don't go in for the slick Nashville pop sound, but on this record the results are sometimes surprisingly polished (\\"Distance Between\\" being a shining example of that). \\"Marfa Lights\\" and \\"Where I Found You\\" are good traditional country songs, while \\"Wind it Up\\", \\"Damage is Done\\", and \\"1970 Monte Carlo\\" are Bakersfield-style rockers. But my favorite songs are probably the more quiet and comtemplative ones, like \\"Beautiful Cage\\" and \\"Burn Down.\\"There's a lot here to like, even with repeated listenings over the past two years. I'm looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"I bought this CD cause of the price. It should be less considering the quality of the tracks. Mostly all of the songs are the same beat over and over again.. there's no varity. Don't get me wrong there are some alright songs, but overall this CD basically stinks big time. The one thing that I find hard to believe is this is a \\"various artist\\" CD that term can be used loosely, listen to some songs online or something and you'll know what i'm talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I am really disapointed by this big book.The Title is different from what it contains.

Kim discusses and illustrates all the necessary tools and techniques from gathering green wood to making two different projects: a plant stand and a settee.Although he uses and discusses woods native to his area (Canada), especially alder, I was able to substitute local Kentucky bendable green woods, inculding poplar, basswood, and of course, willow.I found Kim's script well written and organized for its intended purpose of teaching rustic furniture making. He offered several useful techniques that aren't apparent to beginners and that saved many hours of learning from my own mistakes. An instructional booklet is included that contains detailed materials lists for the two projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all in the details...","review":"I purchased two front sprockets from JT (14T and 16T) and cannot use either... the splined bore has been chamfered on the back face where it's supposed to be a sharp square edge to locate against the step on the counter shaft and provide the proper alignment with the rear sprocket. When the OEM sprocket is slid onto the counter shaft it sits slightly proud of the end face of the counter shaft but when I slide either of these on, they both sit approximately 1/16\\" to 3/32\\" below the end face of the counter shaft preventing the proper preload of the belleville washer when the bolt is torqued.

But Katie's just an idiot. In her book, she kept calling him a pedophile(which he isn't, because he went after teenagers, not children who hadn't yet gone through puberty), and supports parents spying on their children on the internet. I really wish I could say something on her website, but I can see everyone calling me a sicko pedo, as they always do. Just because you had a bad experience it's okay to tell parents to invade their kids' privacy? No. Don't think so.Also, she complains about the objectification of women and says porn is contributing to perverted actions.

I can't imagine trying severalrecipes from the book and finding them awful unless you are doingjust that. As far as cooking with sun dried tomatoes, I believethey are an acquired taste which I don't have yet, therefore Irestrict them to side dishes until I acquire the taste or giveup on them.This book is very good at giving the basics to which you caninfuse your own epicurian taste ingredients."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good recipes","review":"I've tried most of the Meat recipes and have liked them all.

I like everything about it. It is great that it is spiral bound. I have used many of the recipes and every one of them has turned out delicious. The cooking times listed are just about right. Some of the recipes may have too much salt, so I use my judgment and just decrease it a bit. After all, it is easy to add salt at the table if necessary. However, sometimes the recipe will say to use either wine OR beef broth or something similar. That, of course, changes the amount of salt necessary, so I need to adjust accordingly. I love how the proper size of each slow cooker is mentioned for each recipe.

This gives great information on the Judeo-Christian system that our government was built upon.

Vikas Swarup knows how to tell a story, and the reading by Kerry Shale is among the best that I have experienced. Even if you saw the movie, you have no idea of the depth of the character and experiences of Ram Mohammad Thomas. When I got to the final CD I was truly sad that this story would end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Better or Worse - Just Different","review":"I bought this book because I too loved the movie, and wanted to read the inspiration. I can see why the producers chose this book to adapt; it is an enthralling story about a young hero who has managed to value integrity, hope, and friendship through a horrible life.Apart from the geographic setting, the age of the hero, and the tv show, the book's characters and events have little in common with the movie. I leave it up to the future reader to discover the differences. However I will not say the movie is better than the book, or vice versa. They were both outstanding; they complement and enhance one another. I can now more fully appreciate the choices that the screenwriter made in bringing the text to the screen, to accommodate the 3-act mythological structure.I especially recommend the audiobook version narrated by Christopher Simpson."},{"rating":"1","title":"a MAJOR dissapointment","review":"I was told that Swarup wrote this novel in four months, and wow did it show. This novel is loaded with the most cheesy, mindless accumulation of junk I have ever had to endure through. That might have been harsh, but the repetitiveness, the punch lines, and most of all the bad writing warrants it. Also, it lacks considerably in showing the reality of India's poverty. I was also told that Swarup had never even visited the slum that he writes about and that also shows. It lacks the depth and insight needed for authenticity. I view this novel as sort of like a Bollywood film--all about cheap escapism and no substance. If you're for that, then this will definitely entertained you. It, however, frustrated me more than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Good, Book Bad","review":"The movie \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is one of those few exceptions where the movie is much, much, better than the book it is based on. The academy award for best screenplay adapted from another source was well-earned, as the screenwriter took a really awful book and turned it into a compelling story.The actual writing isn't that good, but what I really did not like about the book was its relentlessly oppressive, depressing tone throughout the story. Nothing but horrible bad things happen to our protagonist and his friends. It might be reality in the slums of Mumbai, but it makes for a dreary time reading about it. I sure hope things aren't that bad for the poor in Mumbai. If they are, how could millions of the poor still be alive? I'd think they'd all be dead from some horrible calamity. If you want to read about third-world slum living, this might be a good book to read. Otherwise, watch the movie and skip the book if the story interests you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I was actually born in Mumbai and Slumdog Millionaire is one of my top 5 movies, but I read this book and was very disappointed. I expected it to be raw and beautiful like the movie, but it wasn't. It was all over the place and very hard to get into.

Calling it the soundtrack and packaging it with imagery from \\"Into the West\\" is deceiving. How many musical tracks from the film were accompanied with lyrics? Every song on this CD is.

Its only rival, in a way, are the excerpts from the 1948 London rehearsal, featuring the same exponents, which was fortunately captured on film.Make no mistake: there is no greater Fourth in existence - non plus ultra.

He teaches NONE of the new MX concepts or tools, he simply developes in MX like he would in 5 (you can do that in MX).Flash MX, which is the recently released upgrade to Flash 5, gives a game developer scores of new features and functionality and Rosenzweig uses none of it.If you really want to buy this book, buy the Flash5 version, it's cheaper and exactly the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Me-Too book","review":"It really ticks me off when publishers (in this case Que) slap a new label on an old book and call it new. ... This is indeed a Flash 5 book (as another reader mentioned - I wish I would have read their comment before I bought this book). Nothing in this book relates to MX at all.As far as a Flash 5 book, it's nice to have a games-specific book - altough it really is padded with a lot of non-flash information that can be read anywhere (i.e. video game history). Although decent, nothing special jumps out at me. It taught me nothing new from the other books on Flash I have. If this is the first Flash Book you're buying, the visual \\"Teach Yourself Visually\\" books are probably a better bet (ISBN 0764536613); if you already have Flash books, then this will probably teach you nothing new. It's a pass on both accounts.Que - shame on you. I don't plan on buying any more of your books if these are the games you play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"Even though this book was written for Actionscript 1.0, it still has plenty of life left in it. A reasonably capable Flash designer should be able to convert the script to AS 2, and probably even convert it to AS 3. If you're already a guru you may not find it as useful, but intermediate level Flashers should find plenty of inspiration. The game theory is light - just the basics - but I was more interested in the script, which it is full of.

Plans are presented for fences, cabins, barns, animal feeding stations, milking stations, shearing stations, green houses, cold frames, sheds, outhouses, cisterns, smokehouses, picnic tables and saw horses. Plus a whole lot more.The only word of caution is that quite a few of the large structures are geared to the state of origin. For example, the guest house is designed for Florida. The roof as presented will never withstand snow loads in Vermont. Likewise foundation depths; designs from Maryland will need to be extended below the frostline in colder climes. Otherwise, an incredible amount of good, useable information is presented along with several novel design approaches such as the reinforced concrete fence or the pasture drag made from old car tires.This is one of my most prized and most used books. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wit and Wisdom of Glenn O'Brien","review":"A wonderful collection of wisdom from GQ's Style Guy, Glenn O'Brien. The book is a collection/selection of wit and wisdom from his column in GQ. If you are a regular reader of Mr. O'Brien's column you may find the book redundant. However, if this is your first exposure to the Style Guy, or if you are an avid fan, then it's worth the price of admission.Essentially Mr. O'Brien offers commentary, reflections and advice on style issues, tailoring, grooming and matters of the heart. It's not a book about fashion, as Mr. O'Brien goes to some pains to explain, it's about style. Mr. O'Brien advocates that you develop your own personal style, whatever you define that as being."},{"rating":"1","title":"GQ no more","review":"The beginning of the end of GQ was the exit of Art Cooper, et al and their replacement by a new generation of editors of whom O'Brien is one.Richman andIt's not so much that O'Brien is terrible, but when you compare the writing in this book with that of Cooper and the old GQ, you see what style really is, and how far the magazine has fallen into the realm of boys magazines, e.g., Maxim.America could really use a real men's magazine again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help Keep this Man Employed","review":"It's nice to see that leftover 70's trend merchants can still make a living re-packaging their columns.

Because all the negative things about writing--envy, loneliness, uncertainty--are all that he focuses on, even though his clients (or amalgamations thereof) are wildly successful. I mean, why should I spend all that time on something that may never get sold? If I'm going to put that much time into writing, I'm going to get something out of it. I've spent more than enough time on the job, and it still isn't done. So I'll focus on the writing I'm best at--opinion, quiz games, and business procedures.

It reminded me of many forgotten methods of creating hydrogen. This book has real value.On the negative side...Mr. Peavey what were you thinking? You need to hire a good technical editor to remove all the typos. You also need to hire a graphic designer to make this book look good. The information is great for tinkerers and R&D; people like myself, but when you package it in such an amateur way it gives the impression that the content also lacks value.

To his credit, he does cover the topic well and also provides a useful bibliography and list of sources -- from the mid 80's.

As another reviewer wrote, Anakin Solo was poorly written: pretty much a curious baby who could walk and talk (barely). This gave me almost no insight into his character, which I was also very curious to read about. I would tell more, but it's been about 4 years since I read the series and I don't remember many the details or the storyline. All I remember is that it's a good, fast-paced read, and that you should definitely stick around for books 2 and 3. You won't regret it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars should be the subtitle","review":"Should be called \\"Boredom at Corellia\\" (as if the characters ever get there). To be fair I could only stomach 100 pages of this pablum infested tripe. When I think Star Wars I think action or at least I think of the primary characters. But to sit through this reincarnation of Jar Jar Binks in codex form is a test in concentration. I got so bored one time that the droning of my air conditioner stole my attention and I lost track of what I was reading. If your interested in Han and Leia's children, the Solo's family dynamics at the dinner table, and Lando's quest to find a wife through the help of the Jedi (HAHAH not joking HAHAHA), namely Luke, then sit back and enjoy what is basically Saved by the Bell: Ambush at Corellia. What crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I keep reading Star Wars novels?","review":"Does Lucas direct all the writers in these books to bring all the main characters together, come hell or high water? The plot devices used to ensure that all the characters we know and love are brought together, relatively defenseless, on Correlia are laughable - especially Lando and Luke. The Solo children might as well be trained monkeys, for all they contribute, not counting Anakin's very convenient abilities with the force. But, with all that said, the plot is reasonably interesting, once it gets going, and the cliffhanger ending did persuade me to get the next book. This one is certainly better than The Paradise Snare, which was a total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it to satisfy a Star Wars need only","review":"The idea that the new Republic needs outside help defeting a small ramshackle fleet because they moth-balled a substantial part of their fleet 14 years after winning a major battle against a galactic empire is absurd. Particularly when the Black Fleet Crisis trilogy demonstrates how strong the New Republic Navy had become only 2 years previous to this trilogy.This book is inconsistent with the other Star Wars novels in many ways and rates a zero on the feasability scale.It is worth reading only if you have read all the other Star Wars novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Han Solo is turning 50!","review":"I simply think this is definitely not the best title in the Star Wars literature. There are a lot of things I did not liked about the book but I guess the greatest dissapointments are the use (again!) of a mass destruction device, didn't we had enough with two Death Stars, World Devastators and Sun Crushers, and now this!. Other fact that disturbs me is the complete abscence of the technical fiction that makes the Star Wars Universe so special. I say, you could spend your money in a far better Star Wars book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misfire in the Star Wars universe","review":"In Ambush at Corellia, Han Solo, his wife Leia and their children go back to Han's home world of Corellia for a trade summit. But they are warned before they go that there are ominous things happening in the Corellian system and they must be careful. When they get there things are worse than they imagined as the 3 different species that inhabit the worlds are about to go to war with each other.Unfortunately, this was the dullest of the Star Wars books I've read and the poorest written. There are a lot cliches in the writing and not much life. There's too much of the Solo children and much too much of an uninteresting sub plot about Lando trying to marry a rich woman. The characters weren't right either. Neither Han nor Luke's personalities seemed correct. This was a misfire in the Star Wars universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"This book lacked excitement. I didn't like the way the characters were handled, or the plot of the book as a whole. If there was a real plot. For the most part it was an extremely dull family holiday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Action???","review":"This book stated out decent, however as the plot devoloped( which happened at the end of the book)the author seemed to purposely delay the action for the next two books in the trilogy. This book wasn't the worst but it certainly could have been much better. The Solo do go on an adventure and the author show how Anakins power is devolping. To sum it all up the book had little action and lots of plot and character building."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic cash-in, it takes forever for anything to happen","review":"Easily the worst trilogy of books I've ever read in terms of frustratingly boring pace, characters that are inaccurate to the movies or just indifferent. It was a struggle to resist the impulse to bin this without finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Book!!","review":"Oh, YEAH! My my my, this was good, although the plot development starts a little late. I liked this because it gave some good details on the planet Corellia, Han's homeworld."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"This book is exiting and fast-paced. You'll get your money's worth. This is a must for any Star Wars fan. You have got to get this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Catholic textbook available","review":"To say \\"the best\\" may sound like an exaggeration, but I don't think it is, in this case. I've homeschooled for 12 years, and I've seen a lot of Catholic educational materials in that time... some good, some bad. This excels them all. One of the most difficult things for a Catholic who is homeschooling a high-schooler is finding age appropriate materials that are written in sufficient depth and at a college preparatory level. So many of them are written either in simplistic language, or for the adult learner who has more specific, non-academic needs. This book is a must-have for anyone who is educating highly intelligent teenagers, or for the motivated Catholic adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and interesting book","review":"This book was adviced to read by a psychologist. It is interesting and helpful. And easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photoshop CS2 bible","review":"I am new to digital photography correcting and I didn't really find this book very helpful. It is full of information, if you know what is the purpose of the information. To me it seems like the on-line help that comes with the programme. I would also compare it to labels on medicine bottles......if you are a doctor then the chemical's name, proportion and mix make sense. If you are not a doctor then it is a case of \\"so What\\". If you are a \\"doctor\\" then it is just the thing for you. If you want something practical then stick to photography magazines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Index needs improvment","review":"The usefulness of great content (the content IS first rate) is diluted when you can't find what you want quickly. I tend to use this type of book to answer quick questions, and expect to be able to find the answers quickly. No matter how good the Table of Contents is, a 1,000+ page book should have a robust and well thought out index and this one doesn't. For example, the word \\"perspective\\" doesn't even appear in the index even though it is a Photoshop command and appears quite a few times in the 4 pages covering the vanishing point filter. Maybe this is something the authors could fix in the next edition..??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Reference","review":"Normally I need a manual to understand manuals, however the new edition of The Photoshop Bible is a remarkably clear, comprehensive, and enjoyable. It is an inspiring reference for everyone from photographers and designers to the generally interested. The increased coverage of web graphics was most welcome (I own previous editions of the Photoshop Bible) The authors are clearly experts with great passion for the topic; what could have been a very dry, sobering read has been really interesting and enlightening. I'm very glad I decided to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Very thorough and coherent presentation of topics, clear and easy to grasp even for somebody erratic like me. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to unveil the mystery of Photoshop. Great for beginners or intermediate learners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Es realmente estupendo","review":"Es realmente fabuloso encontrar este valioso material. Los temas seleccionados son de un alto valor sentimental e hist��rico. Un material impregnado de nostalgia, que cualquier coleccionista sabra valorar en toda su magnitud"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure why they decided to ruin this capo","review":"Had one of these for a couple years, it worked great and I loved it. Last week I lost mine somehow so I immediately went back on Amazon to purchase another. To my amazement when it got here I noticed that they had changed the design of it slightly, it used to clamp down as far as you wanted it to go, but now it just stops dead after a very small amount of travel. This means for a guitar like mine with a thin neck there is no way to secure the capo to the upper frets. So, now I've wasted $13 on nothing. Thanks a bunch idiots. Everyone do yourselves a favor and avoid this capo until they change it back to the way it used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good, serious design flaw","review":"Although the quality of the item is fine, and it is light and compact, there is one rather serious design flaw that stops me from using it... the part of the capo that makes contact with the back of the neck is too short, and also is flat and not curved. Therefore, it meets the neck in such a way that it seems very likely to dig into the neck and dammage the guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware--the sizing is off--","review":"I bought one of these capos about 3 years ago, and was very happy with its super-functional design and low profile. I lost that capo at a show, however, and endeavored to purchase an identical replacement, which this is not. This model is much wider and thus does not clamp down nearly as narrow as the previous model, so it just barely fits on the neck of my acoustic guitar when the screw is all the way tightened. For my electric guitars it is of no value. I'm not sure what they were thinking with this redesign--why limit the travel so that it only fits on guitars with the thickest necks? I thought that I had been sent the wrong model, but no--the package states that it is a universal capo for mostly all guitars. Well, unless you play a guitar with a super-fat neck then I would consider this a waste of money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great on my Gibson","review":"Bought this and the Kyser capo for my acoustic Gibson L-140 with the understanding that some reviews say it does not work on all guitars. All I can say is it works great on mine. I like the low profile of it, very unobtrusive. Also like the variable tension. It is made of plastic so I can't say how long it will last but at the price, it's a very good deal.Only problem (if it IS a problem) is that unlike the Kyeser, when not in use, you can't really stick it on your guitar's peg head out of the way. No biggy at home, but when I am a world famous touring rock star, it may prove inconvenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted","review":"I didn't want to buy another capo, but when I got my classical guitar the other capos I own just couldn't do the job. The Planet Waves capo is lightweight and easy to adjust. The adjustability was a major selling point for me. Too often other capos will bend the strings out of tune--not this one. You can give it the right amount of tension, and the guitar stays in tune every time. It's a great product I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light weighted and easy to install and adjust","review":"Buy this one and you won't be disappointed. Light-weighted, easy to installed with just one hand. I used to use the cejilla(traditional flamenco capo)because it never blocked any of my fingers and the force can be adjusted. This Planet Waves NS Capo is also easier to adjust and doesn't block fingers, and of course it is cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good design and light weight","review":"So it may be a bit premature to write a review because I've just received this item in the mail. However, this capo looks pretty tough and light weigh.I loved the design also. When I tried it on my guitar, I had a pretty positive impression on this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I really love this capo. I have a Dunlop one too and it doesn't fit my classical guitar very well. Seems well made, looks good, and is easy enough to take off and put on. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to get a capo for their classical guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"I bought this Planet Waves \\"classical\\" guitar capo to use with my Takamine classical guitar. Unfortunately, it does not work very well. The capo runs out of adjustment and does not fully press the strings down when trying to use at the 2nd and 3rd frets. The result is what you'd expect, a muffled buzz on the lower strings due to not being tight on the fret. I guess maybe my Takamine has a slimmer neck profile than what the Planet Waves classical capo was supposed to work with, but it would not have taken much to make this one work. They could have built in more adjustment or made the cushion a little thicker. I'll keep it and try to modify it myself if I can, but I was sure hoping to use it without any of that. I really like the steel string capo, and for that matter, I've liked everything I've ever used from Planet Waves (polishing cloth, circuit breaker guitar cables). But this capo is a bit disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price","review":"This capo is pretty good for the price. It stays in place and its quite easy to put into place.

Highly recommended; you definitely can't go wrong buying this capo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Capo I Have Ever Owned","review":"I have played for almost 10 years and have been through tons of capos. I purchased this capo after having been through what feels like 1000 others. I was hectic to buy because it is a screw on mechanism but was pleasantly rewarded when I found how snugly this capo fit, and it is the perfect size, No more bulky spring loaded capo. Fits right into my gig bag, or my pocket. This is an AWESOME product and I'd refer it to any player and any skill level. 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best capo ever","review":"If you are a classical guitarist or just enjoy playing on them, this is the capo for you. It is flat and wide like the neck of a classical, so there is equal pressure on each string. Furthermore, the thumbscrew tightening mechanism allows for exactly the right amount of pressure, so you don't have to worry about strings going sharp like you do with a spring-style capo. The only drawback is that it takes two hands and a little time (10 seconds) to put on. However, as a classical player, I never have to move a capo in the middle on a piece. It's either on or off, so this little drawback doesn't matter to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the heavy one","review":"The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings I want more pressure, I advise getting the NS Capo that is not \\"lite\\", I prefer that one above this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy bueno y funcional","review":"Buen producto, ligero, y funciona a la perfecci��n.

Has never failed me","review":"I'm a leisure guitar player and I bought this capo for the price. It's very affordable, and it works very well. I've never had a problem with this capo, it works well and the sound is fine, it's very easy to use and doesn't take long at all to screw/unscrew the pin to loosen the capo. I've had no problems with breakage. My only complaint is that the capo cannot be tightened to stay on the guitar while it is not in use. But this is not a huge problem as I store the capo on my dresser near my guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good capo for the price.","review":"Not as good as the G7th line of Capo but they are about half the price.

It was being used on a Squier Classic Vibe Custom Telecaster which has a pretty thin neck. I liked being able to dial in exactly to the point of playability without having to worry about tuning issues found on other capos.However, when I received mine and set to work attaching it to my guitar, I noticed it was much more stiff than the one I had used previously. Right as it got to what I felt was a proper tension, the arm snapped in half. Needless to say, I was not amused. Now I have spent money on a product that failed on it's first use. I like the design and hope that maybe mine was a fluke. But it would seem that the manufacturing process has changed. Good luck on the draw if you decide to purchase one of these for a guitar with a thinner neck. I'm sure it would be fine on a thicker neck."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Capo ever!","review":"over my twenty some years of playing guitar, I've tried every capo I could get my hands on. The only two I hadn't tried were this one and the G7. Since this was cheaper, I figured I'd try this first and then, if I didn't like it, try the G7. Never needed to try the G7... I love that the capo puts even pressure against the strings, so that they're better in tune. It's pretty quick on and off (not as fast as a Keyser, but then it doesn't pull the strings out of tune like a Keyser can). You can't put it on the headstock like a keyser, but then that's bad for your headstock finish, anyway. Also, one of my guitars has a HUGE neck. None of my other capos would fit. The NS did. It'll work on anything from a super thin to super thick neck. And it's really unobtrusive, too - really easy to play around. I highly recommend these to all my friends who are in need of a capo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"This capo is light, sturdy, small and efficient. What else do you need?

The birdbaths were quite expensive so I had a eureka moment and decided to look at heated dog bowls. I found and ordered this one and it works just fine on our deck railing. It was a little too deep so I put some bricks in the bottom so that birds could stand on them and get a drink.

They are the only bowl readily available in the area where I live so I just buy another one hoping for better performance. The good news is while they work they are a good bowl.

The thread count is a bit lacking, too. For microfiber sheets, I want a cloud-like surface. I will go for a higher priced item next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Top Sheet!","review":"I took the sheets out of the package when they arrived, washed them in cold water and dried them, as I normally would. The fitted sheet fit fine, but the top flat sheet was WAY TOO SHORT in length and in width. I have a 9\\" deep mattress that's 61\\" across (I just measured). When you add up both sides and the distance across it equals 79\\". If the sheet is really 90\\" there should be 5-1/2\\" extra on each side. The sheet doesn't even drop down far enough to tuck in. I already threw away the packaging or I would return this sheet set. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color All over","review":"The quality of the fabric is good. But there was no warning that it should be washed before use as its color was coming off. All my cloths and pajama and the mattress now have a shade of red color in them. After the first wash now it seems to be ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"So thin they could be sheer curtains!","review":"When I got these I was amazed at how incredibly thin they are. They could easily be made into sheer curtains- they are that translucent. They are soft, but they do not fit the twin bed well and I am afraid that with one big foot shove they will rip......QUITE disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"My wife absolutely hates these. They came with a hole in one of the seams, they catch your skin and fingernails, they are see through thin, and now they are balling up. My wife made me take them to the thrift store after a week of sleeping in them! I do not recommend them. They are a beautiful purple color though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheets","review":"They are really thin for summer they will work but you have to change them often and the stiching on one pillowcase fell apart after the first washing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheets? Sheers!","review":"These are not usable as sheets. Even doubled, they are very see-through. I would have returned them but Amazon's, \\"If it is not our fault\\" policy would have me pay shipping. Yeah, it is cheaper to keep the sheet set. They do make great light tan sheers. The color is consistent throughout and the pillowcases turned into nice kitchen curtains. If you are crafty, these are way less expensive than buying sheers or even purchasing the fabric to make your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sheets ever!","review":"They are very, very thin. My set arrived with several stains and an overall \\"soiled\\" look. The pillow cases both had multiple holes. A thrift store wouldn't even bother selling sheets in this condition. At least Amazon's excellent customer service makes getting a refund a painless experience. Honestly, even if the sheets hadn't been ripped and dirty I don't know how anyone could rate these above 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap quality sheet","review":"These sheets are horrible. They come off the mattress throughout the night and the quality is horrible. It is like sleeping on scrachy polyester."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinner than I expected!","review":"These sheets are very soft and silky but very, very thin. I decided not to use them on the bed but they made wonderful curtains! Not really what I'd call microfiber - they feel more like rayon."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you expect for $9?","review":"I don't know what I was thinking. I just wanted a pair of cheap sheets for the summer. I didn't realize that polyester sheets would be so hot. Also, I slipped around on the cheap fibers and the sheet didn't stay on my bed through the night (very low-quality elastic corners)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor twin sheets","review":"Incredibly thin, in fact, I had no idea such sheets even existed. They are nearly transparent. They really feel like disposable sheets, but I assume that they will survive washing. I guess that is what the \\"microfiber\\" designation means. Luckily, the sheets are for a bed that gets used 2-3 times/year, so they will probably last for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor qua;ity","review":"The micro fiber sheets were of very poor qua;ity and they came complete with stains on them. I was very dissappointed as was my wife when she opened them in front of everyone for her 40th birthday. I would look elsewhere when wanting a pair of sheets. Good Luck if you buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I usually read the reviews before I purchase any item but I needed the sheets in a hurry and merely looked at the thread count and thought it would be okay. This is one of the very rare occasions when I was disappointed with a purchase I made on Amazon. The sheets are far too thin and it is true, they do not fit well. I purchased them for a twin bed and you really can see the mattress through the sheet. The only good thing about the sheet set is that it dries very quickly. I reside in the Caribbean and although the climate is warm these thin sheets are still not good for our beds here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micofiber sheet set","review":"This sheet set is thinner than I expected it to be. It does not stay on the bed like a cotton sheet does. It would be worth it to spend a few more dollars on a traditional cotton sheet set. I would not recommened this product to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best sheets I've ever had","review":"These sheets are very very thin and seem to collect snags every time you wash them. The bottom sheet does not fit; it is far too big and comes un-tucked constantly. I ened up having to sew each corner's gathers so that the sheet stays tucked. Just not the highest quality, but ok for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good quality - Don't waist your money!!","review":"I purchased 2 sets of these sheets for my son's bed. The are so thin you can see through them and snag way too easily (not something desired with small children). Each time that I wash them they develop at least 1 new snag. They are also bigger than the sizes indicated. I purchased full size sheet sets and have a difficult time getting them to stay on the matteress. I'm glad I didn't pay more for them but do not think they are worth spending your money on. My rating F--- (I had to pick at least one star otherwise it would have received no stars)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional value for an exceptional product","review":"The price/value ratio is excellent. I've paid a lot more for sheets not even close to the comfort of these. While I cannot say how they will hold up after washing, I can say, I am very happy I purchased them. The only minor \\"problem\\" was that one pillow case was slightly larger than the other... not a biggee. If I wasn't broke, I'd buy several more of these sheets. They couldn't have come at a better time, as I got a bad rash on my back and it was sensitive to everything, except the sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"too thin","review":"I wasn't familiar with \\"microfiber\\", only \\"microfiber cotton\\". These are very, very thin. Like sheer curtains. Again, \\"you get what you pay for!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive with a lot of static!","review":"Not worth it honestly for the price. It was not what I thought it would be because I was hoping it'll be similar to 200-thread count. The fabric is like nylon and created a lot of static. I think it is good for sofas or futons and the burgundy is a nice color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really what I expected","review":"The items were delivered in a timely manner, but the quality of the product was not a good as I expected"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheet set","review":"Very unhappy with sheet set i hate them so much I wont even put them on bed Ill probably throw them away"},{"rating":"2","title":"sheets","review":"When I received these, I thought they were much too thin. But being microfiber it was just something I wasn't used to. They feel wonderful on the skin,laundered wonderfully, and seem very durable. I would recommend them to anyone. The hunter green color is also beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"the color is possibly the only good thing about these sheets.","review":"As many other reviewers noted, these sheets are very, very thin. You can see your mattress or mattress pad through the fitted sheet. And speaking of the fitted sheet, it's not very fitted. On my queen size mattress at least, it's several inches too wide, and ever so slightly too short. The extra width mitigates the lack of length, but i've still got extra material bunching up under me every night, and have to tug the corners down every few days to keep the sheet from popping off the head or foot of the bed.The only reason i'm giving this product two stars instead of one is that the ridiculously thin material is actually kinda nice on really, really hot humid summer nights. As soon as the temperature is reliably below 85 at night, these sheets will either get thrown in a box until next summer, or just thrown away."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thank you","review":"I can't recommend them. They seemed to have a finish that clung to me when I rolled over and took the bottom sheet with me, they were so light weight they bunched up a LOT...cheap, color was gorgeous, but for me, not a pleasant sleeping experience, on their way to Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad review. Taupe set.","review":"I would agree these sheets are fairly soft, like 300 thread count sheets.Some kind of big issues though:1. One pillow case has a 3 inch opening where it looks like the sewing machine \\"missed\\". Should have been caught by quality control.2. The bottom side of the flat sheet(the side that is supposed to be against your body) is very rough polyester.3. The fitted sheet fit my 16\\" deep pillow top very well. But was a much lighter shade of taupe. Noticeable.4. The pillow cases were two different shades of taupe. One was almost white! Even worse than the flat/fitted sheet difference. I can take a picture if anyone asks me to.5. The \\"taupe\\" in the picture is more of a brown/grey. The \\"taupe\\" I got is almost purple/lavender.Maybe my set was a reject, but I would not buy this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Sheets","review":"The sheets are what I should have expected for $25. The sheets are becoming worn after a few (less than 5) washes. I was looking for a good colored sheet, but I really should have gone for something in the 800+ thread count. The low price lured me in, don't let it happen to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow these are REALLY bad, not even worth it","review":"Wow, these sheets are horrible- felt like i was sleeping on a piece of rough plastic. the material used for the sheet and the pillow cases are very different- the pillow cases I don't mind so much except for the fact that they don't match the bottom sheet because they are made of different material, but the bottom sheet not only felt like plastic BUT it didn't even fit my king size bed properly.Bad design, bad material, bad deal. I highly NOT recommend this, unless you like the feel of plastic burlap on your skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously disappointed.","review":"I gave these one star because I had to. These sheets are garbage. The colors will wash out after the first washing. My blue sheets now have big permanent peach marks in them. And the corners of the fitted sheet have split. I have only had them for a month. Love the way that they feel, however the quality is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd blue color","review":"These sheets are just okay for the price. They aren't really a light blue, more of a purplish blue and they are VERY thin. They are nice and soft though and will be good for summertime. Mine did get a couple of snags after the first wash since they are microfiber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Problem with Slippage","review":"I agree with other reviewers. We've had these sheets on the bed for several days now, but we won't ever use them again. Every day, the bottom sheet slips off the mattress. And it doesn't seem to matter how carefully you put it back on again. There's something bad in the design of the fitted sheet corners. The fabric is very slippery. That may also contribute to why they slip off so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microfiber sheets","review":"These are certainly \\"micro\\" fibers. They are thin, very thin. I will in the future be more careful in the thread count, which I don't remember seeing in their ad. Most sheets list thread count."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid! Don't bother.","review":"These are going back to Amazon. They are thin, thin and do not feel nice at all. I didn't even unfold them all the way. They are so cheap that it was immediately apparent that I would never put these on my children's beds. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Let's just say for approximately $10 I shouldn't have expected anything better. I bought these for myself for a trip and they were fine but I would have been embarrassed to have them on a guest bed in my home."},{"rating":"1","title":"MICROFIBER SHEET SET","review":"THE FIRST SET I RECEIVED HAD A BROWNISH RED SPOT ON THE TOP SHEET, SO I SENT THE WHOLE THING BACK.

They slip so much, the bottom sheet comes off the bad every morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Sheets Ever!","review":"These sheets are very thin and you could almost see through them after a couple washings. They also got completely fuzzballed and worn away after only a few weeks of sleeping on them. The fitted sheet finally wore out and tore right in the middle. After only 5 months we had to throw them away. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, they're ok","review":"When I opened the product, the sheets really were soft. But when you're laying on them, they aren't very comfortable. I wouldn't buy another set again. But they were cheap, so not a horrible buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal","review":"I bought these sheets because they were on sale and it's nice to have a few extra sets. I purchased the yellow ones, they are actually more of a golden rod orangy color, so that was kind of a bummer. They are really soft though, I like the way they feel, they do however come up off the corners of the bed a lot. Otherwise great sheet set, I would buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stained my bed and pillows","review":"I like the thin durable fabric. I had no issue with warmth or fit, those were great. However, this product lost serious points in that the color bled onto my bed and pillows at all contact points(ie corners, etc). There was no liquid and it was not worse where people laid, it just bled color, over time. Even after repeated washings.In and of itself annoying. But in so far as it voided the warranty of my bed, that made it a much bigger deal"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheezy low quality","review":"I wish I hadn't wasted my money on these, they pilled up and are rough and uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"sheets","review":"I really liked these sheets .. they were thin as others suggested but they are great to sleep on when its very warm out.

A waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"stained and mismatched","review":"I received my sheets and when I opened them to put on the bed, the bottom fitted sheet was an off color from the top sheet. Then when I opened up the top sheet, right on the top was two big stains. I didn't even unfold it when I found this. I don't recommend these sheets at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Disappointing!","review":"I bought these sheets in Hunter Green queen size.Pros: the color was great, they fit my bed.Cons: the great color lasted for about 10-secs, until after one cold water wash it bled over everything - our night clothes, comforter etc. Very very thin and poorly constructed. Would not recommend, definitely not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the price sucker you in...","review":"I ordered two sets, because hey, it's so cheap, right? Cheap is right. The colors were wonderful, very rich and the feel was great as well. But my joy soon ended after I made the bed. I thought I had purchased the wrong size, but after checking it three times, I had definately ordered the queen. It was strange because the sides of the fitted sheet seemed much too large for the mattress and when you get to the corners, they don't even fit over the mattress!!! I thought I was in the twilight zone. And after considering that maybe it was just a mistake by the factory, I put on the second set I ordered.... Same exact thing. After the cost of the sheet sets and the shipping, I had paid almost $50. I feel like Pike Street should pay me $50 plus an added $20 for my frustrations. Not worth the money or my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't stay put","review":"These sheets feel nice, and they look nice. However, if you move around a bit while you are sleeping, these sheets will end up at the foot of your bed. They are so thin and so lightweight, they might as well not even be on the bed.

Upon receiving, I was instantly skeptical... the sheets are almost completely see-through... After washing, I noticed that there are numerous defects in the material in the pillow cases- like patches with lines where missing threads had been pulled out at some point in the manufacturing process. Basically what you would expect if these had been labled \\"factory seconds\\", which they were not...The redeeming quality is that the sheets do have the feel of silk at much lower cost-which is nice- just don't expect a high-quality sheet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.","review":"I don't think the Item Description does justice to just how cheap and thin these sheets are.

So obviously polyester, they feel like the old tricot sheets popular in the 70's only much thinner. I think those who have compared these sheets to silk haven't really slept in silk - sorry, but there is no comparison. I'd save my money for a really good set of satin sheets if that is what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"These sheets feel nice but do not stay on the bed at all.

Saw this on the Smithsonian Channel and decided to buy a copy so I could watch it without the commercials. I think it is a great video. I wish there were more like it. Jeremy Irons is a great narrator. The cinematography is reminiscent of the 1970's and looks astonishing. The dramatizations are fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Stuck to Straight Documentary","review":"I was looking forward to seeing this DVD, thinking that it would be a straight historical/archeological documentary. And indeed, it did have all the elements of such documentaries - computer reconstructions, expert commentary, etc. Unfortunately, the makers of this DVD must have thought that this was not sufficient, and they also included scenes that were more like historical dramas or vignettes of Hittite kings and queens. Since so little is known about these people, this was stretching the story way beyond the available material, and frankly seemed just silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"I used this to change some really stubborn beliefs that I was having trouble with for years.

While the author claims to have logged \\"counltess\\" hours in correspondence and meetings with various murderers, he has very little to show for the work that he supposedly did. Many of the quotes in this book come from sources such as statements to police or court transcripts that are publicly available. The names and crimes of the killers are already well documented elsewhere. Worse still, the style suffers from embarrassing cliches, pretentious hyperbole, and bogus moral outrage that is expressed while missing no opportunity to titillate the reader.This is a lame piece of hack work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Run, don't walk, to get this book!","review":"An incredible book, one which will stay with you for a long time after you put it down! Strangewood has one of the most imaginative premises ever conceived of in any genre, but particularly in the horror-fantasy arena where so many new books are just hackneyed rewrites of old novels. Christopher Golden has an amazing gift for creating not only a roller-coaster ride of a plot, but characters to whom you are instantly drawn and about whom you care from word one. The climax of the book will leave you drop-jawed with disbelief. I can't wait for Mr. Golden's next book to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Fantasy rarely gets this good","review":"Christopher Golden's Strangewood is a book that stays with you. At times lyrical, funny, tragic, thrilling, the novel touches the reader on a number of levels. The characters are well-drawn and I'm especially happy with what has to be one of the best written descriptions of a divorced couple that I have ever read. My only real complaint is that I really wish the book had been longer. At times the jumps between scenes happen so rapid-fire I couldn't help but think how much more time I wanted to spend with these characters. Overall, though, a really wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully twisted, but wanted more","review":"Awesome piece of fiction, but its a little sketchy in parts, however some very memorable characters! Pick this one up.

Christopher Golden's imagination knows no bounds, and nowhere is that more apparent than in this novel. This is a unique, richly drawn world that pulls you in, takes you for a ride and makes you love every minute of it, even, or maybe especially, when things take a dark turn. I've never read anything like this before or since. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Chris","review":"Christopher Golden is an odd one. I don't think there's an author out there with better premises for books than he but when you get into the heart of the story you find that he's done nothing creative with it. If throwing one odd thing after another at you is creativity, sign me up. Strangewood could have been such an awesome book but instead it's a mess. The story's potential for excellence declines the further you trod into it. The characters are shallow cliches and the conclusion is predictable. All of the books I've read by Golden are the same. Great ideas written badly. I want to give him another chance. I think he has potential but...I just don't know if I can waste my time and money on this author anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro book","review":"Great book for beginners in the field.

The cover comes with a fitted fabric outside and a foam pad for underneath. The item fit perfectly on the board and around the frame to where you snap the cover into place on the frame. Fits nice and snug so it doesn't shift. Highly recommend this product for the exact dimensions the cover is listed for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts","review":"I was disappointed with Homz over-the-door ironing board when I ordered it, the parts did not work so I had to improvise with some wire to make it work. The reviews, thankfully, warned about the thin cover so I ordered an additional cover. Imagine my surprise when a second item from this same company came without the proper parts to make the product work. It has grommetts but no straps to keep the cover on. I give it credit that it is thick but now I have to buy something to tie it on with to make it work. I'll never purchase Homz on-line again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised on the package","review":"The packaging says \\"extra-thick fiber pad\\", but it is very thin and not enough. The package also says \\"stitched elastic for snug fit\\", but the one I received had no elastic at all. There was nothing to keep the rounded end of the cover in place, so it was pretty useless as received. I ended up buying some ironing board cover fasteners from a local store to make it work. It's not the greatest, but better than nothing and it was easier for me to do this than to return it. I uploaded pictures in the product description to show how mine turned out. I kept the padding out of my old cover that had elastic, as you can see in my picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"over the door cover for ironing board","review":"Very upset regarding the quality of this product. The foam attached to the cover is not thick enough, therefore you get the impression of the ironing board on your clothes as you iron.

The sycophantic Dick-Clark-as-God writing grows intolerable very quickly.The pictures are wonderful, especially in countering the bogus \\"Grease\\" idea of 'Fifties teen clothing. The kids on Bandstand influenced fashions all over the USA in the 1950s and 1960s. The lists of songs at the end of each chapter, devoted to the decade just covered, are wonderful for nostalgia buffs. The text, however, is another matter.

Even with Ms Heyer's books, I prefer the ones featuring \\"older\\" women than 18-year-olds.I read both Lady of Quality and Black Sheep back to back. I must say that I like Black Sheep more. First of all, the contrast of what love means to a 17-year-old and to a 28-year-old is so funny and right on that I could not help but chuckle whenever Fanny (ingenue) declared her undying love for Stacy the cad. The conversations between Abby (Mature Woman) and Miles (Hero) are also full of humor and word play. Their verbal sparring is never tiresome and always witty. Ms Heyer deserved to be compared to Jane Austen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just This Side of an Old Maid Aunt","review":"When you're \\"on the shelf at 20, \\" then 28 year old Aabigail Wendover is definitely out-to-pasture.

Since then, I pick it up every few weeks when I can't sleep, need a good laugh or a good sigh, or just want to admire Heyer's spot-on period detail. The BAAth setting (bad pun) is delightful, making a smaller circle of characters, all of whom know each other.Oddly, this one seems to be the shortest of the novels, and not one Heyer herself thought was great. Who cares? Jane Austen thought no one would like Emma but herself. Sometimes authors are wrong about the reception of their books. I love Emma, and I love Black Sheep. It's the funniest and most romantic of them all. And there's something delicious about finding yourself rooting for the rebels in the book to find happiness with each other.

This new album builds on all of their previous work and takes their sound to a new level of maturity. Icon of Coil, known for their introspective (albeit sometimes seemingly juvenile) lyrics accompanied by a driving beat, has evolved to a plateau of cemented self identity. While they are standing shoulder to shoulder to such bands as VNV Nation, Covenant and Apop and even utilizing some of their colleagues sounds in homage, they have stood by their guns and etched out a unique sound within their genre of music.Upon first listen, songs like \\"dead enough to live\\" jump out as certain dance floor hits. Multiple listenings will reveal such gems as: \\"shelter\\" and \\"consumer\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give them slack","review":"Yes, the lyrics may be cheesy at times but I think the beats make up for it all. Give them some slack. I personally think what they have is great, but could be improved. I never really knew much of Icon of Coil's work but when I got this cd I couldn't stop listening to it. I like the whole \\"machines\\" theme, even though it probably isn't the most original thing in the world. Then again lots of things these days isn't. Actually, the cd quite often reminds me of the movie Blade Runner... which is a nice plus. I don't know if it reminds anyone of the same thing. I have to say hearing this cd makes me want to check out their other cds. If they were to go on tour, I'd be right there."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"This cd is exactly like the last two. Nothing innovative what so ever. Your basic generic sounding programming and no musicianship skills. Most groups atleast have fundementals. Maybe icon does too but I cant hear them. Icon continue to follow the rest. They just dont have anything interesting lyricaly where as VNV, Assemblage23, etc really have a story behind their words. Icon is all about power on the dance floor. Not to say this cd wont get you dancing, but it also keeps Icon of Coil way out of range in this genre. A perfect example of technology overpowering the imagination. Perfect title for this album atleast."},{"rating":"2","title":"IoC's best work","review":"This was actually the first Icon CD I bought, and I really liked it, so I got Serenity is the Devil and The Soul is in the Software. I was very disappointed with The Soul is in the Software...Like the other reviewers have stated, it was very linear, unimaginative, and left a very bland taste in my mouth. Serenity is the Devil was better, but I didn't find it to be anything to get excited about. Machines Are Us is head and shoulders above IoC's previous work, with more creative sounds, better rhythms, and far better lyrics, although they could still use improvement. \\"Remove/Replace\\" makes a great opening and is probably my favorite Icon of Coil song. Other standout songs on this CD include \\"Shelter,\\" \\"Dead Enough For Life,\\" \\"Wiretrip,\\" and \\"Pursuit.\\"If you're an EBM or dance music fan, you will probably like this CD.

Out on the dance floor, \\"I can't find shelter in this world, I'm searching for an other world, where I'll feel safe.\\" Brought me back to why industrial music, or \\"EPM\\" can still be on the cutting edge, by far better than the dark goth scene.

The etiquette is that if you download a file, that you should keep your client connected to the net. So that it can answer quests from others.

The story line is credible and realistic unlike (all other shooters games) the phony inconceivable rainbow six United Nations counter terror units. The weapon actions, sound effects, characters movement and image and the general graphics are all superior.Other related games I have enjoyed are the half life series, the far cry series, the F.E.A.R. series and the Mechwarrior (from Activision to Microprose and Microsoft).The only one to avoid is F.E.A.R. due to it's bad atmosphere and theme of creep and that it has nothing it does better than or as well as, lets say half life or far cry.

Clavell combines characters that descend from the two previous books in Japan of 1862. For fans of the Asian saga, Gai-Jin fits right in.Some complain of the latter half of the book and the ending without a major climax. I don't agree. It's just Clavell's style. There's really no need for a major happening in the final pages since the entire book is filled with climaxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Written competently enough, and the historical detail is impressive, but Clavell's unfortunate focus on melodrama produces characters impossible to credit. In this book, he particularly kills off characters just as their relationships are developing some momentum, preventing any depth of emotion, personality, or drama. I agree with the earlier reviewer who said that the first half was better than the second. This was not an enjoyable book, overall, far too long to produce so little resolution to its multiple plot lines. I can only think Clavell was straining to set up the sequel, and due to his death, we are only left with a disappointing failure as his epitaph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical of Clavell's quality","review":"I'm a big fan of Clavell and looked forward to reading Gai-jin, but was pretty disappointed.

This novel does not hold up to the other books in the Asia Saga. Although Noble House was one of my favorite books and I usually enjoy Clavell novels, it was an effort to finish this book. Clavell does a fine job recreating ancient Japan (I know, I lived there for many years) and the character development is sound.The problem is the reader never knows who to root for and the ending is a letdown. There are a few wonderful twists that truly surprised me and I couldn't put the book down through the first 500 pages, but the story went downhill from there and fell flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big dissappointment","review":"I used to be a fan of Clavell and now could not go past the first few chapters of this book. Authors need to write from their heart and not follow a particular theme or fad just because it seemed to work before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters makes it cumbersome","review":"There were far too many characters in this book for me to keep track of, especially Japanese characters. If the author has to make a list of characters so that you can keep them straight (which he did), there are too many. I stuck with the book even though I wanted to quit. I should have quit. It just wasn't my type of book even though there were a few incidents I enjoyed. Maybe it would have helped to have read some of his other books first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to recommend this one","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who comment on the second half/finish of the book. After over 1200 pages too much is left unresolved. I might feel differently if there was a direct sequel continuing the story of these characters, but of course there isn't one.While I still enjoyed the setting and the development of the character's view of their world and their strategy for dealing with it, it's really more of the same from Shogun and Taipan. Further, possibly the most interesting character, Tess Struan, appears in the book only through her letters written to other characters.Wish I'd read 1200 pages of something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"Gai-Jin was heavy reading. As much as I had enojyed Clavell's previous novels, the prose in Gai-Jin read like an author stumbling through a long and complicated story. Subjects changed mid-paragraph; long rambling and purple prose abutting coarse and violent actions; suspended action with long periods of inconsequntial thoughts and descriptions; rapid changes of third and first person thoughts and dialogue; rapid changes of peoples' characters; uses of aliases and new names suddenly appearing with little or no introduction, etc. etc. Finally, the plot itself held promise but was not realized. It seems that Clavell anticipated writing a sequel that never came about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gai-Jin","review":"James Clavell is a wonderful storyteller. Anyone interested in Japanese history and their rich culture should pick up one of his novels. Tai-Pan is a good place to start. The saga also encompasses the British and Chinese cultures that had such a tremendous influence over this unique country. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gai-Jin=Chore+Bore","review":"This is probably the most excruciatingly boring book I have ever read. Were it not for the $22.95 that I spent on it and my previous joy with Clavells' work, I would have detached myself from it and thrown it in the trash. The characters are shallow beyond belief, with the men fawning over the resident bimbo with nauseating chivalry. Having read it some time ago, I'm now struggling with any memory I have of this ridiculous story to vent here. Don't waste your time or money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Somewhat Tiresome","review":"I purchassed Gai-Jin years ago in the 90's but just got around to reading it. I finished it 07102008. First, it has been years since I read Clavell. When I first read Sho-Gun - back in 1977 - I didn't have the questions I have now concerning the Japanese. The two questions I have now are did they really think this way concerning politics and sex?I recommend this book as I do all of James Clavell's works. I think that people should read these in chronological order though, not in the order they were published. Though I recommend the book, I only gave it 4 stars because with 1,000 plus pages, after awhile, the intrigue, double-plots, spies plans and counter-plans become somewhat tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring","review":"I love history and was really impressed by Clavell in Shogun and Tai-Pan, though I never understood the need for renaming the true historical characters such as Tokugawa vs. Toranaga, etc...In any case - this book is horrendously slow. The last half is just being plain awful. It fills like Clavell was being paid per word and had to come up with as many of them as he could describing totally ordinary events that hardly deserve mentioning, while leaving aside so much that could be very interesting.Definitely NOT RECOMMENDED, especially if you value your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't no 'Shogun', baby","review":"I read James Clavell's other novel of Japan, 'Shogun' obsesively, and finishing all 1000+ pages in under five days. This one, on the other hand, I have attempted to read twice, and NEVER finished it. Compared to the epic 'Shogun', this book was very slow and clunky. It is based in fact - the result of the forced opening of Japan in the mid-late 19th century. however, the story is so realistic as to be dull. Truth may be stranger than fiction, but in this case anyway, it is hardly as interesting. The story itself is very coherent and easy to follow. It is just too DULL. If you are looking for another \\"Shogun\\", aside from a few interesting (stress on few) tie-ins to \\"Shogun\\", there is nothing there. Shogun was the pinacle for Clavell. This just might be the nadir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clavell has written many great novels - just not this one.","review":"Unlike Shogun or Noble House, two of my favorite books of all time, it was as if Clavell stopped writing 2/3 of the way through and someone who was incredibly rushed finished the book as fast and as awkwardly as possible. I've read just about all of Clavell's works and this one was either finished by someone else who had never read Clavell or was the work of a very sick man with a tight deadline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Typos","review":"I am a fan of James Clavell. I enjoyed the story as I have enjoyed all of his other books. Gai-Jin is the first of his books I have read on my Kindle. I could not believe how many serious typographical errors were in the e-book. Most could be figured out by context, but some were so bad the intended word was completely lost. One was nothing but numbers. It was apparent a non-English speaking person transcribed the book into electronic format. This book makes me apprehensive about buying future e-books if they are so poorly transcribed.Gai- Jin."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't recommend this book.","review":"Shogun is one of my favorite books, and I was pleased to find Gai-Jin in a used book store while I was travelling in New Zealand.Unfortunately, I just can't recommend Gai-Jin. I struggled through the first half, hoping that it would really grab me at some point, but alas, it didn't. I did a \\"spot read\\" of the second half of the book, and really don't feel like I missed anything that was really worth taking the time to finish it properly. I just never cared about any of these characters. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This is not one of my favorite Clavell books - It is longwinded and the ending (is there one ? ) is appalling"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed plot, stereotyped characters","review":"This book was unfortunately rather bad. It was full of cliched characters, so-so plot twists and offensive racial stereotyping. There seems to be little attempt to explore the culture and plenty of ways in which it exploits it. Clavell introduces all the possible racial stereotypes he can e.g. the beautiful, lustful French woman, the suicidal Japanese spy, the greedy and conniving Chinese servants, the upright English man. The list goes on. Some of the dialogue appears to be straight from a B movie. As an Asian, I felt quite offended by certain sections of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total come down from a great writer","review":"Gai-Jin, the last of James Clavel's books and in my opinion is his worst. If you are a James Clavel fan and have not yet read this book I suggest that you don't and if you are a first time reader start with \\"Shogun\\" or \\"Taipan\\". Pathetic, is the best word I can use to describe this novel. It really brought down my opinion of James Clavel as a great author."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"After reading Shogun and Tai-pan, I was expecting that Gai-jin would be of the same quality, it wasn't. The story moves far too slowly. This 1200 page novel could easily have been half that size. The story itself was a good one, but I was hard pressed to spend the time to finish it.Gai-jin may be an okay novel, but is doesn't measure up to Clavell's previous works. It's a sad end to the career of a great author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gai-Junk","review":"James Clavell's writing in Gai-Jin probably contains the worst grammar and syntax ever written by a published novelist. Once you get beyond that though, there's decapitations, rapes, castrations, the mild titillations of the 'Flower World', and a host of laughable characters. There's Andre Poncin, the syphilitic spy with the perverse heart; there's the impossibly beautiful Angelique with the hourglass waist who every man swoons over; there's the tyrannical Tess Straun (whom we never meet) who makes men and women quake with fear. There are plots within plots that are sometimes hard to follow due to Clavell's butchering of the English language. Despite all this, the book is strangely enjoyable in a depraved way. There are so many loose ends at the book's end that it is obvious that Clavell was planning a sequel. Alas, Mr. Clavell passed on and we'll never know what happened to our poor Angelique, the dashing Mr.Gornt, or the wicked Tess."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointint","review":"I can not believe I wasted a month reading this book. It has way too much sex and violence and moves too slowly. It is nothing like Tai-Pan or Noble House (which I am now reading for the second time.) I'm glad I got it at a used book store and did not have to pay full price for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous sentences","review":"i'm not a poem buff but picked this one up in hopes to inspire my artistic side. even with no experience i can tell that poe is a master, no doubt. each poem i read i start to drift off into a fantasy world, and it takes effort to come back to the words themselves! hard to believe they're just words sometimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy, like pulling teeth.","review":"Malkovich is a great actor, however, this movie drug on and on, with no apparent point except that the man portrayed is a sick individual. It left me screaming for him to do SOMETHING right, either turn his life around, or exact revenge upon the brutal rapists in the movie. I was waiting for some sort of ending to justify what was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Craziness","review":"If you are a woman, the story declares, it is normal for you to be gang raped by men who live in your neighborhood. Resign yourself to this fate. They need to vent. They need to express their frustrations. Do not seek or even desire any justice. Do not secure your home. Do not move away. In fact, try to protect the rapists' families at any cost. Fathers, accept your daughters being perpetual rape victims. Why should a movie so willingly accept (and even celebrate???) the sad fact that parts of Africa still have these attitudes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disgrace","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book and I'm glad I read the book later as my opinion on the main charater changed after reading the book. My impression of the main character....in the book....was of a man deeply flawed but not to the extent that Malkovitch portrayed him in the movie. I think that the South African accent came across as very stilted and this influenced my opinion of the man. In the book this was not so.I rate the book highly because it deals with a problem that is two-sided and does not seem ...to me ....to take a side one way or the other. A very introspective look at black/white relations in South Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Semi-successful, complex film","review":"This falls down early when we must believe that the young college student whom the professor seduces has no choice in the matter. Perhaps because it was her first film role, we don't quite believe that. However, it is the incident upon which the whole film then revolves, as the professor gets fired, moves to a rural farm and endures a harsh attack on him and his daughter. Uncomfortable scenes of dogs being euthanized are shown. The South African landscape and photography are stunning, and we do see much of why this country is such a conundrum. The new complexities of its social scene are the real underpinnings of the film and the J.M. Coetzee novel upon which it based. The extras provide context and should be watched. A thoughtful film with a few flaws, but watchable, nonetheless. You will not much like the selfish John Malkovich character, but he does a great acting job."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disgrace!","review":"Steve Jacobs so-called adaptation of Coetzee's beautiful novel is nothing less than a Disgrace. Malkovich is creepy from the beginning (made worse by a bad attempt at a South African accent) and all of the humanity of the book is gone. Not to mention that Jacobs clearly doesn't get the point! It is hards to fathom how this got any positive ratings, but easy to see why it wasn't released in the US. This is nothing less than a travesty. If you've never read the book and like soap operas you might find some redeeming quality. But if you appreciate great literature you will need to look elsewhere. It is squeamish and painful in every frame while never touching any of the deep issues Coetzee wrote about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This movie is thoroughly a waste of time. I generally like movies with John Malkovich, but with this script there was not much to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Depressing","review":"I kept waiting for this movie to reach some kind of enlightenment, but instead it was terribly depressing all the way to the end (aided by the same kind of haunting music over and over). Depressing and disturbing. If rape, attempted suicide, misuse of power, violence and mental illness aren't enough to take you down, maybe the constant putting dogs to sleep, shooting and burying them will do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace","review":"The other negative (one-star) reviewers said it way better than I could.

Go clean your garage, you'll be better off for it. A boring film about several pathetic neurotics, totally lacking in any enlightening or uplifting message.

At the start you meet stand-up comic Brett Leake and enter the world of MS. However, you soon you find yourself forgetting the illness and laughing at an expert stand-up who just happens to sit down. Leake's professionalism and talent is well-known in the comedy world but it took someone like Director Ken Sons (also a respected comic) to make it this real.Don't let the subject matter turn you off, because this films isn't really about MS. It's about meeting any challenge that life brings. Brett Leake isn't the funniest \\"handicapped comic.\\" He's one of funniest comics out there despite his illness.Leake also works clean and this movie is appropriate for the entire family.
