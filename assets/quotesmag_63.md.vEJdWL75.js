The only thing I have a problem with is you have to pull the little lock dial out and turn at the same time in order to unlock it, which can be considered a good safety feature if you have children who might want to touch the blades or play with the pieces, but not great if you have damp hands or any medical issues like arthritis in your fingers. Otherwise I love it, and am pleased with the price I paid for it on Amazon as it was much more elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife likes it.","review":"Performed above expectations.

Will work with cucumbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good concept","review":"I like having a place to store my blades and discs. It is clean and it locks (the lock is a little tricky to work). I've found with Cuisinart, you must read all the instructions, right down to unpacking the box.It is a little bulky on the counter and I wish it came in a metal color or black to match my Food Processor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The IDEA of a holder for all these accessories and parts is great but the end result needs help.","review":"The open and close broke our first try at opening it per instructions. We simply used a screw driver and removed the entire apparatus. I wish someone would invent a holder that would also hold the different type lids and that was easy to open and close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I can safely store my blades","review":"I bought this with my food processor and now I have a happy safe place to store my blades. The model of food processor that I purchased had a dough blade, sharp blade and 2 disks and this held all that came with it, including that stem for the disks, and there is room for one more blade. It has a lock on the base so I can leave it on the counter without worrying about knocking it open. I wash my blades and dry them and place them right back in the case after use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps all my blades together","review":"This product is great. I was always concerned about my grandson accidently cutting himself with the blades but with this system the cover locks. Its a much safer place to store my blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"A place for my sharp things","review":"Cuisinart blades are wicked sharp, so clearly they should be stored in an appropriate manner so you don't cut yourself trying to get at them. This is the holder that Cuisinart makes for them. It looks pretty nice, and everything fits: it holds the blades, the disc stem, and 3 discs (so the 2 that came with my food processor plus one more). I agree with the reviewer to said opening and closing the holder is a bit annoying b/c you have to pull while turning the latch. However, it makes sense that it should be a bit difficult to get into/open since it's housing *sharp and dangerous* items. This does mean that you need to take care when closing it to make sure it latches properly.FYI, the box says: \\"Holds accessories for all Cuisinart Food Processors except models DLC-XP, DLC-5 and LPP.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete product info","review":"This item only fits certain models of cusinart food processors. it should be specific as to which models!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps fingers safe!","review":"Nifty blade/attachment holder keeps sharp blades housed in counter top case. No more cutting your fingers while reaching in a drawer for your blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good accessory addition","review":"This product is well worth the effort and expense. It keeps the discs and blades neatly stored and out of the way while in the cabinet. I highly recommend this product as an addition to your Cuisinart food processor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp blade disc storage","review":"I am glad that I finally have a storage unit to hold my sharp Cuisinart Blades. I have three little kids and the thought of them getting their little hands on them always had me worried. The only design flaw is that it can be difficult to open and then lock back into place. I knew this going into my purchase and decided to take the chance as the flaw was better then not having to worry about my children.Hopefully Cuisinart is aware of the design flaw and working to fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bottom?","review":"Was surprised to find that this holder is totally open at the bottom. Do not have much space on countertops and wanted to store in the cupboard but when picking it up it's hard not to touch the slicing part of the blades that hang down, and won't keep the dust out. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade and Disk Holder","review":"This is a must if you have the food processor.

Should be a little larger to hold all of the blades I want to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy and utilitarian","review":"A good way to store the attachment discs and blades for my Cuisinart food processor. Easy to move from place to place without fear of cuts or dropping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great place to store sharp blades","review":"I would have given this disc holder a 5-star rating except that the child-resistant safety button/knob is difficult for arthritic hands to lift and twist at the same time. If I am very careful when closing it, I can avoid having the safety latch catch, but that does not always work. I wish they had an option to purchase it without the child-resistant device, for non-child older households.Other than that, it is a great way to keep sharp blades and discs organized and safe! It is well-made and stores 3 discs, a dough blade, and the chopping blade. Although it is fairly large, it is easy to keep on top of my fridge, as it is very lightweight but sturdy.This would be a great item for a household with children, with its safety device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as a organizer on the kitchen counter","review":"I bought this to store the cuisinart 9 cup blades and disc on the counter. It looks good on the counter and everything is tidy and organized. The lock thing is far from ideal. You have to pull and twist the little knob to open the box and having wet hands while cooking doesn't help! I try to leave the lid just sitting on by bringing it down slowly to prevent it from closing automatically. Be careful that the box doesn't have a bottom so maybe this holder is not as good is you need to store it somewhere else and move it around the kitchen. Overall I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defines organization","review":"This blade and disc holder is the perfect companion for my new Cuisinart. My Cuisinart of 30 years decided to expire Christmas Day so when I replaced it, it occurred to me that I ought to get a holder for all my attachments. Fortunately, the attachments from my old Cuisinart were compatible with the new model. This Disc and Blade Holder is ideal. All the attachments are visible, compactly organized and the container locks. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Safe and Convenient storage for Cuisinart cutting edges","review":"The advertising is great. The specifications read that it should hold everything from our new Cuisinart Elite 12 cup machine. It takes up a lot of space to hold some of the blades and discs with difficulty.We did not throw it away, but will if we ever see one that really does deal with the storage problems well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty much what I expected except...","review":"in order to open the cover to access the blades, there is a tiny tab that must be pulled outward in order to unlock.

The blades did not fit in the holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job.","review":"I originally thought to put everything in a tupperware container but I hated how unorganized it was looking so I was just keeping them in the cabinet until last week I opened the cabinet to have a blade flying out at me. I moved just in time as it almost got my arm and toes. Whew! It was then that I knew I NEEDED this holder. I ordered it right away and received it this afternoon. I immediately put the blades in. The design is so simple yet so amazing. I love the lock on the front however I do not like that there is no bottom, I can still cut myself on the blades if I accidentally touched the blades from underneath. I understand this would not be much of a problem if this was sitting on the counter but mine won't be, it's in the cabinet where I have to bring it down each use. I think I will be adding on a Plexiglas bottom for added safety. Overall it does it's job and keeps you overall safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy holder!","review":"I like this holder. I used to keep my processor parts in a smallrectangular, shallow basket. That made for interesting results whengrabbing for attachments. It is no longer a problem to pull out theneeded part. The only drawback is where to put this, which is moreof a personal problem. I just need to make a spot for it in my overcrowded cabinets. Some have expressed a concern about the latch.It takes a little bit of figuring out, which is a good thing, if you havesmall children. If you don't need to worry about that, there is not a need to keep the latch in the locked position. I am so happy to have at least one appliance for which I can easily find the attachments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart Blade and Disc Holder","review":"After owning my food processor for several years, I finally purchased the blade and disc holder. Keeps discs organized, clean and sharp. This purchase was long overdue. I recommend purchasing this when you purchase your food processor."},{"rating":"1","title":"disc","review":"It does not hold discs that have the stems on them which my discs do. I returned it. It may work just fine for someone who has the discs with no stems."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't fit!","review":"This is listed as an accessory for the DLC-5 7-cup food processor on special. However, it works with all Cuisinarts *except* the DLC-XP, DLC-X, DLC-5 and LPP. This would have been nice to know in advance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Could do Better","review":"So, now that we have established, in a different review, that this item will not hold the fixed-stem blades that come with the DLC-5, I have a question.WHY DO YOU STILL LIST IT AS AN ACCESSORY FOR THE DLC-5?????Can't you at least note that it doesn't accept the standard discs instead of expecting everyone to ferret out the information from the reviews?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a safety device for homes with children","review":"I am disappointed in several aspects of this item. The first is that the cutting accessories for the DLC-5 Cuisinart do not fit in the box, despite being shown as an accessory for this processor on Amazon. Additionally, it is quite large and bulky, requiring more space than the food processor itself!Most importantly, I specifically purchased this item after reading reviews about how sharp the Cuisinart cutting blades are and how great the Blade and Disc Holder is for keeping the blades away from children. This is *not* a child-proofing device. The entire bottom of the \\"box\\" is open. While the cutting edges are protected when the holder is locked and sitting on a counter or table top, you can easily cut your fingers by picking up the holder and sticking your hand inside through free access on the bottom side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personally, I don't need this...","review":"I like being organized as well as the next person, but based on the other reviews warning that this holder does not fit the blades for all Cuisinart models, you might consider doing what I have done for the last 20 years. I bought a small, rectangular plastic basket for about a dollar, and simply store my discs and blades in that. The discs sit vertically in the basket, and it's easy to pluck out the one I need. Simple and inexpensive solution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - doesn't work with the Cuisinart 7 blades!","review":"Alas, the Cuisinart 7 blades have fixed rods and so this storage unit is useless. It should NOT be listed as an accessory on the Cuisnart Amazon page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe and Sound","review":"I am the happy owner of a Cuisinart DFP-11 Deluxe 11-Cup Capacity Food Processor. My only complaint was storing the blades and disc. I use to store my blades in a drawer and cut my finger not realize that one of the blades was facing upward. This product is perfect for the type of person who likes to keep things organized as well as protected. When I saw this item I knew it would be the wisest solution for my dilemma. It is wonderful to know that my blades are in a safer place and easier to access."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a pain!","review":"I found out the hard way that the Cuisinart DLC 5 is NOT compatible with the Blade and Disc Holder - BDH-2! I suppose part of it is because I had no idea that there were ratings for this item ( way way way down the page!). I now see that others have had the same experience from many months ago and it is STILL being listed as an accessory. When I bought my Cuisinart - which I love- it was the only one shown and the Blade holder comes up with that specific style of Cuisinart. Hopefully others ordering will scroll WAY down and see my input!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Lock Construction","review":"The locking mechanism is VERY fragile and appears to be poorly designed. It requires a pull and twist of a very small dial to move the spring-loaded gears (yes, gears) to disengage the lock. It doesn't take long for the gears to slip and the locking mechanism to get stuck in a locked position. Once this happens, you need to disassemble the lock (two phillips screws) and re-engage the gears.If this happens to you, be careful not to grind the gears as you'll render the locking mechanism inoperable.I'd give this 0 stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife Likes it so What Else Matters","review":"Great addition for the food processor. There a too many sharp items not to be able so store them safely. And I hop that by storing them properly they will stay sharp longer. Good price too for a item that looks of pretty high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock Broken","review":"When I received it the lock was broken.

And they play their instruments too well. This is the type of humor found hilarious by frat boys, employees of record store chains and people who sport ponytails (sometimes all three). You can't accuse them of classism because they'd say they're \\"celebrating\\" the culture they mock. Yeah, right. Perhaps if we just ignore this band, they'll go away for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For Lovers OF Texas History","review":"As a lover of Texas history, I consider this one of my all-time favorite books. The accounts are first hand, well written, and will leave you longing for more from each character.

Although this story is reminscient by Phillip K. Dick's writings, \\"Gunn's\\" one disapointment is it lacks Phillip K. Dick's knack of using futurism as social commentary.A close second for my favorites would be \\"The Lizard Catcher.\\"Be sure to keep a close eye on these writers as I foresee future great projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have never heard such a voice...","review":"Harriet's voice is from the gods. I am a fairly knowledgeable music fan, and cannot think of a more lovely voice, period. I like this album, but perhaps give the nod to their earlier effort, \\"Blind\\". All three of their albums are quality, however, and this latest one should be added to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more traditional pop sound from The Sundays","review":"This is a nice, relaxing pop album.Its sound differs from The Sundays previous two albums a fair bit, though. Their earlier stuff was more rooted in 80s indie/dream pop, with loads of chorus FX and reverb that were like a cross between The Smiths rhythms and Cocteau Twins ethereal vibe. This one is more traditional, soundwise; reminds me of 60s & 70s middle-of-the-road pop with all the strings and folk touches.Overall mood of the album remains intimate but melancholy. Coldplay comes to mind, but gentler than that. Some of it reminds me of a US alt-pop band called Ida, but without the vocal harmonies.Songwriting is hit and miss. There's nothing here that's a chore to get through, but only 2 or 3 really standout songs such as \\"When I'm Thinking About You\\", and a bit of filler about 2/3 way through. But even the Sunday's filler is still quite nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"I love, love, love this cd. It is perfect listening for those days of first love. This is a romantic and reflective cd for The Sundays. However, my favorite song on the cd is the title song Static and Silence because it is about my birthday, July 20, Moon Day!Harriet Wheeler is easy to understand on this album and the music, as always, is great, very easy going."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great CD","review":"I actually was at someone's house while they were listening to this CD and found the music absolutely a pleasure to listen to. I asked my friend what was playing and went out and bought the CD that day; after eight years, this is still one of my favorite CD's of all time (and I have a huge CD collection encompassing a very wide range of music). In fact, whenever I have it playing, other people always ask me about it and also find the music very enjoyable. I can't really put my finger on the defining characteristics of it that make the CD so addicting, I just recommend it to anyone who likes music that is slightly reminiscent of the 80s and that is both fun and somehow relaxing at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Alt Classic","review":"Better then anything by the Smiths, The Sundays' last effort proves they have transended their idols. If you like R.E.M.'s Automatic, you will love this CD. Great to drive to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best wrap ever until it caught on fire","review":"This neck wrap has saved me from suffering through the pain of headaches and cramps for about a year now. However i am giving it 4 of 5 instead of 5 of 5 stars because I just put it in the microwave, and it promptly caught on fire even though it was only in for a minute. It was great for the time I had it. Will probably be looking into other brands for my next one though, don't want to burn my house down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark Comedy","review":"The author, James McEachin, continues to amaze me with his writing style. This book is a great departure from previous works which include, Farewell to the Mockingbirds and Tell Me a Story. The author presents a surprising twist to viewing law enforcement. The story takes place in New Jersey during a cold wintery night. It is the perfect backdrop of what is to unfolds as the authors presents a very amusing tale of what can happen will happen on a given night. This is not a lengthy book but it explores several themes includng sexism, racism, classism, isolation and cultural. These themes are explored through the eyes of the \\"...Men in Blue\\". It is without a doubt, a very entertaning and amusing account of what might happen during the course of an eight hours shift on this local police squad given the right circumstances. The story unfolds gradually but the pace picks up after a somewhat slow introduction. It is worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest","review":"I'm glad I didn't pay for it, but just borrowed it.The cops are portrayed as more unintelligent than is credible by any wild stretch, even though it is set in New Jersey. It falls well below humor into something unsettling, and seems to be a black author having his revenge on white cops. I could enjoy that if it were funny, but it is just dismal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about paranoia.","review":"I am very interested in events concerning Area 51 and felt that this would enlighten my curiosity. Instead, the author is a perfect example of an individual that gives UFOlogists a bad name. Despite the extremely poor presentation (home video cam showing a screen with still slides), the extent of the paranoia he represents as 'facts' ( eg. cellular phones are a Government ploy to cause mass histeria) are simply amazing, and the viewer, in the end, is left with absolutely no satisfaction or new information than they probably already suspect. Instead of focusing on 'Area 51' information, you will be guided through the mind of an extremely disturbed, paranoid, uninformed, speculator, who see's every action of the Government as a subversive plot against the gullible American public.

Also a great book to help revive mamories of past dives at this wonderful site.The book outlines the major sites and not only describes the dives but also takes a moment to rate how suitable some sites are for snorkeling.There are brief reviews of resturants and a short listing of where to stay, Bonaireian customs and local nitespots.The book concludes with a short section describing some of the fish, sponges and corals that inhabit the clear waters around Bonaire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information is too old to be useful","review":"This book was published in 1991. Unfortunately in November 1999, Hurricane Lenny inflicted a massive underwater storm surge on Bonaire that destroyed many of the dive & snorkel sites referenced in this book.

A song which, alone, makes it worth buying. I immediately started looking for them, and managed to have the album imported, though it doesn't include 'Keep Myself Awake'. I would have given the album 5 stars, had they stuck to the songs they're good at all the way through, such as 'Time Ago' and 'Gates of the Country'. Unfortunately, songs like 'X-Ray' seem a little too metal for them and can spoil the taste of the others.

I was just looking for a regular 2 x 2 Rubik's cube with 6 different colors. I didn't realize this until I opened the package. I wanted to return the product but when I considered the shipping costs and the restocking fee, it doesn't pay to return it. The description of the product should have been clearer about 3 sides being the same color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Rubik's Cube","review":"I found that the little kids like the Rubik's cube too but it is too big for their small hands and that they could never accomplish much. This is smaller and just the right size of sides. It is cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is a boring and ridiculous cube. For a 2x2, it only has 2 colors! There is a green side, and then all the others are pink. One side of the pink has a monkey face, and you're supposed to either solve for green, or solve for green and pink (no regard for the face), or solve for everything. But the idea just doesn't work. If you want to get a 2x2, definitely go for the rubik's ice cube. It's just like a regular rubik's cube, although the colors set-up is a little off (blue is beneath white, etc), but the ice cube is still way better than this.

This makes actually soving the cube akin to doing it in the dark. It does not make it easier, it makes it significantly harder. Eventually we added stickers to each side to distinguish them. Once done, my son needed less than an hour to figure it out on his own.

Of course, by comparison to the 3x3, 4x4, & 5x5 cubes, it's certainly a lot easier, but I am not well suited, brain-wise to solving these Rubik's cubes, though I do have fun having a go at them! I think the idea to have one side be one color, and the rest another color is very clever, and to have the Monkey face on one side helps you to solve part of the puzzle. But if even a Monkey can solve this puzzle as it says on the package, I must be sub-primate, where Rubik's cubes are concerned. I DO, however, think it's ingeniously designed, and a great entry level Rubik's cube for beginners, children, or anyone who has struggled endlessly with the classic 3X3 cube. Maybe one day I'll solve it, and have it bronzed for posterity! LOL! Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Buy","review":"I was expecting a decent 2x2 rubiks cube when i ordered it. I ordered two because I had heard that they were cheap and break easily. I was also expecting it to have six colors but it turns out that it has two colors and one side with a monkey face on it. The first broke a few minutes after i had taken it out of the package. The second one stayed together but I had to take the stickers off of an old broken 3x3 and put it on the six sides of the 2x2. Overall it is a terrible product."},{"rating":"2","title":"more please","review":"This video is based on the books by Richard P. Hobson, and is a nostalgic trip back to real frontiers and cowboys. The story is pre World War II in British Columbia, with two cowboys from the States with a dream of their own cattle ranch. Yep, there are cows and cowboys in British Columbia, with the expected moose, bear, beaver and wolves already occupying the ranch in the sky. Of course, Rich is not the usual cowboy but a socialite drop-out and maverick from the East coast, so when he manages to elope with a socialite in Vancouver, it isn't too far fetched. The story is just beginning with ranch hands enlisting in the Canadian army, forcing Rich to recruit underage boys, with one surprise, to work his infant dream. Good fun, but where's the rest of the stories? The Canadians had produced at least two seasons of Hobson's stories, so this is a revamp introduction of a very successful series.

I can receive alot more NDB in the 144 to 353 kHz range with this portable than any other radio I have owned. MW DXing has been easy with this radio, so is the selectivity of the AM bands.

The SW performance is pretty good out of the box, and the unit ships with a retractable longwire that can help improve reception. It does receive SSB transmissions, but does not have a selector to specify LSB vs. USB...you have to compensate with the fine-tune knob. This is probably the greatest weakness of the radio, along with the almost useless (in SW) scan function.

FM reception is very good and AM is about as good as my other radios. The dial light and LCD readout could be stronger and bigger. It comes with an adaptor. Sleep timer and alarm works just fine.

This one is also useless. The libraries are small; e.g., only four door styles to choose from. There is no way to \\"cut a section\\" and view an elevation.

Even if they start full-season releases of MWC now, at that rate it would be at least 2009 to get all of them!

The shapes are fun and include a good variety: arcs, bars, equilateral and scalene triangles, half circles, as well as your usuals. The weird rope idea is poorly done, though.

All the CPU does is lob the ball down field on 3rd and long plays and the receiver catches it 80% of the time regardless of coverage. What fun is that? This in itself is highly unrealistic. Don't even get me started on the other things this game does. NCAA 2006 is nothing but an arcade game, realism is thrown out the window in this one. EA does not know the meaning of AI. The only difference between the levels is the amount of cheating the CPU does.Don't waste your money, and don't make EA any more richer, its obvious they just throw these games together.

THE GRAPHICS AREN'T AS GOOD, THE MUSIC STINKS, AND THE FEEL FOR REAL FOOTBALL IS GONE. IT IS LIKE AN ARCADE GAME. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I WANT MY FOOTBALL GAME TO BE AS REAL AS POSSIBLE.

I LOVE the heisman mode, it's really cool how you can take someone through their four years in college and add more attributes to your player and see how close they are to the heisman, and hopefully win it. The graphics are a lot better then last year, and the gameplay is pretty much the same...except there aren't as many dropped passes, which is a good thing. The presentation is okay, I'm defiantly going to be missing the 2K series in football this year. I haven't been online yet, because I dont have xbox live, but from what I have heard its really good.

No, that's quite good, as a matter of fact.For me the standout track is by the Shamus Twins. There's three of them, so how can they calll themselves the Shamus Twins?

Two days later I emerged back to the real world.Instead of just showing you a story, this book challenges you to think. This is a hell of a rollecoaster. I was deeply disturbed AND surprised every few pages.In the reviews, some people said that the sequel was better - not for me. The sequel is a must read of course, but the first one is the 5-star.This book is not for everyone, though. Give it a trial read (10-15 pages) to make sure it's your style.Enjoy...

It's not really accurate to use the phrase \\"hard science\\" anywhere in connection with this book. The prose took so much effort to establish imagery that it interfered with the narrative flow. I actually wound up skimming parts of the book in a semi-desperate attempt to see if it got any better. It didn't.Not my thing, although folks who enjoy Bill Burroughs might give it a whirl. For what it's worth, the next book in the series, \\"A Signal Shattered\\", is even more disjointed.If you are expecting hard science fiction in the sense of Niven or Clarke, stay away. I don't buy the PKD comparison, either. I've been devouring every Phil Dick book I could find since 1969. Dick wrote some muddled-reality sequences to cover when his characters were going through a crisis period, but in this case the whole book is written in that style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking Through Bubbles, Darkly","review":"This is really the type of book that I shouldn't read. With enough fear of the corporate agenda being forced down our throats right now, this book presents a dark future. The fact that most of this story takes place in VR seems to confuse at first but begins to add to the drama and intrigue of the story. My favourite part of this book is when Jack makes contact with an alien species - only to find out that the corporate hostilities on earth are going on out there in the Universe, as well. Very encouraging. A dark glimpse at a possible future. I'm glad I got the sequel, \\"A Signal Shattered\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An ok idea, but terrible writing","review":"The overall ideas are good, both the major premise driving the story as well as the bubble environments used for research and some interaction. I particularly enjoyed the panic the lead character experiences the few times he's forced to communicate without the available metaphors that are typically generated for him when he uses his bubble.But that is all there is to enjoy. The writing is simply amateurish, and certain key associations are beaten to death...This is a second draft, not a finished book. At times it was so difficult to read I had to put it down and read some magazine article simply to be able to trudge on and find out the ending. I can't get myself to read the sequel, even though I did finish this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic read","review":"Nylund really did a great job with this book.

Hmm.","review":"Amazon referred this book to me as one that William Gibson fans liked. If that's how you found it, keep looking-- although I don't doubt that anybody who likes this book probably likes William Gibson.The plot moved along, sure. There was some of the grittiness that you expect from Gibson or Shirley, and Nylund tried hard, without quite succeeding, to make it ring true. What was most annoying about the book, though, more than the fake street-smarts, was how friggin STUPID the protagonist was. No way a street kid-turned-spook would give an unknown alien what Jack was passing out. By the end, I was mostly reading the book in the hope that Jack would get what he had coming, but no such luck.Hang in there.

I researched numerous travel radios in all price ranges and various web sites: Grundig's G2000A was the winner. Not.First, reception on any short-wave band is non-existent and the lo-fi FM sound was an even greater disappointment. To date, hubby, master of all bathroom radios, uses only one FM station and occasionally one AM station. Worse yet, he still travels with his Sharper Image radio, which cost half as much and has many more useful features as a radio and, of course, its quality sound and reception leave the G2000A biting the dust.Finally, the G2000A's fine leather cover with its fancy logo interferes with operation of the radio, so it rests peacefully in a closet.

Every fan has a dream of becoming close or special to the one they adore. Most fans never get to do this;some just get to meet their idol and rarely does one actually become a friend. Kris Smith ,at one time, was just like any other fan, but circumstance and Deforest Kelley's genuine kindness, allowed her not only to become close to him and his wife, but also, at the end of his life, to become his principal caregiver. Not many would be able to be as strong as she was when he was dying, but almost every fan who reads this book will vicariously enjoy what it is like to admire someone from a distance and then to evolve from a fan to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertised","review":"The product was fine but the retailer falsely advertises.

The music making that is achieved here rivals any of Beethoven's other late Piano works. The skill that Konstantin Scherbakov displays as a musician is simply beautiful. His fiery pianism makes you completely forget about the fact that this was originally composed for a full orchestra (granted the Lisztian embellishments may not sit with Beethoven purists). I have found this to be true with all of Scherbakov's interpretations of the Beethoven-Liszt Symphonies (#'s 1+3, 2+5, and 4+6). I recommend all of these recordings wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant adaptation, splendid performance","review":"I heard this over the radio. When it was announced I sneered at the thought of a symphony, and a choral one at that, being reduced to being played on a single instrument. When I heard it, I was stunned and overwhelmed.The only places the transcription fell short was in the opening of the second movement, and in the \\"ethereal\\" passages of the last. I plan to get transcription of all the Beethoven symphonies. At the cost, they are a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting document, but...","review":"This is a very different reading of the transcription of 9th. But, I prefer much too the 5th Symphony transc.. Because, in this recording Scherbakov played a little calm, I think. However it could be more wild, exciting tempos... OK, his technique is good, but musiquality is not enough, I think. For example, the latest finale, Prestissimo is too calm. When I listen that transcription, I think like that this symphony not written for orchestra originally, but for piano! He is played like that style. And the 3rd slow, heavenly movement could be more singing, meditative. (But really, only Glenn Gould could do that!) But however, the sound quality is excellent. Naxos' latest CDs' has really amazing quality.So, at this price, this is a worthlistening for anyone which search a different perspective of this monumental symphony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple lyrics, complex harmonies, not just fluff, though","review":"Great light background music AND great for serious listening, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Celtic for the Soul","review":"I had the privilage of hearing Sheila Walsh both speak and sing live at the Woman of Faith conference of 2000, and bought her CD the very same day.

Her voice is absolutely angelic, the words to her songs powerful and moving, especially \\"Beautiful, Scandalous Night,\\" which I loved so much, I played until I learned all the words.

I loved that each chapter was in another phase of her life, career, and romantic journey. Coincidentally she seems to be roughly my age, so I had fun recognizing the fashions and mentality of each era she wrote of. Hilarious lines -that I had to repeat to my ever-attentive husband-were scattered throughout the chapters, often unexpectedly in tragic moments. Good example \\"Do you think Chris and I will get back together?\\" Sophie asks her longtime friend at Chris' funeral. I hope Ms. Bank keeps them coming.

I started to read it at the bookstore coffeeshop, and I read it every free moment until I was done! I cannot remember the last time a book grabbed me that way. There are some great one-liners in this book, and what is so cool is that there is nothing really remarkable about this main character. She is just like any of us, and that is what makes us care what happens next in her life. I also really liked the temporal flow of this book: entire years are left out, yet continuity is preserved. Genius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened","review":"After I read her first novel, I couldn't honestly see all the hype behind it. The prose was rather pedestrian and the characters seemed rather flat. I was given Wonder Spot as a gift and so I thought I would give Banks another shot. To be honest, I read half of the book and felt as if I were reading about the same characters as in her first novel but merely the names had been changed. Banks does not write with verve or insight but rather with caution-as if she is afraid to take chances and write from the heart. She relies upon a formula that in my view barely worked the first time. This book is a beach book at best; ie; let this one float away. A real disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the book?","review":"'Read it, didn't really like it. 'Left me wondering why the author wrote this as it was not as good as her first effort.

Instead, I read what should have been tossed in the slush pile. Cliche upon cliche first tripped me, but wait, suddenly I realized Melissa Banks wasn't writing chapters or developing characters. This was a sloppy journal of notes for a possible manuscript! What publishing house could feel proud of this? One only read page 267 \\"Neil and I stayed together for nights on end, lost of the Bermuda Triangle of Love\\" to see that this book is junk!

Take my advice don't bother ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing and I was looking forward to this book, but I was very disappointed with The Wonder Spot. The first thing I noticed was she used the words \\"I said\\", \\"he said\\" \\"she said\\" FAR FAR too often. Perhaps this was a creative choice, to use only the word \\"said\\" over and over and over again, but it came incredibly repetitive, particularly on the audiobook version. If this was a creative choice, it did not seem a very successful one. In addition, I found the main character entirely without any redeeming quality. She whined and complained constantly about her life, but did little to try to improve it and made just stupid, uninspired life choices repeatedly. I have little patience with that sort of thing and don't find it enjoyable to read about a woman with no direction. Overall, I was very disappointed and with the vast amount of books available in this genre, I doubt I read anything further from Ms. Bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonder Spot? More like: Wonder (Why It Was Published) Spot!","review":"I am perplexed that in this modern day of printing, errors such as this can still occur, but I'm missing several pages of The Wonder Spot starting after page 134 (jumps to 199). It then repeats 60 some-odd pages (263-324) in the back.I was looking for a quick, brainless read, and this was it, but the missing pages reminds me of receiving a book on CD with a major scratch in it, thus preventing me from moving forward... I think this is fate's way of telling me to not waste my time with this shallow drivel.I'm not above occassionally picking up a book of chic lit ilk, but was not impressed with The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing, and am equally unimpressed with Melissa Banks' sophomore effort. It's too bad, because the editor who wrote the back jacket sell copy reeled me in with the description. Unfortunately it must apply to another book on their list."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Engaging Read","review":"Melissa Bank's The Wonder Spot is an engaging novel/collection of short stories about one character. When I first started reading, I was a little annoyed that the chapters are more like stand alone short stories than parts of a novel with a unified narrative. I mean, come on, this is glorified chick lit, how hard can it be? But, I admit, Bank won me over with her excellent, evocative writing. She does an excellent job of capturing dating/single life in New York, plus the work is written cleverly with deadpan wit. The Wonder Spot is a good, quick read, intelligently written, definitely a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it...","review":"This book left me cold. I was really looking forward to reading it because I love the Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing and count it as one of my favorite books, but it just did not have the magic that Girls Guide did. I got so annoyed with the main character and could not relate to her or find something that I found charming or neat about her. It just seemed like with this book Melissa Banks wrote whatever came off of the top of her head with no rhyme or reason to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"I loved Girl's Guide and have to agree with most of the reviewers below. I was so looking forward to another fun, interesting read and for once could not actually finish a book, unusual for me as I will stick with anything unless it's terrible.

However, this book makes me wonder whether my opinion of the first book was accurate. (I had a similar experience with Frank McCourt's books). While the interconnection between stories and characters was clear and flowed smoothly in the first book, the style of this one is just a mess. Characters disappeared without explanation. The main character rambles on in a self-absorbed and unsympathetic manner. In any case, if you haven't read either of her books, I'd certainly recommend \\"The Girl's Guide...\\" over this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Can this book be any more boring? I got the audio CD and author's voice was so boring (she also has a little lisp going) it made me want to drive my car in to the wall.

I devoured every word of this novel. It was funny,entertaining, and brilliant. Sophie is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, somewhat of the underdog, but the reader roots for her all the way! It reminded me of Wally Lamb's She's Come Undone. I truly appreciated the novel- I understood it all the way.

Her first book was nothing special, for all the hoopla, and this book is just as disappointing.To be completely fair, it started out somewhat promising but quickly dissolved into another ordinary/boring tale of an ordinary/boring slacker. Sophie Applebaum has nothing special to tell and nothing interesting to say. She is just another twenty-something with very low self-esteem.Don't waste your time or money. Either take it out of the library or look for it in the discount book section, where I am sure it will turn up very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. I LOVED her first book; was totally disappointed by this one.","review":"It's too bad. I've tried reading different parts of this book at different points throughout the past 2 weeks and I can't be compelled at all.Not interesting, not funny.After her first book, \\"The Girls' Guide To Hunting and Fishing\\", Melissa Bank became well-known as a very funny, witty, interesting writer. That's one of my favourite books of all time.But nothing in this book interested me, and nothing made me laugh. It's sort of a different style, and at some points (the first chapter) I felt like she was trying too hard. At other points, I felt like she wasn't trying at all.Maybe when it comes out on paperback I will give it another try. Perhaps I personally didn't like it because the style is so different from the first.I'm not sure why so many critics like this one. She's a critical darling now I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel old","review":"\\"Girls' Guide\\" was the first chick lit book I ever read, and I remember thinking at the time how unrealistic these books are...that these women can \\"summer\\" in their families' homes in Martha's Vineyard, and they end up getting jobs in NYC with no real problem. That's just not something I could relate to. And as a writer myself, I thought it must be really easy to get published, since all these chick lit books are the same.\\"The Wonder Spot\\" was an interesting idea, but I felt like she was lapsing into the same-old, same-old. The characters weren't realistic and didn't hold down realistic jobs or have realistic money situations or realistic vacations. More than anything, as I read and watched Sophie's life drift by, I myself became more aware of how life can just pass you by without your doing anything worth much.

I found the characters to be so boring that after awhile I forgot what was going on in these stories. I read a few reviews that said this book was 'electrifying' and to be honest, the only thing 'electrifying' about this book is if I were to read it in the bathtub and accidently drop in my hair dryer.

I plodded through The Wonder Spot hoping it would get better and the real writing of Melissa Bank would emerge. Her main character, Sophie, is a loser. She is not just a loser, she is a bore, who is rude; although she thinks she is being witty. Sophie is the person you meet and can't wait to get away from because you are afraid her negativity will rub off if she shakes your hand. She falls into jobs. She falls into relationships. She falls.

It reminded me of romance novels, completely interchangebale. THere is nothing original, witty, or well done here, and had she not had GIrl's GUide under her belt it would have never, ever been published. As I was reading it, I thought, Why did she bother with this? So it dawned on me that she must have been required by her publisher to write it?

So the coach cant really help the team in winning because he doesn't know the rules or how to play the game.

Their waffle iron is the best, and the food processor is 20 years old, and works great. Is this another brand that got bought, and gets slapped on cheap Chinese products? Seems like at has happened a lot. This coffee grinder is toast after two grinds today. And of course, like an idiot, I tossed the \\"instructions\\" and \\"warranty papers\\". C'mon you really need instructions to use this? The claim of 12 cup capacity is bogus. The Keurig people \\"could\\" say it has a 1/2 gallon capacity and that is true..but one cup at a time. This thing makes an inconsistent grind, and produces weak coffee. It should be an embarrassment to the company..and our country for not being able to manufacture a stupidly simple product as this. Buh bye Cuisinart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooked Goose","review":"I received this product through Cuisinart's rebate after purchasing their coffeemaker DCC 2650 at Bloomingdale's. The coffeemaker was mediocre and I actually purchased an Aerobie aeropress in the end. But going back to the grinder, I'm glad that I spent zero dollars on the product and it worked okay during the first 10 grinds. The cup is very small and I had a large can of beans to grind.Afterwards, it was dead. Didn't even sputter and die, just went dead after using the grinder as directed. I suggest you spend the money on something else rather than this product. I've never had any bad experiences with Cuisinart before and is disappointed that this grinder would go so quickly.

Before I even used it, (but already bought it), I had reservations about this product because of all the bad reviews. 12 1star rating out of 25 4 star ratings is not a huge difference. I honestly thought that mine would come out fine because what are the chances of me getting something defective right and I also trusted the Cuisinart brand because most of my appliances are from Cuisinart and I love them. However, during the first use, it tripped off the electrical outlet!!! I tried it over and over again, and it really does do it most of the time. I think Cuisinart outsourced this product to a manufacturer in China with no quality control and the whole batch probably was defective or something, coz I saw a bunch of them at a discounted price. I'm returning this and looking for another brand this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke the second day - and it wasn't big enough","review":"Motor quit the second day! I am not kidding. And as others said, it really wasn't big enough. If you got your 12 cups worth you had to remove the lid over another container because the grounds will spill out. Finally, it is poorly designed with an extra wall in the lid - the only function of which is to capture grounds and beans so you can have trouble cleaning it.I'm a fool. After buying their combo grinder/maker for our new second home, I gave up cleaning that joke every day and got the seperate maker and grinder of the same brand.I'm a fool, don't be like me.

It is very hard to clean. The only work-around we have found is to load and assemble it upside-down. Then, you can turn it over and grind without too much problem with the seal. Our old Krups never had any such problem. I also bought a Cusinart hand mixer recently, because it used to be a good brand. Both were fair to poor.

So, I started doing two grinds to get the amount of coffee I like.A week ago,a friend of mine was making coffee, and not knowing the grinder's capacity limitation, filled it full with beans and burned out the motor.Anyways, if you like strong coffee don't buy this grinder. If you like lighter strength coffee this is a good grinder because of its consistent grinding of the beans.We bought this to replace it!Breville BCG450XL Ikon Conical Burr Grinder"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fast!","review":"This is a replacement for a coffee grinder we've had for more than 2-years.

I would put the limit at 8 cups. Additionally, there is no removable cup. While that it is not a big deal, it does make it harder to pour and clean. Since this grinder wouldn't work for our coffee needs, we started using it as a spice grinder. It works just fine for that purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem of a Little Grinder!","review":"Very happy with this little grinder!

Thanks Cuisinart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Just Fine, Long Lasting, Good Value!","review":"This is my second coffee grinder by Cuisinart. I have a previous one that fell from the counter and cracked the lid. That model has lasted for at least three years without any problem. Since I am satisfied with this model I bought another replacement.The space for the coffee beans is limited. If you are going to make a full pot of coffee you will have to grind 2 or 3 loads. For the 6 cups of coffee I brew in the morning I only need to grind two full loads of coffee beans. If you don't overload the coffee beans it works fine. I recommend finding measuring cup. Once you grind the beans it is good to shake the grinder to get all of the beans ground. If you do this you get perfectly ground coffee.The cord of the grinder is about 18\\". It's a little shorter than their previous model but manageable. Compared to a Mr. Coffee grinders whose motors kept burning out I would definitely recommend this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, weak and ineffective","review":"I purchased this grinder to replace my 20+year old Braun whose cord had come apart (it still works). The smaller Braun can easily grind a 12 cup pot, fast and effectively. This machine on the other hand is quite a bit larger and when I attempted to grind enough beans for a strong 10 cup pot, the blade quit spinning several times and after enough fooling around it chopped them up, but one could hardly call it a ground bean, it looked more like grass clippings.I doubt this thing will last very long after watching it literally stop working with a full load of beans to grind. I now use it for a small afternoon pot of coffee, half full of beans it will eventually produce a \\"ground\\" bean product. Another annoyance is its shape, difficult to hold on to especially early in the morning if you happen to have a touch of arthritis.NOT worth even the $13 it is advertised for on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"product has 1/3 the power of the previous model with the same #","review":"This product sucks, not the same as prevous model with the same #, does Amazon buy cheaper product matching the same product #and pass them as the same?.

I don't know if it is a new style of writing or just a turn of bad taste for the publisher pushing for a book. Every book you read has a beginning building on a plot, which was the first book. It is wholly exceptable to have the first book in a series not come to some conclusion. But to have an entire second book, over 300 pages, drone on and on, add new conflicts but bring no end to even one single plot, twist, conflict, snippit of information, is not in good writing taste.

It is not genuine Christian fiction. I read the Preacher's Daughter first and then The Englisher and I found them to not be an accurate view of the Christian faith. The books (and the Amish faith) portray a legalistic religion, put their authority as supreme rather than a direct relationship with God, and don't allow people to say they have been saved through a personal relationship with God. This thinking is contrary to what the Bible teaches. The book also leaves you hanging. There is no good closure to the book and it does not stand alone as a book. I would not want people to buy this book thinking this is what it is to be a Christian. A relationship with God is personal and brings freedom not legalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original male control freaks!","review":"This was a very upsetting story to me.

The tunes are both catchy and creative, ranging from the through-composed \\"Family functions\\" to a postmodern delight in \\"You are here.\\" More important than any of this is the remarkable humility that are apparent in Anna's lyrics. Rather than attempting to write deep and profound poetry (and failing as most songwriters do), Anna writes lyrics that are clearly based on personal experience in a beautiful and humble way.

It does an ok job on bagels and other really thick things - but it's just plain lousy for normal toast. The heating elements tend to be very hot at the ends but cooler in the middle. This means that one end of the bread gets burned while the other is barely browned. The elements are also too far away from the center and don't move, so it takes at least two cycles to get toast for normal bread. Doesn't even color the bread on the first cycle.

The text, though simple, are written with Tibetan script, transiliteration and English translation, the story is good too.

The result was an error code (DREGDRAW MISS). Customer service was helpful... so helpful in fact I could tell I wasn't the first person with this problem. They emailed me info to remove the brew unit using a screwdriver to over-ride the program that was locking it in place. Still no luck. Then they thought maybe it was one of the three pressure switches. In the end they offered to have it shipped back for repairs. I delcined and returned it to where I bought it. I'm sure the thing works great, but you had better be prepared for breakdowns and have a plan to deal with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will do until I get my commercial 2-grouper","review":"This machine makes good espresso and good cappuccinos. In terms of fully automatic machines, its price is infinitely more reasonable than that of a Jura. The price of a Jura X9 at $6500 is about that of a commercial machine. This Saeco will do nicely until I get my Faema E61 or Prestige semi-automatic 2-groupers with a Mahlkonig grinder. I doubt if my commercial machine will make a much better espresso or cappuccino but I think a manual machine has fewer maintenace problems and I have more control over the milk foaming. However the Saeco does offer the manual steam wand as well as its cappuccitore (milk foamer) and they both work well. I also like the energy saver feature of the Saeco since I prefer not to power off the machine. I also like the cup warmer. The screen menu is easy to use and the different options and diagnostics are useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself the hassle","review":"Very disappointing. We were convinced by the positive reviews from others so we went ahead after much research and ordered this espresso machine. it arrived, didn't work (electronics problem) and the friendly Saeco customer service person told us to simply return it. This is our second attempt with a Saeco product and we have now given up on this brand. The first try was with a factory refurbished machine which never worked despite the fact that we went the extra mile and sent it back to the Saeco factory only to have it returned in the same inoperable condition. The Saeco 21103 Royal Professional was our second attempt, this time we got a totally new machine. The result was the same: a machine that didn't even begin to work.Thank heaven for Amazon and its splendid return policy. Save yourself the hassle and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Trouble","review":"Returned first machine; wouldn't work. Received replacement from Amazon. Same problem. Was instructed by SAECO to return machine to them for replacement. Received 3rd machine on Oct 13. On Oct 24 machine stopped working. Apparently the heating element went out. Machine has been returned to SAECO for repair or replacement. If problem occurs again, will retun the machine to Amazon for refund.In all fairness, this machine is a good product and makes great coffee when it is working properly. We had an earlier edition which we gave to our daughter when we decided to purchase the new one. Our other daughter also has a SAECO and it works well. So perhaps we have just had bad luck. But right now we wish we would have just hung on to the old one and saved $1500."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gray paper provides poor contrast","review":"I like 5 per inch grid paper over 4 per inch because it fits my writing and sketching style better, but they're expensive and harder to find in bulk.

Avoid buying discs with model numbers that do not end in \\"TX\\". Cuisinart puts out two versions of its discs, the TX and non-TX. With the exception of \\"TX\\" at the end of the part number, the part numbers are the same and the discs look superficially identical. BUT, the non-TX have weaker locks where it fits on the stem. Mine failed after 2 months of moderate use - the disc flies off the stem as soon as you start using it.2. Cuisinart will only honor warranty for accessories purchased directly from them! I think it's ridiculous and should be illegal, but that's their official policy.Bottom line: spend a little more to buy the TX version of this disc directly from Cuisinart, which has a stronger attachment mechanism and is covered by warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agatha Raisin is back on form","review":"This outing finds Agatha once again battling depression. She doesn't like getting old. She sometimes finds her retirement boring. And, she just never seems to find the right man to spend her time with.The pretty boy new curate is murdered very early in the book, and Agatha spends the remaining chapters trying to clear the name of her good friend Mrs. Bloxby's husband. Everyone in Carsely thinks the Vicar done it, because the curate was more popular.Once again, Agatha is sleuthing with her neighbor, the mystery writer, and once again the two of them are constantly sending each other missed signals.Agatha may never find romantic happiness, but she's a good friend, and a terrific fundraiser. If she ever learns to recognize contentedness, it may be the end of her detecting. Lucky for us, she remains obtuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straightforward Mystery 101","review":"Agatha Raisin is certainly no Miss Marple. This amateur sleuth is full of sexual innuendos while Miss Marple is a true lady in all of her series created by the late Agatha Christie. Regretfully, Agatha Raisin's persona annoys me. There is too many feminine intuitive in one small book. Beaton incorporated more than three vicious and spiteful female characters (including the main role) in a short mystery. This could result in quite a headache and it did for me. The murder mystery itself is clear-cut.

This series started out so strong; I used to laugh out loud, and looked forward to the release of the next book. The plots were never mundane, and the books were filled with imagination and character. But gradually this series has become less and less enjoyable for me. I certainly won't rush to buy the next one. Thankfully, the Hamish Macbeth series is still going strong. Reading this book and the latest Hamish Macbeth book in sucession, it was difficult to believe they were from the same author; the Agatha Raisin book was run of the mill, the Hamish Macbeth book was as engaging as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know why I read these books","review":"I've read all the Agatha's and still find her a bad car wreck.

I am already hooked on her Lost in Trek series and was glad to find this book. I am picky about reading books with Dom or Dominant male themes and this fit what I was looking for in a story. This theme in the book is not the main focus and it is not too heavy.I really liked the relationship between Nikki and Thomas. He was a cop dealing with the horrors of the case and personal stuff. She was a talented doctor who felt she was missing something in her personal life. This leads her to the internet and the book unfolds from there. I liked the pace of the book and the action helped. Also I must add that I liked her best girlfriend Kim and thought her addition to the story was just right.

Which it is to a certain extent. But Get REAL!! This is an attempt to mainstream a type of erotic novel better left off the suspense shelf.The first few pages were GREAT!! I thought o'boy, this will be good. The premise is GREAT! I loved the thought of people who are lonely looking for love on the internet. It is real, it happens. BUT, looking for someone to dominate you or force your submission, is kinky. With all the abuse in the world, Who would be foolish enough to let someone you haven't ever seen do those kind of things to you.As a doctor, she has seen alot. Surely she has some kind of sense of self preservation.This is erotica.

The side of the book said Romantic Suspense. Berkley should be ashamed for trying to pass off graphic erotica as Romantic Suspense. While I'm no prude and have read many sensual but still entertaining and mature erotic romances-this stuff is just soft core porn being shilled as romance. There is nothing romantic about this book.That being said the book was just plain horrible. Three fourths amateur \\"suspense\\" with one fourth implausible and twisted sub/dom stuff thrown in. At the point where the \\"hero\\" calls the \\"heroine\\" \\"my little girl\\" and calls himself \\"daddy\\" during the bedroom scenes, sickened, I just chunked this bad boy in the trash where it belongs.

(the story of the hero's daughter, the bad guy sewing the picture) I'm trying not to give anything away here.The pistachios were a nice touch. In fact, I went out after I read the book and bought a bag of pistachios.The one major love/sex scene was hot, hot, hot.

Have you tried finding a decent toaster lately? I've been through many. If you like crispy dark toast, this is it - but if you like browned toast, this is uneven and burns one end, and light on the other. This is the second one of these I had. The first was bad and so the customer service (which is very good) sent me a replacement. It's just as bad. Used to be any cheapo toaster would do a great job. It's much harder to find one now. If you look inside when the elements are going, many of the windings of the heating elements are too tight and so don't heat up since they are flush against the insulation so only around 1/2 of the inner elements even glow red, but the outer ones are better, so it's very uneven. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy crap not worthy of Cuisinart brand","review":"Mine died after 6 months - half the heating elements stopped working, toasting only one side of the bread.

The instruction manual says that the control should be set to 3 as an initial setting, the range is 1 - 6. It consistantly burns white bread toast on 1.

We threw the last one out when it started making toxic odors akin to melting plastic, and it became difficult toasting bread when the lever lowering the toast wouldn't stay down. The latest one will be returned shortly, unused, because we do not know of bread made so small that may fit in this toaster. The mouth may be wide, but it is terribly short.

Next time I'm going to get something more substantial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it used to be","review":"I had what was supposed to be the same model for many years and it worked very well, although the push-down handle broke off two years ago. The toaster finally became stuck in reheat mode, so I decided to replace it with the same model. Not possible. The newer incarnation of the Classic is much less sturdy and the push-down mechanism would not engage - that is, you could not push the handle down and have it stay down to toast. I returned it and set out to find a better toaster - no easy task."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like burnt toast, this is for you","review":"Personally, I don't like burnt toast and hate this toaster. I thought buying a Cuisinart toaster would insure a lasting appliance. I may as well have spent $10 at a discout store. I have had this toaster for a bit over 3 years. We don't toast often, but for the last year I have been tolerant of popping up the toast half-way through to see if it is ready as if I wait for the machine despite any setting it will burn. Very disappointing for an appliance that is supposed to have a good reputation. Two starts as it did work fine for 2 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"universal remote","review":"I order the RCA remote you sent me a PHILIPS remote.

Color plates, drawings, tables and a concise paragraph describing each fish and its behavior make it an essential reference for divers and scientists almost anywhere in the tropical Indo-Pacific, not only Micronesia.

The classic Catholic & Protestant models no longer seem to be working the way the used to. And yet Americans continue to identify with some sort of faith. The latest trend of describing oneself as 'spiritual not religious' is reflected in a market which prusues and explores alternatives to traditions that no longer seem to fit today's lifestyle. Roof offers great insights. The book keeps the reader engrossed and curious. Definitely worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helping Close the Gap in Research","review":"Roof's book is a welcomed insight into the nature and character of the up-and-coming generation. It solidly answers the question, \\"What motivates, and what are the thoughts of this next generation\\". Roof makes a solid claim (well supported) that this next generation is moving away from religion and embracing spirituality. While I personally think they are moving away from DOGMA, the point may in the end be the same. Religion is too slow to adjust to the relevant and contextual problems faced by this modern generation. Roof, provides some insights into where this generation is headed.Ewest, TimVisiting Research Collaborator,Princeton University Faith and Work"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Had they stuck to one or two, or even five or six animation styles this could have been great.

The book's jacket promised much, the heart wrenching tale of a young woman, still raw from a divorce and the death of her stepson, returning home to heal and find solace on a beautiful ranch in Montana. But there really is very little story here, the characters are cariacatures, their motivations and behaviors wildly improbable, the type setting shoddy and the hero's name changing from Jess to Jerry inexplicably at one point. It really is a shame. The author definitely knows how to create mood and her descriptions are sometimes beautiful but the constant, repetitive sexual encounters become tedious because of their frequency and thus lose their power to move the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old fashion Harlequin Romance","review":"\`Part of Bargain' is Harlequin Romance with a cute story and lots of love scenes.

I found it very hard to tolerate the poor language and grammar of the authors, the stereotypic, sentimental and one dimensional characters, and the authors' poor grasp of detail. To offer an example, Tanis Half-Elven (A very annoying character) is described as having a beard which bears testimony to his human blood, since no elf on Krynn can grow a beard. None the less, when the also very annoying character Chrysania is visited by an elven cleric, this elf is sporting a very long beard, which I then assume must have been false.When I still decided to give this book two stars, it is because I find the world of Krynn innovative, and I can't help liking kenders.

All of the books are enjoyable, but there are only 7 that matter... the 4 Chronicles (especially the first 3), and the 3 legends books. This book 1 the first of the latter series, and is truly enjoyable. Not as much action as the chronicles, but for true dragonlance fans that doesn't matter. The subject matter is different, and equally as compelling, but on a more personal and spiritual level. This book deals with arguably the most famous dragonlance character, Raistlin, and his brother Caramon. It is the single-most important and compelling relationship in the Dragonlance saga, and for that reason alone, this book is a must read. Plus it is a hell of a book, and it tells the story of the culmination of Raistlin's power and ambition which, behind the war of the lance, is the most thrilling topic in the world of Dragonlance."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just boox..","review":"When I first read these novels I was about 16 years old and some sort of spell came over me.

The new concealed missiles and sonic charges are really a plus, although the rotating missile launcher of my toy tends to fail.Comparing the new and the old Slave I, there's a striking difference. The new toy is heavier and has more fuselage parts, but is far, FAR more detailed and proportioned than the old one, which looks blunt in comparison.And I don't miss the opening hatch that much, since this toy is NOT scaled to the action figures' size (An accurately scaled Fett figure for this ship would be 1.5 inches tall at most).So, this one is heavier, more proportioned and more accurate... but above all, it really is FUN, even if you're 25 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for Star Wars fans!","review":"I bought this at Christmas along with Obi-Wan's Jedi Starfighter, and here it is now May and my son is still playing with it.

The \\"Brew Pause\\" feature is designed to allow the coffee pot to be removed while still brewing. This element, which works 50% of the time, requires critical alignment between the base unit, filter holder and pause lever. Without that alignment, half-brewed coffee spills over the top of the basket and onto the counter.

Made great, hot coffee. But by week two, the bloom was off the rose. Multiple times since the coffee has overflowed from the basket making ungodly messes. It's very difficult to clean and maintain. Now, the only way to make sure the coffee ends up in the carafe is to wedge a chop stick into the release mechanism. I'd send it back for repairs, but that would cost me $10 (to Cuisinart) and who knows how much for shipping. Just not worth it for a $30 coffee maker.

Now, there is a big gap between the cover and the container, and steam escapes when I make coffee.Good thing I didn't throw away the old unit.

Works well... for a while.","review":"The first KUA-17 we bought was replaced under warranty after 15 months. Not good for an expensive kettle. Now the identical replacement has gone on the blink after 12 months. We are quite heavy users... boil water maybe four times a day for drinks... but that shouldn't be a problem... It's the same electrical connection problem between the base and the kettle as extensively described on other negative reviews. Obvioulsy a bad design. Can't be bothered to go through with another warranty claim. This time it's going in the trash can - where it belongs. Bottom line? Not a good buy. We had problems with an unreliable (and expensive) Cuisinart toaster earlier this year so this brand is now on our 'AVOID' list. Cuisinart used to be very good.

This is not a complicated device - kettle, heating element, thermostat, switch and cord. It should last for many years, not just a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough . . . .","review":"You would expect more of the Cuisinart brand but, once again, U. S. outsourcing to places like China of reliable old products without careful oversight and quality control results in flimsy design and poor life expectancy. Do younger consumers even know what's been lost over the past few decades? Instead, try the Bonjour Renoir Electric Kettle. Their quality control is extremely high, the kettle is beautifully designed down to the chrome strip encircling the heating element, and the kettle is made of hefty brushed stainless, with a high-shine cast stainless steel handle that is lovely to look at and feels good in the hand. Cuisinart may have been a great brand once but, unfortunately, like much of what consumers are forced to buy these days, no more. Go with Bonjour!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design -- DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL","review":"We got this kettle, and it worked well for just under a year. Then it died. The problem had something to do with a faulty connection between the base and kettle, which made it impossible to boil water. I called a Cuisinart office in New Jersey (it was still under warranty), and they offered to replace it for \\"free,\\" but they charged us shipping both ways. So we got a replacement kettle, which worked for about nine months, and once again the exact same thing happened. It wouldn't boil water anymore. Well, once again, I called them back again, and they sent us another replacement, but charged us shipping again. Clearly, it is most likely only a matter of time before it dies again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this kettle!!!","review":"I received this kettle as a gift. It was a refurbished model. So they refurbish a broken kettle and send it back out to make more money on it. My parents bought it and saved it for a present. Well it had a 90 warranty on it. So I took it out to make hot chocolate for my kids and it worked fine. I got used to using it and then less than 2 weeks later, it just did nothing. I used it for less than two weeks, but of course it is already off warranty. Then I looked at amazon reviews and saw that this was a common problem for this kettle. I am so aggravated that my parents spent money on this junk and that Cuisinart sends this stuff back out to sell it again.

However, there are two tiny piece of plastic that have been inserted into the interior of this kettle to indicate what is the maximum amount of water that the kettle can contain. This is the only plastic that is used inside this kettle (no plastic bolts or screws, the lid underside is even metal). The good news is that these little pieces of plastic are easy to remove from the kettle, solving the issue entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"This kettle is awkward to use.","review":"We found this kettle to be awkward and difficult in several ways. It has a bottom-heavy feeling that makes pouring laborious; because the handle is on top and not on the side, you have to twist your arm all the way over to pour out the water. The water gulg-gulgs slowly out of the spout, rather than pouring smoothly. The instructions say not to leave water sitting in the kettle -- this is something I, who grew up with electric kettles, have never heard of, and which would have made using it more work than convenience. It is also quite noisy, making a deep rumbling roar while heating, which I also find unusual. It's only redeeming feature is that it looks very attractive on the counter... which isn't much use if you're making tea four times a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted -- but short life expectancy.","review":"Am sorry to say after less than a year - this product began to have trouble staying 'on'. The contact on the bottom of the kettle starts to wear out. Too bad, we really enjoyed it.

This one is going in the trash as well and I will not be getting anymore of their products. The wiring on the heating base has overheated and melted the plastic base and I'm sure that if I wasn't home my mother in law would have burnt the house down. Sure it shuts off when the water comes to a boil but the internal wiring gets hot enough to melt the unit.......that doesn't sit well with me. Especially for $65. Another wonderful china made product !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasts (which isn't long)","review":"I really liked this product while it lasted, but it should have lasted far longer!

It was disappointing that it didn't last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had for 5 years and it's wonderful","review":"I have had this kettle for about 5 years and just love it. I use it probably 5-8 times a day. I use it for water for tea and even when I need to boil something else because it is faster to boil water in this kettle and then pour it into the pot than it is to wait for the pot of water to start boiling.

It's a great asset to any kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stopped stopping!","review":"After 1.5 years, this automatic tea kettle, which I use every day, stopped automatically turning off at a rolling boil.

I've had this kettle for over four years now and it has developed the same problem as some of the people who gave it one-star reviews. The electrical contacts have degraded over the past few months and today I couldn't get it to turn on at all no matter how many times I twisted it around on its base.I've cleaned the contacts twice in the past few months to no avail. Maybe an improvement for all of a day each time.Looking inside the base, I can see why the contacts die -- they don't grip the metal ring & spike at all, but rather the ring and spike just rest on loosely sprung metal. Wish I'd thought to inspect that before buying it.There's no excuse for such a bad design. Were they hoping for a repeat buy? Not going to happen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it works","review":"The Cuisinart is a great kettle while it works. We have two homes and this kettle at each home.

Compared to others I looked at, this one is well made, compact and attractive. The handle is a little awkward at first but not so bad that you don't get used to it soon.Two cups of water boils in about two minutes. Of course, more water will take longer. The pot shuts off as soon as a full boil is reached. If you are looking for a pot that will keep water hot for a long period of time, this is not the pot to buy.I haven't had the problem with plastic taste noted by some reviewers. Cuisinart recommends always starting with fresh water and pouring immediately. This probably helps to avoid having the water pick up the plastic taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dorm Room Wonder","review":"I am in college and spend many late nights studying...the problem is that I don't have a kitchen.

It was easy to use, boiled water quickly and looked good. After just less than a year it started to make a lot of noise when boiling water and eventually stopped working. I returned it and received a replacement kettle. Apparently you MUST empty the water out of it once you have used the kettle. Letting water sit in the kettle causes corrosion and damages the heating component. My second kettle is on its last legs because I use it all the time to make hot tea and I am too lazy to empty it after every use. I wont be buying the same kettle again. I find it odd that a kettle can corrode??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"STAY AWAY!! This kettle designed with a plastic contact mechanism (It is not visible, covered by the black bottom) which cannot stand the temperature of boiling water. It gradually melts, contacts getting loose, starts sparkling and eventually melts more plastic to make a SHORT CIRCUIT!!! Contacts are funny thin for it's power. I think it is made deliberately for shortening it life to force you to buy next one.After disassembling this mechanism, trying to figure out the way to repair this kettle I put it to garbage incinerator. No more Cuisinart!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and dangerous","review":"We bought this kettle just under a year ago and were happy with it up until last week. Somehow, the mechanism that should shut off the kettle when the water boils failed. This caused the kettle to boil dry AND melt the plastic bottom of the kettle rendering the unit unusable. This is also extremely dangerous and could have caused a fire and endangered everyone in the house. Needless to say, we will not be purchasing another one of these kettles, especially since it is expensive compared to other brands, it does not seem to have a boil dry safety mechanism, and it does not last very long. I will try to contact the company for a replacement since we have not even had it for 1 year yet, but I am not willing to spend too much time arguing with the company. There is no way I can recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't reliably turn off","review":"My kettle is about 2 years old and I have been very happy with it until recently.

Unfortunately, the kettle just suddenly stopped working, and had to be replaced. Given the other reviews indicating a pattern here, we didn't choose to go with another Cuisinart.When we received an electric kettle as a wedding present 37 years ago, I couldn't see the point, but quickly learned the error of my ways. It's unbelievably handy to have at hand, even in this day of microwave ovens. Nothing is better, in my experience, for making a great cup or pot of tea; and that alone would be reason enough to have one.This kettle seemed to have everything I wanted in an electric kettle, and more!

I found a great looking one in this product, but was very dissappointed when it died early after 1 1/2 years. I got another one thinking it was just bad luck, but lo and behold. It has just died again of the same problem. The connection on the base gives up. First it will work if you spin it round on the base until the light goes on, but then it just has enough of that and becomes good for nothing. I won't be buying a 3rd.

I wouldn't dare try any other kind myself, and naturally it was my first and only choice to give to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I bought this electric kettle to use at work. I love it. I love the style. It does boil water faster than a microwave and certainly faster than my stove-top kettle at home. The separate heating element in the base makes it easy to care for and to use. I just lift it off the base, fill it with water, put it back on the base, press the button and I have hot water very quickly. It shuts itself off. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I bought one of these teapots about 5 years ago. I like it so well that I've now bought a second one for work. I'd have given it 5 stars, except that I find the lid to be a bit tight. It's fine on my original pot, but hard to get off of the second one. I called customer service at Cuisinart. I was told to return it to where I bought it or to buy another lid. I didn't find either option to be very good. IMO, they should have replaced the lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like! Top handle and small mouth","review":"My elderly dad has this kettle for 2 years now. He has no issues with it. It is quick boil and easy to use. It has a small mouth. Water contacts no plastic part if fills below the max tab. It has automatic shut off so I don't need to worry about him burning the house down.I have heard that this kettle might have a short life.

Along with all the others owners of deceased kettle, I am steering clear of any Cuisinart products in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice kettle but design flaw","review":"I really liked this kettle but discovered a design flaw when it fell off the counter and the handle just snapped off. And there is no way to fix it. I called Cuisinart and they said it could not be fixed, and because it was more than 3 years since it was manufactured (though I've had it for less than 2 years), they would not replace. I have taken it to a kitchen repair shop, hardware stores, etc and no one can fix it. Very frustrating because the kettle is in perfect working condition but unusable because it has no handle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still going strong after 6 years!","review":"Pros:- Boils water rapidly.- Still working after 6 years (2 times daily usage from fall to spring; rarely used in summer)Cons:- Cord a little short (not a big deal)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product-until it breaks","review":"This is the third kettle of the same kind that I am buying. I love how fast it boils the water and I like the design - BUT after a year or two it always starts failing to switch off (that means steam damage on my kitchen cabinets) and then the little light starts flickering until one day it doesn't work anymore at all.

Fast to boil water, no nasty taste. Then one morning, nothing! First I thought I had blown a circuit breaker. NOT! It just won't turn on. My guess is that a fuse blew in the kettle itself, but there is apparently no way of accessing that. I paid too much to have it only give me a year of service. Sorry Cuisinart, but I won't purchase another kettle from you to replace it. That would be unwise on my part given all of the other reviewers who say the same thing happened to their Cuisinart tea kettle. Too bad, so sad, I'll move on. I'll look over the reviews of Chefs Choice and Breville."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a tribute","review":"I'm normally pretty charitable when it comes to reviews, but this CD is bad.

I'm happy with this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"It won't shut up or dial!","review":"I bought this phone after 2 failed attempts with a Uniden 2.4GHz expandable model. This phone, however, is also maddening. First, the handsets, though in communication with the base, will not dial. Touch \\"flash\\" and begin dialing and NOTHING. No tones from the numbers, only the hum of the dial tone. The only way to solve this is to unplug the base. Second, and almost as aggravating, is the answering machine can NOT be muted. When the machine answers, the outgoing message blares like a roaring jet engine. Didn't anyone at Motorola think, 'Hey, maybe the customer will purposely not answer the phone?' It's so loud I've had to tape a pad of post-it notes over the speaker. If you don't have a baby sleeping anywhere in the house or you enjoy being awoken every morning by your answering machine, this phone is for you. Oh, don't forget to reset the base so you can actually call the person back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, But a Workable Phone","review":"We bought this phone at Costco with the 3 additional handsets. Overall the phone works as advertised.The good:- Color screens- Good sound quality- Speaker phone works great- Buttons are big and the phone works intuitively, once set upThe cons:- My major disappointment is the range. From garage is 40 feet from the house. Yet the expandable unit does not get the signal. Thus unable to use the intercom feature (one of the reasons for selecting this phone). My husband is back to using a standard wired phone in the garage.- The second, more minor, disappointment is the phone battery life. Previously we set our old model phones in the base occaisionally. These phones need to be in their base at least every other day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible ringtones/Bad handset shape","review":"This phone had 2 flaws that caused us to return it. The ringtones are awful sounding, anything other than the default ringtone is unusable because the sound seems muffled and just sounds bad. We could not stand to hear it ring. Also the handset will not stand up on its own so the handset speakerphone is essentially useless. The handset speakephone volume is also too low at even the highest setting.

But what should have been a blessing was as much a curse - for jealousy and fear grew in the lands of men. Shadows of newly awakened evil swarmed across both landscapes, threatening to bring the clang and reek of war from the warm hearthstones of the mortal keeps to the silvery heart of Ealdwood. And Ciaran knew that he must once again put his humanity aside and reclaim his haunted weapons from the Tree of Swords or see both his worlds fold into darkness!\\" I first read this book when I was about ten, and it made an indelible impression on me.

Image ignoring 20% of the world's population!The final issue which prompted me to return my package to Broderbund was that the software does not allow you to create a split day-cell at the end of the month. When the last day of the month falls on a Sunday, you should be able to combine that cell with the one above. This allows you to have a calendar with 5 rows instead of 6. Despite the fact that Broderbund is at version 10 of this package, it seems that they've never noticed that most calendars follow this format.

Specifically, versions 5 and up have no provision to make event graphics small so multiple events on a given day will both print. Why Broderbund did this, I don't understand, but for my purposes, they ruined the product.

At first glance, this book may appear to be just a collection of portraits of boys in a variety of situations: some nude, some at play, some with family, some lost in their own thoughts. But in each photograph, McBride has managed to capture those emotions I listed, and more. None of the nudity is contrived nor is it exploitative. In some you can see the diffidence and anxiety in the subject, while in others you can see a nonchalance in the boy's posture exposing what? Trust in the photographer? Or the cynicism born out of some other, previous experience?An excellent collection created by a photographer with an exceptional eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOVING AND WITH A CERTAIN GRANDURE","review":"Will McBride has always been on the cutting edge (from his book Show Me) but this book like others of his, are controversal (mostly boys and men) but his skill is genius........the pictures are like going back in time to memories all of us have had...at least men.School halls of beaurifully uniformed boys lined up in front of the Headmaster...and german shower houses where pans of water fall on the head.......its all unusal and majestic somehow.

The new Gi Joe body is a great added feature, plus, all the neat gadgets that it comes with makes it even better. The only thing I see it lacking is the some armor doesn't fit well; example, the chin guards are to narrow for the legs and sometimes it is dificult to move the figure without the holster straps popping out. A child needs an adult to put the figure together and I can already see pieces being lost. Overall, this figure is great for display but not for playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!

Very articulate, accessories definitely a BIG plus, and goes beyond all boundaries of what an action figure is(way better than many of those so called \\"action figures which I do not wish to mention\\". The only real objection I have is not with the action figure but it's packaging. Are all those twisty ties really necessary? I almost felt like I was trying to disarm a bomb or something.

EA makes the same crap over and over. ESPN sold better then Madden, last year becuase 1. it was a better game, also was rated higher in 75% of ratings. better graphics and acurate models. That is why they bought the licencse to the NFL. Beecuase if they didnt ESPN would sell better AGAIN this year.If EA sees failure, they find the quickest way out. They do not improve their game, they buy a license so that they do not have to improve their game. Pethetic. Madden is lame and EA is a retarded game maker. All EA games are bad, and cheap.

Whether the athlete sits the bench or not they go up. As you can expect, this causes major cap problems. Further, any guy who you do play (especially a Safety) goes up. Therefore, if you draft a Strong Safety in the 7th round, give him 3 years and he will be a 90. At one point, about 15 years into my franchise. There was only 1 QB ( the one on my team) in the 90s, whereas EVERY strong and free safety was at least a 92 rating. Despite this negative I still play the game constantly because it is quite addicting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wowza","review":"This game has some of the worst AI I've seen yet. One drive you can throw for 100 yards, the next drive, every pass you throw is almost picked off. The way the AI works is so predictable and frustrating, that it makes this game worth nothing. This isn't anything new either. However, instead of cleaning up the AI or starting over to improve the game, they go ahead and buy out the NFL to make a monopoly.

QB vision and superstar mode, the 2 big additions to this year's version are not significant enough to warrant another $50. They will just bog down your system & make loading times, always a weak point in EA's titles, even longer. Stick with Madden 2005 or 2004 if you have them.

The machine died after a year, but was replaced under warranty. The second machine gave up the ghost about a year into it's life span. Part of the problem I believe is that the electronics reside underneath the coffee pot burner/heater. Spills tend to wash over the supposedly water proof buttons.

If you're not ready to make coffee at that time, you literally have to unplug it, which resets the clock, and timers, etc.2) The lettering on the controls has come off, and we haven't done excessive wiping on it, so that seems a bit cheap.3) I'm on my 3rd carafe - they break very easily and are sensitive to temperature, more that other coffee makers that I have had4) Yes, the grinding is loud, but who cares - it's the price you pay for good tasting coffee5) And finally - After two years IT DIED YESTERDAY.

Then at night before we go to bed I put the beans in and the grounds don't stick in the grinder.If you don't like to use the gold filter basket, an even easier clean-up happens. Just put the paper filter inside the basket (wet down the upper edges and flip it down around the outside of the basket), when you are done lift up on the basket handle and carry it to the garbage where you can then pull out the paper filter easily. Only thing is if you do it this way it will take longer to brew the coffee, so just set the timer earlier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it","review":"The first one of these I bought at a department store had to be returned because it refused to work at all--it kept beeping 5 times and wouldn't start. I returned it for another one and have used it for about a year. The past week or so the grinder, which is obnoxiously loud, is malfunctioning--grinding the beans the size of small pebbles. You also have to decalcify the machine with vinegar and water pretty often or it won't brew your coffee. I'm now out there looking for a new coffee maker and separate grinder. It won't be a Cuisinart brand, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much more work than separate grinder and coffeemaker","review":"I purchased this coffeemaker to replace my grinder and coffeemaker, and am considering giving it away and going back to my old 2 machine setup. There are 3 parts that have to be removed, washed and dried after each use, so I'm not saving any time or steps from using 2 machines.Further, I prefer a strong brew, and if I want to make a full pot, not all the beans will fit in the grinder at once. I have to run it twice. What a pain. I resent this machine and wish it would \\"accidently\\" fall off the counter so I could justify throwing out a costly appliance.By the way, I don't think the coffee is as good or as hot as it was with my old Krups. If you love coffee, you probably don't want this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"We purchased the Cuisinart about 3 years ago and it has been nothing but trouble. The coffee pot always leaks when you try to pour the coffee into a cup, the clear plastic in the lid has splintered and the grid off button does not work anymore. The grinder runs whether you want it to or not. How annoying at 5:00 a.m. We are now searching for another grind and brew coffeemaker and I guarantee that it will not be of the Cuisinart brand. Hopefully these reviews will make people realize not to waste their money on this piece of machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Egads, man, what were they thinking?","review":"This isn't a coffee maker. It's a heinous, ungainly beast of an appliance that rewards an unprecedented amount of effort with weak and inconsistent coffee. Apparently no one who made this thing has ever made coffee before. The steam from the coffee gets into the grinder, making a muddy mess that makes each subsequent pot ranker. The many pieces, all of which you have to remove to make a simple batch, go back together like an IQ test. At 8 a.m., I DO NOT NEED AN IQ TEST. I NEED COFFEE.If you really want a grinder-brew pot, spend the extra for the nicely designed (but still complex) Capresso model. But until this technology advances a few more generations, I'm sticking with two seperate and blissfully simple units.Happy brewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not satified with it","review":"In general its a good coffee pot but mine has had a problem with the grinder and I am unhappy that I couldn't get a new one. they wanted me to ship this thing back then I wouldn't have no pot at all this one does give me some ground coffee. I paid 179.00 for this pot new, I would never do it again I had to buy a new pot and I don't like the features near as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No 5 stars from me!","review":"While I was initially thrilled with this awesome looking machine, I was soon disappointed. I opened the box to find a piece broken, which they replaced but soon found that my initial disappointment was true to the whole machine. I found it very messy to clean up, and clean you must (the whole machine) after every pot or mold soon appears in many of the nooks & crannies, which are difficult to clean. The flavor select nob, in my opinion, does nothing! The pot itself never stayed sufficiently hot, even at the highest setting and eventually the clock stopped functioning properly. Soon after(about 3 days)the entire machine stopped working. Well, i returned it and just ordered the Capresso....we'll see?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blandest coffee I've ever had","review":"As it is impossible to get a fine grind with this machine, it produces consistantly weak coffee. I will agree with the manufacturer's claims that your coffee will not be acidic, however this machine produces coffee which is almost completely lacking in flavor. Not for someone who is looking for more than generic \\"american\\" coffee; I switched to Melitta's version & love its grind control, consisently robust coffee, & easy cleaning. (cost less too - an added bonus.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Designed this Mess?","review":"This is the absolute hardest coffee maker to clean ever made. It is impossible to clean. Even though it worked, I threw it away as I could not get it clean. It clogs very easily!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4-Stars so far","review":"I consider it my mission to find a Great coffee and so far my new Cuisinart has REALLY come close. It's not acidic and it's VERY smooth. I haven't really come into the problems of cleaning it so far. I clean it in the morning and it's dry by the time I get home to set it back up. The pot is a little trickie to pour water or coffee out of, but I will suffer through that little inconvenience for good coffee every morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars for the 1st year","review":"I've now had 2 of these Cuisinart coffee maker/ grinders. I asked for both as gifts. They both worked great for the 1st year. There are several parts to clean, beans can fall down into the water tank, the grinder shaft motor only lasts about 2 years, then tends to go KAPUT, and I only make a pot every 2-3 days! Accidently dropped the filter top in the sink, and the inner rim piece broke loose (this happened on both units) Super-glued the two pieces together, with mixed results. One I have now, that rim cracked loose, the grinder died, and recently, the top latch no longer latches, one side of the flimsy little thing cracked. Ok, so now, I'm grinding whole bean coffee with my 25 yr old KRUPS grinder, putting it in this coffee maker set to brew only, not to grind. AND, I now have to use some masking tape on the lid to keep it closed, or the damn thing won't work at all. I'm looking for something else next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space eater then died","review":"I fit into the group of people who think that this thing is a major pain to clean. Actually cleaning all of the removable pieces isn't that bad, but the grounds get all over the inside of the machine along with brown coffee goo, so you have to wipe everything down inside, turn the machine over, and shake out the grounds. Plus, the machine is gigantic. Look at the picture and the ratio of machine to pot. That's a lot of counter space for a pot of coffee. Finally, it died after only a couple of years of use. You plug it in but nothing happens - the clock doesn't flash, none of the buttons work, nothing. It's a goner. Now I just have to find a place that will accept it for its parts because I feel so bad throwing such a huge appliance into the landfill. I have to admit, though, the coffee was pretty darn good while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luxury!!!","review":"I finally sucumbed and bought this new coffee maker. My idea of great coffee is hitting the gas station in the morning. I just did not want to be bothered with all of the hassle.I am very happy though that I did make this purchase! Every morning, I wake up to the wonderful smell of freshly ground coffee. Tasty and piping hot to boot.With this Cuisinart, you can set the timer to make coffee, grind (or not), adjust the strength and not worry if you forgot to turn it off (it worries for you). A little red ball even indicates water loss due to steam. Oh and you can even set the temperature.Apparently there is even a self clean function but you still have to wash the parts out. This was my only complaint since there are more than a few pieces. Despite that small part of housekeeping, I am quite pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much time and trouble","review":"I bought the grind and brew as a gift for my in-laws and regretted it almost immediately. In order for the coffee maker to work you have to pull it apart, rinse it and dry it completely before each use. It's time consuming and difficult. Who wants to work that hard for a decent cup of coffee? This year we're buying them a Melitta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee, simple to clean, easy to use","review":"I don't get it. You rinse out three pieces under the faucet, wipe dry two of them with a paper towel, fill the cup with beans, fill it with water and hit the button. You get fresh ground beans, good coffee, adjustable heat to keep the coffee as warm as you like and it works like a champ. What's to complain about? Yeah, things do break. When they do I either return it or buy another. What's so hard about that?I make two full brews a day, every day, once in the morning and again in the evening. I've had mine for well over a year and the coffee maker does everything it's supposed to do.Yes, you have to clean it to make a pot of coffee. It's worth it! Buy it, use it, clean it, repeat. Don't make life so hard . . . have a cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REAL GRIND......","review":"Yes, this unit is a pain to clean - but not impossible. After a while I was literally cleaning it in my sleep. But when I had guests over they were baffled as to how to get at all the parts and subsequently caused a few overflows. Yes, it makes good coffee....but...I like my coffee strong and it can only make a maximum of 6 strong cups at a time. Worst of all - I went through 2 of these units in 4 years - the motors just burned out. Do yourself a favor and get the Melitta MEMB1B if you want quality, fresh ground coffee from a unit that is quieter, faster, easier to clean, lasts longer and costs less than the Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a pain to clean!","review":"I agree with what most of the other reviewers have said except that it's not so much that cleaning it is such a pain, it's that all those parts you have cleaned need to be COMPLETELY dry to use, otherwise all that freshly ground coffee sticks to everything with so much as a drop of water on it, making the next cleanup even worse and making an awful weak pot of coffee. We have also had our curafe lose parts causing the pause and pour feature to retain water (making a horrible mess) unless the pot is put completely 90 degrees to either side. Would not reccomend and will not replace with another cuisinart. Looking for replacement now. Now where did I put that grinder..."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't make life easier","review":"I thought it would be great to have the grinder/coffee maker in one. It was a pain to clean, couln't make more then 1 pot with out going through a process. Coffee grounds everywhere, and one by one something went. the clock, timer then it wouldn't turn off.(I only had it 8 months) it finally died, won't brew anything(I'm thrilled to get rid of it). Looks nice though. Do yourself a favor, buy the grinder/coffee maker seperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Maintenance","review":"This machine makes great tasting coffee, but has many parts that have to be removed and at least rinsed after each use. I don't think integrating the grinder within the machine is such a good idea, since steam from the brewing process gets into the grinder, turning any leftover grounds in there into a thick paste that clings to the inside of the grinder. Also, the thin, plastic clip that holds the cover down broke on mine, forcing me to put something on top of the machine to keep it closed when I want to use it, since it will not work unless the cover is closed securely."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the complusive cleaner","review":"I purchased this coffee maker thinking how convenient it would be to have my beans ground and coffee made with one touch of a button.While this appliance does deliver this convenience, it also demands meticulous clening with every pot brewed. The coffee grounds seem to get everywhere inside. Furthermore, there are just too many pieces to be cleraned.I would definitely not buy this coffee maker knowing what I know now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design!","review":"Automatic Grind and Brew should be efficient and easy to clean - this is NOT! Wastes enough coffee for about 2/3 cup with each grind and creates a real mess if you stop it between grind and brew to clean. Special features just water down brewed coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this machine","review":"I love coffee--so much that when Toshiba came out with a grind/brew machine about 12 years ago I plunked down approx. $250 for it. I grew to dread this machine. The only reason I'm taking time to write this story is to point out that this is not new technology. So, Cuisinart comes along and markets basically the same product with the same MAJOR problems. It is loud, really loud. It is difficult to clean, and it looks like a 5-year Toyota--the egg carton design era. One big, ugly, loud, very hard-to-clean, bulky machine. My best friend bought it and can't stand it. I was still stinging from the Toshiba 12 years earlier. BUT GOOD NEWS! MELITTA HAS COME OUT W/A GREAT GRIND AND BREW MACHINE. It's much quieter, easier to clean, it doesn't use filters, has a timer, and it makes an incredible cup of coffee. It's approx. $20 cheaper, too. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"After using it for two weeks, we returned it. The outer design is excellent,very stylish, and it has a small footprint for the counter. No need to have a separate grinder and canister on the counter. That's the good news. However, having the coffee grinder inside the machine, causes condensation to buildup in the grinder after each use which results in a very high maintenence clean-up effort every time. The grinder assemply, and the connecting flue to the filter, has to be cleaned and throughly dry before the next use, so the ground coffee will end up in the filter and not stuck to the wet surfaces. It was really a hassle to clean and given the high quality of most Cuisuinart products, and the cost, it was a disappointment. In any event, the vendor took it back without a hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"coffee freak!","review":"i have had my grind and brew for 14 months. it produces great coffee, as long as you take the time to work with programming the heat and the quantity dial under the lid. yes, it is a pain to clean, but i feel well worth it. yes, you do have to wash the parts and make sure they are thoroughly dry before re-using the machine, but you get used to that after a few times. it becomes routine. besides having fresh ground coffee, the coffee can be ready the moment your feet hit the floor in the morning! i also like the automatic \\"clean\\" feature (lites up when it is time to run the vinegar through the machine). the only problem i experienced was the plastic lid snapped off....you can't keep removing that lid to clean the pot or it becomes weak, as mine did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Grind and Brew will Screw You","review":"This is an engineering monstrosity. You must spend 5-10 minutes cleaning it after every use. Otherwise, moisure inside the unit causes the grounds to start sticking everywhere, clogging the unit and making it inoperable. In cleaning, you may throw away 25% of the coffee you put in. When yo do clean it, grounds stick and smear on everything you touch, including wash cloths. If you forget to clean it (because you have to go to work) cleaning it the next morning is hopeless, since it goes back together damp, unless you thoroughly dry each component. Way more time, way more money and average coffee. Get a grinder and a press."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a difference a millimeter makes","review":"I was hesitant to spend the money for this disc since my Cuisinart came with a 4mm slicing disc and I had already bought a 2mm disc. The thicker disc is great for a variety of uses which is probably why it ships as standard equipment with the food processor but I wanted thinner slices for things like cucumber salad and scalloped potatoes or potato salad. I used the 2mm for years but I was never really happy with it for softer vegetables. The cucumber slices were so thin they would just wilt and lose their crispness and cooked potatoes would frequently fall apart. For these items, the 3mm slicing disc is sheer perfection. The vegetables are thin yet they retain their shape and I am happy that I made this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon's misleading accessory link","review":"I just bought three cuisinart dlc-5 food processors: first one for myself and then later two as gifts.

I agree with \\"spotlight reviewer\\" Mr. King. It will put you to sleep. But thats not what good ambient music is intended for.

If this were an Alan Holdsworth, Chick Corea or even a Soft Machine recording, you wouldn't hear such complaining. After reading the reviews, I was leery of buying it, but I like it just fine. It still sounds like Area to me, right from the beginning of the first track. Save for a bit of tape hiss, it is a fine recording as well. To be clear, it is not merely Area without Stratos. How could it be? But it is a perfectly good fusion record. The amazing thing to me is that all of these astounding (and astoundingly obscure) recordings are available again. After college, I didn't meet another Area fan for 20 years. Now, we get to complain about the \\"lesser\\" gems on Amazon.com. If you like other jazz fusion, you will not be disappointed.

The music is loud, the guitars are heard like a more modern hatebreed record, and everything has enourmous punch. The album is short, but it works that the way. Everything is well planned and sounds complete also.I am a guitarist in a band myself, I'm not trying to be concieded, but from what I hear on this record, I could tear the guitarists apart.

Thus if you want to grate an infinitesimally small amount of material the waste will be unacceptable. On the other hand for power grating you've got something here. Also -- who cares if you waste a bit of a carrot.It works as advertised. It is fantastic for large grating jobs and the price is reasonable once you heft the thing. It is substantial.

I had to order a replacement \\"blender cutting assembly\\" from the Cuisinart website for $15 with shipping, only to have it happen again.Plus, it was a pain to clean - the base threading didn't match up well with the jar and screwing and unscrewing the base was often difficult.

Now i am doubting it. Specially after calling customer service. The service was very slow and the rep was trying politely to get rid of me. First he said that these food processors are loud in general, so unless you see a smoke coming of the motor there is nothing really wrong (???). then he said that i am not eligible for a warranty based on the manufacture date, but since i bought it 1 year after manufacturing he might consider it after i fax lot's of papers....

We returned it, received a replacement and it broke 4 days later. The lights went on, but there was nobody home and nothing moved or could be heard! Ok, you're probably wondering what are we chopping up with this thing, BRICKS?!? Oh, contrar, we used this to chop up my infant sons baby food, rather than purchase any of the suspect ready made stuff. The only reason that I gave them 1 star is because Amazon doesn't do fractions! I am satisfied that I will not buy anything EVER again with the name Cuisinart on it!

The only things I use the blender for is to make chocolate shakes and Yoplait smoothies for the kids. This blender could not handle that! Today, making a Yoplait smoothie the thing started smoking and stinking up the whole kitchen. The bottom RUBBER cutting melted!!!

It really blends beautifully -- smoothies, frozen margaritas, anything really. I use my blender a lot, for some many things. But I'm really fed up with having to buy parts for it. The plastic base where the blades are has cracked twice for me. The blender collar has also cracked. All from simple use. I've had many blenders in my life, but none have cracked and broken with the regularity of this one.

It never labored or nuthin. It chopped to a snow good enough to make snow cones. COOL!!! I've not had much chance of yet, to work with the duo part of the food proceesor, but how handy is this??

BYE BYE . will never buy another Cuisinart product. also it was made in china,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"The problem with this blender is that it just doesn't do what it supposed to do. It fails to draw down the ingredients you are blending so the blades just spin around and stir whatever was in the base over and over again. Every time I blend something I have to push the ingredients down with a spoon (while it is off of course)and blend small sections at a time. Sometimes, playing with the various speeds helps, but the design is sorely lacking. I doubt I will ever buy another Cuisinart product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Even Get to Use It","review":"I received this item as a gift for Christmas and was very excited. That is, until I took it out of the box. As soon as I took the processor out of the box, the small plastic piece on the lid fell out (a piece without which the motor won't turn on. It's a safety mechanism.)--- it has already broken off during shipping! It seems, in reading other reviews, that this is a common problem.

I haven't had the unit long enough for it to break on me, but I am definitely disappointed with the ability of the blender, and it does Smell during operation, and the food processor unit, which seems to work decent, is Very Loud. The blender carafe is too wide at the base for proper mixing. I bought this to make smoothies, added the ice cubes last and they would not crush very well, have to crush the ice before adding any other ingredients, then you still end up stirring the smoothie to get it completely mixed. Made hummus with the food processor, per their recipe, and it wasn't able to process the garlic very well, ended up with big chunks in the final product. Shredded carrots halfway decent though. I would definitely reccommend you take a pass on this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product","review":"I have owned two Cuisinart products. One was a coffee maker that ground beans and brewed coffee. Great concept, but the grinder always got stuck in the coffee maker. I would have to use pliers and screwdrivers to pry it out. I tried to grease the grinder- nothing worked. I threw away the coffee maker.Today, I used my Cuisinart blender's food processor for the first time. The chopping blade is now stuck half way inserted into the preparation bowl and will not come out. Nor will it go on. Nothing will dislodge the blades, and I cannot use the food processor. This is exactly the same problem.Long story short- I can recommend staying at the Cuisinart Spa in Anguilla in the West Indies, but I cannot recommend any kitchen products made by them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish that I could give zero stars.....","review":"HORRIBLY loud, when I use the food processor i have to leave the room because of the high pitch screech (sp?), and it's still bad in the other room.Does NOT work well, when i make hummus the liquid comes out the sides, when I make a smoothie it takes forever to get smooth. I really thought it would be nice to have a 2 in 1 appliance, but this is not the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its loudness supersedes any functionality","review":"We got this as a gift several years ago, and I never use it because I remember it being so loud. However, since it's practically brand new due to lack of use, and since I'm really a hand-chopper / immersion blender kinda gal and rarely use a food processor / full-sized blender anyway, my husband doesn't want me to get rid of it in case there is a rare time we need a food processor or blender - after all, no sense in getting rid of a functioning one that was free, right?I finally used it again today. I wondered if maybe it was as bad as I remembered... and it was. I used the food processor function, and it was so incredibly loud it was almost intolerable. And it's not because of the types of foods I was blending - the foods were soft (canned beans, eggs, etc.). It blended the ingredients well enough, but the loudness is such a turn-off that I cannot discourage potential buyers enough, especially for the price they're trying to sell it for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!

(Call me dumb for purchasing the second one!) Really a cheap part for the Cuisinart product. (All I've used these blenders for was fruit smoothies! I doubt the Duet would have made it throught the first challenge of food processing!) The Cuisinart product may be smart but they sure aren't very strong. I certainly would not classify them as heavy-duty! An improvement would be making the gasket either metal or a plastic with more give. (I won't be going back for thirds!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Versatile, but breaks easily","review":"I have owned the duet for approximatley one year. I use the blender mostly for milkshakes. The food processor is small, which is ok with me, except I do not like the feed tube. With a processor this small, it's unlikely one would use it to slice or shred, so why bother with the slicing disk and therefore the feed tube? Also, the feed tube makes it too tall to work with right under kitchen cabinets--you must pull it out to use. The motor is loud for both appliances. And the biggest problem is that mine broke this morning while I attempted to make a milkshake rendering both applicances unusable, since now the blade will not rotate. There is a small black plastic disk that fits between the base and the jar that has shattered all on its own. After reading your other reviews, I see I am not the first person to experience this. Buy this item with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another broken part","review":"As mentioned by others, after less tham two weeks use, the black plastic piece above the motor that interlocks with the jar bottom broke.

In fact, I won't be buying any more of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"The BLADE broke in pieces making SOUP!","review":"This machine sounds and look good at first blush. But when the blades BREAK, leaving shards in vegetable soup, this machine becomes a danger. After owning this and using it for about 8 months, I used it for 4 courses of a dinner party. When the roasted (quite soft, almost overcooked) vegetables were processed, one blade broke off in 2 pieces, and the remaining blade lost the tip. Shards of this machine were found in my soup!

In the meantime two parts cracked off of the food processor attachment while just attaching/removing it from the base, making the food processor completely unsafe to use.

Last week, the motor finally died. I had used it probably 15 times over the course of 3 and a half years. Upon calling Cuisinart, I found that it is out of warranty and I would have to pay to get it fixed. No thank you. I will be buying another brand. I wish I would have used it more so it broke within the warranty period, but because it just didn't work well, I didn't use it much.

I've since used it two times and tonight I heard a clunky piece moving around when I took it out of a cabinet. I unscrewed the bottom to find that the fan was completely detached.

It eventually cracks from the heat/friction produced. I bought the Oster Beehive blender to replace it, and it has a metal piece beneath it and I have had it for a few years now with no problem.

What a piece of junk and shameful for Cuisinart to produce such landfill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable and Downright Dangerous - Beware","review":"I bought this machine at a reliable retailer and based my decision largely on the Cuisinart brand name. My last food processor had fallen off a high shelf and broken after a 13 year reign. I'm a cookbook writer so all my kitchen appliances and tools get more than the usual amount of wear, but this machine was trouble immediately. Unless you hold down the sleeve that fits over the gears they grind and begin to smoke. The push button controls are awkward to use and it's easy to overprocess foods. The blender works better than the processor but still has a tendency to loosen from the base if you don't constantly hold the thing together. After 2 weeks I'm already shopping for a new machine. I wouldn't recommend this machine to even the casual user. Smoking appliances have no place in any kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't make pesto","review":"We use a blender for two things - making pesto and smoothies. I don't know how this one works for smoothies - as we returned it because it doesn't make pesto. All the ingredients (nuts, basil leaves and olive oil) just sat there. After much stirring and poking and more stirring and poking, it did grind the mixture up a bit. More stirring and poking and more stirring and poking yielded a very lumpy sauce and fustrated cook. I think that the design of the glass jar is such that the ingredients are not fed into the blades properly. This jar is very flat on the bottom, whereas other blenders that we have owned have a more cone shape at the bottom. It's hard for me to imagine that Cuisinart even put out this blender and impossible to believe that they tested it for simple tasks. Making pesto just isn't that difficult a job. Maybe the food processor part works better, but we needed a blender, so we got something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another broken part","review":"Although the blender is working like a charm, the drive for the food processor died for no reason.

Two machines for the price of one, right? Well I'm about to purchase a new food processor because this one is so LOUD I hate using it. (The person who said they wear earplugs is not exaggerating. I have to cover my ears. It makes my kids cry.) Also, it only holds 3 cups of food - way too small for most jobs. It's ok as a blender.

The blade assembly developed a crack after many years, but still works (though it leaks). Both of these items are replaceable - I'm just a procrastinator.I love the heavy glass blender jar. The blender works wonderfully for my breakfast smoothies, and the food processor makes quick work of small batches. I love how easy it is to disassemble for cleaning (and dishwasher safe).

You've convinced me to never again purchase ANYTHING you make.I should also add that while the unit was working, I found the food processor not very good.I've purchased a KitchenAid food processor which is much better and working well.

Once in a while, the pieces are a little larger than I need, but most of the time I get excellent results. I use it often to make carrot cake and tuna or chicken salad. If it can chop up a carrot completely, I'm happy.My son loves the blender part if only because its only use has been milkshakes. It is loud but it chops/purees everything much better than the 10 year old blender I was using before.I read all the reviews about the broken parts. Haven't had a problem yet, so I'll continue to use this. One of the best deals I have come across in a long time.Its now 11/2005 and it still works, not one problem with it ever.

It worked OK (when it worked)--not too powerful, and I found the shape of the blender jar to be awkward--no funnel-type shape, just flat, doesn't mix well. Cuisinart's service is scary. Their website is of no help. I just needed a replacement rubber gasket, made three requests online and got no response. I finally called, and they sent me one gratis, but it took a month. Last night it finally just stopped working, though I'm not sure why or how. All I know is that it took everything I could muster to get it to chop tomatoes. I considered looking for a place to get it fixed, rather than just throwing it out and starting over, but coming by this info. is hard and I'm not sure it's worth it.

It's pointless to even try ice because it hardly blends thawed mushy frozen fruit.3. As loud as it is you would think it would be a blend like a mad man.4. It would be nice if cuisinart designed some way to not have extra sharp blades with no place to store them safely. I have had this blender for 3 years and never found a good safe place to store the extra food processor blade, and I am a very organized person.It has worked for awhile for how overly crappy it is 3-4 years but like the title says, I wish it would burn out so I wouldn't feel guilty about buying a new blender and food processor."},{"rating":"1","title":"chunky smoothies, blade assembly seizes","review":"Somehow stuff gets missed by the blades.

I may give up before I buy the second blade unit. I have had other blenders that were way more effective. The overall idea is great, a dual purpose unit with a wide glass jar, and an easy to clean control panel.

I'm not quite sure who the \\"WE\\" that the creators write about in the introductory pamphlet is, but I would hope that most women would find the self-stereotyping and overgeneralizations that this game depends on to be offensive or at least unsettling.Not only does it suggest that all women regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. are united by Western pseudopsychological self-esteem issues, but the game also pushes alternative medicine, suggesting on one card that there are \\"alternative ways to healing,\\" as though being an empowered woman necessitates buying into pseudoscientific theories of medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romeo Gigli, Live or Memorex!","review":"In the past I have come across several imitations of Romeo Gigli and have found that the coloring of the spray handle on the bottle is a good indication of a copy.

There are pose modifications being demonstrated by one of the other people on stage, but what is really needed are a few more sequences, and the inclusion of more challenging poses. I have only been doing yoga about a year, but I am athletic and was in good shape when I started. I still recommend this DVD, and keep it in rotation with several others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great relaxing program","review":"Not only is the program very relaxing, I have been using it for a month and have felt significant reduction in my hip pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"this has to be one of my favorite yoga videos! i don't have time to go to a studio on a regular basis so finding good videos to do at home is really important for me. if you like this one you'll definitely like YogaWorks Body Slim. I had been looking for a video with quick transitions to get my heart rate up like the YogaWorks Body Slim video and finally found it when I found this Feel Good Yoga video. This video is on the pricey side but I suppose it is still cheaper than going to a studio, and it's a good video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good Yoga: Aptly named","review":"I have had over 50 yoga DVDs in my collection, and this is one I return to again and again when I truly need a \\"feel good\\" session. I bought my second copy a few months ago, after having worn the first one out. The pace is wonderful, with one of the best warm up and cooldown sequences I've ever seen. The narration is smooth and soothing, even humorous at times without being smarmy, and having three levels of each pose being demonstrated is inspiring as well as instructional.I would give this DVDs five stars save for a quality issue that has already been mentioned in several other reviews: both of my DVDs have had skip problems, in the same section (a brief blip going into cat-cow sequence). Very minor, but persistant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"This power yoga class is excellent! It is very similar to a power vinyasa flow yoga class that I usually go to. The only thing that sort of bugs me is his moans throughout the dvd when he gets into a pose he likes....a little funny. However even with the moans this is a very challenging and satisfying power yoga session!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing copy quality - content good","review":"Content was OK but was hard to focus on due to the poor quality of the \\"new\\" product shipped to me. The DVD looked flawless (no scratches or visible imperfections). When played, there were numerous skips and audio dead spots. During the final relaxation pose, the DVD skipped back into the middle of the routine, jerking me out of my calm state. The cover art mirrored the production quality - the colors didn't line up giving the photos a double-vision quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"If you like the nightmare on elm street movies, then this Cd is for you! it has great songs on it. definately one of the better soundtracks from movies of the nightmare series.

It took me the first week to get through the instructional portion because I couldn't finish it. (I have a lot of back problems that prevent me from doing so much.)

I had tired of the jumping and gyrating of high impact aerobics and other forms of exercise. Just as I was coming to this realization, I happened upon Teresa Tapp and T-Tapp being shown on my local PBS station. Curious, I purchased the Basic Workout Plus. It is a 15 minute workout. I was skeptical. Could I get a decent workout in 15 minutes? The answer is YES!! Her workout is medically and anatomically based. It's almost like physical therapy. Anyone of any age can do it. There is NO jumping. There is no complicated choreography. I do not need any equipment. After the 15 minute exercise, my heart is pumping and my muscles feel as if they've been working. I have since ordered the Total Workout. It is longer, with added moves. I really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"It is a workout anyone can do and it takes such little time out of the day.It gives you extra energy to go about your day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jr version of the adult game","review":"This game is simply Yahtzee in a Jr form.

My son loves to read it and look at the pictures. He is not quite 2, and I can't keep him away from it! It's also a fun read for adults. It has it all: action, adventure, comedy, and a moral at the end (that's not overdone). It's a great comic-type book without the stuff we don't want our kids getting into too young. The illustrations are fabulous, and the transitions between make-believe and reality are excellent. I highly recommend this book to anyone with young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must","review":"This a great book, one that I feel the adults will get the bigger kick out of.

The machine almost jumped off the table! It was so completely jammedand that center stem was so tightly wedged into the center hole that the entiremachine, stem, blade and all, had to go into the dumpster. I felt lucky it didn't fly apart into a whirling disk of death.So here I am buying another one to go into my new 9 cup processor. Yes, these will fit that size machine also. This size cut is the one you want your cucumbers to be, and most other vegitables. The one that comes with the machine is paper thin.Hopefully it will last a bit longer than the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't use with DLC5 unless ordering adt'l part","review":"Amazon recommended this accessory when I bought the DLC5. After receiving it I found that the spindles are permanently attached to the shredder and slicer blades that came with the unit. (I'm not sure how you store those very efficiently!) Now I have the adt'l slicer blade with no spindle. I have to do some research to find a spindle see if it will fit the DLC5 food processor.

It makes near perfect slices (depends more on the apple how they come out) and they are all the perfect thickness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's supposed to","review":"I actually didn't use this as a 6mm for long, because eventually I decided I wanted even wider cuts... so I took a pair of nose pliers and some oomf combined with caressing ingenuity and turned it into an 8-9 mm slicing disk. would've purchased a bigger slicing disk but alas 6mm is the largest they sell for the 7 cup DLC-10). Even back when I used to use it as its intended 6mm size it did what it was supposed to just as it does now at my modified size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart 6mm Slicing Disc","review":"This is the size slicing disc one really needs for most food prep. It's perfect for potatoe casseroles and apple pie slices as well as most veggies for salads. The 4mm that is included with the purchase of a food processer should be replaced with this 6mm one. The 4mm is useless except for specialty recipies using very thin slices."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap, old, shabby","review":"Why did I expect an old book in paper back that cost $.49 to be in better condition than the shabby condition it was?

The slim light grey strap of plastic which goes between the thumb and index finger simply broke while I slept. Otherwise the design is light and the rest of the design works well. The velcro adjustment straps which hold the main portion of the brace tightly against the wrist flop around and sort of get in the way. There must be a simple easy disign an improvement to make these two straps less intrusive. If those two flaws are addressed, (and they would be easy changes) this brace would be perfect as it light yet otherwise strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 hours!","review":"The brace felt very comfortable at first, and seemed like it was going to work for me.

You have to stop the thing and stir the ingredients around a couple times then restart it to get things blended. Even then it doesn't work as well as my old blender.

The activity is exactly the same on each page (one for each letter of the alphabet) and consists of just finding the letters that surround the picture of an animal on each page.

This book is bettered geared for infants who are just learning the letters as in the nursery - I think he would have been more interested then. I bought the Leap goes Shopping - which is delightfully interesting and challenging for him,it is multi-task, multi senosry and includes identifying in games - letters, shapes, colours, lots of sounds and noises. etc. We also got the Toy Story II which is a smashing hit with him - and it has challenges for him now until age 6 or so - per tuff stuff - but there are levels to choose.Therefore, I would recommend Leaps friends A-Z for infant beginners like 2 - 3 year olds but not for a 4 year old - too boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best choice","review":"My son received this book last year for christmas when he was four.

Two songs specifically, Voodoo Child and Little Wings. Not that Hendrix isn't brilliant in these version but I was hoping to get the songs from the original album.

This was very obviously aimed at kids with little attempt to entertain their parents. The mystery element (Who's the mysterious and sinister \\"Rattler\\"?) is rather ho-hum. The element where the bad guy is successfully disguising himself as other characters using rubber masks is laughable. The continuing antics of Ken Maynard's sidekick are rather tiring.

Anyway's I like the controls setting for the game, and the fact that most of the moves are easy to master. The story mode is one of the best i've ever played and of course it goes from the beggining to the end of the Dark Tournament saga. When you finish a match, there are cutscenes from the anime that you watch, and even title cards.

Many of the insects are common species that most folks can already identify from experience (house flies, mosquitos, fleas, centipedes, millipedes, house crickets, etc.) It may be useful for children, but as I mentioned, there are limited illustrations (and they are not in color). If you are looking for something along the lines of a key to identifying insects, this book will not help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Entomophiles, but...","review":"I purchased the book as an entomologist looking for a reference to local taxa. While the book is adequate, it's definitly written for the lay reader. Good for a quick reference to common insects and arthropods of the southwest, including tips for avoiding habitats of venomous species, not good for a key to species. Cheap enough to be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bendis does it again","review":"Total Sell Out is basically just a collection of short strips/stories that Bendis has done over the years. Some are crime fiction (naturally) and others are just hysterical.When I read \\"My Blue Heaven,\\" I just about fell out of my chair, and the Shtick section is definitely worth a laugh.By far, the gem of the book, and the funniest, is the story about Kabukiman. I won't spoil it--but it's so indicative of the state of comic book conventions.\\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\" and \\"The Kiss Off\\" are superb pieces of crime fiction that feature Bendis on art. I wish this guy would pick his pencil back up!All in all, a very entertaining read. At the very least, it's a great book for bathroom reading, if you're into that kind of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have owned a 7-speed Cuisinart blender for a year. The performace is inferior. Banana smoothies still have lumps after minutes of blending. It has been a long time since I have been so disgusted by a product. Also, the disk with the teeth in the center of the base unit (that meshes with the one on the bottom of the container to turn the blade) is prone to shatter if you lift the container while it is running. Cuisinart will send a replacement part for free, but it is a pain to install. There is no reason why this part should not be made of shatterproof material. I recommend avoiding this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly fabulous read!","review":"Those who dismiss \\"K.Ro\\" and \\"Mel-DLC's\\" book as trite or annoying are so gouche -- and maybe a little jealous that these two were able to bootstrap up the ladder! The book is hilarious and a total confidence-booster, as you leave the book feeling, \\"Hey, I can do this! I can be famous!\\" You'll be designing your exclusive calling cards inside the back cover and snickering as you remember Melissa's crashing-the-bachelor party story or the story of the ladies' run-in with another fame-seeker, a dentist, who didn't quite leave the best impression.Do not listen to the one-star-ers or the \\"three barely flickering star\\" reviewers!

Don't even bother browsing through it at the bookstore. Whoever said in an earlier review that all the five star ratings were written by the authors themselves is spot on; the book is not clever, insightful, or even tongue-in-cheek cute. What's more these ladies are not glamorous, famous or even beautiful -- just desperate. If you're really dying to get on Page Six (yechh!) all you need to do is steal a celebrity's shoes or underwear . . . or worse (just ask Andrew Cunanan). So a couple of haggish, self-aggrandizing neurotics got to wear some nice jewelry and get written about in the newspaper? Who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you ever heard of the authors? I haven't.","review":"The fact that I have never heard of either of the authors should have been my first clue as to how ineffective their techniques are.Throughout the book so many names are dropped that the reader nearly trips over them at every turn. How are those of us who don't know Michael Musto and the like supposed to apply the advice of these two authors? The fact that they do have friends in high places and still couldn't become well-known speaks volumes.There is, in truth, very little advice contained in this book. It is mostly filled with anecdotes of the authors' exploits with very few practical tips for fame-seekers.In the authors' quest for fame they missed the mark. It wasn't fame that they achieved, but rather the ability to be anonymous free-loaders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neurotic Wannabe Drivel","review":"Don't waste your time or money reading this book. The positive reviews were clearly written by their friends - or themselves. The book reminds me of going on a blind date with someone who is so self involved you start seeing Charlie Brown's teacher making that \\"harr heer heer hoar haar\\" noise as their mouth opens and closes.When these women aren't boring you by dropping names, they're giving advice on how to become a neurotic socialite wannabe. Unfortunately, they seem to strive to be just such a person with such vigor they don't notice how desperate and pathetic they really are. A sad insight to desperate women who place too much value in everthing that doesn't matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-lease","review":"Can we say shameless self promotion?

This is not entertaining and useful hints and tips on what ordinary Americans can do to ckaim some fame. It is simply a description on how two over-the-hill journalists in their 30s used their old sources to get invited to celebrity parties -for two weeks. (going to these parties is basically in the job desciption for journalists anyway.) The book is fun at times, but on the whole it is repetitive and self absorbed. Not worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good obscure hard rocker that'll grow on you!!","review":"I had never heard this band's album from 1979, but purchased it when it came out on the excellent Monster Records label this past year.

I compare these guys to the Undertaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sweet","review":"After reading the positive reviews I decided to try this cereal. I'm not impressed. It's too sweet with lots of sugar. There are 14g of sugars per 2/3 cup serving. Some ingredients like the dried fruit and oats are hard while others like the cereal flakes are soft and absorb milk. If you let the hard parts soften up with milk the flakes turn into mush.Familia makes a lot of great cereals and I'm surprised they let this one out the door. They must think Americans are sugar-crazed Coca Cola addicts. I really like the Familia Low-Fat Musli and suggest you buy that instead.On the plus side this cereal has a lot of dried fruit. It tastes good if you eat it quickly before it gets to soggy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good taste but hard bits dangerous to teeth.","review":"I really wish I could say I loved this as it does taste good. the hard fruit bits just make it a danger to your teeth!

My only complaint about the writing style is that the work really needs to be read twice: once to get the general feel of the ideas presented, and a second time to follow all the references to chapters found later on in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Ancient Roman history, even though I found the price a bit high for a 90-page work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandmother","review":"The wheelbarrows I purchased are just what I thought they would be - just like my son's which we bought 25 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice quaility wheelbarrow","review":"I have a 6 y.o. boy and a 4 y.o. boy and they both enjoy this wheelbarrow.

We bought it for xmas along with some rakes, brooms, etc for pretend play and he just does not use the wheelbarrel at all. It is a bit hard for him to balance and so he is using it now just to play car races and building legos. He is a very active, coordinated boy so it is not that he doesnt know how to use it- I think it needs more stability, at least another wheel possibly or maybe as he gets older he may develop more of an interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great birthday present for Yard work loving Kids","review":"we purchased this for our daughters 3rd birthday she loved it.its very sturdy, pushes nicely, we have a very uneven bumpy yard & pushing it around was not a problem, right height for little kids, held a 30+ pound kid in it with out collapsing,my son & nephew did somehow manage to break 1 handle but we screwed it back on doesn't look perfect any more but still worksyou do have to assemble!!well worth the price!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not great","review":"Two grandsons and one granddaughter LOVED this wheelbarrow, which was purchased to replace a 20+ year old radio flyer kid's wheelbarrow that finally wore out - on the new one the gauge of the metal is thinner, the paint wasn't applied as nicely and within 6 years it had deteriorated and begun to rust.These issues are NOT the fault of the seller - just keep in mind, like most things manufactured now, the quality and construction is sometimes not as good as what was made previously.

Why did he undertake this journey? How did he plan for it? It really isn't explained. I do not get any feel for the experience he had. The entire book is only 19 pages. Another 6 pages relate the story of St. Thomas. Skip it and try Jerry Ellis' far more substantial and better written 'Walking to Canterbury'."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Orleans History","review":"This book probably only appeals to those who lived through the Catholic school desegregation turbulence in New Orleans. Written by a Jesuit with access to the Jesuit community documents, it provides a window into the thinking of New Orleans southerners with emphasis on Loyola University. The divisions among the Jesuits at Loyola and across the city in the face of desegregation were amazingly deep, especially compared with those at Spring Hill College in Mobile, another Jesuit college in the same province. It is frightening to learn how deeply rooted the racial heritage of religious and educators really was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Received Order","review":"This was delivered to the wrong address and I never received it.

They gave me an RMA number and everything so it seemed to be going fine.It has been about two months now and they are ignoring every effort I make to contact them via email, phone, etc..

I think it gets forced into the deep \\"V\\" in the thread when you close the cap. Better bottles use larger shallow round bottom threads. Also the plastic coating is, well plastic. They do look nice and hold up to abuse. And I don't think the gunk in the threads will kill you because you can turn it into sterile gunk if you soak it in bleach. But it looks bad even at arm's length I can see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectations","review":"I bought this product to replace an old Sigg water bottle I have been using for the past 5 years. Seeing as how much I liked my other one, I figured \\"Why switch?\\" Loved this bottle the first day, and then the second, but on the third the inside lining started peeling off. And let me tell you there is nothing worse than taking a drink from your water bottle only to end up with some little rubber pieces floating around your mouth. Im back to using my old bottle... I would have only given it one star, but it is still a damn good lookin bottle and I cant bring myself to throw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"No metallic taste","review":"The other bottles I have purchased, taste like metal. The Sigg bottle is the first that I try that doesn't have a metallic smell or taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but dents easily","review":"I decided to go with a metal bottle because i wouldn't have to worry about plastic chemicals getting into the water. It's a pretty convenient size, holds a good amount of water. Only complaint is the metal dents very easily. They could have put a protective plastic layer on the outside or something to make it more durable, especially seeing as it cost $20. Apart from that it's a good bottle as long as you don't care about a few dents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottle!","review":"After deciding to replace our Nalgene bottles, I researched metal bottles from various manufacturers. Sigg bottles consistently scored high in reliablility and satisfaction, so we bought a few of them. My only nit is that the lids are easy to drop and maybe lose, so an included lanyard would be nice. But aside from that minor complaint, the bottles are light, odor/taste-less, and dead sexy, to quote someone famous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fit For Battle","review":"I returned this bottle because it was all dinged up and scratched. Honestly, it looked like it had been through Iraq before it got to me in LA. I didn't reorder because it seemed like it would damage easily, and for over $20 I think it should stand up to a little abuse.

This screw off style cap is cumbersome and takes a total of SEVEN turns to get the cap off. Who has the time or patience when looking for a quick drink?

( I forget the exact name but its black with pink and white flowers) As far as the looks goes, it's pretty sweet. Its perfect size. I would have given it 5, but it doesn't keep water cold at all. If you put hot water in it, you cannot even hold the thing. I do not like that this item is NOT dishwasher safe. I use a baby bottle scrubber, and that seems to work, but it is still a pain. I bought another bottle brand that is dishwasher safe, and has a sleeve on it to help keep it insulated, I use that one much more often than this one. But it does not look as pretty. Overall though, it does the job, and seems to be good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"good bottle","review":"im happy...but i dont know if its worth the price. nalgene bottles are much cheaper.

It is lightweight, fits into the cupholders in my car, does not leak and is easy to drink from the opening. The ice cubes from my icemaker DO fit into the opening although you have to insert them one at a time. I recently melted some older plastic water bottles in the dishwasher, and had been wanting to replace them anyway with all the concern about BPA in plastics and the funky taste you sometimes get from plastic. There is no funky taste at all with this. We have a Sigg bottle and a Klean Kanteen, the Sigg bottle is much lighter. I am considering getting a bunch of these to give away as Christmas gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great water bottle","review":"This is a really good water bottle if you don't want to use plastic bottles. It holds a lot. A little hard to carry around, but I don't have that much problem with it. It does sweat quite a bit when filled with cold liquids, so you need to be careful with it around papers in the office/classroom.

It's probably the only HTML book you need to give you good foundation knowledge. It then gives you a basic overview of what you need to learn in the future to become an advanced web site creator (like Javascript, CGI, and Perl). At times I found some concepts difficult to understand, and had to go to another source for an alternative explanation, but that was seldom and probably to be expected from time-to-time given the subject matter. Sometimes re-reading an earlier chapter was enough to clear up any confusion. I was very impressed (and surprised) to discover some topics, like web page design, were covered just as well in \\"HTML Complete\\" as more specialised books."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this!","review":"When I first got this camera, I was satisfied. It is complicated to use (definitely not intuitive) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want. However, it took pretty good pictures. However, soon after the warranty expired, it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn't stop it from doing that. We tried to contact Fuji but have gotten no response. My wife found that this is a common problem (overeposure and lack of response from Fuji), which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell. Hopefully, they have fixed the problem but I wouldn't bet my money on it. This camera has given us more frustration than it is worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuji Finepix E550 turns off when press shutter","review":"I had this camera for two years. It worked great for about a year but after that the camera would turn itself off when you try to take a picture. It will remains on if you take a movie clip or do anything else, but as soon as you press the shutter to take a picture it would turns itself off. This has nothing to do with the batteries as I tried new batteries, different brand of batteries, fully recharge, orginal rechargeable Fuji batteries. I have seen many, many posts online about this exact problem. Don't buy this product if you're looking for something that lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for?","review":"I too am missing the usb adapter as well as the hand strap & cradle.

If you're looking for a picture book of grand movie palaces, this isn't it.

Te whole plot centers around Darcy and Bingley's premarital affairs. The author just kept on reiterating this in different ways; so many times, it was irritating. She glossed over births, romance, and Lizzie's personality.There are other P&P sequels that are more worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good sequal...","review":"...compared to many of the other P&P; sequals...the plot skips, the language does not conform, the characters are not well established.

Other books equally good are those that offer P&P; from Darcy's point of view. Specifically the Aiden books. Nicely done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing? You Bet!","review":"Being quite the fan of Jane Austen and, particularly P&P, I looked forward to receiving and reading this book. Almost from the beginning the disapointment began to set in. Most troublesome was the fact that I was never quite sure in which setting a particular scene took place. The locations were not well described and the plot seemed to jump around. The many characters and intertwined relationships between them made the plot even more difficult to follow. Many of the sentences were sooooooo long that I had to re-read them several times to get the gist of what was being said. More than a few times I had to consult with Mr. Webster to ascertain the meanings of many of the more obscure words. I really was finished with the book about 3/4 of the way through but struggled through to the end which, in itself, was a big letdown. I'd pass on this one if I were you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so bad at all","review":"\\"The Darcys\\" are much better than most of the sequels I read. The author doesn't idealize Darcy and Lizzy and it is very refreshing. Her Lizzy isn't \\"inherently maternal\\" and has no real problems with the birth of the first child (btw, the daughter) and even with the double standards of the age. Her Darcy isn't a paragon of virtue. And Bingley too. Of course, some dialogues are too long and the idea of Her Highness Caroline is too revolting but as a whole the story is not so bad.

Disjointed, motivations unclear, so many details begging to be established, a little bit of atmosphere and some moments of good cinematography can't save this disappointing film. It's like a homemade loaf of bread missing a few ingredients and pulled out of the oven too soon. Though Terrance Malick is listed as a producer, this story doesn't come close to any of his films in substance, just a slight resemblance in style.

Jamie Bell has an ordinary looking face,but when he smiles, oh that smile lights up the place! I wish I could have seen more of that smile in this down beat movie, to help give it a break from the seriousness of the unsetteling nature of this wounderful movie.

Too many quirky innocent ramblings about chiggers and books, that, spoken by children, must hold some profundity. The humor of the film came from the colorful locals and didn't seem to have much to do with any directorial intention. And finally, the music. We knew something dramatic was happening on the screen when the music kicked in. Philip Glass or not, the music was intrusive, clunky (like video game music during the action scenes) and cinematically redundant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd Piece of Southern Goth","review":"Undertow starts nicely - particularly in detailing the world of the boys in this rural drama. However, after a while it becomes too rote as a thriller/chase film.Both boys turn in great perfomances and Mulroney is very good as the terminally depressed, bitter and unlucky father.There is some great mood setting up-front that disolves as the story moves into thriller territory. As a thriller however, it is still a little too languid with some major over-indulgent moves by the director. Frankly, it looked beautiful but turned dull.Rental only, if interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sweet spot of hardcore, but not the sweetest...","review":"Haste the Day is one of the more amazing bands to pop into an overpopulated metal scene, and they're doing a dang fine job of pushing to the front of the crowd.

The hard vocals are more refined and the guitars sound better from \\"Burning Bridges\\", but it lacks the variety BB had. Some say that having more soft vocals on this disc makes it suffer, but I think the soft vocals blend very well with the hard.

I eagerly awaited their second release, expecting even more of this intensity.However, When Everything Falls left me disappointed. While there still were decent breakdowns and the music was still pretty driving, everything sounded the same. There was a lot more singing, which for me was another disappointment, but that's just preference (as is my dislike for their cover song). The intensity seemed to have been lost somewhere inbetween their live performance and the recording, because they were the most intense and heaviest show I saw of the 28 shows I went to at Cornerstone Festival this summer- but it's just not there when I listen to it on the CD.Haste the Day is still a great band, they just don't have much that separates them from the rest anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy's last","review":"Lets start off by saying that Haste the Day was one of my favorite bands (RIP) so I'm totally biased when reviewing this band.

It sounds like random metal. I like Mushroomhead a lot but they are a GOOD metal band. It sounds like Jeff Hatrix is trying to sound like half Joey Belladonna(Old Anthrax) and half James Hetfield(metallisuck). And personally I dont like either of those guys!

If you're expecting this to be along the lines of \\"Blue Lines\\" or \\"Mezzanine\\", don't hold your breath--but \\"100th Window\\" still holds its own as being an impressive release!

You could not force the Cd out of my player. 100th Window, however, is taking me longer to develop a true reaction to.

It adds absolutely nothing to their catalogue and Sinead O'Conner was a singularly uninspired choice for a guest vocalist. Finally, this is a \\"Massive Attack\\" album in name only, as two of the three absolutely essential bandmates left, leaving 3-D to his own devices to inflict this turgid dross upon us.I'm a long-time fan of Massive Attack and have given this album many chances. I was a bit on the fence regarding it, but seeing so many desperate 5-star reviews from people with such obviously low expectations reinforces how far this band has sunk.

This album is boring.Most importantly, two of the main songwriters from their previous albums, Marshall and Vowles, are glaringly missing.This is not Massive attack. It is the Robert Del Naja and Sinead O'Connor show.No more of the smooth laid back rapping style that I loved from their previous albums. It suffers from a lack of variety opting for a more consistent (read: monotonous) sound throughout. Where are the guitars or the energy of previous releases? 3 Sinead songs is three too many. Her \\"Prayer for England\\" is the worst track with M.A. written on it.I'm beginning to think that there are a lot people being paid to write 5 star \\"customer reviews\\" of albums. This trend is disheartening, although I'm not surprised. Be wary!

For Massive Attack, it's a starting point in dire need of refining and perfecting.Independent of the band, this record works as utterly forgettable music to read or sleep to. In conjuncture with Massive Attack's name, it's a disappointment and a bore. O'Connor's contribution makes only about one track - \\"What Your Soul Sings\\" - stand out. Otherwise, the sound is not meddlesome, in that you won't even notice the songs go buy, and you won't be able to tell one from another.Defenestration is what this deserves.

While Mezzanine is beautifully dark and powerful, 100th window is dark but lacks any power. I have listened to 100th window a good 10 times and still find it hard to remember a single track. The only one that stands out is the single \\"special cases\\"and that's not because it's good, but because it's the only track that sounds different. The rest of 100th window is mostly lite a fluffy ambient filler. Sinead O'conner who lends vocals to 3 tracks, sounds awfully tired and her voice just doesn't fit the music in my opinion. She sounds especially awful on 'A prayer for England'. With 9 tracks at a whopping 73 minutes long, 100th window might make for some interesting background noise for a while. Just make sure you are doing something else while you listen to it or you will surely fall asleep. 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing... and Dangerous !!!","review":"Disappointing since all the hip hop influences are now gone.

I have always been a big fan of MA and their previous works are all top notch, but this CD was a total disappointment. Totally uninspiring, lacking in everything, boring, depressingly depressing, not a single track stands out as a highlight in any way whatsoever. What is Sinead O'Conner doing here, and what does she have to contribute? Did they bump into her at the pub on the way to the recording and asked her to come along for a wrist slashing session? Give this a wide berth and pick up a copy of any of their previous releases instead, (ie, Blue Lines, Protection, Mezzanine are all brilliant). 100th Window is a shocker,,,BLAND-BLAND-BLAND!!!

I still support the band for their pioneering musicianship, but I hope they see the error of their ways and get back to creating substantive music, or else just call it a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous!","review":"The new album from Massive Attack is just brilliant. It differs greatly from their previous work. Its a cold record which is equally very dark. A lot of the string arrangments used help greatly to give that sort of mood. Despite Daddy G temporarily leaving and Mushroom completely quiting the group, 3D manages this piece of work extremely well. This time Sinead O'Connor is on vocals for 2 songs. Yes, it would have been nice to hear Liz Fraser on the mic again but hey! Sinead sounds fabulous especially on \\"A prayer for England\\". As for Horace Andy, he still sounds as great as he always did. 100th window is an album that is hard to get into at first but when given several listens it will sink right through you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Un disco perfecto","review":"El disco es una auténtica maravilla.

Un lujo que llevaba esperando muchísimo tiempo.En definitiva un disco imprescindible."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad, sad disappointment","review":"This latest Massive Attack release -- what in fact would be more aptly defined as 3D's solo effort -- finds the Bristol \\"wild bunch\\" retracing the ground that Mezannine opened. The dark, brooding beats were new in '98, but they're getting abit old now, no? Moroever, Sinead O'Connor's shrill croonings were a bad choice for the album--remember that this is the band that has featured the likes of Shara Nelson, Traci Thorn and Liz Frazer.Given the brilliant experimentation between Blue Lines, Protection and Mezannnine, one would have hoped for a few more inspired tunes. At the end of the day, one can't help but think that Mushroom's departure robbed the band of the creative impulse that distinguished Massive Attack's previous albums. Perhaps next time around they might look to their roots, take a step forward and continue the genre-breaking, original work for which we love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite return to form","review":"Okay lets get it over with; this album is DARK! it bleeds seediness,uncomfort and tension from every song, even the 'lighter' ones.But that's not to say that it's not an enjoyable record - on the contrary, it is, in my estimation, considerably better than mezzanine AND protection.It is an evolution from the sound of mezzanine, but contains a more organic,soulful sound. I heard the 'special cases' song with Sinead O'Connor on MTV, and wasn't too impressed with it.But when listened to on a radio with the rest of the songs,it makes sense. Even for those who usually find Horace Andy's vocals annoying, he actually sounds good here. I downloaded this album thinking that it wouldn't be worth buying, but I may just give my burned version to a mate and buy the retail version, and the last album I actually 'bought' was ages ago - Beth Gibbons' album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Massive Attack - 100th Window","review":"Not Massive Attack's best album, but 100TH WINDOW is still an album of impressive beauty and menace. Sinead O'Connor takes the role of chanteuse du jour, and her fragile voice accompanies the lonesome guitar and wistful harp chords on \\"What Your Soul Sings\\" with startling fragility. Later, on \\"Special Cases,\\" she makes her whisper into more of a growl. Frequent collaborator Horace Andy also lends his vocals: on \\"Everywhen,\\" he adds a grace note amongst the dub effects. He also works well with faster tempo, as on \\"Name Taken.\\" As with other Massive Attack albums, the overall feel of 100TH WINDOW is one of dense sonic paranoia (\\"Butterfly Caught\\" is a good example of this; it's bass growls with tension), but also has fewer songs to lighten the mood somewhat. \\"A Prayer for England\\" is both gorgeous and depressing. And I've never thought that Robert Del Naja was the best vocalist, but his grizzled voice matches the overall tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening","review":"Everytime I listen to this album I hear something new. I'm amazed how quickly I become lost in their sound, almost as if in a trance. Small Time Shot Away is by far the best track, and Sinead does a wonderful job on a few of the tracks. This is a must for any listener. Its passionate, emotional, and thought provoking. What more could anyone ask for in an album. I won't even bother comparing it to their other albums, 100th Window is in a league of its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"100th Window is being compared to Mezzanine and people are disappointed. I think they were just trying to do a different sound here, and if you listen to it, it is a hauntingly beautiful sound. Sinead O'Connor has a wonderful voice and \\"Special Cases\\" is one of my favorite songs. The only complaint I have is AntiStar---what is the point of having this song as 19 minutes? It's clearly filler. The album as a whole is very dark but if you listen to it again you discover that it is multi-layered and carefully prepared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I expected it to be: the CD after Mezzanine.","review":"First, try not to look at Massive Attack as being a \\"solo venture,\\" okay? I mean, you're practically putting 3D in the same genre as Trent Reznor. These songs are a far cry from simply hitting a button and regurgitating (sp) the same song in a different manner!And Sinead O'Conner has a wonderful voice (and she's attractive too, although I didn't think so back in 1989 when she was popular, but then again I was only 12 years old and didn't realize that bald women could be so hot!)In all honesty, if anyone is purchasing this CD expecting some kind of spiritual and metaphysical epiphany, it's probably because he or she hasn't purchased Mezzanine yet.Think about it: Mezzanine is the kind of album about which 90% of most musicians only dream! To expect a group (or \\"soloist\\") to subsequently come out with an album as exquisite as Mezzanine is asking one hell of a lot!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, but my ears do not like it completely","review":"Defined as Trip-Hop that is dark, moody and unpredictable, Massive Attack does a good job at living up to those descriptions. However, the end result is a product that I just don't like too much. I like Trip-Hop that is moody, but as usual with most Trip-Hop that I come across, there are only 2 or 3 songs that I may like. I think it may be due to the experimental nature of the genre. This CD is no exception. I like the tracks that Sinead O'Connor lends her voice on and Track #4 \\"Everywhen\\", but the last few tracks, specifically 7-9, were skipped really fast. As with Massive Attack's other CD's, I can't say that I liked the whole CD, but I can definitely say that there were some outstanding tracks. Especially on the \\"Blue Lines\\" CD. I can't even say that about this CD. I liked some of the songs, but there was nothing that really stood out to me as a classic. Oh well, it happens......"},{"rating":"2","title":"3-d sings!!!","review":"Although that's not the better MA's CD, although 3-d hates his own voice, I love his intelligent records, I like his guest singers and I can't forget their recent live concert in Granada."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEPRESSING","review":"Loved the previous CD's and so was very disappointed with this one, too dark and depressing, not all what i expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Mezzanine, with even less to say (if that were possible","review":"The thing that frustrated me right off the bat about this CD was that the new \\"anti-piracy\\" protection completely FUBARs playing this disk on my computer.

Its the same sampled sound playing over and over. I lost NOTHING.The album itself is mediocre at best. I would rate the songs, but the all sound the same and are instantly forgetable.

A sad day for fans. This album is boring.Most importantly, two of the main songwriters from their previous albums, Marshall and Vowles, are glaringly missing.This is not Massive attack. It is the Robert Del Naja and Sinead O'Connor show.No more of the smooth laid back rapping style that I loved from their previous albums. It suffers from a lack of variety opting for a more consistent (read: monotonous) sound throughout. Where are the guitars or the energy of previous releases?Sinead and Gabriel = Good. Sinead and Massive = Bad.Her \\"Prayer for England\\" is the worst track to ever bear the Massive Attack monicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNOREVILLE","review":"Not a single memorable track.

I find it as exciting as blue lines, and even more fun than mezzanine. Allthough its still very atmospheric, dark and dreamy, there is an upbeat danceable side to it. Sineads guest vocals fit the mood of this album very well. Mezzanine was a total bore compared. It may take a few listens to really feel its intentions, but it will create some kind of emotional response in you. Take it as you will, I think its very versatile, and well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than reviewed","review":"I'm surprised to see such low reviews. The disc lacks some of the aggressiveness of Mezzanine/Blue Lines but this is great electronica. The beauty of this disc is in the soft details that are too often overlooked by people with their bass jacked up.I rarely believe this when I hear it but this disc really grows on you (or me, whatever!). I've owned it for a month and have now reached the point of wishing I could hum wierd drumbeats and little catches. It is more trance-esque though so accept it and love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"I is very difficult for me to find words to discribe this album. If I use 'fantastic' 'unbelievable' or 'wonderful', I feel like it is not enough. At first I was a bit disappointed about 100th window. But months (yes, months!) later, I began to realize that this album wasn't that bad. Now, 6 months later, I can say that this is the best MA album next to Mezzanine! If I have to find something less good on this CD, it's the performance of Sinead O' Connor, but still. To all those MA-fans who are dissapointed about 100th window, I say: play it! Over and over again. I maybe takes months but I garantee: you'll like it! You have to listen to it, not just hearing it play. Pay attention to the details: the baselines, the lyrics, his voice. It's a very relaxing album just like the other MA-albums. Big difference is is that this one is more intimate, more personal. It is not made for selling, it is made for YOU. Enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my faves","review":"I really enjoy listening to this album while I'm sitting back and chilling out. Its really good to wind down to. My favorite song is the second one but the entire album is very good. My only complaint is that after a while of listening the songs kind of blend together.

I do feel though some people have rated it 5 stars because its Massive Attack.."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark and darker","review":"Ominous, foreboding, if you like your music dark then this is for you. Massive Attack's, Mezzanine set the scene and this steals the show. Sinead O' Connor comes into her own on this, her vocals are perfect for this kind of haunting edgy sound. Loved this."},{"rating":"2","title":"100th Window","review":"Out of all the massive attack, 100th window is an extremely great cd. However, I dont think it comes close to Blue Lines and Mezzanine. Those two albums were perfect. I do like Sinead O Connor' s vocals but still feel like something is missing that was present in the other albums. The music is still low and dark, but I didnt feel the emotions I felt like the first time I listened to Mezzanine. Maybe it will come later. I would definitly buy this album if you like Massive Attack but if you are new to them, I would start with Mezzanine or Blue Lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tremendous disappointment from MA","review":"I'm a big fan of Massive Attack, and their three previous albums each have a distinct flavor, and addictive quality. This one is just flat, dull, and repetitive. Most bands burn out after a while, and I'm sad to say that this seems to have happened for MA. I hope that I'm wrong, and that they bounce back, but 100th Window is a big letdown. Not terrible, but certainly not up to their usual standards. 100th Window may appeal to some (it reminds me vaguely of Radiohead, whom I also find dull but others like). It's definitely different from earlier MA albums, and the first monotonous, boring album they've done. I'm all for change, but not just plain giving up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy album for your collection","review":"Despite the fact that I like this album I've found myself wanting more. This is because I don't think it fully holds up to its progeniteurs (Mezzanine, Protection & Blue Lines). In fact, if you purchased Mezzanine as your first introduction to Massive Attack, I'd recommend first rounding out your collection with Protection and especially Blue Lines, and its beautiful accent of urban rhythm). This being said, I don't think you'd be wasting your money on 100th Window. The production is strong. Moody and brooding, the album delivers a complex layered melange of enjoyable down-beat triphop. Robert Del Naja is a musician with talent, and it shows througout the album. It's just a different beast wihout Mushroom & Daddy G."},{"rating":"2","title":"Massive Attack or Paris under a groove","review":"I just bought both of these titles at the virgin store in NYC. I have to say that I am enjoying Paris Under A groove much more than massive. Massive has various electronica cuts featured here. Some of the vocals are nicely interwoven in their production. But, where are the monster beats and fat grooves.Paris under a groove is full of eclectic french electronica stylings and has many mind blowing tracks. Especially when you turn them up to feel the amazing basslines. check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a big fan, but...","review":"Recently I heard a journalist talking about Massive Attack. She said what we all know which is that they were ground breaking, combining dark beats and lilting vocals with reggae and other influences.Blue Lines and Protection shaped a generation of artists and turned my world upside down.But that was then...Now Del Naja without his co-founders seems a bit one dimensional. The depth and variation isn't there.Checkout Theivery Corporation's 'Richest Man in Babylon' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Background Music","review":"Massive Attack's 100th Window is trip-hop without the hip-hop. Better known for their spooky atmospherics than for their beats, they give up all pretense to dance culture and go for the ambient chill crowd. Problem is, without the underlay of terror that's driven their best tracks (\\"Angel\\", \\"Protection\\"), there's not much there there. Not that these songs aren't scary - the lyrics are full of forbidding images - but that the music is, at its most propulsive, tinkling and comforting. Sinead O'Connor pops up on a few tracks; she's the trance dance diva du jour and, much as I love her voice, she's a stone bore. Horace Andy's lovely lilt does what it can to prop up a few okay songs. Otherwise, it's background music. Hopefully, for a place you never set foot in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly too dark...","review":"If you come looking for a simple, happy set of tunes, don't! This time Massive Attack have teamed up with Sinhead O'Connor, whacky Irish artist, and in places it becomes downright depressing.

Honest to god, the only good cut here is the one featuring Sinéad O'Connor, \\"What Your Soul Sings.\\" But when they try to use her twice, it turns into another tedious soundscape, as in \\"Prayer For England.\\" And speaking of tedious soundscapes, the repetitiveness of these meagre songs starts to blot out your consciousness after a very short time!If you like \\"What Your Soul Sings,\\" I would suggest doing what I did, and that's purchasing Sinéad's new CD, \\"She Who Dwells.\\" There are a lot more songs like \\"Soul Sings\\" than \\"Prayer For England.\\" In fact, there are dubby gems arranged by Massive Attack (\\"It's All Good\\"), influenced by Massive Attack (\\"Love is Ours\\"), and some outright brilliance on the part of Asian Dub Foundation. \\"She Who Dwells\\" actually sounds like \\"Mezzanine\\"!Guess we'll have to find our Massive Attack in other places from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleak, grim, grim....","review":"I think MA have spent too much time reading the papers. This is one of the most depressing, grim, lachrymose CDs I have yet heard. Listening to this in the car CD player on the way to work is the best possible way to get unmotivated to do any work - particularly in the depressing Bay Area economy. Navel-gazing at its worst. Very Goth, very dark, and just a bit too much in general. Verging on monotonous. DO NOT listen to this if you're out of work or mourning a relationship. In fact, even if you're in a cheerful mood, this disc will fix that good and proper. Good production, good atmospherics. The musicians on this disc just really need to get away for a vacation in a sunny place and drink lots of pina coladas. No wonder Sinead's retiring after cutting this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mezzanine ll","review":"After listening to this cd,I wonder,why did I buy this?,I guess,because I'm a fan and I though that Massive Attack wouldn't let me down.But 100th Windows is exactly like Mezzanine,except that all the songs sound exactly the same,it is hard to remember which song is which,same instruments,same rhythm,same voice.Also the brooding thing is fantastic,if you don't overdo it.This cd is too dark and oppresive,not what I was expecting in a band that is always evolving.Oh,well,maybe next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!

The family concept is very relatable for little kiddos and the animals relate well to younger kids, both boys and girls. My one complaint...and the only reason I rated durability as a 3, is that the clothes seem cheaply made and are very difficult (impossible) for little fingers.

This year, our corn, squash, and grapes were untouched. As evidence of its success, we found one morning a disturbed section of grapevines where a raccoon had likely fallen after encountering an electrified wire we had strung atop the fence in which the grapevine was entwined. It seems that the shock had frightened the raccoon to such an extent that it never returned. It is easy to set up and use. The only \\"downside\\" of the kit is that no hook-up wire is included, which seems essential in order to properly set up the fence. I suspect that this is due to the cost of the hook-up wire, which I bought (50 feet) for about half the price of the kit. Would I have bought the kit (for $20 more) if the wire had been included? Maybe not; so I understand why the manufacturer did not include it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all there is","review":"Bought this kit to keep our puppy out of our garden. Having a kit seems nice only problem it does not have all the parts you need. In order to use this fence outside you have to have a 20thousand volt wire which the company is more than willing to ship for 19.64 plus S$H. Not such a great deal after all. Their company service was not at all helpful and very rude. Take it from me and save time and money and buy a little more expensive fence."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy and missing a wire","review":"I have used electric fences on my gardens before so I was excited to find this kit on Amazon! Once the package was opened I realized that the product was on the flimsy side for an electric fence. The directions called for a 20,000 volt wire which was not included in the kit. I took the directions to Ace Hardware for the wire and they had no idea what kind of wire the directions were calling for. I then took the directions and kit to home depot. Same answer. I called an electrician friend to assist and he could not get it to work with any kind of wire. The plastic posts were not strong enough and there were too few clips to do more than 2 rows. This would definitely not keep my cat out of the garden let alone large iguanas!I am returning it and hope to find something of better quality at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I returned this product.

In the game, you have to create your own team and edit their profile and skills before you can play in the game's campaign mode. I have played about ten games in main career game and I haven't won once. It's because of the create-a-team that isn't that good yet. You only have a limited amount of points that you can use to enhance your team, so some members are better than others.

The drag queen wants to be a \\"real woman\\" and spares money for the operation. That's not much but there is something that makes the movie so good you'll never forget it.

And of course while Wilson makes the only really convincing drag queen, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, really stole the movie most of the time. He was so fun and believable. Of course, on the other end of the spectrum, I was not too thrilled with Robert DeNiro. I suppose that is just my experience with paralysis patients making me a bit too judgmental about the little things. He's a great actor in my opinion, this might just not have been the role for him. Also, their storyline was great, but the money storyline they always went back to was a little boring but I guess it was necessary. Overall, a good buy and worth it. But the RENT-head inside my heart screams for more Cha-Cha screen time ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Philip Seymour Hoffman's Genius Shines!","review":"Watching this amazing film was, at times, painful for me, because Hoffman seemed to be channeling the famous San Francisco drag Queen, 'Valentine.' He looked just like him and his mannerisms were right on. The scenario seems a bit far-fetched even in New York City, but who knows, it could happen. All of the actors were excellent in their roles and both DeNiro and Hoffman seemed to be getting a kick out of playing their scenes together. It takes me back to the early 90s when 'Valentine' and I were dear friends and just trying to stay alive in a very rich city. Our lives took different turns and he stayed and I returned to New York. While I will never see him again, I can see his spirit in the performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman whenever I watch this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Philip Seymour Hoffman..","review":"...it is a toss up between him and William H Macy as to who is the better character actor.

Most of the drag queens in this are plastic characters. Even DeNiro seems plastic. The suspense part of it is seems to have just been thrown in as an excuse for violence and action of a sort.

I've had mine a few years, and I've had little satisfaction from the non-stick feature. I thought it rather quickly lost its non-stick benefit, even with careful washing and treatment. Also, the lid design makes it hard to set the lid on a little to the side for letting steam escape. The lid just comes sliding back full onto the pot. You have to stick a spoon or something in the pan to keep the lid cocked. And watch out when you are washing the lid, it tends to spray water out of the sink if you're not holding it down low enough. The main thing, though, is that non-stick coatings never seems to stick long. I always wish I had gone with non-coated stainless so I can use scouring pads and steel spatulas; cleanup is eventually actually quicker. Just get uncoated stainless and use a little oil; stainless isn't all THAT sticky."},{"rating":"1","title":"The SB-104 kit is slow for networking.","review":"Sharing 2 computers and a printer seemed to be too much for this kit.

Unfortunately The Zen Gun belongs in the latter category. The story is a mixture of all sorts of ideas: genetic engineering, an intergalactic empire in decline, talking animals, a strange zen gun with an ominous purpose...There's plenty of imaginative space opera action and it all moves pretty swiftly, but at the same time the whole story is confusing and bounces from place to place. Parts of The Zen Gun are pertty good, but the most of it doesn't really work that well.Add to that some very bizarre and boring pseudoscientific lectures on the nature of the universe and you'll end up with a fairly pointless book.

Besides his review came directly off the back cover of the book. Mr. Atalay has written a wonderful book. It isn't just about math and the Mona Lisa but marries the history of art with the history of science in a delightful and insightful way. His digressions and endnotes are copious,entertaining and enlightening. I rank it with Margaret Livingstone's \\"Vision and Art, the Biology of Seeing\\", as must reads for painters and those interested in painting.But, this is not an easy read or a book to speed read.

This book is in the same genre as several other books, all of which are far superior: Galileo Galilei by Gould, The Map that Changed the World, by Winchester, Fermat's Enigma by Singh, A History of Pi by Beckman, and Isaac Newton by Gleick. My general complaints are that the author is a bit sloppy, inexact, speculative and his math is imprecise. Examples are: speculative (free men built the pyramids and they represent a sunburst in honor of Ra); inexact (use of truncated decimals for phi, etymology of the word sluggish as related to a slug of mass, and derivation of a pyramid of exactly 52 degrees). The paragraph on the top of p.81 on platonic solids is especially confusing. So while he does make some interesting points, it just isn't worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad author...","review":"Author presented the book to a class by first starting out with a discussion of UFOs, spewing forth misinformation throughout the discussion.

As most of us readily recognize and concede, da Vinci was a man in possession of extraordinary and unparalleled talent and Atalay does a nice job of communicating that talent to the reader. If you are expecting a book wherein da Vinci is the sole topic, however, I presume there are other books w/ more of a 'biography' flavor -- this book is not one of them -- albeit this should not detract from the author's impressive juxtaposition of various historical figures, findings, and facts. And ultimately, the reader should finish the book w/ a renewed vigor and appreciation for all things mathematic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer of a book not even for the hardcore fan","review":"This book is written from a scholarly standpoint.

It also almost never mentions anything about the WCW, as much of the research material is lifted from angles during the glory years of the 1980's in WWF.

The sets and costumes are lavish; it must have cost a heap to mount. The casting is generally reliable although Marco Berti (Calaf), while hitting all the correct notes, is a wooden actor and lacks stage presence. Maria Guleghina (Turandot) is steely voiced and good but not great in her role.Zubin Mehta,who has conducted a number of DVD and CD recodings of Turandot, keeps a firm grip on the not too subtle score.

There are artists left out and what is written is often slanted with regards to \\"collectability\\" since the authors' have invested in a large folk art collection. The emphasis is often that the early work is really the only inspired work. Once an artist is \\"discovered\\" by the public the art is no longer as good so you should only have the early pieces, like the ones in the encyclopedia. This bias also occurs in the author's book on Collecting American Folk Art.

I laughed then. I saw it recently at a friend's house and can't believe Wes Craven's career didn't end with this schlock. I don't know what kind of movie this was meant to be. It was too lame to be scary and too stupid to be funny. Running from an 'electronic phantom' through scenes from 'Leave it to Beaver' is enough to make you roll your eyes in disbelief.

I actually enjoyed the first 45 minutes or so. Seemed like a pretty decent slasher flick. I even liked how the main character interacted with the killer through his dreams and had to be woke up before he got killed. Very reminiscent of Nightmare on Elm St. But after they caught the killer and executed him by the electric chair and he became an electro ghost killer (for lack of a better phrase) the movie just got flushed down the toilet. I think I dropped a whole star after the scene in the tv. It doesn't get much more horrible than that. I don't mind cheese in horror flicks. Its common.

Just leave this one alone, the score was so perfect. I have nothing against any of the bands on this album or the songs, I'm just saying that as was done with The Blair Witch Project, a movie that was made so perfectly, and was pop music-less FOR A REASON has one again been plagued with it.

While Amos is not a well-preached book of the Bible, it is an excellent source when we discuss social issues, and I keep this book at hand to draw upon.Just a note - this is a scholarly commentary, rather than a preaching commentary. It discusses the text, leaving you to draw your own conclusions, so if you are looking for something to help you preach a series, consider this a foundational book (like a dictionary) rather than the only resource you use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cute!","review":"This tractor is super cute.

Scream 2 was a sad and hurried attempt to cash in on scream 1. The same does not apply to scream 3. In scream 3 the overall ranking is better than scream 2, but it does not even come close to scream 1. Scream 3 has it's moments, and a decent(but corny) ending.

I didn't get what I wanted, because this film is just terrible. The way the camera was shot was stupid, the director could of done soo much better, the acting was terrible, the music gave me a headache and the screenplay and special effects were silly and made the film boring to look at. Drew Barymore foolish girl on the run has just been stabbed and killed by a mysterious person at her home. Now all her friends and family are looking for what happened. I do not recommend this film at all, it is no true classic, and NOT the scariest movie ever made. Also, the starting scene is absolute rubbish.

Though it's still not as good as the original, they've added some suspense this time! It's probably because almost every scene is darker, and the climax is in a mansion. Humor doesn't play a big part this time, but that's OK, because were more interested in finding out more about Sidney's unknown life, or at least, her mother's. Overall, this installment was more fun and suspenseful, so I recommend the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but that's all.","review":"In line with its predecessors, \\"Scream 3\\" employs the same devices and theme to produce an entertaining blend of new age horror and roll your eyes humor. The acting is adequate and characters are what we would expect in this trilogy. Perceptions vary as to what is scary or humorous, and this is one of those movies that most people view with tongue in cheek. That being said, there is a degree of mystery and suspense here of the whodunnit variety as with the prior two that is worth mentioning, and it is entertaining for that and its slasher qualities. Interestingly enough, this movie takes the actual trilogy theme to heart in that on the one level takes, it takes itself seriously and on the other, it pokes fun at itself, but that is what the \\"Scream\\" movies are all about. Ultimately, while the movie plays out as a horror movie, it is simply not scary despite its entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE MAKE THIS BE THE LAST ONE","review":"THIS SECOND SEQUEL DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO BE MADE.

IRONICALLY, DAVID ARQUETTE AND COURTENEY COX ARE ACTUALLY MARRIED IN REAL LIFE AS THIS WAS BEING TYPED. THIS SERIES WAS FUN AT FIRST, BUT NOW IT'S LOSING ITS EXCITEMENT.

I dont understand how you people can call this a masterpiece and say how good it is when it cant even compare to the older horror movies. Personally i think it sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Scary but exciting","review":"This is one of the better screams out of the two. There is less gore but more myster to it. I think the director(Wes Craven) was going for more laughs than screams. You're always guessing how many killers there are, and where there calling from ,who they are, and it's real shocking at the end when you find out who the killer really is.

The identity of the killer keeps you guessing up to the end, just like the first two movies. Plenty of inside jokes about the movie industry, some of which I got, and many others I'm sure I missed. Ordinarily I'm not a fan of movies about movies, but when it's a send-up, I suppose I can relax the rules a bit. Carrie Fisher in her cameo was hysterical. I was happy to see that they brought Jamie Kennedy back for the finale--I thought he was the most entertaining character from the first two movies. Wes was a little enigmatic with his final closing shot, seeming to say that he's still open to making a fourth film. That could happen, but frankly, I think Wes said what needed to be said in the trilogy. No need to serialize it any further, and if he tried, I don't think it would make him a buck. Worth the price of a rental, or if you are a fan of the genre, a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"Scream 3 is very fun, funny and is entertaining through out.

Scream 1 and 2 are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not be worse","review":"Congrats Wes! If Scream was a TV sitcom this is what it would look like. There's not a original or funny scene in this movie...the blooper reel is more entertaining with Parker Posey playing nimbly off Courtney Cox's tired, overblown charicature. She seems to be the only one who tries to have fun with the material, and even she can't lift it. I've seen Scooby-Doo episodes that are more complex. And Neve honey, go back to TV with your 2 facial expressions, you're fifteen minutes are up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Shame?!!","review":"I am a big fan of SCREAM 1 & 2... and I was really hoping that Wes Craven might be able to succeed in this TRIOLOGY but as all triologies fall down...

Forget it, it follows all the rules and doesn't break one. After a fantastic opening sequence, it never quite reaches the same pitch again. The first two are still great, but this has no guts at all, you are more likely to be scared eating an hot apple pie. Wait for TV, Tape it, watch the pre-credits sequence and the cameos from Carrie Fisher, Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, and dump the rest. It's not scary, it's not violent and it's not funny.Try Cherry Falls - that's far more fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"way better than scream 2 but not scream 1","review":"I thought the movie was pretty good, i think it is the scariest of the three, but not the funniest or cleveries of the mainly the first one, second one ok.The beginning of the movie was a shock to me, however i thought the end was ok little surprising but was looking for more of a surprise like with the first killing of the beginning of the film had.

Why would you ever do Scream 3 to such excellent movies like Scream and Scream 2? This movie is flat out horrible! Acting, gore, plotline, and ending. It seems like the writer had no clue where it was going to end so he just threw in little bits and pieces of everything. Its all just one big slap in the face to the end. I do NOT recommend this.P.S. Scream 3 is not the final installment in the series. Prepare for Scream 4 sometime in 2006. Neve Campbell will be back along with david Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Patrick Dempsey. Wes Craven will be back also. The filming was just declared in April 2003.

Sorry to inform anyone with a brain but despite the fact that it advertises that \\"anything can happen in a trilogy\\", it is still a predictable film that follows the same rules as all these other horror movies.

Sidney is in hiding somewhere in the woods (like we didn't know that was going to happen). To make a long story short, Sidney finds her long lost brother that she didn't know she had...da.dah.da..dah..da. I was also disappointed with Cottonweiry's role in the movie.

It starts out with Cotten driving home on a crowded freeway.the killer threataning his girlfriend he rushes home to find.

The movie is a great truth in how cinema vilence affects the world around us as well as an edge of your seat thriller.

It wasn't as good as the original Scream, but good just the same. It took on a completely new outlook at the whole Scream saga, and included fresh ideas from a new writer. This film was funny at the same time as it was scary. There are rumours that this was not, in fact, the final Scream (as it should have been), but it brought a good thing to an end with its ending.

Then a bunch of other horror movies that tried to copy it was released like: Urban Legend, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Valentine, and more. But the Scream trilogy remains the best and top dog. Scream was a terrific film and Scream 2 was not, but Scream 3 was the best. Scream 2 dissapointed audiences with nothing but just another horror film, but Scream 3 corrected that and brought the sereis to an end. Scream 3 wasfunnyer and completely different from the first two, but Scream the orignal film reamined the scariest. Dimension Home Video did a excellent job in releasing this edition to Dvd. Scream 2 only included a theatrical trailer, which was all.

Just like the Scream 2 this movie was retarded. No Exception to Scream 2 the killer just popped out of no where, no one had a clue. Why would the director of this movie be so stupid as to have the killer a character that was never introduced throughout the whole movie.

Scream 1&2 were good and scary because they redefined the movie genre. Scream 3, on the other hand, takes all the movie cliches that were intelligently avoided in the first two films and crams them into 2 hours of nonsense. The characters here are so stupid I actually wanted them to die. I mean, if you and a friend were in a huge mansion in which a killer is on the loose, would you split up and would you each go in a separate direction? I didn't think so... But the people in that movie don't seem to agree now do they?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Scream if there's a 4th","review":"The only thing to scream about in this tired installment is Courtney Cox's bad wig!

Now Scream has become a parody of itself. No more please......"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"People have been saying that it's not as scary as the earlier films and I would have to agree. But only partially. It's not jump and run because Ghostface might be behind you kinda fright. A lot of it is qsychological. I thought it was a very unpredictable discovery at the end that made it so amazing because everything suddenly fit into place. I especially think the actors have gotten better and more comfortable in their roles since the first one. I thought the scared witless Sidney was interesting because you hadn't seen her like that before. I loved Gale and Dewey's constant arguing too. And lastly I loved the happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCREAM 3 IS THE BEST OF THE BEST!","review":"Scream is the last sequel to the thrilling trilogy. It stars David Arquette, Neve Cambell Courteney Cox Arquette, Patrick Dempsey, Jenny McCarthy, Parker Posey and Deon Richmond. This movie is about Sidney lives all peacefully all by herself in the woods, and then she starts hearing about all the bodies getting killed by the guy in the mask in the set of Stab 3. In this 3rd chapter all the starts realize that in this chapter, all the rulse are broken! Scream 3 is the best SCREAM of all. It is rated \\"R\\" for strong horror violence, Sexuality, and strong language. It had blood, but not to bad. In my personal opinion, Scream 3 is the best scream of all because Wes Craven delivers Chills, and Thrills with out going over board with the gore. There is some, but not as bad as the 1st and 2nd Scream. If your looking for a Thrilling, Action, and Suspenseful movie, this one if for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd Time is the Charm","review":"I enjoyed the whole trilogy but the care and fun the actors put into their 3rd time with these characters was one of the best!

The screenwriter seems to be out of ideas and without any clever tricks to pull out of his sleeve. Wes Craven is a very clever horror director and has directed many classics in the genre, but he simply doesn't have the right material here. The cast also seems tired and they all repeat what they've down in the previous movies. Some attempts a comedy fall flat, and an assortment of unlikable supporting characters doesn't help. The 'keep guessing until the last scene' technique really doesn't work here. Too bad, because the first two 'Scream' movies we're good and it would have been a memorable trilogy.

I am a good customer of Amazon, But this time you really disappointed me........"},{"rating":"1","title":"DIE ALL READY!","review":"After Kevin Williamson dropped out of this project, I thought that there might be a glimmer of hope. Alas...no. The dialogue is laughably bad and the plot is ludicrous. The only bright spot is a surprise cameo by Jay and Silent Bob. By the end of the trilogy, Sydney has become so annoying that you are almost rooting for her to get killed. Fortunately, Courtney Cox gets more screen time in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, I'd do some screamin' too","review":"Scream one, was cool. Scream two, was acceptable. Scream three?

Sequels really suck, and no rules are broken here. Here Neve Campbell is NOT the main character, but Arquette and Cox Arquette. It's another round of brutal and bloody terror with slashing and killing. It's somewhat predictable and a little boring. I really hope there's not going to be a fourth Scream; one was enough. All in all, if you like horror, I guess you would like this one, but there's no solid plot behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUINNED THE SERIES","review":"I am a big fan of the horror genere. I am especially fond of Wes Craven. But Scream 3 is just bad film making. It is completely unoriginal, completely stupid (no voice changer can steal someone's voice so you can talk just like they do.), and all in all, a complete representation when a studio wants to milk a good idea for money. The \\"revalations\\" in this movie are so queer and unnessacary, when are people going to realize you dont have to explain every little thing in a movie, you dont have to somehow tie everything together. So, if your a fan of in your face, no holds barred, ground breaking horror, stay away. If you like predictable hollywood soft \\"horror\\"...be my guest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk!","review":"This movie had a promising beggining, but then it all went downhill. It has got to be the worst horror movie that I have ever seen, and, to tell you the truth, the ending was no big deal. The killer is-----SIDNEY'S LONG LOST BROTHER! It would have been even more surprising if it had been someone in the original cast! What a waste of time and money. A better film could have been made. I will not even bother to see \\"Scream 4\\", if, god forbid, there is one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A kill and trash movie","review":"This movie is representative of today Hollywood standards, that is to say a movie with no plot nor acting. The movie is very stupid with a lot of involuntary humor. It is not scary at all, when i see it i fell asleep. This movie is only a product for teenagers. If i could i would give 0 star for the movie. The movie will bee forgot after 1 month, it is like eating an hamburger at Mac-Donald."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great end to a Great Series","review":"WOW, this movie was great. I watched the DVD, and it was AWESOME. I have always loved the Scream series. This third installment was the best yet, in my opinion. The end was definitely a shock. Neve Campbell was as great in this one as she was in the others. Courtney Cox, and David Arquette light up the screen with their little freak show romance. THe dvd has many features, such as an alternate ending, and music video, BIos, and 16 movie trailers..all for Scream 3. This is a must for horror movie fans. I suggest that everyone buy this movie. You won't be disapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't scream at all","review":"The first one was good, the second was OK but this one really misses the target, in fact it's dead boring.

Alas, Scream3 can't escape the tradition it attempts to spoof. The first movie was pretty witty, enjoyable in the way it self-consciously sent up the horrow shows of the last 20 years. The 2nd Scream was OK. Unfortunately, the 3rd one keeps all the self-consciousness with little of the wit. Oh, there's an occasional sharp line, but I guarantee you won't remember any of them by the time you return the video to the rental store.Do yourself a favor.

It is very good becuase of the great gameplay and graphics. I think this is going to be ten times better than blitz. It will have more players, plays, and tricks along with the same great gameplay.

After buying and enjoying NBA Street Vol. 2, I thought this game would be better. This game is so unbelievably unrealistic and unfun. Let me give you a word of advice, If you're debating on whether or not to buy this game or Madden 2004 get Madden. It is so much more fun and realistic. I can understand how you might say that the game is supposed to be realistic, the makers went over the top. If you have played at a friends house and have enjoyed it, it gets boring after four times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea....but falls short","review":"It is a very good concept & the game could be amazing. I wish they had created a dynasty, franchise or at least a tournament mode. You have to start out with \\"no name\\" players & play against pro-players to unlock new levels stadiums etc..It would be fun to manage the team & trade players to work towards a championship or superbowl. Instead the game goes no where. It's more like NFL Blitz than a Madden type game. It gets old quick. Good idea & good intention...hopefully a better sequel is in the works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GAME IS GREAT","review":"THIS GAME IS GREAT. IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN MADDEN 2004.

THIS GAME IS REALLY FUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my best games!","review":"I know a lot of people say it's a waste of time creating a team, but you can switch to passs balanced, run balance etc. There is a lot of hall of famers, like Barry Sanders, Ronnie Lott, Willam Perry. This is one of those games that you can get used to easy. Graphics are great, I'm lovin the main menu music and there's tons of choices for create a player and creating a logo for your team. NFL Challenge mode has if you have enough tokens you can get pro player any team you choose. They have really detailed stadiums and one stadium for each division. And the art before you start a game is really cool. There are even tutorials! So overall this is a game is for anyone! Trust me! It's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good game","review":"This is the perfect game except for one thing. The computer is way too hard.

If you want a good football simulation series get the Madden .If you want a good Street series get the NBA Street series"},{"rating":"2","title":"its worth buying it","review":"the game itself is ok but its just too difficult to win anny of the challanges.tip: only buy it if you're really good at these games."},{"rating":"2","title":"not that great","review":"i just got this game and it isnt all that good.

I've bought the last 6 years worth of maddens, and will always treasure that series. But after 10 straight seasons every year, I could use a football game that i don't have to always think so hard about. That is what is so great about nfl street. its a great game to play when you don't want to get to deep into it. The only let down was not being able to play challenge games with pro players, but the create a player is quite awesome. Football needed this game, and blitz was crap, so its refreshing to have a good game to have a few beers and pound away at the teams you hate. GO BENGALS!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NFL Street is not too bad","review":"NFL Street is a fun game to play. There is only 2 thing bad about this game. 1. The controls take a while to get used to. 2. When you play NFL Challenge, and you play the ladder games, you cannot save the game until you beat every team in the ladder challange.

Well not even a year later it has happened again! I emailed casablanca yet again and they still were not willing to help me, I asked why my $600 fan already needed $200 in repairs and they stopped responding to my emails! They have the absolute worst customer service I have ever encountered, I took the fan down and replaced it with a $110 Harbor Breeze fan and a $35 Lutron Maestro remote.

For less than $20, it's worth a try.Well, it really does work well! My knee gets very sore when I run, and this sleeve makes it 80% better. I think it's a combination of the patellar support under the knee, the compression, and the fact that my knee stays warm when I'm wearing this. I've been able to do 40 minute runs with little discomfort, whereas before using this support, I was hurting right away.Bottom line: well worth $20.

The album as a whole is nothing like the single. It is very punk rock with lots of unintelligible screaming, empty lyrics and poor vocals from the lead singer. After researching the band (which I should have done first) I found that they've had a few albums before this one. It's clear to me now. They were a medicore, no-name band so their record label released a \\"pop\\" sounding song to trick the unsuspecting into buying the album.

How on the one hand can you claim to want to change the system but then utilize some of the most evil and ultracorporate tools to do this? (i.e. MTV, Dreamworks!) The music is pop-core punk at best and the message is clear: Do as I say, not as I do. If you want to incite change through music then: 1. Sign to an independent label or create your own label. 2. DO NOT under any circumstances make a friggin video for play on MTV. 3. Tour Relentlessly 4. Do Not take your fans for idiots 5. Back your message with actions not hollow words.

These guys are stemming the tide of mainstream pop-punk? Dude, no. They're worse because they're actually trying to pretend they're better than or different to those bands. At no point does the guitar sound at all jagged, gritty, or dirty. It's all languid, lackluster, limp-wristed powerchord strumming that has more in common with Nickelback and Three Days Grace than it does with even Blink 182 or Sum 41, let alone any real punk bands. The vocals are the only thing that set this album apart from any of those bands. This isn't the sound of a band attacking their instruments like they mean it. This is the sound of a band sitting back in comfortable chairs watching tv while they churn out boring, energyless music with as much disinterest as possible.

Its heavy, thats for sure, the lyrics are absolutely amazing, the music is really almost as alluring as the lyrics. The songs have great variety in the sounds, from the fast intense State Of The Union, to the accoustic Swing Life Away, every song is amazing. The tracks that really catch my ears on this are, The First Drop, Rumors Of My Demise Have Been Greatly Exagerated, Paper Wings and Life Less Frightening.This CD is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the previous album","review":"I really really love this cd. A true Punk/hardcore band that uses good riffs and awesome lyrics. Tim McElrath has perfected going from melodic singing to a piercing scream. The previous album had more songs that were better sing-a-longs, where this cd is just packed with better overall songs. This is seriously a cd that you could put in and not skip, even though I do find myself only skipping two songs, just because the other 10 are way better.It starts with State of the Union, a great and powerful opening for the album, and probably their hardest song to date. My other personal favorites are Life Less Frightening, Blood to Bleed, To Them These Streets Belong, Tip The Scales, Give it All, Dancing for Rain, and Swing Life Away. The two best are Give it All, which I didn't like for the longest time, but now love, and State Of the Union.

The arrangements were lackluster and formulaic, and the performance was mechanical and lifeless.I was surprised at how little feeling and expression the director lent to what is clearly a competant choir.

We first put one on him when leaving the hospital and even the nurses commented on how much they liked it. But over the next week or so we realized how tight these were. First we noticed that he ate less (had to be formula fed) when wearing these compared to a regular snap shirt. Then we noticed that they were putting pressure on the top of his diaper and pushing it into his umbilical cord stump - even causing small amounts of bleeding. Not good at all. If you're considering these for a preemie, you'd be better off with just a basic snap shirt (e.g. Gerber), diaper, and then swaddle in a light blanket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratchy and disappointing...save your money","review":"I bought these based on the product description that the cotton is extremely soft and because of the unique design that does not go over baby's head. However, the cotton is not very soft. In fact, it's scratchy, even after I washed it and used extra fabric softener. The cheap onesies someone gave me from Wal mart are softer than these. The spa silk onesies are way overpriced for what you get. The softest onesies we own by far are the organic gerber. Unfortunately, they only go up to size 3-6 months. The spa silk onesies do have a great design that you don't need to pull over the baby's head, but be warned that they are made short for their size.

Piccirilli writes wonderfully; he doesn't just tell a great story; he fashions that story with so much style and humor that the reader hesitates to skip even a single sentence for fear of missing something. Shards is like a fusion of Fletch and Lethal Weapon; it's tough and smart and fast paced and spiced by some of the wittiest one-liners I have ever encountered. I liked this book so much that, having finished it, I immediately bought everything available by Picirilli, and have yet to find any book which deserves less than a four or five star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild, weird, and thrilling mystery","review":"SHARDS is an outstanding novel that has an atmosphere like no other book I've ever read.

Definitely check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another winner","review":"I'm a fan of all of Tom Piccirilli's novels, but SHARDS is perhaps my favorite.

He meets with a mysterious, rich girl Susan Hartford. She invites him to her B-day party the next day and that's when the* hits the fan. Something surprising happens at the party and Nathaniel must pick up the shards (get it?) of pieces to solve the puzzle. Along the way we follow Nathaniel trying to get at the bottom of it all and when we all realize what's going on, I was shocked, mad and spellbound. High energy, hilarious dialogue and true motivations behind the characters actions. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I thought this was boring and under-written.

If you are looking for something a little different than the other books in the series then you may want to try to read something else but if you like Mrs Raisin and you enjoy watching her get into, and most times stay into trouble then you will enjoy this book and take it for what it is worth. Lets hope that another comes out very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thouroughly Enjoyed Aggie This Time.","review":"Nothing is more satisfying than a new Agatha Raisin mystery.

I have been visiting Turkey frequently and I can say being a U.S. citizen I have an objective view about the country, Turkish people and the system there. The book which can be only categorized as fiction is I believe written with a differnent agenda that Hayes had, but obviously not for revealing the truth.I am more surprised at the positive reaction it got from some groups all over the world. If they chose to beleive a story written only to blame a goverment to put a criminal in jail who both used and traded drugs, I have to say I have difficulty to understand in what sane state of mind they believe this guy who is trying to gain the sympathy of people by deceiving and lying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deterioration of the truth, a ridicule","review":"I do not remember reading a more ridiculous book whose main objective is only to deteriorate the truth with fallacious dreamwork of a smuggler.

A smuggler is trying to be a hero and the villain in his story is the Turkish Authorities to catch him! WHat a scenario he creates with the sick lies coming out of his cocaine loaded brain. In Turkey else anywhere and also here in the U.S. a smuggler after a fair trial goes to prison and maybe in the U.S.he would be treated even with more strict rules, because Hayes could not stand being caught when he was smuggling something that poisons thousands of people, instead of admitting what hideous thing this was to do, he tries to use demogogue claims of him to look like an angel who suffered for nothing. com'on spare me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Movie","review":"The story comes across in Billy Hayes own words, even though he co-authorized this with another writer. His voice still comes through, however. Great look at his live in prison. With all the additional detail, it's better than the movie (as great as that was), due to all the extra details he can provide us here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"It is very sad to see people calling Billy Hayes a fraud, or hear them say that his book is just fiction. Prisoners in this country have it pretty good, with their TVs and free time. The only punishment they get is from their cell mates. But imagine being tourtured by prison officals just because you breathed wrong. Before you call billy a fraud, why dont you dig deaper into the prison where he was kept. Perhaps you too will get thrown in their, than you can see if he was lying."},{"rating":"2","title":"crackin' good read","review":"Extrenely well crafted story. There have been questions raised about exactly how factual the events are, but really, I don't care about that stuff. This is one of those books that if you start in the morning you could finish by the evening because the pages seem to turn themselves. William Hayes had help writing it, though. But it's extremely well-done: he doesn't get into his backstory too much, doesn't drift off into politics or human rights, doesn't talk about culture or philosophy. Just sticks to the adventure. There are no slow parts.Two things:1. I'm glad he put the sodomy scene in there. If he hadn't, I simply wouldn't have trusted this.2. Shame that William Hayes eventually went back to Turkey and apologized for besmirching their reputation. No way, man. Forget them.

I bought the correct size (#14); saturated the five screw heads, which I wanted to remove, with WD-40; followed the directions that came with the Eazypower tool exactly; and none of the scews budged. I used a new variable speed reversible drill at slow speeds, but it could not make this tool turn the scews the slightest bit. I had hoped it would at least loosen the heads enough so that I could use Vise-Grip pliers or a socket wrench to turn and remove the screws the rest of the way.

He ultimately tries to use them to get back at his ex-wife for cheating on him with the town sheriff. I know it sounds weak, but there is a decent cast including my favorite scream queen, Tiffany Shepis, who plays the sheriff's daughter.Yeah we're not looking at Oscar material, but for a zombie film with a budget, it actually has a nice plot and does what I think every zombie movie should do. It makes fun of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good B-Movie","review":"I'm not that big of a zombie fan but this was a great little zombie comedy/horror film. A mortician creates a serum that can revive the dead for one hour and he uses them to do his bidding. As the story unfolds, the mortician plans to get revenge on his ex-wife for attempting to ruin his life and it is up to his assistant to stop him.A B-movie in every sense of the word, it isn't meant to be taken seriously.

Others have complained about the slack use of UFO imagery - to me this is not important as the main character, Rebecca, is seen and treated as an outcast from the start. An unbelievable story unfolds and playswith ideas of what we consider to be religious or infernal. The characters are skillfully shaped by Fowles tofit the time - while we, the twentieth century readers, canmake judgements about the visions described in the book, the characters themselves are as confused and disturbed as we would be in the same situation. An excellent novel that encourages the reader to take all religious experiences with a pinch of salt..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful 18th Century story coupled with bad Sci-Fi chaps.","review":"*A Maggot* contains the first bad writing I've seen from John Fowles. I hadn't thought he was capable of it. But he responds to the apparently irresistible temptation of British general fiction writers of the past 20-30 years -- he's just got to write SF. If you skip the SFnal parts (the Stonehenge \\"flyby\\" and Rebecca Lee's Ming-the-Merciless-esque testimony about the \\"June Eternal\\" people) it's a tremendous book, as unified a work as any of Fowles' others, very rich and thought-provoking. Readers not familiar with good SF may not object to Rebecca Lee's testimony. It is, however, hackneyed and illogical, not due to the 18th century filter, but due to the original vision which is being portrayed. Thomas More did somewhat better in 1516. The poor man is not even credited, which is so unlike John Fowles. I'm joking here - I can't understand the \\"Ancient Astronauts\\" inclusion in this book - otherwise, it is so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fowles shines again","review":"Almost as good as The Magus, if such a thing were possible.

Firstly, the version on this album is the single version; it comes from the 'Ingredients' EP and is, I believe, a far superior version of the song to the one on the 'God's Fodder' LP. In my opinion, while that album was good, it also suffered from overproduction; the sound was too 'clean', so to speak, and lacked the 'fuzzed out' guitar sound that made the band so 'groovy'.In relation to this album, it's a very good round-up of the band's music. It has the 'single' versions of the songs rather than the album versions, which, as I said above, suffer from over-production.If you haven't heard the band before, this is a great look at one of band's that introduced grebo to the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading the what?","review":"This tape has nothing whatsoever to do with the skills involved with reading the wind.

Breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Delerue's best","review":"What a wonderful, melodic, thematic score! This Cd is full of beautiful, delicate, and peaceful music written by a master of that kind of thing. So many different instruments are given solos here.

To scroll down through the phone book feels like click-pause-click-pause-click-pause.... Each handset defaults to private phone book use, so to switch to the shared phone book involves a couple of button-pushes, each of which takes ages to respond. And don't try getting ahead of it: your button pushes may or may not be recognized.What a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this if you are looking to expand...","review":"I am very happy with this phone, it works well and I get great reception. But I ran into a big problem when I tried to expand my system. I went online to find another handset/charger. The cheapest I found was a factory refurbished unit for $130, new units run anywhere from $250 to $300. Yet I can buy a base unit and 2 handset/charger (Model #7091) for $125.

That's what I do now and they are wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Gluten-Free","review":"Just a word of warning?Lots of celiacs have trouble with this--it will depend on how sensitive you are to gluten. Bob's Red Mill is probably legally gluten-free--20 ppm, or close to it--but it makes enough people sick that you have to wonder.If you are still getting sick and you are eating this, or you are feeding this to a gluten-free kid who is still getting sick, either you and a substantial portion of celiacs on various websites are ultra-sensitive to the small amounts of gluten in this, or it's not actually gluten-free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sligtly Different Preparation Hints","review":"After my Celiac diagnosis, it took 2 years to find this product...walla! I can eat pancakes again. These taste quite nice, but I had to modify the recipe a bit:1) substitute Bob's GF Bread mix for 1/4 of the total mix. This seems to make the batter a lot smoother and cuts down on the sweetness overall.2) definitely allow the mix to stand and thicken! If it doesn't flow easily out of the measuring cup, add 1 TBS each of milk and egg, and mix with a fork to thin it out. In 1/2 a minute you'll have a good idea if you have the desired consistency. Repeat if needed. The extra prep time ensures that you can get 3-4 pancakes that spread out properly on e.g., a a 10\\" frying pan on medium heat before they start to bubble up.It was definitely worth the wait to \\"discover\\" pancakes again...yum! Served with blueberry or maple syrup, Bob's pancake mix rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pancakes I have ever had!","review":"My guy is allergic to a lot of things, so we have to make concessions sometimes... but this mix makes the best pancakes I have ever had... I would suggest, if you don't eat eggs, use a 1/4 cup of applesauce instead... they taste better than anything that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad aftertaste","review":"I agree with other reviewers that comment on a strong (and bad) after taste. Not sure what it is. Maybe it's picked up by some taste buds and not others...must be since there are so many positive reviews.

But unlike a lot of other GF products, the rest of the family loves it too. The pancakes don't have the noticable taste/feel that rice flour typically adds to GF baked goods. Like many of the other reviewers, I make it a little thinner by adding more liquid. Works great for pancakes or in a waffle iron. Funny thing is, I can't find this mix in the stores anymore. Whole Foods and Wegmans carry 10-15 other Bob's Red Mill flours including a wide selection of GF products, but they longer carry the GF pancake mix. The mix also keeps very well if you freeze the extra bags in a ziploc bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely passable","review":"Add me to the list of folks who doesn't get the good reviews for these pancakes. They are not delicious. They have a strong corn texture (sort of a cornbread pancake), they are extremely crumbly. They are dry. They are neither light nor fluffy and really barely even passable for pancakes. I added fresh blueberries to ours and that was the only saving grace. Really very not good and I won't buy this again.There are so many genuinely great GF mixes these days, I don't know why Bob's Red Mill couldn't do a better job on this mix. 2 stars are just because they are easy and edible. Maybe I could have turned the mix into something good by making a million modifications, but that wouldn't really be a review for the pancakes made as the mix recommends, would it? Though I am glad some people have found a way to make this mix better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I did not like the taste of these pancakes. They had a funny taste to them and left an after taste in my mouth. I have only been on a gluten free diet for a month now but still you know what you like.

It is just like the original Bisquick hardly any difference at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great... with a slight modification in recipe...","review":"This is a great mix, with a slight modification in recipe... double the eggs and double the amount of oil/butter then make the pancakes \\"swedish style\\" (very, very thin on a very hot griddle). It's my favorite breakfast.

My husband won't eat them - and my kids complain when I make them - The only thing I like about them is that they are fluffy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if made the right way with a few modifications","review":"If you do any GF baking you know that all the ingredients have to be at room temperature. First, beat the egg (I use extra large or 2 eggs) for 30 seconds on medium speed until frothy. Then add the oil. Mix again until combined. Then add the milk. I also add a 1/2 cup of applesauce. Mix again. Then add dry ingredients. I sometimes also add 1 Tablespoon sugar since sugar also acts as a liquid in baking.

If you follow the instructions from the package to make them they're kinda so-so, but if you substitute 1/2 a cup of yogurt and enough liquid to thin the the batter to the proper consistency for the milk that it asks for you get a really fluffy and pleasantly sweet pancake. Without the addition of the acid from the yogurt they taste a little too much like baking soda and don't rise very well.I suspect one could use orange juice to the same effect if you were avoiding dairy/soy/nut liquids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Try to imagine an italian Tom Waits, warm and wit and never sober...

This one seemed like it would be perfect. It had to be altered to make it look presentable, but it's adorable now, and it wasn't expensive. The shirt was huge, very long, and much too wide. We took in the sides and hemmed it. The pants have an elastic waist (thumbs up), but were a little too short. They looked like highwaters, so we shortened them to make them hit in the middle of the calf. We cut the belt off completely - it was flimsy and looked horrible. The little tie at the bottom of the navy trim on the chest looked cheap and tacky. That was cut off, too. The hat was tiny, so we couldn't use it at all. It would fit a baby or a small toddler. The material feels like linen and wrinkles easily. Just for dress up purposes to play around, this costume is fine. The price is right. After some modifications, it makes a great dance costume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very pleased!","review":"I purchased this costume along with 2 others in the sailor category.

The characters are interesting if not so developed as, say, Holden Caulfield or any of Mary Renault's.That being said, I was sad when the adventure was over and the events, settings, and characters stayed with me for months.

This book is for you if you don't want a realistic story with real characters but rather just a fictional romance. I didn't think the author took the book seriously but rather made the players into comic book characters, all good or all evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but disappointing","review":"Yet another interesting concept, well begun, but ultimately retreating to cliché. The first half of the book is quite good - detailing the travels of an embassy from Louis IV to the Negus (emperor) of Abyssinia in 1699. The novelist makes good use of the intrigues and mistrust among the various Catholic and other Western factions. The hero is a young herbalist whose medical knowledge gives him near miraculous powers, and provides several easy escapes from intricate plot devices. But these sections do impart a good sense of what it might be like to travel in these then unknown parts of the world, down the Nile, through Egypt and the Sudan, and ultimately to Ethiopia. (A good map would have been handy for this, as the areas involved are not well-known, even today.) But, about half way through, the descriptions and background can't hide the predictability of the plot, and the Candidean romantic subplot detracts from the overall effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little predictable","review":"This novel does have pretty prose, romantic characters, and exotic locales.

Reading it for a paper,I found myself groaning as I read from the uninteresting and confusing book, dreading the reading and falling asleep several times. Through my paper I have found that this book is historically inaccurate in many aspects - in particular, socially. Poncet goes on his embassy only in order to be given a title and marry Alix, the daughter of the consul in Cairo. This would NOT happen. I found myself enjoying the parts about Alix, however, the majority of the book is politics related and very confusing to someone who is not oriented with the religioun and politics of Abysinnia, France and Cairo.

Collecting and Collage-making: The Case of Kurt Schwitters by Roger Cardinal3. A Collector's Model of Desire: The House and Museum of Sir John Soane by John Elsner. If you are a rabid collector of anything, you will delight in this ULTIMATE collection in which a man turned everything he did and his very house into a museum. He made multiple catalogs of his \\"collection\\" throughout his life and arranged and rearranged until his death.

It is a nice looking bag, and also has a nice light and small design. It fits my notebook, power chords, and notebook-mouse just fine without looking stuffed or too thick. In fact, I really liked this bag until one day...It was a rainy day. I packed my notebook as usual, stepped outside assuming all would be protected and safe. However, if you look carefully, the flap that swings over the top is not made to wrap around the edges. There is an angled gap of roughly half an inch on both sides of the flap, that provides direct access to the notebook.Luckily for me, it was a short walk to the car in very heavy rain. when I opened my notebook bag, I discovered water on the edges of my notebook. And now, I have to always remember to stuff paper towels on the edges just in case it rains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bag for computer and a book","review":"I bought this bag in order to carry little more than my macbook - and it is great for that. There are a couple of additional pockets for accessories, but none are quite adequate for the bulk of the power adapter. The design of the case is sleek, following the pattern of the macbook itself - a not very thick rectangle. So writing pads or notebooks, trade paperbacks or hardback books will fit nicely, as long as you select no more than one of each.I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT FIT!","review":"I love this bag for my MacBook Air! At first, it fit a bit loose but then when I put the protective cover on it it was a bit more snug.

My iPhone is also safe, secure and in easy access in it's little cell phone pocket on the outside (on the straps). Carrying the new power cord and iPhone/iPad chargers have never been so easy. In the front pocket, you can carry as many things you can imagine...very spacious. The only thing I don't like about that particular pocket is that when you open the bag all of the contents can hide in crease at the top. Other than that no complaints whatsoever.

Quite frankly, I regret it. Sound quality on the Motorola units is extremely poor...sometimes. And it is not predictable. I have tried moving the base unit and even sitting next to the base unit when the sound quality is poor and there is little correlation to distance from the base. The range is vastly inferior to the VTEC 2.4 GHz units. I can talk on the VTECHs up to 400 ft away from the base and I can't even use the Motorolas in the next room. It's too bad because Motorola did a good job with the features and functions. I especially like the blinking light on each hand unit to notify of a waiting message.

It didn't just happen on one handheld, but both...which I had bought separately - thus it couldn't just be a lemon. Now a couple of years later, I'm looking to buy a new phone: the batteries die within 20 min (they never worked well, especially when using the speaker option); the phone loses the signal and disconnects calls; it won't let me dial as it's \\"out of range\\" when I'm 2 feet from the base; on and on.

It is fairly stable on a flat surface such as a countertop or an electric burner, but on most gas burners, it will be unstable and tip over when empty or near-empty. The handle needs to be lighter, or the copper disk heavier.Secondly, the copper disk on the bottom isn't wide enough. Gas flames lick up the sides, and so you have a too-hot ring surrounding the part that is over the copper disk. This is very obvious if you fry an egg. You have to turn the heat much too far down to avoid this.I suspect it works reasonably well on electric burners, but I haven't tried.For gas, I'd recommend you get a pan that doesn't just have a copper disk, but is solid copper or aluminum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"I have been using this pan for abt 5 months now and am just abt ready to put it away.

The themes circulated around common ideas, which isn't a bad idea, but tended to reflect more often than not the current political, cultural, state of affairs with unusual psychological/dramatic twists. I suppose this is to be expected: we live out of a cultural remix that is reflective of many interpersonal, political, psychological perspectives.

I actually looked the series set up online to make sure it was licensed set and not just that someone burned the episodes from their VHS to a dvd. But unfortunately, that is the quality you get to look forward to with this set. The audio on the playback is sometimes low with a hum in the background and there is no option of closed captioning or subtitles. The picture, while cleaned up a bit, still looks grainy.

The problem is the electronics, especially the thermostat, which didn't work on day one and doesn't work now (about a year later). Today, the thermostat failed to shut-off entirely and the machine came close to catching on fire. A true hazard that I'll have to retire. It's a sad day, when you can't trust the cuisinart name and the industrial-chrome look to deliver quality.

The first one stopped working in the middle of cooking a waffle, about a year ago. To Cuisinart's credit, they honored the 3-year warranty even though I didn't have an actual receipt (I only had the credit card statement that showed the store where I bought it) and replaced it within a month at no charge. The second one just died a few weeks ago, this time the thermostat won't shut off, which could actually be a fire hazard. If you look closely at an actual model, you'll notice that there's a couple of small holes in the upper handle housing that will allow steam to make it through to the thermostat circuitry, and indeed when you cook a waffle you'll get steam coming out from the temperature control knob area. I believe that sooner or later this causes something to short out in the thermostat circuitry. I wouldn't buy another one of these, although they do bake a good waffle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsey construction","review":"Bought this as a replacement for a 10 year old villaware 2-slice.

It pretty much does that, and the fact that you don't have to pay any connection fees (unless it's a call to someone else not using Skype) is nice, but there are a few downsides. One, there is a major delay in the transmission; you can say something in the phone, and it will take like 10-15 seconds before it arrives on the other end. Also, you have to keep it connected to your computer with your computer online if you ever want to recieve unexpected phonecalls from loved ones; otherwise you'll have to make arrangements with them to be online at the same time. Ultimately, it is a very usefull tool if you have limited access to hi-tech communications (like in 3rd world foreign countries), but at the same time you may find it more of a hassle than a boon if you use it like a home phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Classier Than the Film Itself...","review":"Though missing the eerie incedental music by Michael Kamen & James Guthrie(added by the panicked producers to the USA cut of the film at the last minute) This CD asks and answers the musical question: Can Henry Mancini write sci-fi/horror music?

I am loyal Amazon Prime customer and can not believe the \\"REVIEWS\\" that were allowed on a product page for a preschool-aged product.

The only problem I had is that we read a little each night before bed and they always wanted me to read more! It is a very interesting and imaginitive book with lots of moral values built into it.

Some may argue \\"But she was 27 when she wrote it.\\" Let me tell you: Age ain't nothing but a number. Just because she's young doesn't mean she's not full of stories! Aren't we all?Buy this book; you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"geri halliwell \\\\if only","review":"i think it was a graet book its so heart worming and she is the beast im only 10 yrs old and i love this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"I identified and I am a 29 yr old American non-popstar male","review":"Sure this was a quick read, but it was enjoyable none the less. The best parts were when Geri talked about her habit of counting lights or running a little farther so that what she wanted would happen. I do that all the time and thought I was a tad weird. But if someone who has attained the kind of fame she has, then I don't feel so bad.Its an inspiring book really. I even found it uplifting and I am a lowly 29 year old American male!Geri Power, indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ NOW!","review":"I received this book for Christmas, and read it in a day. I was absolutely hooked. It details the rise to fame of the Spice Girls, hand in hand with Geri's whole experience of the situation. It will have you crying and laughing - it is very well written, and I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it. It gives the reader an insight into Geri's thoughts, and you feel as if you are living out her life too. With certain events described, you can remember the events, but now view them from a different slant - Geri's true feelings. Geri - you go girl! We think you are Fab!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sympathy for a Spice Girl","review":"I liked this book a lot, but not for the reasons that others have cited. If Only is a perfect example of the celebrity \\"autobiography\\". While a little disjointed it tracks a path from humble beginnings to superstardom. It shows some clear signs of a coauthors knowing hand, but remains just disjointed enough to present an authentic voice.No hard hitting expose's here. Nearly everyone Geri meets is at least nice. And it makes a point to emphasize that she was born in 1972. Personally, I find more to admire in the fact that this woman who is _clearly_ older is still pulling the age trick off. Even if there is a slip up a couple of chapters in when she describes being touched by the wedding of Charles and Diana. In 1986. Clearly the consistantcy fairy slipped a bit.It's a vastly entertaing read, and I look forward to the second volume, some 20 years from now when she no longer feels the need to be nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star Still Lives...","review":"Geri's book is very inspirational. It's a modern-day Cinderella story. The book shows that behind all the walls that are put up with stars, they are still human. How she wanted fame so much, proves that if you want it, you will get it! Once I started reading, I couldn't put it. GOOO GERI!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IF ONLY I CAME ACROSS THIS BOOK EARLIER!","review":"Geri Halliwell deserves a standing ovation. Iam not a huge fan of the spice girls and was a bit unsure about this book thinking that it would be aimed for teenage readers.Geri really poors her heart out in this book over very personal issues , and takes the reader on a tour down the road she walked all the way to where she is today. I applaud her with her honesty in this book , and on some of the photos that she included in the book , photos in which she was subject to alot of criticism, a classic tale of \\"the past came back to haunt her\\" I truly admire her for her courage. All spice girls fans and non-fans will enjoy this book thoroughly and would not want the book to finish. When I started to read this I could not put it down and I was up reading this book up to 3:30 am every morning and I had to force myself to put it down so I could got to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only....","review":"If ever there was a book that described one's personal battles to overcome so may obstacles, it would be this one. \\"If Only\\" brings you through the highlights of Geri Halliwell's life, the successful and the traumatic. It explains the troubles she endured as a child as well as her dreams. She explains how determined she was to follow her dreams and become an international pop star. She makes it quite clear how she uses her fame, as well as her heart of gold, to try to enrich teh lives of those less fortunate than her, being familiar with having very little. her story should be an inspiration to all of us, and just goes to show that fame and fortune don't necessarily solve all of life's little problems. Three cheers for geri Halliwell, as well as for her partner at rest, Ginger Spice."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I didn't buy the book","review":"What a waste of money and time!!!! Geri Halliwell only demonstrates what an egomaniac she is and reinforces beauty stereotypes. She is doing her young readers an injustice talking about her bust size, looks, etc. Very superficial! And her supposed problems with bulimia were almost an insult to someone who has been struggling with it for 16 years. In short, save your money and watch Cinderella-it's more convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"GERI HALLIWELL IS THE BEST EVER, FOREVER!","review":"Geri E.

Then she reinvented herself when she went solo. I sometimes couldn't put this book down because it was so catchy. Even though Ms. Halliwell has a penchant for being a good liar, many accounts of her life seem like they were open and sincere. But there will always be disputes, even if Ms. Halliwell says that everyone has his or her version of the truth.For example, did she share the popcorn she stole at the Tank Girl audition with Victoria Adams (the future Posh Spice) as she claimed she did? Adams (later Beckham) mentioned in her autobiography that she refused the popcorn because it was stolen. Did Ms. Halliwell leave the Spice Girls because she couldn't do it anymore, or was it because of a power struggle with a fellow band member? Is she committed to the cause of breast cancer, or is it simply a publicity stunt?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Truly Enjoyed this book","review":"Having had a brief remenissant moment of the spice girls I was suddenly curious as to the true details as to why Geri left the band. I always appreciated what they stood for as a kid, with their Girl Power and fun group of girls antics. Let me tell you that I found this book to be a great read! Gave me a completely different view of Ginger Spice and a whole level of respect for her as a person. Geri seems to be a sweet, geniuine, nice and thoughtful person, She seemed like a genuinely real person who had a dream and achieved her goal. She's very much the character she portrayed in the Spice Girls, spunky, animated and full of Girl Power. Honestly after reading this book I now see her as a more delicate, fragile person, who loves to laugh and enjoy the simple parts of life, but hates monotony and honestly as humans we all do, well, I do anyways. I recommend this book for those who were/are/is a Spice Girls fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ginger was really the best of the Spice collection","review":"Geri Halliwell shocked many of her fans when she left the Spice Girls in 1998 after a 2 year mega successful time. The Spice Girls were the biggest girl band in music history.... and Ginger Spice (her moniker back then) was the most exciting personality. Like her childhood idol Madonna, Geri Halliwell grew up in a working class suburb and had a dream to be famous since she was 12. She got it and yet she found that fame had an interesting impact on her life. This book answers a few questions as to why her sudden departure happened at the height of the Spice Girls fame ... and it reveals more of Geri underneath all the Ginger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superficial, Attention Seeking And Very Shallow!The Book That Is!","review":"This book reads like a very tedious conversation with Ms. Halliwell over a long lunch that you can't get away from until she finishes her dessert.She writes about her early impoverished childhood and how she craved the attention of an audience and wanted everybody's approval which sadly most people of any maturity know that this is something you will never get. Ms. Halliwell's \\"definition\\" of her \\"Personal Growth\\" is when she tries on an outfit which is too small so she asks for a bigger size.The last time I saw Ms. Halliwell in a photo she was being carried away to her limo by a big bodyguard after suffering from \\"Champagne Fatigue\\". The only good thing about this book are the revealing photos that were taken during her days as a \\"Glamour Model\\". It is no wonder that this woman likes living in Los Angeles.Her greatest accomlishment in life was to stop singing in a Pop Group and start singing solo. Big Deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a dream","review":"UnI has a unique way of blending vocals, guitar, and drums. The vocals are pleasant and are not overpowered by the instrumentals. I feel as if I've moved a little back in time listening to the CD. The vocals reminds me of Joan Baez, only clearer and more precise. More like a voice of an angel. This is definitely a CD worth buying! I look forward to more releases from this duo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Use of Talent","review":"I bought this CD out of curiosity, knowing it would not be the type of song I'm used to hearing Charlotte sing. It's difficult for me to rate it because this is not my type of music. I think Charlotte deserves 5 stars for being brave enough to try something new, which is why I give this CD a very generous 2 stars. But I don't like this CD at all! The synthetic music drowns out her voice and the lyrics are dreadfully repetitive. This is a good example of why some pop artists get away with not being able to sing well.If she is going to go pop, I'd much rather see her do Celine Dione type songs. This is not a good use of her extraordinary talent.But hey, maybe I'm just too old to appreciate something like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bag","review":"This bag was a gift for y sister who is a gadget fiend!

Yes, it is cute, small and folds up easily but the cons far outweight the pros. The basket is useless. It is too small and your baby cannot be in the stroller while you put something in it. What I dislike the most is how it handles. It will not stay on a straight path and the handling is bad. I am forever running into things in tight stores. It is not just me, my babysitter (sister) also hates my stroller. I will be purchasing a new stroller as soon as my baby outgrows the carseat for it. I don't like that either. The buckles are very hard to snap together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"This stroller looks great however is a waste of money and we no longer use it. I too am of average height (5'6\\") the handle is too short therefore my feet hit the wheels while walking (even worse for my 6'1\\" husband). The wheels are not sturdy and the stroller does not handle well on sidewalks. The sun visor is small and we end up having to place a blanket over the front end of the stroller which obstructs the view for the child. This stoller was quite a disapointment given the cost of over $100. A friend has this stroller and was sorry to learn we too had made the same mistake. I would have gladly spent twice the amount for something that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"I find that this stroller folds up easy and is very light weight. The problems with it is it's too short. I'm an average height 5'5\\" and I'm bent over trying to push it. When you are our for a long day it makes for a sore back. Also, the wheels aren't very sturdy. If you are using it outdoors, it's not very smooth. I have had mine for under a year and one of the straps is already broken. The basket underneith is VERY difficult to get things into. I will be going out to buy a new stroller tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light, but handles poorly","review":"We got this stroller as our primary, and while it has many good features, we ended up not using it primarily because the handling on urban sidewalks sucks. Also, we ended up missing a parent tray and a child tray.Pro: comfy for child, nice recline, light, folds well, includes infant bootCons: terrible handling, small basket, no parent tray, no child trayWe got a used Gracco Metrolite for $35 and are much happier. We do still use this for travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nightmare","review":"This stroller is terrible. I purchased it after an in-store test drive and I liked it because the seat was roomier than some others and it seemed lightweight and easy to tote around. After less than a month the wheels (which are cheap and wobbly) had already loosened to the point where it was next to impossible to maneuver it. My daughter is only two but she is tall and her feet easily reached the wheels which is another detriment to trying to push this thing around. The basket underneath is tiny, forget about stowing a diaper bag or even a purse in there. The bar for pushing is very narrow and if you are more than about 5'4 forget about pushing it without having your feet hit the wheels, my husband could never push this thing and I was just short enough to get away with it. In short...not a good buy. I have only had mine for about two months and I am getting a new one ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"If you were able to get to this webpage, then you know more about the internet and business than this book will ever teach you.

But as much as I love the selection of songs on this CD, its muffled monophonic sound makes it a very frustrating listening experience. I have heard bootleg cassette tapes of live recordings made with a stereo microphone during the 1970s that sound better than this. Instead of getting this poor excuse for a live recording, get its equivalent DVD,Live at the Hacienda '83/'86(which I also have, and I like watching the corresponding DVD FAR BETTER than listening to this CD).

Although I'm not rich, I related to all the discussions about the psychological aspects of money and how it plays into relationships. The anecdotal openings to each chapter keep the book entertaining. Also because the chapter titles are so descriptive, each reader will know immediately where they'll want to spend the the most time.I'm going to take the advice in the chapter on charitable giving because it turns giving into a real commitment by the whole family, not just a check dashed off by someone with a checkbook. Because I have children, I particularly related to this chapter as well as others on parenting. This book was really good -- practical advice -- but sensitive to differences."},{"rating":"1","title":"chintzy","review":"I was looking for an inexpensive collection of dance music to get my toddler moving, with some of the catchy songs that I remember enjoying as a kid. These CDs have some good songs (my toddler really likes \\"Celebration\\") but the kids singing the songs sing in what I call \\"Barbie doll voices\\" and are a little off key; personally I find it spoils the fun. Also, the arrangement lacks energy, in my opinion, so it doesn't encourage dancing as much as it should. Apart from one or two songs my toddler didn't really notice that the music was on. A major problem with the unprofessional presentation is that the CD numbers aren't written on them so when you pop one in you don't know which collection of songs will play. I had to label the CDs 1,2,3, with a sharpie.

Each mile differs in terms of intensity. Two miles are led by Bob Harper and the other two are led by two previous participants Sione and Tara. Bob's miles are my favourite but if you can get over the corny jokes by Sione and Tara, those are 2 good miles. You can decide to do 1, 2,3 of all 4 miles. There is a guide but as an intermediate to advanced level exerciser, I do all 4 miles and get a good calories burn between 450 / 500 calories each time. Surprisingly, your thighs and legs will be so done! Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my fav workout DVDs","review":"I really like the segments with Bob, Tara is ok, and I generally skip over the awkwardness that is Sione.

It is a straight forward cardio workout without complex moves, it serves its purpose in 16 minutes.

The first mile is a little slow but I amped up the pace myself by just walking faster. The other miles have some nice interval training and use weights or a weighted medicine ball. I was sweating by the end and felt like I had done a very good workout. If you have any knee trouble some of the miles may be hard for you. There is some jogging and speed running in place. Each mile had someone doing a modification to the exercise so you can follow them if you need to. The instructors are pleasant and easy to listen to their voices. It is shot outside so the workout makes you feel like you are outside also. The stretch at the end was a little short for my tastes, but I just threw in a yoga dvd and I was good. For those new or back into exercise prepare for a challenge. For those like me who want some variety and a little blood pumping workout this is a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout with Limited Time","review":"This is a great workout with limited time committment.

Other than that, I thought it was a good workout, especially if you need to get yourself started in exercising. But,don't be fooled that it's just \\"walking\\"; the 3rd and 4th walk will challenge you and that's the whole point. I did all four walks at once and it was a really good workout (you will sweat!!).

I have bad knees, making a lot of the exercise videos difficult for me to do - I have the biggest loser workout for Kinect and find it frustrating because of all the exercises that are bad for my knees - but this is low impact and still gives you a good workout. I'm not in the best of shape, so I've stuck with the first walk, but there are three more that get gradually more intense. Bob instructs the first walk, Simone the second, Bob the third, Tara the fourth. There's also a cool down at the end with Tara and Simone. I've done Walk Away The Pounds in the past and I would consider this comparable but I think this walk goes more quickly - it's not boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout video","review":"I have some Leslie Sansone walking videos.

The cover on the DVD is different but she's wearing the same outfit and does the same routine. They don't tell you that in the advertisement. Because I liked Karen Voight, I ordered another DVD and then ended up with 2 DVDs exactly alike. I was so upset about this that I emailed her company and told them about it. They knew they were the same but don't tell you that in the advertisement. They were nice enough to exchange YogaSculpt for another DVD for me. But it was a pain because I had to send them YogaSculpt and wait for them to send me something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic workout to challenge you","review":"I've owned this DVD for a while now - for some reason I keep forgetting how much I enjoy it and it finds itself left on the shelf. Then I rediscover it and fall in love all over again.This is a fantastic, challenging yoga/pilates workout. Karen's form and cueing are exceptional - she reminds you to place your weight here, push your foot there, bringing your own form and workout along in leaps and bounds. It will push you - some of the balancing poses will really force you to focus on stabilising your torso so you don't fall, and the warrior/triangle series really makes my legs shake.The workout can be done as a whole, or you can choose from the 25 minute \\"Flow Series\\" or the 20 minute \\"Pilates/Yoga Matwork\\" section.I would recommend this to those with some background knowledge of yoga; although Karen's instruction would probably allow a beginner to use proper form, I suspect it may be too challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I love this tape! I've tried yoga before as a teen but never quite like this. This is a relaxing yet challenging 45 minute session that not only centers you & sets the pace for a more focused balanced day but it strengthens your back, abs, arms & increases your flexibility.

At first I thought it wouldn't challenge me much (I am used to power yoga along the lines of Baron Baptiste, Mark Blanchard, and Seane Corne), but after a few minutes, I realized that the slowness actually meant holding poses for longer, and there is plenty of challenge in so doing. The music is very different- quiet, classical music- but a nice change from the traditional chanting or no music at all. I would recommend this to a beginner, since she explains the movement into and out of poses well, and because she doesn't use a lot of the technical names for poses, but more experienced yoga lovers will get a nice, deep stretch, and a muscular endurance challenge as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard on my wrists","review":"this is a well made product. her instructions are clear. the music is quiet. her form is impeccable (& her _new_ boobs look too perky.)there seems only few poses repeated: downward dogs or other all-four positions are done too many times. i find it very taxing on my (bad) wrists. surely there're other yoga poses that work hamstrings, lower back equally well?i guess i'm just not the right exerciser the video is made for. i gave mine away after trying it once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Easy Belgian Waffles","review":"There's really not much that can be said for this small and elegant machine other than it makes great Belgian waffles, provided YOU make great batter.The waffle maker itself is compact, stores easily, almost completely idiot-proof as it has two glowing attentuators on top. One indicates power to the appliance; the green tells you the waffle maker is ready to make waffles or that your waffle is ready.There's a locking mechanism to keep the lid tight while the waffle is baking. The waffle will NOT stick if you used a cooking spray like PAM (butter flavor?) or Mazola ahead of time as recommended by the manufacturer.Sunday mornings are fun again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works nicely for a couple of months -- then dies.","review":"Based on other similar reviews, I can only conclude that the WMB-2 has a fundamental design flaw.

I liked the features it has; heat settings, \`non stick' and a light to let you know when it's ready and when your waffle is done.The downside is; there is no recommended batter level so when you use too much batter it flows out, making a big mess of the waffle maker and your countertop. After about a month, the waffles started sticking. I had to spray with a non stick spray and then that stopped helping. The latch became brittle from the heat and cracked so it doesn't lock shut.

You have to mail your vac to St Louis and they will determine if you invalidated your warranty. I was told the warranty would apply if I used the wrong kind of filter for the wrong kind of dust. WHAT? So is that their way out of fixing it? So customers are suppose to spend the money mailing a fairly large vac and it may or may not be covered?

I had to barely push them through. The water system is bad too. Too much water gets thrown off. On my other one the water return system worked pretty good.

The prose is painfully bad, the dialogue is excruciating, the characterization falls flat, and the plot loses any tenuous claim to credibility unless the reader is willing to assume that each character is stupider than the last.Occasionally such a book can be rescued by an interesting detective. Alas, I have no idea whether this is one of them; because although this book is billed as an Inspector Jack Oxby novel, when I finally gave up reading on page 300 of a 378-page book, Inspector Oxby had made one brief appearance and garnered two passing references. I assume he actually does take part in the plot at some point, but I can't vouch for it.The cover blurb says \\"Fans of Ian Pears' art mysteries will enjoy the lavish detail.\\" Fans of Ian Pears would do well to reread Ian Pears and stay well away from this charmless hash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice documentary with designers' interviews & home movie clips.","review":"First let me make it clear that these are a DVD-R discs.This nice, although amature, documentary is mostly a 100 minute interview with one of the designers of the Disneyland Monorail. It is enhanced with home movie clips of the early monorails to show what is being talked about. The clips do get repeated through out the documentary, but I guess footage is scarce. The interviews are rather good, with a lot of behind-the-scenes details and information.The clips are fun to watch, most taken from 16mm & 8mm home movies. Most of the time they are sharp but a few are fuzzy, depending on the quality of the source material.If you don't expect a 'History Channel' quality documentary and you will be pleased with this DVD-R.

It's horribly crowded now and Disneyland has lost a lot of it's magic. Disneyland was better back in the 1970s as I remember it with the dual Autopias, People Mover, Rockets, Circle Vision movie of America, and gondolas. Tomorrow Land was stripped of so many great rides and it looks a bit like a ghost town. Very sad to see the People Mover track just sitting there gathering spider webs.

A strong, smart middle-aged heroine, Southern setting, a little bit of romance. Sadly, I was very disappointed. The writing was mediocre. I also found the privileged lives of Bay Tanner and her \\"ladies who lunch\\" friends to be extremely uninteresting. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters and gave up halfway through the book. Bay was far from a sassy no-nonsense heroine. She complained a lot, and seemed continually petulant. The kiss of death for me was the description of one of the (white) main characters as \\"exotic,\\" \\"Oriental,\\" with \\"slanting eyes\\" seemingly just because she has black hair. Oooh, black hair! Soooo exciting. What painfully boring lives these people live."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you enjoy putting things back together, buy this.","review":"What a disappointment. When fully put together and operating, this is a really fun toy that made both my boys, ages 3 and 4, squeal in delight. But as mentioned before, the minute you pick it up to move it, the legs, all 5 of them, fall off. There is also a support ramp that holds the climbing ramp that falls off constantly. We put ours on a little table, but when the table gets bumped, the track falls apart. I wouldn't buy this again. I am very disappointed in this toy. I can't imagine it would have been very difficult to have made the legs where they would \\"clip\\" in for more support. This was a major oversight.In short, if you like constantly putting your child's toys back together, you'll like this. If not, stick with the rich and wonderful Thomas Wooden Railway! Now THAT is a toy worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR disappointment!","review":"Santa brought this last Christmas and the kids were thrilled. BUT, I agree with the last review... this toy falls apart if breathe on it. My kids were constantly begging me to put it back together because it falls apart constantly. If the legs were made to \\"snap\\" in place, it would be one of the BEST toys made for Thomas fans. I cannot believe this toy passed any kind of toy inspection because it's a disaster as far as I'm concerned. I sold it at a garage sale for $3 this summer and was relieved to get rid of it. It caused a lot of angst and tears in this house. Too bad, because it really is a terrific and inventive idea for little Thomas fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son loves it I hate it","review":"My son loves this toy, as do all the kids around my house.

It keeps falling apart every second, no exaggeration here. It's worth $10 no more. $30 for this is highway robbery. I am thinking that I have to glue this thing to keep from falling apart. My son has fun for a few seconds then he gets frustrated because it keeps falling down and then I have to put those silly, poorly made sticks back on. Give me a break.

It looked like a lot of fun and my son loved it. But once I got it home, it was such a disappointment! The legs do NOT stay on and are very hard to put back in their proper holes. This toy sits on the floor of my son's bedroom perpetually tipped over and my son got very frustrated with it and never plays with it. Defiinitely now worth $40! I can't wait to get rid of it. It would be so much fun if it worked well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"We bought this toy for our son's birthday. It wasn't worth the money! The legs that held the track up kept falling off which really frustrated my son. It wouldn't have been so bad if it was every now and then, but it was all the time. It was noisy too, something I would have been happy to deal with if it wasn't falling apart every second. I gave it two stars because when it did work (meaning don't touch it let alone breathe on it) my son loved it. What good is a toy if you're not able to play with it? We ending up shelling out more money to buy another Thomas toy that he could play with. Save yourself (and your child) the frustration and buy something that's meant to be played with."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great toy!!","review":"My 3 year old son absolutely loved this one.

It is very cute - however, it is on the noisy side. The legs do come off very easy and cannot be glued (they come undone) He plays with it all the time and I would recommend it to others.

Hotel Rwanda succeeds in everything it does, the acting is incredible, and the movie leaves you drained and depressed. Seeing how the U.S. and the rest of the world abandoned these people just makes you ashamed. The worst thing is that you can't even blame it on Bush because Clinton was in office. Democrats, Republicans - they'd both let a million people die rather than risk losing a few votes for the next election."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Intense Film","review":"I got to watch this film recently&it truly just got at me very early on.it was said seeing what Power&force can do to a whole place.the Brutality&Loss of Lives was so Emotional.Don Cheadle was Great. he is One of the Most slept on Actors in the Business&after this Performance He won't be denied any longer.the whole Cast was truly in tune with the task at hand.when you watch a film as this you see the world differently&for whatever is happening in your world you just know that whatever you are dealing with isn't half of what is truly going on in the world.the saddest part after viewing this film is that this Genocide of a People all happened within the past 10-12 years which truly is Scary. a Must see film&this film should be taught at all schools.very intense film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Were is the genocide?","review":"I was very disappointed by Hotel Rwanda. It is completely inaccurate in the locations and in the manner it depicts the actors of the genocide. Furthermore big Hollywood strings were used to bring out the tears of the spectators using the same scenes as in The Pianist or Schindler's List.All the massacres happen in the background of the movie, no main character becomes a victim of the genocide. This somehow distances the spectator from what really happened.This is the story of one good man in the middle of hell, a Schindler's list Rwanda-style. I would have liked a movie telling the story about hell first, like Sometimes in April from Raoul Peck, to give the full perspective and not to focus only on an individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"When everyone left, he stayed...","review":"Hotel Rwanda is about a man who, during the early-90's Hutu and Tutsi war (and of course genocide), was faced with extreme challenges, and met as many of them as he could. The characters name is Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle), a man who really existed (and still does), and did become more then a hero for those who were protected in the hotel. This is that story, and I assure you is quite good.With so many great film aspects too because the acting itself was quite superb, and recognized as many were nominated for Oscars. However, more then that the movie just seemed to capture the tension, violence, and just absurdity that occurred in those few month's.Because as I mentioned before, the world mostly ignored the violence, yet with this film one cannot escape the realities that were those of the day, in Paul Rusesabagina's home of Rwanda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Oscars this year should have been given out!","review":"Wow...What an eye opening, gripping, heartfelt film!!! I truly believe Jamie Foxx deserved his Oscar for the movie, \\"Ray\\", but they should have made an exception in giving out two Oscars!Don Cheadle's performance was nothing less than BRILLANT, CAPTIVATING, and RIVETING all wrapped up in one!!!You have to see this movie folks, not for just the wonderful acting, directing, editing, cinematography, etc...but most all all for the realism and the truth to what happened in Rwanda. To think such atrocity could still take place (even in modern times) is beyond comprehension!What evil lurks in the hearts of mankind sometimes makes me truly ashamed to be called human! Heaven help us all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent way to raise awareness, a call to action.","review":"Don Cheadle is excellent in his portrayal of the courageous hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina.The way the characters calmly wait for death speaks volume of their desperation and their aloneness in the entire world. This message was so clear that it made me sick to my stomach.The bonus features introduce the real Paul Rusesabagina. The way he speaks without bitterness of the genocide is nothing short of a great lesson for everyone.A flawless feature, and a great lesson of humanity. Well worth any moviegoer's time, and moviegoers' taking action."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most important documents of our times.","review":"In one of the darkest days of modern times when the nations of the world stood by as hundreds of thousands were slaughtered this is a true story of how one man risked his life to save his fellow man. An incredibly moving film that is both a cautionary tale and the story how one brave man can make a difference.After the Holocaust everyone said they would never forget. When I learned about the Holocaust in school I never thought genocide would occur in my life time. Since that time however we have seen the killing fields of Cambodia and the ethnic cleansing in former Yugoslavia and then of course there was Rwanda.This time when we say we will not forget let's mean it.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrifying, but ultimately uplifting","review":"This is a moving depiction of the Rwandan genocide, told from the point of view of Paul Rusesabagina, a real-life hotel manager who sheltered more than 1,000 refugees during the 1994 conflict. Unlike the sweeping scope and flamboyant, somewhat off-putting titular character in 'Schindler's List', another compelling film about senseless human slaughter, 'Hotel Rwanda' succeeds in portraying a down-to-earth man just desperately trying to protect his family. Great performances by Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo render the Rusesabaginas' plight very sympathetic. The horror of the genocide is also depicted in an admirably restrained fashion, retaining its emotional impact without resorting to extreme graphic violence. The film also succeeds as a blunt indictment of the Western nations that did nothing to avert this terrible bloodshed. In all, a well-made, powerful and important film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad, yet powerful story","review":"This movie is based on the true story of Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle), a hotel manager of a luxury hotel who was directly responsible for saving over 1,200 lives during the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.Rusesabagina uses his connections to keep these people alive, and tries to get help for them. The movie is very touching, and it saddens me that the real Rusesabagina is not better recognized for his courage.I highly recommend this movie to all. I expect that it will be receiving a number of awards because the acting is phenomenal. The events that took place in Rwanda were gripping and tragic, but Rusesabagina's story is simply awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is an atrocity","review":"Another review said \\"hackneyed moralizing\\". I'd add, \\"with some apologetic white guilt thrown in\\" and \\"hand-picked, predictable plot vehicles contrived for the dumbest audience members\\". It ends up being un-convincing. Here you are supposed to be horrified at some \\"atrocity\\" and it's as phony as street theatre. It's a \\"made-for-TV\\" movie at best.One example: when some bloodthirsty thug has your life in his hands, and kills the person next to you just because he can, you don't stare into his eyes with a look of \\"How COULD you?\\". Instead, you make no eye contact and try to appear non-judgmental if not invisible, for the sake of your own survival(ok \\"appear invisible\\" is an oxymoron).If you want to see two good movies on the Rwandan genocide, try \\"Sometimes in April\\" or \\"Shake Hands with the Devil\\". The History Channel has a very affordable and superbly done documentary \\"Rwanda - Do the Scars Ever Fade?\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Helplessness of war and the courage of one man","review":"That is what Hotel Rwanda is all about, BUT more importantly it ends with hope, hope that this will never happen again. Don Cheadle gives a performance of a lifetime in this movie. I say that a really good movie can make you tear up, and I was tearing up during this movie.Terry George has directed a fabulous film. Everything is woven together wonderfully. This movie never turns to melodrama and has a documentary type feel to it. Like United 93(another great movie)it draws you in and you know what is going to happen, but when it does you still find yourself in tears. That is what great movies do.The sadness for me is that this is not a fake, it is not fiction. This really happened. The movie is amazing, BUT it also gives you a sense of anger at the US and all the big powers, I love the line Nick Nolte uses after he finds out they are only evacuating the whites. Watch this film, it will give you a much better understanding of what happened in 1994..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotel Rwanda is Brilliant and So is Cheadle","review":"I would agree with this reviewer who says, \\"Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina as he really was during the ensuing chaos: \\"an expert in situational ethics\\" doing what he morally had to do, at great risk and potential sacrifice, with an understanding that wartime negotiations are largely a game of subterfuge, cooperation, and clever bribery.\\" The portrayal of America is not especially good. The film makes it seem like the U.S. doesn't care about the tragedy because it is \\"not in their interest.\\" This may be an unfair shot. It' almost like they are saying there is no oil or economic reason to fight, so let the black suckers die. It may not be that simple as Hollywood makes it out to be....just a thought.Great acting, great picture, no doubt about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good one to add to your collection","review":"Don Cheadle continues to amaze. This reality story can't fail to move you and is informative as well as enlightening, especially if you aren't already familiar with the events. Lead roles are strongly portrayed by each actor. I'm glad to have this one in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB!!","review":"The only means to expose millions of westerners to the horrible and SHAMEFUL genocide that occured there. I saw it on the news 10 years ago when it all happened but I did nothing- no protest, not anything. Being a Jew this movie made me feel especially bad. Belonging to a people that had undergone genocide I should have known better. Shame on me and shame on the world for not caring once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I have ever seen!","review":"I was totally blown away by this movie. Don Cheadle did an amazing job bringing this story to life. He made the movie. There's drama, suspense, love, and wrenching heartache, then a bittersweet victory. I recommend this movie to anyone - you should go out and get it! Don Cheadle deserved the Oscar for his amazing performance.\\"Dying without doing anything to me was a failure.\\" ~Paul Rusesabagina (the man who the movie is about)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar Worthy Performances By All","review":"All I can say is \\"Outstanding Movie\\" on all levels.

Will the people of Africa ever know how to live in peace?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul is no hero...","review":"I have been to Rwanda twice and have met and interviewed dozens of people who were at the Hotel des Mille Collines including Interhamwe who he dealt with.. The 'hero' of this film lied during most of the story. He charged money for the refugees to stay at the Hotel even though the Hotel Management in Brussels told him not to do so. He pocketed the money for his own profit and if people couldn't pay, he would throw them out to the Interhamwe for them to be butchered. He is no hero, he was a villain who before getting the spot at the Mille Collines worked at the Hotel Diplomat, because that is where the genocide government had their headquarters for the first few days of the genocide. If anyone questions anything I wrote, contact the Kigali memorial Centre, ([...]). If you want to use a film for your students, use either Sometimes in April or Shooting Dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"Normally, I'm not a big fan of message movies. Usually the politically correct leanings of the director are more than I care to endure. However, this one surprised me because it's good film-making, in addition to carrying a very heavy message about man's inhumanity to man. Don Cheadle does a great job as the noble hotel manager. The violence is visible, bit not gagging. I add my thumbs up to this very popular flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving film","review":"This film blew me away. It is a moving and tragic story about the genocide that occurred in Rwanda, focusing on this hotel and the man that fought to keep people alive. It is absolutely amazing and sad. I always enjoy movies that make you think and tackle a difficult subject. This movie is no exception. I highly recommend this to everyone. It is thought-provoking and will tear at your heartstrings. It is graphic at times so I do not recommend it for the younger crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant","review":"This movie is Don Cheadle's movie. His quiet gravita carries the weight and he deservedly wins an Oscar's nomination for it. To put it in a nutshell, Hotel Rwanda is akin to Oskar Schlinder saving the Jews in Schlinder's List. Here, we would get to see how Rwanda is abandoned by major powers such as French, Belgium, and even America. Unlike Iraq, Kuwait which have oil that America needs, Rwanda has nothing that those major power craves for. Even when genocide begins, personnel for the White House is still debating if \\"genocide\\" is a just definition of what happened to Rwanda. One million corpses is quite a body count, isn't it? Even when Paul (Don Cheadle), House Manager for Mille Colline could leave Rwanda, he morally chooses to stay back to ensure that those under his protection would leave safely. Established supporting cast such as Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Sophie Okonedo. A movie to watch, lest we forget of human's propensity to commit evil towards one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional rollercoaster","review":"THis film depects the horror that happened in Africa and how one hotel manager did in fact make a difference in the world. THe movie shows the difficulties of the time and how no one's life was safe. THis movie shows the ups and downs of emotions that was running rampid in this film. A must see film for anyone who wasn't involved in the actual event."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Action Packed True Story","review":"This movie was not only a moving tale about a true genocide that you forget about once you leave the theater. This is something you will never forget, the tale of a hotel manager that helped to save 1,000 refugees. The tutsies and the hutus were 2 rival races of the same people in Rwanda during 1994. The hutus attempted to take over the country of Rwanda while the tutsies couldnt stop them. The UN couldnt help, european and western nations couldnt help, in fact they all left. The refugees were left to fend for themselves. The main character, Paul, is played Don Cheadle and no one could have done a better job. This compelling tale of a Hutu that saved hundreds of people, both hutu and tutsie, by risking his life is not only moving but action packed to the very end. Whether you love action, docudramas, or just an all-round good movie, this is for you!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal & Highly under-rated","review":"I don't know what else to say about this movie. It's was one of the most moving stories about Africa that I have seen. It's a shame that it didn't receive more rewards. I only wish I would've seen this film sooner. Powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flick, But...","review":"SOMETIMES IN APRIL was even better. If you really want to get a feel for what happened outside of the hotel see this movie!! It takes you into the homes, neighborhoods, villages, churches, schools for Hutu's & Tutsi's alike and there are even a few scenes at the hotel from HOTEL RWANDA. It also extends past those 100+ days to the trials and village tribunals years later. SOMETIMES IN APRIL is a much more comprehensive look at the horror of that time. While I was moved by HOTEL RWANDA, I was moved to tears by SOMETIMES IN APRIL. Everyone should see both of these movies. Also, read the book, WE ARE HERE TO INFORM YOU THAT TOMORROW YOU WILL BE KILLED WITH YOUR FAMILIES, for folks interested in additional reading on the subject. I'd like to say that perhaps we all can learn something from these tragedies but what happened in Rwanda seems like further indication that we never learn from history, we just end up repeating it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit, work as well as OEM for way less money","review":"I replaced the front and rear rotors on my '95 BMW 740i, and went to some Hawk pads at the same time.

EBC makes a slotted rotor for this car, but I didn't feel like spending the extra money. The OE rotors cost about the same as the EBCs, but I don't see a problem with these much less expensive parts.My brake redo involved new pad sensors, new rotors, and new pads.

I would expect them to be of lesser quality and greater chance of breaking.I don't care if it says tow chain written all over it, and is painted highway traffic cone orange. If it isn't a 3/8 inch chain - you might be able to tow an ATV out of the mud - but NEVER tow a car with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun!","review":"You can just picture the soldiers getting home from WWII and wanting to get married and buy their first home!

People who have seen Takumi race have been wondering for a while if he can pull his magic off on a mountain other than his normal Akina run; we finally discover the answer. No, I won't tell you what it is. Cole has the chance to take his relationship to the next level, will he do it? And finally, summer's over and school begins, will this mean that Tak's racing will be put on hold?This is a good volume. You really get to see some great racing scenes, it's definately worth the ten bucks you need to pay for it. If you've read the other five volumes and liked them, I'm betting that you'll like this one, too. If you haven't read the earlier parts or you didn't like them, then don't buy this quite yet. The character designs can be a little weird at times, but it really isn't that bad, they grow on you. You'll get used to it, and hopefully it won't get in the way of your enjoying a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takumi vs. Cute Racer Chicks","review":"In this book, there is the question of whether Takumi can handle racing in places other than Mt. Akina. Over at Mt. Usui he goes up against a pair of female racers who call themselves Impact Blue and drive a Nissan Sil 80. Shuichi Shigeno, as always, can be counted on to produce a tightly illustrated racing scene. Some of Impact Blue's dialogue gets a little over-the-top during the race, but it's all good fun. So far, Natsuki (\\"Natalie\\" in the English translation) has been the only regular female character, and it's nice to see more female characters getting introduced into the spotlight. At the same time though, there is a bit of a cheesecake factor put into Book 6 because of the girls and the author admits it in a really funny caption. On the other hand, it actually helps bring out the personalities and insecurities of the main characters. Iketani (\\"Cole\\") also gets a lot of good character development in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right up there with the best","review":"Ellen Chen's translation, along with her excellent commentaries for each chapter is one of the best.I rank it up there with Derek Lin's version for its clarity and succinctness.While these two versions don't always agree, they do offer more than just a translation.

We've had problems with guests and kids - you have to remember to tell guests that they must brown things like ground beef on low, which they are not used to. Our worst experience was with guests of our kids - all of a sudden there was a fire on the stove because the pot had been on high with olive oil in it. These things did not happen with our old pots.

When they are forgetting their own creed to respect what others believe. Ed Fitch did a wonderful job in this book. Freya Aswynn, an Asatru author even wrote that Wicca is based of the ORIGINAL form of Norse religion, witch was, just like everyone else, a Skyfather and an Earthmother, there are many phenomenons to both the sky and the earth, and so the other gods popped up to incarnate these phenomenons.

I expected a description of what we know of ancient practices, but that's not what it is.Waste of money. Some interesting stuff but most of it is ceremonies he made up for the book. The first three, long, paragraphs of most of them is the same. His history of the gods, their rune symbols, etc are out of whack with conventional sources. It's a touchy, feel-good version of Neo-Wicca and not a good one of that. At least he admits you are free to see the gods to be what you want and make up the rites by however you see the world and feel at the moment. Save your money and make up something that makes you happy. That's all the book tells you to do. Should have spent the money on beer - and toasted Odin."},{"rating":"1","title":"bug poop","review":"While not as butt-despicable as, say, Rune Magic by \\"Deon Dolphin\\", this is still a book to be wary of. I would expect anyone writing about Asatru to at least know the difference between \\"thou\\" and \\"you\\" ( singular vs. plural ) but this is apparently too much for Fitch. A similar ignorance affects the otherwise appealing artwork by Robin Wood : to use the runes Tir and Hagalaz for _th_ when there's a perfectly good rune Thurisaz available is sheer runic illiteracy and to render Freya as \\"Freua\\", using Uruz as _y_, is just plain stoopid. Alas, this seems to be the most popular book on the Asatru revival, if the number of copies I see appearing and disappearing in bookstores is any indication. A far better way to start is with Kveldulf Gundarsson's Teutonic Religion; once you've read that, Fitch can safely be read as entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The illustrations are nice","review":"Robin Wood's drawings of the Goddesses and Gods are about all that I like about this book.

People interested in wicca are better off with something by Buckland or Cunningham or any of the other decent wiccan authors, and people looking for heathen books are better off with anything else but this. The back of the book is extremely deceptive, although the author is slightly more honest in his introduction. The mythology and lore found in the book are useless as is the rune information. The few useful bits on mead and drinking horns just aren't enough to make the book worth the money.

Unfortunately, you never get to know them. The movie suffers from an acute lack of directing, editing, script and continuity. Having a story to tell doesn't count unless you know how to tell it.The cinematography does have its moments. But intimate moments are shot from too far away to tell what's happening to the people; establishing shots don't fit together enough to establish anything. Musical passages are chosen not so much to create or enhance mood as to just cover up gaps in dialog.In order for a \\"small town romance\\" -- or any kind of romance -- to work, you have to care about the people.

The directing is soemthing you'll have to put up with: short staccato scenes that jab you with story bits rather than drawing you into a dramatic sweep.

The Doc Brown Y cuts are ideal for his feedings. They can be difficult to find in retail stores. The only store around us that even carries them is Babies R Us and they are almost always out of stock. My only complaint is that after about three weeks the opening on the nipples start to widen and this causes the liquids to pour out too quickly. When your paying $6.00 for three nipples and have to replace 6 to 9 of them every three weeks it gets a little expensive. Aside from the widening problem it really is a good product. I know it has helped with my son's feedings. If Doc Brown can figure out a way to keep them from wearing out so quickly it would be a five star product instead of a four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"We used the Y-cut nipples when our daughter started rice cereal. The nipples worked great and didn't flow too fast. Would definitely recommend rather than cutting a regular nipple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photo deceptive for more than one reason","review":"Yes, the stand appears wider than it actually is, and no dimensions are given. Photographing it without the leg extensions creates the illusion of greater width. Of more concern to me is the fact that the color of the legs is completely misrepresented in the photograph. The platform is a dark gray, almost black, but the legs are a very LIGHT gray, appearing almost white by contrast. My impulse was to return it, but I decided it wasn't worth it and spray-painted the legs black. The stand is sturdy, but the legs are plastic and look cheap, and the sections (too few and too wide for proper height-adjustment) do not all fit together well. The description is also deceptive; yes, something can be stored beneath the stand, but NOT paper: there isn't quite enough room for an 8 1/2\\" sheet. Another couple of millimeters would have done it, so this is just poor design. Your move, but be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is made of cheap plastic - Broken when I installed","review":"This product is poorly constructed.

I strongly do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for what I need","review":"I bought this to have enough space to put my Mac Mini underneath but couldn't have it to tall because my desk has a hutch. Took all the measurements ahead to know what I needed and the product was exactly as described.

As no dimensions are listed, I was fooled by the photo. It's only about 11\\" wide. The screws putting it together are difficult to screw in straight, due to poorly constructed parts. You'd do as well putting an old book, or two, under your monitor; which is what I do with worthless old computer books, like books on Windows 98."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Waste of Money","review":"There's nothing holding the legs of this stand together. To look at the pictures, one might think that the leg extensions snap in place firmly like Lego blcoks, but that's not the case. One piece simply rests on another without the beneift of friction, so it falls apart easily when jostled. If this happens while your monitor is resting on the stand, your first instinct might be to tilt the stand so you can reconnect the leg, at which point another leg will likely fall off. Honestly, the whole thing should come with a tube of crazy glue, because it's a complete failure of a product as-is."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong color and wrong height","review":"First, though it appears to be black with dark grey legs -- both in the Amazon picture and on the box it arrives in -- it's actually a medium grey platform with light grey legs. So if you need it to be a particular color to blend with your desk and monitors, just be aware that there is a bit of false advertising going on here.Second, the adjustable leg pieces are just too big -- about 1.5 inches each -- so it's very difficult to get exactly the right height. It would be better if they were smaller (say .75 inches), so that you could get the platform to sit at the height you really need.All that said, I haven't seen any better options on Amazon, so I might just stick with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"only so so","review":"I was disappointed. Its smaller than it looks. I thought I would have had enough room to slide my keyboard underneath. It doesnt fit. Even when I tried to slide it underneath thru the side.

The switch is very sensitive and when you just press it, it will turn on and then once its on the only way to turn it off is to take off the battery cover. It mixes well but makes a mess once it stops turning on and off. I have to put my bottles deep in my sink and pull it out of the bottles with it still spinning. The only reason I am still using it is because my daughter is on an 8oz bottle and when you are just shaking the bottle all the powder goes into the nipple and does not mix well. Thankfully, she is almost off formula. Will definately purchase the more expensive items for the next child!Also, smaller than expected!

Even after I swiped them away, my son--normally a good eater and quick to burp--was fussy and squirmy during the feeding and had difficulty burping afterward. Another thing I didn't like is that you have to hold the ON button down at all times in order for it to work... kind of a pain. Preparing bottles is a little faster, but what good is that if it makes baby unhappy? A battery powered powdered formula mixer seems like it would be such a convenience, but I recommend sticking to the old fashioned wire whisk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the need?","review":"I'm confused.

They are indispensable if you formula feed (we're formula feeding twins, which makes it doubly necessary!).Our first PL mixer was great and lasted 5 months before the motor died. I recently purchased another and, after only 2 days, the mixer stopped turning when immersed in liquid.So, word to the wise, there's a reason why these are so cheap (actually quite a bit cheaper at BrUs).

It has great power for the first week and that is it. I wish i could get a refund for it or atlease one,or hell just send me another one, but it's ok.. Hope they will improve their product. I seen that munchkin has one, but the prince Lion had better reviews, but maybe I'll try the munchkin brand... Yes yes.. I also made sure that it did not get wet beyond the little stick and it still played out. I will not buy another one. I believe that two is the limit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful with formula mixing!","review":"I love this mixer! It makes mixing a bottle so simple and quick! I had read reviews that the item didn't work well, etc, but I took a risk and bought it anyway. I've had it about 3 weeks now, and it works like a charm! It is a little tricky with bottles that are filled to the top, but we fix about 6 oz in a 9 oz bottle, and it's perfect. The trick I've found to keep it from splashing out is to move the mixer in a counter-clockwise motion (the mixer itself moves in a clockwise motion), and make sure it's completly stopped before pulling it out of the fluid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth watching","review":"Not a good movie in my opinion.

For some reason, Amazon offers a lot of old schlockly films from the 60s and 70s that combine sexploitation with violence. Why this combo ever appealed to anyone, I don't know, but it's rather disgusting. This is simply another one of those films, but an a foreign Italian one instead of an American one. This film has bad conception, bad writing, bad directing, bad filmography. Only, you can say there is a pretty girl in it, but so what? I'm a triple sucker, and I got suckered into buying this one.

As this album originally recorded in 1970, it's not an old-fashioned stuff. Essentially T2 were formed in early 1970 as a power trio like The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Cream and Budgie. (their guitar player Keith Cross was only seventeen at that time and being hailed as the new Eric Clapton) But this album has a unique blend of various musical styles. They played as one, with great emotional intensity and sounded like no one else.

The research background of the author seems...well, intuitive, rather than empirical. As a Cherokee writer, he seems to base many of his conclusions on his own experiences of what Cherokee people are like (independent, democratic, etc).

After reading that Leah Kincaid was sexually assaulted by her brother-in-law, Chase Kincaid, and then found out she was pregnant and did not know who the father was, I almost put the book down.

If you are an advanced Yogi and are just looking for different Vinyasas to try and are not interested in instruction then perhaps you may enjoy this DVD.One thing I DID like about this DVD is the set locations are BEAUTIFUL!

They all said they are the best bottles and that nothing compared. My son has execlusively used them for two months now and I think the hype is not all its cracked up to be. Simply stated they leak. I will go to feed him an half an ounce will pour out all over his clothes. Also, everytime I go out I have to put the bottles in a ziploc bag just to prevent them from leaking all over the diaper bag. I am very frustrated with them and I am switching to Playtex Ventaire they work just as well and they don't leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"These bottles did not work for my baby","review":"My daughter has reflux and is colicky so when I saw the ad for these bottles I thought that they actually might work(They boast about how your colicky child will be less gassy and spit up less). So I went and bought some just to try them out, My daughter spit up more when she was fed from these bottles than any other bottles. I followed all of the directions given in the box, and still it didn't work. I guess they work for some, but for the most part, everyone that I have talked to about them has also claimed they did nothing but cause more spit ups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kim","review":"I didn't think these bottles were that great. My child isn't collicky and doesn't have digestive problems so maybe I would rate this item differently if she were. I thought maybe she would burp or spit up less with these bottles compared to regular bottles but she didn't. Plus there are more parts to clean. My husband hated them after the first couple of tries but I wanted to give them a chance. So after a couple of weeks I also gave up on them and use them as regular bottles instead of attaching all the parts. Save your money and get a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but messy","review":"I registered for these bottles while I was pregnant based on reviews I had read and hear-say from people I'd meet in the store while \\"researching\\" them. Of course when you are a first time mom you aren't familiar with any of the baby stuff so you have to take advice on these sorts of things from other moms. I think the concept of these bottles is wonderful but they are too aggravating. I never used one of these bottles that didn't leak. No matter what I did to try to get them not to leak, it didn't work. So they made for a very messy feeding time and a waste of milk; and as a first time mom with a newborn, this is the last thing I wanted to deal with! I always had to make sure that my daughter had a bib on or I had a burp cloth tucked under her chin. I have recently switched to the Playtex VentAire and feeding time is much more enjoyable and not messy at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Our 2 month old had colic, gas and what seemed like a lot of spitting up. We tried these for 4 days and the gas was the only thing that improved. We believe the gas decreased because he wasn't keeping any of his formula down. The spitting up became projectile and he seemed hungry all of the time because he wasn't able to keep anything in his stomach. We were all miserable, so we went back to the Playtex and the spitting up returned to normal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky, a pain to clean, clog all the time","review":"My husband did a lot of research and was convinced these would be perfect for our daughter. Now six months old, she was born a 3 pound premie. We had a lot of trouble with the premie and stage one nipples. The bottles also leak terribly. When we go out, I have taken to carrying the formula in a large tupperware drink container and filling empty bottles as the day goes on. Our baby has reflux, a common premie problem. We are supposed to put cereal in her bottles to help prevent spitting up but the vents and Y nipples get so clogged, our poor baby sucks and sucks and nothing comes out. She gets so frustrated. They are also a pain to clean and mold grows in the vent. Do not waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't I have these for my other two children??","review":"After my doctor recommended Playtex nursers because of daughter's gassiness, I came across Dr. Brown's. I thought, \\"Oh, come on, how good could they be?\\" But thought I would buy 1 and give it a try......WELL! My daughter is now happy ALL the time instead of only when not full of gas! She is like a new baby after only one day! No more mylicon drops for us! YIPPEEE! I only wish I had found Dr. Browns sooner and had them for my other two children who suffered with gas terribly! I know this sounds hokey but I would have enjoyed my first two children soo much more if they had Dr. Brown's bottles and weren't so cranky so much of the time! Thank you Dr. Brown's for giving me my happy girl 100% of the time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"the bottles were working great but then my son got thrush.

I tried Advent bottles and my boy continued to have a digestive disorder. He has a # of issues with eating. The other bottles he would cough and spit up. Then he would have gas. Also, they leaked half of the time. I tried the Browns bottles and he was able to eat more and keep more down him. He was diagnosed with Failure to Thrive. He is now gaining some wieght and is much happier. Though he still has some medical issues...he is getting stronger everyday. The heavier he gets, the better he sleeps and feels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for us","review":"My sister and i where out searching for a good product that had a smaller flow hole and we found this bottle. It sounded great! And I am sure it works pretty well, but my daughter would not even take to the nipple. She turned her nose at it and so I switched her back to the only bottle I have been happy with, which is the playtex premium nurser.If they offered larger softer nipple sizes, I think it would be a better product, but now as it stands I have to say that playtex is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, bad nipples.","review":"I think the engineering of this bottle system is great, but the nipples are just too small and narrow. My baby would put the whole thing in her mouth and her lips would touch the plastic rim. I never purchased any more after my initial set. I much preferred the Avent bottles and found they were much closer to breast feeding anatomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate these bottles!","review":"I had added these bottles to my baby registry and also bought a few myself. Well when my son came along these were a nightmare! So many pieces to constantly clean, he had so much gas, they didn't reduce colic at all, and they were horrible to mix formula in! The cleaning didn't get easier since they all melted in the dishwasher and weren't supposed to. These were way too [$$$] and were worthless! I switched to Playtex Nursers [...]!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Dr. Brown's!","review":"Loved these bottles...never had problems with gas or bubbles.

My sitter and husband do the feeding from a bottle and insist on using the Dr.Brown's bottles. My husband will even use 2 small Dr. Brown's before he'll use a single bigger bottle of any brand. My baby took to the Dr. Brown's bottles right away. We rinse the bottles out after using them and put them in the dishwasher. I do use the little brush that is included to clean often, but I've never had a mold problem (as mentioned in other reviews). I usually spend $15 for 3 bottles which may sound excessive, but it's worth it! I get them for every friend who has a baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING BOTTLES!!!!","review":"One afternoon at a relatives house my 2 month old's bottle broke and these bottles were loaned to us after trying them I ran out that evening to buy my own. They are AMAZING. I formula feed my son and he hasnt had that much gas or very frequently spits up. The bottles have a bit of assembling to do, but well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Browns bottles are the best!","review":"Like many new first time moms, I registered for many different bottles. The only brand worth keeping was Dr. Browns. Our son was born 18 days early and his digestive system was still premature. The Dr. Browns bottles helped tremendously in feeding him. His reflux was decreased and he did not scream from horrible gas pains. The system is definitely the best one out there. I started with Avent and about half of the formula would spill down my son's chin. I was so surprise at how much my son did not like these bottles since so many of my friends loved them. So if you are registering for bottles ONLY register for Dr. Browns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them!!!!!!","review":"I switched from AVENT after my new born was 4 months old....I waited too long....after months of bottles leaking and hearing air bubbles....and having a colic child...I decide it was enough...I see a major difference with a decrease in colic and gas...the bottles don't bubble and they really are that bad to clean...that's why we have dish washers or sterilizers...I love them and highly recommend them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy these for your sanity!!","review":"These are a must for any parent! I used to think a bottle was a bottle. Was I ever mistaken. After two months of the baby screaming for hours at a time I thought I was going to have to go to the mental hospital. The doctor said that this was normal. Yeah right... Mom said, I think it is your bottle. She is getting air and it hurts her belly. I switched to Dr. Brown's bottles and never looked back. She doesn't scream in pain anymore and I feel like a normal person again. These are the best!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Hassle","review":"I bought these bottles for our newborn before she arrived, and I wish I didn't. They leak like crazy if you hold them wrong, there's a bunch of little pieces you have to clean with a pipe cleaner (which I found to be a headache) and their no better than any of the other bubble free bottles. The nipples are also really long and big, which my newborn did not like. I now use either regular Avent bottles, or Playtex VentAire-which are cheaper and work awesome! To each his own I guess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This product has made all the difference in the world","review":"I was hesitant to try these bottles only because I didn't really believe it would make a difference. My baby had SUCH bad problems with gas, I thought it was just her lot in life. Then a friend urged me to try these. Man, am I sorry I didn't try them sooner. My baby can now actually sleep for hours without getting woken up by the awful gas pains she was getting. I owe it all to these bottles. Who knew a bottle made such a difference?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bottles...no problems with them.","review":"It might take you awhile to figure out how to take apart and put together the bottle but it works great!

I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"preemiemom","review":"I normally would have not written this, however I must share my expriences with these bottles. First all they are totally AWESOME!!! They have made my life so much easier. I was having trouble with my preemie (10 weeks early) after being relaesed from the NICU. She eats are every 3 hours. I spent 1 1/2 hours trying (struggling) to feed, burp and dealing with non-stop crying. It had become such a chore I was at the verge of post pardum depression. I had tried every bottle known to MAN!! I tried Dr. Brown and reduced the expreince to 1/2 hr minus the crying and burping is a sinch. Our baby is so much happier and so am I. My loyalty is with Dr. Brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Nipple that my Baby Likes","review":"After trying Playtex, Nuk, which both nipples collapsed, and the Avent nipple which was too hard for my 3 month old to suck, a friend suggested Dr. Brown. My baby is unique in that she has cardiac issues. She was able to down these 4 oz bottles in 15 minutes, with minimal gas and no spit-up. It used to take her over 30 minutes to drink previosly mentioned bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottles !","review":"I've used these bottles with my daughter since she was born. She is now 3 1/2 months. She's loved them from the start. I did try the wide bottle with her and she didn't take to the nipple, which seem to be very flimmsy. The skinny bottles are great. I wouldn't recommend getting too many 4oz bottles b/c they grow out of them quickly. I guess I'd say the best investment is to buy the 8oz, with a couple 4oz on hand for water or travel. As much of a pain it is to clean the many pieces from each bottle, I highly recommend the Dr. Brown's."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOTTLE OF CHOICE","review":"Tried it all. I used everything Platex has to offer with my first child and went on trying everything after that. Now with my second child - his problems include GER (reflux) and allergies/intolerances. We have tried Avent since birth because everyone said, \\"they are the best\\". Phooie. I wish I had tried something else sooner. Dr. Brown's bottles are easier to drink from for my son. His problems are too severe for the bottle to be the end all cure - but he likes the softer nipple, doensn't have problems with milk leaking out of his mouth while drinking (I ALWAYS had to put a rag under his chin), less burping afterward, reduced spitting and generally more relaxed - before it was a bigger effort to drink from the Avent bottles (we tried all they had to offer.) Downside = the cleaning does take longer. Worth it though. (We use the wide mouth bottles for formula and regular neck for water/juice - occasionally)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until your baby starts to hold her own bottle","review":"We bought these bottles - lots of them for our premature twins to help with gas reduction. The product APPEARED to deliver on that part. However, cleaning was a major pain, and you had to be very careful to prevent leaks - not easy when you have one adult and two babies. Now that our twins are 10 months old and holding their own bottles - they shake them, turn them upside down etc, milk goes EVERYWHERE! I have just thrown all twelve out including the three types of nipples and have replaced them with another brand that works MUCH better. I regret having spent my money on this product and all the time I wasted cleaning them when I could have been focusing on other things."},{"rating":"2","title":"They just work.","review":"I tred Avent and others and switched to Dr. Brown/s. there's a reason they're patented. They work. No more gas pains or air bubbles. amazing. Yes, more peices, but so what, my babys comfort (and yours too) is well worth it . They do leak occasionally, but if you don't overfill and don't tip them up too high when feeding, When heating the milk don't leave the top tight, loosen it, then tighten it to feed or it can leak. they'e great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Bottle I Will Ever Use!!","review":"I received the Dr.Brown bottles as a gift from another first time mom, and cannot imagine not having them. My daughter is breastfed, but I do like to pump to allow my husband feeding time with her. This is the only bottle that she could take and have no problems nursing at her next feeding. Although the cleaning is time consuming, I know her bottles are clean and do not have to worry about milk build up. The leaking has only been a problem with us when it was filled above the line. Overall a great bottle, I will never use an Avent again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful bottles!","review":"When I went back to work, we had a hard time getting my daughter to take a bottle of breast milk. She didn't like either Avent or Second Nature. I had purchased one Dr. Brown's, and out of desperation, my husband tried it. She took it no problem, and now doesn't bat an eyelash when they are offered. It's really helped with her gas as well. I love these bottles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It!!","review":"After not having to use bottles since my son six years ago, I didn't know what was out there. After a lot of research, I came across these bottles, read reviews and decided to buy them. Not once have I been disappointed. My daughter has not used anything else and is now 7 months old. She rarely ever spit up and never had problems with gas or an upset tummy. I am amazed how well these bottles have worked. Yes, they do take more time to clean, but in the long run you save time because you have a happy and smiling baby!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"djla","review":"These bottles a totally worth the money. I originally used the Avent bottles and with those my baby drooled so much formula out of his mouth while eating, I had to keep a kitchen towel under his chin to soak it up. He also had gas problems. I had heard about the Dr. Browns bottles and bought one to try. It was a miracle, no drooling, no gas. I'm glad I tried these, because previously I thought all babies had these problems. I clean the bottles with soap and warm water, and it does not take any longer than it did to clean regular bottles. Buy one bottle and give it a try, see if you like it. I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...relief!!!","review":"Our daughter was suffering terrible gas and creating a large amount of spit up. It truly seemed to be the bottles we were using. After reviewing others, we decided to try the Dr. Brown bottles and love them. She is such a happy baby now without gas and barely a drop of spit up. I think the bottles work wonders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottles","review":"I have a newborn who was 5 weeks premature and had trouble feeding after being tube fed for a couple weeks. These bottles were great and she definately had no trouble with gas which my firstborn drove me crazy with. The only thing I didn't like was that you have to have the insert inside or the nipple and ring leak, this makes shaking up a formula bottle hard because the dry powder can get stuck in the tube and not mix well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottles!","review":"These bottles have been wonderful for us. My son was colicky, and I was using the avent bottles. His burp cloth would be soaked by the time he was finished. When we switched, you immediatly heard the differents. The only disadvantage I could say about these bottles would be to clean them. They have several parts to them. He recently turned 6 months, and was ready for a bigger size bottle. I switched back to avent bottles, for convenience for one whole day. I got the same results as before. I have a small microwave, that the tall Dr. Brown bottles wouldn't fit in. I ended up buying the short Dr. Brown bottles, that are made like the avent. They have been as great as the small ones. I will never switch again!!!!! I would recommend these bottles to anyone, they really work in reducing air intake, and they aren't as messy either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed...","review":"I tried these bottles at the recommendation of several individuals who have tried them. My daughter has reflux and spits quite often. So, I decided to give these bottles a try. We had been using the Avent bottle system (which is awful and made my daughter very gassy due to the bubbles that form inside the bottles) and I wanted to see if these made a difference. They actually made her reflux WORSE. Initially, during the feedings her spit up had subsided and I thought GREAT! But then she continued to spit up for hours later. And she spit up A LOT. It kept her up all night and she was already sleeping through the night. This was not coincidental and happened on several separate occasions. I DO NOT recommend these bottles to anybody.I am sticking with the Playtex Ventaire system as it substantially decreases my daughter's reflux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't always believe what you read","review":"I bought these for my daughter before she was born, because the ad that I read in the parenting magazines was that is was to reduce spit-up, colic, etc. Well, everytime we used the bottle, even in her later months, she would vomit up her milk. I personally recommend the Avent bottle - the nipple is large, but they are wonderfully manufactured and developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"The Dr. Brown bottle was a great product at first. Then after a couple of weeks I noticed that the bottle started leaking all over the place every time she ate out of it. Then about 3 months after haveing the bottle the top part of the bottle that holds the straw in started to get mildew on it. I was very disapointed and I suggest do not waste your money on this bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great","review":"I know a lot of people love these bottles, but they just did not work for us. They are a big pain to use, you can't shake the formula, you have to prepare it in something else then transfer it to the bottle. They leak, even if you don't fill above the line. They are a bigger pain to clean, and the nipples are too narrow and my daughter seemed to constantly be dribbling all over the place. She also would injest too much formula and choke. We switched to the playtex premium nurser and are all much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby loves these bottles!","review":"Since this was my second child,I was prepared to use the Playtex nursers for my new baby. I soon found out that each baby is different. He did not feed well with the Playtex nursers at all and he ended up with a belly full of gas. The reviews on the Dr. Brown's bottles convinced me to give them a try. Let me tell you, the bottles are wonderful! Even though the bottles have a few extra pieces, I have not found them hard to clean. I would recommend these bottles to everyone I know. I'm sorry that I hadn't used them with my first child. She was a fussy baby. We used alot of gas drops with her. Had I only known that it was the bottle that was causing her discomfort!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best bottles","review":"i am the mother of twins. I registed for the playtex ventaire bottles thinking they were the best bottles.

I haven't written about a product before but I had to write about this one, they really are the best baby bottle you can get and at last a product that really does what it claims to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Dime","review":"You can't go wrong with these bottles. I am a first time mom and love to use them. My son is still breast fed, but when he gets juice or water, I give him the Dr. Browns bottles because he sucks barely any air. With other bottles, the nipples collapse and it never happens with the Dr. Browns. There are a few extra parts to clean, but it isn't a problem and doesn't take that much more time. Would recommend these bottles to anyone and have heard friends rave about these bottles too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty product","review":"I don't know if the Dr. Brown's bottles reduce colic as my son didn't have it, however, I did like the idea that they \\"might\\" reduce gas. I have used them now for about a month now and whenever my 3 month old is done eating, he has this huge gas bubble that comes out in the form of a HUGE burp!I noticed another reader left feedback that there is no point in making a formula bottle with these as they leak and I will agree with that completely!!! When you're done feeding and tilt the bottle back up, it drips down the side and makes a mess. I will also agree that there are too many parts to clean to this bottle when with an Avent (which we're using and is much better), you have a nipple, ring and bottle to clean.Overall we weren't satisfied with this product at all and will be returning them to the store to get more Avent bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bottles for preventing gas & colic","review":"Good bottles for overly eager babies who would otherwise be gulping down a lot of air. A bit of a hassle with cleaning (because of the multiple parts) but otherwise no downside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much to wash and too often and Very Leaky!","review":"First, I would like to mention that these bottles are extremely leaky, I've had them for two months now and the bottles are usually always with a ring of milk underneth them after they've been used & these bottles also leak while they are in the bottle warmer and I have to be cleaning it all the time and all the parts from the bottle seem like they are alway soaking and need to be washed, who has time for this?As far as gas and colic is concerned, which my baby suffers from, I see no difference between Dr Brown's and Avent. I have been using Avent for a few weeks now and I even think my baby has less gases.

I am so happy we have them! It does exactly what it says... at least in my experience it does. My daughter burps easily, and sometimes not at all (without any negative effects)... her spit up is minimized by the bottles and she does have colic. So, anything that reduces the bubbles in her digestive tract are good in my book.I would recommend these to anyone looking to buy bottles for their newborn. My daughter was small for her age, and at 6 weeks old we are still getting use out of them at 4oz. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort if you breastfeed","review":"I bought one of the 4 oz bottles to try for my breast milk so my husband could feed our son. Our son had gas and spit up alot and we found the Avent bottles the best for him along with gas drops. My biggest complaint is how the screw cap attaches to the bottle as when you shake the bottle without the inside parts- the inner cap moves and milk goes everywhere. Maybe not a problem if you make formula and use right away with parts in place but when you put your breast milk in it for future use, I did not want to put all the parts together as breast milk separates. I also found it too long to clean and think that the idea is good but needs a bit more improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work after a few more tries...","review":"After using these bottles and trying to see the benefit in them, it still hasn't proved it's worth. I didn't mind cleaning them an extra few seconds, if only they had worked for my baby!With all the contraptions it comes with, you would think it works. I'm pretty sure there are other babies out there who have benefited from these and I'm happy for them, but I just was not happy that they still gave my son some violent gas pains! I have since switched to a simpler form of basically the same thing, and that is the Ventaire bottle! It has worked wonders for my son! I am disappointed that the Dr Browns bottles didn't work for us, wish they had..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best on the Market","review":"We supplemented my daughter with expressed milk, and eventually weaned her from breast to bottle at four months old. She got very gassy, and would spit up often with all of the other bottles we tried, assuming she would even take the bottle for more than a minute or two. When we first tried Dr. Brown's bottles, we thought it would be more of the same, but boy were we wrong! They were the answer to our prayers! We loved them so much, in fact, that we have purchased them for our son, friends' babies, and for other babies in our family- not to mention recommending them to anyone who asks what bottles we used. We love these bottles and would neven dream of using anything else now. Thank you Dr. Brown!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greates Bottles Ever","review":"These bottles were recommended by my pediatrician to help relieve my 3 week old daughter's gas. I can honestly say that within three days, my daughter was a totally different baby. She no longer suffered with gas.

They are a bit expensive, but it is worth the extra dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"soft and great nipples for new born--great for breastfed kid","review":"this is the best bottle that i have tried.avent, playtex,and evenflow, are horrible and hard nipples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seemed to help with gas, but leak like crazy","review":"My firstborn had no problem with plain old cheap supermarket bottles, so we used the same for my daughter when she started daycare at 3 months. Her daycare providers reported horrible first days of crying and gas, so we tried the Dr. Browns, and they said they made all the difference. (I nurse when she's home with me, so can't report that first hand.)My beef with them is that they leak, even with the little plastic disk inserts that are supposed to prevent leaking. This is a pain, because no matter what, the bottles are going to tip over in a bag at some point and make a mess.So, if your baby has gas problems, by all means try them. But don't turn them upside-down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these bottles!!","review":"These are great bottles! When I started giving my son formula he had a lot of gas problems, but when we switched to these bottles the gas went away. They really helped reduce the amount of air that he swallowed. My son is not 13 months and we still use the Dr. Brown bottles. They only leak if you assemble them incorrectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be good but nipples are too fast!","review":"I think this is a great concept that just did not work for us. My little girl is three weeks old and the stage one nipples are just too fast for her. She drank so quickly that she ended up spitting up entire feedings! Obviously, this is NOT the idea.We are back to using the Platex nursers with the drop in liners and they work better for us. I think these would be great if your baby can handle the faster nipple."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKY","review":"I am a first time mother so maybe I am doing something wrong, but these bottles leak terribly. I have tried everything and still no luck. I breastfeed and cannot afford to waste breastmilk!

Is there anyone out there that can offer any suggestions, before I try another brand?Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my baby spit up at every feeding!","review":"I bought these bottles with the hopes that they'd reduce my baby's gas and fussiness. I thought these were the answer based on all the great reviews they got on this site. However, the stage 1 nipple was way too fast for my baby, and it caused her to spit up nearly everything I had just fed her at every single feeding! I kept thinking she just needed to get used to the nipple flow, so I stuck with it. But she just got fussier and fussier because she was spitting up everything at each feeding. I went back to the Vent Aire bottle I started out with.

We have been struggling with her gas and burps. We tried the Playtex Ventair. She would burp for hours and then when we tried to put her down to sleep, she would wake up crying and have to burp more. Dr. Brown's bottles take a few more minutes to clean, but I'd rather spending 5 minutes extra cleaning bottles rather than hours up trying to comfort my baby because of burps."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS!","review":"These bottles leak like crazy if you tighten them too much or not enough. It takes FOREVER to clean the zillion parts to each bottle. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate them!!","review":"I purchased these bottles after reading all the great reviews on them... I was greatly disappointed!!! First of all, they are a pain to clean!!! There are 6 parts to them and you need 2 different brushes to clean them with!! Second, they seem to leak, at first I thought maybe I had a bad bottle....but soon they all started to leak (I bought 8). Third, my poor baby had the worst gas problems! I changed the bottles to Avent and the gas ended!! So if you still want to try them, I suggest you only by a few and not WASTE your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if you use dishwasher","review":"Do not use these bottles if you use dishwasher to clean them. These bottles have too many little parts and the dishwasher does not clean them well. We bought a brandnew dishwasher with sanitize option just for the baby's bottles. My baby have strange rash on his face immediately after feeding sometimes, we finally traced the problem to the soap on the bottle. Unless you wash yours with hand and rinse them many times, DO NOT use these bottles. Also, it did not help with gas and split up, we own 24 of these bottles, and decided to switch to Avent. No more rash, and much less gas!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't worth the time, money and effort","review":"Problems: It leaks like crazy. Even if you don't shake it, it leaks sometimes when you have it upside down during feeding. Not to mention if it's not upright in your diaper bag. It's impossible to use it in a normal way if you use formula. Then, all those different parts require soooo much attention when cleaning. Oh, one more thing--make sure milk don't accidentally cover the inner tube during feeding!!?Avent's VentAire on the other hand has an elegant design and excellent quality. It does everything Dr Brown claims to do, without all the trouble. Not to mention Dr Brown's bottles are among the most expensive.Just DOESN'T WORTH it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get these","review":"I would never buy these. Who wants to do all that intricate cleaning when you have a newborn? I bought the MAM Ultivent Bottles. They have the same nipples as the pacifiers, so they are orthodontically great. And they totally come apart, even the bottom comes off, so they are a breeze to clean. And my baby who spits up alot, doesn't spit up at all anymore. No more wearing a bib all day! They are found at www.babywise.com. They're great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair to Consumer","review":"I actually find that these bottles are quite helpful in reducing the gas that my babies get during feeding. My problem lies with the Dr. Browns company. These bottles require an additional bottle brush in order to clean the tiny components inside the bottles. They are kind enough to provide you with one tiny brush in the package of 3 bottles. This is a problem because the brushes only last a few weeks at best then you must buy more from the company. I believe that they should be free and this should be brought to the consumers attention at time of purchase. Believe me, at .50 per brush, it will add up by the time the child ends bottle feeding!!Mom 0f 3"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont let the picture fool you!!!","review":"As you can see in the picture the bottles are (supposed) to be clear and NOT the BPA free ones. I ordered these because I wanted the ones that are not BPA free. I wanted them to be completly clear. When I recieved them I was sad to see that they were the BPA free kind. If I wanted the BPA free ones I would have order them for $7 cheaper per pack..needless to say I am getting a refund. But apparently Dr. Browns doesnt make the clear (non BPA free) ones anymore :( So I suppose I will have to get the BPA free kind, but at least I will be getting them cheaper then this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these bottles!","review":"My son is a breastfed baby but we also give him bottles of expressed milk, so Mom can get a break. We were using the Avent bottles and they actually created more work for me because he had to be completely changed after every feeding, he was getting milk everywhere. I tried different nipples, I tried changing how tightly the lid was screwed on, nothing helped. So I pulled out the Dr. Brown's that a friend gave us as a shower gift and LOVED it! My son is no longer wearing half of his milk. And he's not as gassy as he used to be with the Avent bottles. Thank you Dr. Brown!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr.Brown worked for us!!","review":"I really love these bottles. They are worth every penny.

I recently switched to Avent bottles and after 1 night he's a new baby - so content and happy.

We're sticking with Avent, which isn't perfect, but seems to be the brand he spits up the least with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding...","review":"what a pain, too many parts to wash and keep track of. We tried practically every bottle available and the old fashioned plastic bottle with the plain nipples worked as well as any. We couldn't tell any difference in the amount of gas on baby's tummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"I do not recommend this bottle. First of all, the extra parts make it very unhygenic when making milk, especially when you are outside. It doesn't reduce gas as it claims to be. Even though it came with a small brush, there are still areas you cannot reach to clean. And worst of all, even with the stopper, this bottle leak if it is not upright."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE THESE BOTTLES","review":"I absolutly hated these bottles they leak and they have too many pieces. The leaking is what drove me nuts. Dont waste your money on these I would recomend the playtex nursers they are awsome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS!!!!!!!!","review":"These bottles are totally worthless! They don't reduce spit up, colic or anything else the bottle claims to do. They leak like crazy. The flow is way to slow. The bottles are very time consuming to clean. I will stick to the Playtex drop-in bottles. They are the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"this is great if you have ample time to hand wash and boil these bottle parts. the inner pieces are a perfect breeding ground for germs and bacteria since it is so difficult to wash. also, we've had to change nipples constantly since the silicone is so thin and the hold widens quickly with use. the instrux also indicate that you should not boil it for more than 3 mins or it can damage the nipple??!! it also does not indicate that you can boil numerous times- -since it states that you shouldn't boil it past 3 mins, i'm assuming that you aren't supposed to boil it more than once or else the silicone will disintegrate?! the unfortunate thing is that my baby is so used to this bottle system, i'm stuck using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate these bottles","review":"If I could rate it a zero, I would. These bottles are a gimmick. When the baby sucks on the bottle, the air he releases into the bottle goes through the brown insert and up through the blue pipe. That's why you can't see the air bubbles. It actually makes air stay in the nipple longer causing the baby to suck more air if the nipple and ring haven't been screwed on well because the air gets trapped. This in turn makes for a frustrated baby because he is sucking and can't get milk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottle","review":"I did a lot of research online for bottles with our 2nd child. I wanted to see what was new and different since my 1st child. I read the reviews on this highly acclaimed product, and I must say I am pleasantly pleased. My child spit up quite a bit and had an awful time with gas, but after switching to Dr Johns the spitting up has diminished. Although, he still does have a problem with gas. The washing of the bottles was cumbersome at first, but you get down to a routine after the first couple of days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too fast","review":"We were having problems with spit-up/reflux and gas with my 1-month old, so I researched bottles and found these. I was very hopeful after reading all the reviews, but the very first time we tried to use them, my son projectile vomited everything I had just fed him. He had taken the formula entirely too fast. I kept trying, but we had the same results each time. The nipple was allowing him to empty the bottle too quickly - and it was a Stage 1 newborn nipple! We have since gone back to the Playtex nurser and are having better luck. (I also switched to a formula for reflux) I am planning on trying these bottles when he gets a little older - he may be able to handle the quick flow then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottles!","review":"I have used these bottles since my second daughter was born (she is now 7 months). I decided to try them because my first daughter had difficulty with gas and I went through a ton of different bottles trying to find some that would relieve her gas and tummy aches. I wanted to try and avoid the same situation with baby #2 and these are WONDERFUL, especially for the first 2 months when the baby is most prone to gas. I usually put mine in the dishwasher but if I hand wash them, the extra few seconds it takes to disassemble the bottle to wash is well worth it to have a happy baby. There is a mini-brush that comes with the bottles to wash out the bottle tube and top which makes the cleaning that much easier. These are the best bottles I have ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scientifically Designed to Take Away Your Money","review":"Thank heaven we didn't pay for these! They were a gift from my brother-in-law, who was taken in by the wild claims that they would reduce gas and reflux. According to our pediatrician, nothing will reduce gas and reflux except getting older, and, unsurprisingly, these bottles work about the same as the el-cheapo Gerbers we bought for the formula supplements. The only advantage I can see is all the extra parts I get to wash--keeps me busy anyway.The only reason we keep using them is because they fit the orthondotic nipples we're using while the Avents (recommended by the hospital) don't, and hey--they were free. We haven't have the problem with leaking that so many reviewers mention, but my wife and I both play string instruments. With the resulting grips of steel we can twist the little caps on within an inch of their lives.My recommendation? Spend the money on a safe car seat and buy the cheap bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"This a bad bottles","review":"I hated these bottles. There are too many parts to clean for starters and they leak. You can't make-up your formula in the bottle because you can't shake these bottles. They leask all over your baby if you do. I hated them so much I throw them out and bought much cheaper evenflo ones. The work much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"nipple made her gage","review":"maybe it was just my daughter, who went months being force fed, (I tried every bottle made praying for a solution,) but The DR. brown bottles just made her gag and through up any thing that I had forced in to her. the thing that worked the best for me were the platex nurser bottles. That is my recomondation for any one whos baby is tough to feed. (later after going through early intervention for a feeding aversion) i switched to gerber regular bottles they are great for an older baby. I think that the dr. brown bottles are the worst bottles I tried though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly Not What They're Cracked Up To Be!","review":"After reading the many reviews and info on these bottles and giving birth to a colicky baby, I purchased TWO packs of these bottles (all different style/size nipples & bottle types). When she was a newborn they seemed way to fast.....I put them away for a month and they got them out again.....these things LEAK like there is no tomorrow! My baby is soaked after she tries to eat with one of these and they get the diaper bag, fridge--pretty much anywhere you put them--soaked in milk! I called the company and they said don't overfill (I don't), don't heat w/ parts in bottle (we don't), and don't shake with liquid (don't do that either--geez these bottles have a lot of rules!)and THEY STILL LEAK. The Gerbers that we got free at the hospital with their disposable nipples work much better. I wouldn't recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Increase in spittting up!","review":"My son seems to be a little gassy so I gave these bottles a try.

I am sorry I spent the money on these!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so gr ea t","review":"My triplets seem to have different feeding problems: spitting up and GAS mostly.

In addition, Dr. B bottles have more parts to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Mess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I really have no idea if these bottles help with spitting up problems since I wasn't able to use them long enough. No matter what I tried the bottles leak all over the place even while your feeding your child. Also, you can't even shake the bottles or the filter system will get clogged. What a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Go With the Flow...","review":"I tried the Dr. Brown system but was unsatisfied for several reasons. First of all, the bottles flowed too fast causing my son to choke and gag with every couple of swallows. Not surprisingly, this led to terrible gas and spitting up every time we fed.Secondly, I think these bottles are overpriced. Even if they had worked for me, I would have been hard pressed to spend all that extra money. Bottle feeding is not rocket science and no mother should have to pay that much to feed her child successfully.Finally, although the wide-neck bottles may be a little easier to clean, they also come with more parts than standard bottles, so it all evens out anyway. Additionally, I found the big Dr. Brown's bottles (8-9 oz size) to be very cumbersome, especially when storing them in the fridge or in a diaper bag.Every baby is different and you've got to pick the system that works best for the both of you. For our particular situation, Dr. Brown's was not the answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advertisied too good to be ture....","review":"I bought these Dr. Browns Bottles before I gave birth. I thought this would be a very good idea; however, I was totally wrong. I had try several different kind of bottles, no matter what brand or how expensive they are, my baby still got gas.Besides, washing these Dr. Browns bottle is a very time consuming job for a new mom. You have to take every pieces apart to wash, that's too much for a tired new mom. Plus this is not cheap! I don't care if it's expensive or not as long as it works, but these just don't work as advertisied!

They are a pain and not worth the extra money at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot Complain!","review":"After much research for the best bottle out there it appeared that Dr. Brown's would be it. So I bought the wide-neck ones (since they are suppose to be better for switching between breast and bottle) and have to say that I made the right choice. I have had no problems with using this bottle, not even with leaks, which seems to be a big problem with many brands.My baby does not spit-up or gas-up with this bottle. And never had any nipple confusion switching between breast and bottle since she began at three weeks old. Mind you, this was a big concern for me since I wanted to continue breastfeeding once I returned to work. And, not to mention, I wanted other family members be able to enjoy feeding the little one too.Bottom line...baby and I are both very happy. I highly recommend Dr. Brown's bottles. Yeah, they cost a little more and require a few moments more of cleaning time. But neither was an issue with me as I wanted the best for my baby, which I am sure you do too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank goodness for these bottles","review":"My son not only has acid reflux, but he is also allergic to the milk protein.

I read a review on this site about the leaking and to run your finger around the base of the nipple when putting it into the bottle, and that was VERY helpful. I haven't had any leaking since then. My son doesn't swallow any air bubbles, and is eating well thanks to these bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Browns have helped","review":"These bottles are my overall preference my daughter will not take any other kind without dispute.

Then yesterday I used it to puree some vegetable soup. The bowl was just over half full and as soon as I turned it on the Cuisinart started leaking. I stopped it, removed the lid, cleaned it, and locked the lid on. As the lid locked on I noticed that the bowl bowed out on one side, causing the leak.

The only complaint I have is that the part that pushes down the food (not the white insert for it but the whole plastic half-moon shaped piece) doesn't detach from the chute. I can get it off the lid but not apart from the chute. This makes that particular part difficult to clean. Otherwise, I'm very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I'm a 21 year-old college student that loves to cook. For Christmas my Grandma got me this food processor so I could further my cooking skills. This was a fantastic gift.It came in the mail yesterday and I immediatley set it up and made a fresh pesto sauce. I was amazed how quickly the machine was able to dice everything so perfectly. I was also amazed at how quiet it is, which was something I really wanted. The 7 cup work bowl is great is like to cook for more than one person or like to make enough for leftovers. The machine also takes up little counter space.At $99 it's a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Efficient","review":"Good product. Well made. It takes a little time initially to understand how it works. Once I got how it is put together and how it works, it rapidly got the job done. Great for preparing for a family or guests. Not so much for a single person because of the time it takes to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful product!","review":"My wife complained of our previous processor due to its small size, so I figured this 7 cup model upgrade was in order. I wouldn't necessarily say it's used often, but when it is, we are more than happy with the processor. We frequently make salsa using this device and find that it does a great job. All contents are chopped to desired effect and takes little time doing so. My only concern is that after lifting the container, it sometimes leaks on the base. Also, when contents are poured into another container, the blade tends to dump drop in as well. However, these are very minor issues that can easily be be remedied. I would certainly recommend this processor."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for baby food","review":"I take cooked foods or raw soft foods, put them in , and baby food done. I only make a couple of portions of baby food at a time. The container of the processor is not filled to the top or anything.This works well for that function. He enjoys semi chunky foods now, so i am not making it a soupy watery texture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Option","review":"Most of my use for this product is to make my own baby food, for which it has been great! My only complaint is that I wish the storage tray for the blades was not an additional cost...with how sharp the blades are, I feel it should be included. However, it works great, and I feel it is the best value for this size processor out there! I couldn't find one with higher reviews with this many included pieces. It was also a great price, comparatively speaking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplfy your life","review":"The Cusininart Food Processor arrived with good instrucions on how to use the unit.

From doing some other shopping around, we expected to spend around $200. From the time it arrived, the processor has been used at least once daily. The use and care booklet provided more than enough info to get great results from the get go. The video got tossed, so cannot comment on its value. We highly recommend this, especially at the $99 price."},{"rating":"2","title":"a solid workhorse","review":"I tend to put a lot of stress on my kitchen and all my tools and gadgets. This food processor is no exception.I brewed up a six gallon batch of carrot wine this weekend that required me to slice up 25 pounds of carrots. I've done this work before by hand (hours of drudgery!) and with mandolin (better than a knife, but still awful) and other food processors. I raced through an incredibly large bag of carrots in short order.I've pureed soups, made hummus, and shredded vegetables with this food processor, and I couldn't be happier with the results.I've seen some reviews that had concern with the fragility of a one of the snap pieces- I'm bit concerned about it myself, but so far (knock of wood!) no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart DLC-10S Pro Classic 7-Cup Food Processor, White","review":"This cuisinart food processor is just the right size for two people.

This is a great machine that I now find I am using daily for blending, chopping, mixing etc. I find the motor very strong and the machine itself very sturdy. So far I haven't found anything beyond it's capabilities.

They made quality products. I purchased this Cuisinart and immediately noticed that the motor does not have the strength or precision that the prior Cuisinart had. I realized that Cuisinart was purchased by Conair Corporation and Conair has ruined the product through cheap production methods. You can break the unit simply by making a thick dough. I would avoid Cuisinart products as they are cheaply made in China and are no longer a useful tool for a serious chef. Also, their customer service is lacking at the corporate level. I have only had my Cuisinart for 3 years and already it is experiencing serious technical issues with the motor. Buyer Beware. I would shop other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality - easy operations","review":"Though it may be very early to say anything but till now we found this Processor very good. Just for information - This can do both Food processing and Blending (We used it for slicing, shredding, blending and it worked perfectly).

I highly recommend this product :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this product","review":"My husband gave me this food processor. Easy to use, and easy to maintain. I use this almost everyday.

But it is no problem to use, so I'm OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"One month experience","review":"I have this processor about a month and I enjoy making different salads for my family of three. The 7-cup size is good even for more people; assemble and disassemble process quiet easy; no problem with washing it afterward even by hands in the sink. So far I did not brake any part of it but once I accidentally dropped plastic cup and the lid on the floor and realized how fragile is the machine. My advise to the producer to make the plastic parts of it more rigid - thicker and stronger. You have to be very delicate using the machine and it's not always possible when you cutting and chopping in the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally replaced my old one","review":"This works as well or better than the one I purchased about 20 years ago.

I almost never use it. If you're not a complete idiot and can resist the temptation to stick your fingers into a spinning metal blade, look elsewhere. Unfortunately, I can see how this device would be of great use if it didn't take longer to clean than it would in almost any circumstance to just chop by hand with a knife. At least, until lawyers start designing knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's okay","review":"I thought I absolutely HAD to have one of these. Did a few days of reviews, and decided on this particular model, which I still think was a good decision. Regardless, I've only used it one time, and that was to crumble pretzels for a raspberry dessert. It did a good job of crumbling, but the inside surface of the container became marred and cloudy. I guess the pretzels were too crunchy. My own fault?I was disappointed that the video presentation that was included in the box is on VHS cassette, rather than on DVD.

I wondered what owning one would be like since I make a lot of soups and healthy meals. Suprizingly it was easy to put together and learn to use. I just love this machine. It is fairly simple but amazing with what it can do. Having plastic parts dishwasher proof is great for me. I moved things around in the kitchen cupboard so that I could keep it where I may need it. It is a fantastic buy for the money and I am so glad I purchased the 7 cup capacity. Thank you and for whomever is reviewing I strongly suggest buying it at Amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have had this food processor for over a year and have rarely used it because it frustrates me every time I try. If I use more than the regular bowl and lid I have to struggle to get it all put together properly. That doesn't even take into account the difficulty in cleaning the parts. Tonight I attempted to grate some fresh cranberries for a salad and discovered that the attachment will no longer engage the safety feature and the processor would not turn on. In attempting to trouble shoot the problem I discovered that he regular cover engages the safety just fine. I haven't used the grater/slicer more than twice and to say I'm disappointed is putting it mildly. I'll use the regular bowl/lid until the thing dies but don't really expect it to take all that long given the fact that a major part of the device has already failed. I bought this brand because I'd heard good things, I won't purchase from this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Food Processor","review":"I have had this product for 2 years and I use it almost every day. This is the best food processor I've ever used. I mostly use the chopping blade and it does a great job chopping onions, garlic, carrots, celery, hot peppers, kale, etc. I also use it to make peanut butter and it does a great job. It is solid on the counter and doesn't wobble or walk, even with peanut butter. It is easy to clean and does well in the top rack of the dishwasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible food processor and even worse customer service!","review":"I received this food processor as a wedding gift and was SO excited because I LOVE to cook.

I hoped that this would be much better due to the cost. It isn't. The blade is too close to the bottom of the container, not allowing food to get in the right position for chopping. So, often, what I'm making (if not liquid in nature) ends up just riding around on top of the blades. I find that I use my blender more often than the processor. The shredding/dicing blades are also not as effective as anticipated. Items seem to become trapped between the lid and the blade with frequency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart DLB-10S Pro Classic","review":"I have only used this once but it did exactly what I got it for, to chop up meat. The only thing that I did not think was explained very good was how to get the smaller tube out. After doing a search on google, I found a place that showed how to get it out. Once you know, it is very easy. I think this needs a better explanation in the booklet. I will be using this again in about a week to chop up more meat. I use it to chop up meat for my dogs and then I freeze what I am not using. Works perfect, better than a meat grinder that seems to stop up too often for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downsizing without losing quality.","review":"So I am the proverbial empty nester, and my husband and I simply don't need a large food processor most days.

It arrived mildly damaged to begin with. The outer clear plastic is easily scraped and scratched. It doesn't pop for very long each time. The button for it is front, near the bottom.

They're big enough to hold several servings of pasta. The best part is that they clean up easily since the handles are attached as smooth welds. I've had other pasta sets with rivets that made it difficult to remove all the starch. These two clean up with a quick wash. One puzzlement is that the instructions said that the pot heats quickly so use med-hi heat, but my observation is that it doesn't heat all the quickly on an electric range. Using high heat did mar the interior finish on the pot though, so I'd recommend limiting heat to med-high."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Pasta Lover's must-have","review":"This is the ultimate set you should get if you eat pasta at least once a week.I was fed up with pouring the cooked pasta with boiling water to the colander and always get burned on my wrist by the hot steam. This set work like a dream. The stainless steel is beautiful, and it heat evenly. The only thing is that it doesn't heat up that fast as described. I guess with a 7 quart pot it takes time to boil that much of water anyway.

However, they need a leading lady. Well Ted and the director decide that if Bill should run across the right girl, sign her. So Bill sets off to Paris, and Ted for London. Well Bill discovers a girl(Mitzy Gaynor) not knowing that Ted found and signed a girl in Paris (Jeanmaire).When the two find out it is total chaos, especially trying to keep the two girls from finding out about eachother on the way home. All the while trying to get the other to tell their girl to leave. Things seem to be going fine, until the two men begin to fall in love with eachothers leading lady!The movie has GREAT Porter songs De Lovely, Anything Goes, Second Hand Turban, Blow Gabe Blow, I get a kick out of you, You're the Top, and a fabulous tap number with Donald: You Can Bounce Right Back. Phil Harris also stars in this fantastic, De Lovely movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the stage version and NOT pure Cole Porter","review":"While the story may be entertaining in its own right, and ANY chance to see Donald O'Conner dance is worth it, this can be a very disappointing film to Porter buffs. The plot has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does take place on a ship. The story line is totally different and therefore some of Porter's original songs have been taken out and replaced by songs of Sammy Cahn and James Van Huesen which do not live up to Porter's quality.The best examples I can give is the fact that there is no Evangelist so the title song \\"Anything Goes\\" turns into a second act number, sung by Mitzi and chorus (with horrific word changes) and \\"Blow Gabriel Blow\\" becomes a finale in the broadway show (sung by the four main characters) that comes at the end of the picture and has nothing to do with any character or plot line.If you haven't seen it on stage it's pleasant enough, but if you're expecting the broadway show it's a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor choice of script","review":"this musical comedy has been performed in numerous forms with numerous casts, this is not a good combination of the assets."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Anything Goes\\" DVD review","review":"The DVD was is good shape. I'm satisfied with the disk. The story is kind of poor though. I bought this disk to see the story, because I'm going to play in the pit for a high school production of this story. As it turns out, the story that made it to the screen is less rich than the stage production - not as many songs, which is strange considering that it's a Bing Crosby movie. Oh well, we're in production now & I have a Broadway cast recording I can listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Expectations","review":"Donald O'Connor was great in Singing in the Rain. Der Bingle. Mitzi Gaynor. A Cole Porter score. P.G. Wodehouse on the script. How can anything go wrong? The arrangements were too dull for a memorial service. O'Connor and Gaynor danced on the deck of a cruise ship, but they tried to copy Astaire and Rogers and failed. And the love scenes? They missed the part in the script where the protagonists interact in a way that is a prelude to romance. They are suddenly just in love. Then the two females get headaches, but they weren't the only ones. Don't try to make sense of this one. It is simply a footnote in movie history to show how and why musicals disappeared from production schedules by the 1960s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything Goes","review":"The music was pleasing, we enjoyed Donald O'Connor and his acting with the ladies in the film. The dark haired lady in the film did not fit the film. Bing Crosby looked bored throughout the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Original","review":"Anyone looking for a movie capturing the original Broadway hit Anything Goes (or any of its on or off-Broadway revivals) will be very disappointed with this DVD. The plot has been totally convoluted and looks nothing like the original and a number of the great hit songs are now by Bing Crosby, not leading actresses. Not nearly as funny as the original. And the set and dance choreography is all 1950s. Basically, everything has been redone to capture the feel of another White Christmas production with Bing Crosby in the lead. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Stuck to the Stage Play","review":"Anything Goes is a fabulous musical from the stage of the 1930s containing show girls, gangsters, and romance. However, this film version has very little of the above and therefore has only mild entertainment value.Bing Crosby and Donald O'Connor play stage stars, both enjoyable in their own right. They need a female lead for the show, so they split up in search of one. Crosby digs up Mitzi Gaynor and O'Connor finds Zizi Jeanmaire, neither of them expecting the other to find a girl. Herein lies the problem. Both girls believe they will be starring in the show. Steps are taken to let one of the girls down easily, but both men fall in love with the other man's choice of a star.With songs from the original musical peppered throughout, the songs lose their meaning in a different context. The choreography is uninspiring and that singing is not all that great despite the major names featured. This one is a real bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they completely rewrite the original story?","review":"I rented this movie and thought I was seeing a movie version of the original broadway musical. I did not like the movie because the story was weak and silly. Then yesterday I saw the original version at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, SC. I found out that the movie version is a totally different story. The broadway version is exciting and while the story is still not great, it is far superior to the nonsense of the movie. Unless you have to own this movie, I would rent it first.On the plus side is the superior singing of Donald O'Connor, a truly outstanding voice in great form. Mitzi Gaynor also does well and looks great. Bing Crosby is a little past his prime, although still quite good.Normally I can watch great musicals over and over but I finished with this one. I have to thank Winthrop for letting me see the original in what was a truly outstanding production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful film, fabulous talent!","review":"I was so thrilled to find this version of this classic musical, but it was not what I expected.

It reminded me that while writers may be able to do something I can't, or at least not very well, and seem to belong up their on their ivory pedestals, they're still human like me. So, before I loved the writing, now I can love them as well.Good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK at best","review":"The reason I've given this 2 stars is because of how terrible the sound quality is. She is OBVIOUSLY singing VERY VERY well, and her voice is PERFECT, but it's so hard to hear her and at some points you can't!The songs and song choices are good, but this simply isn't just worth the money. It's sad that I was so excited for this and spent so much money for it and ended up being SEVERELY disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I must preface this by saying I am one of the biggest Whitney fans out there. Prior to her drug addiction days, Whitney always sang perfectly and no one (including Mariah Carey and Aretha Franklin) could compare to her.Nonetheless, I am still disappointed by this concert. Whitney's microphone is turned on too low compared to the rest of the music. The overall effect is that her voice barely seeps through the music.This is particularly disappointing because it's clear that Whitney did sing very well in this performance. Indeed, her rendition of \\"A song for you\\" where the backgroup music is softer shows how spectactular her vocal abilities were. Unfortunately, the rest of the songs are marred by the overbearing background music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating woman!","review":"I purchased this book after touring the Schonbrunn Palace outside Vienna, the former Habsburg summer residence.

Sure the type is small and a bit hard to read. But there are only significant ammounts of type on the first twenty pages. The majority of the remaining 268 pages contain mostly images.

If you want a matched set, see them before you buy them (at a Lamps Plus showroom) if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"For $400 (plus $60 shipping) this lamp should have been much better quality. I found it to be the usual \\"Made in China\\" level craftsmanship. The joinery (fit-up of the wood parts) was poor, and the finish was not uniform.

Obviously the shipping people at Lamps Plus are unconscious when they send out products that are damaged.

It was not until after the first 150 pages that I first learned something. This is clearly writen as a marketing piece for the authors. And, when you do go to the website where various additional promised information is supposed to be, it is not there.That is not to say that I did not learn anything, I did.

This is utterly *ridiculous* for a phone branded with the Walkman label. What's worse Sony Ericsson appears to acknowledge in support requests that there is a problem, yet will not fix it because the hissing was introduced when they fixed (via a firmware update) a sonic distortion problem when volume is cranked up.So, everyone who listens at a normal volume level is out of luck while people who are piercing their ear drums at least do it in crystal-clear audio. Nice. This is a firmware issue that SE refuses to fix, at least for now.SE had a real chance hear to create a killer product. It does a lot of thing really well.

You can put freezer packs in both the top and the bottom parts ... the bottom part can hold 2 20 ounce bottles and a couple of Large Apples ... the top part can hold 5 or 6 ziplock bags of Meat and Vegetables ...It is perfect for holding everything you could want, with room to spare ....I typically take 2 Green / Red Peppers, a Cucumber, 8 oz Chicken Breast, and 2 Apples ... easily holds all of the above in the top half ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"My hubby loves this bag. He has to pack at least 2 meals plus snacks every day and this holds everything he needs. I like the two compartments because I can put more fragile things in the top and sturdy items like soda cans and plastic containers in the bottom.

The zipped mesh pocket in front is much too small to hold anything with any real bulk (like a cell phone)and is hard to get in to.

I've been packing the lower portion of the bag with his lunch items (roomy enough for 2 large containers of most any meal size, several of the moderate sized ones). I place a 12 oz gatorade bottle of frozen water in the bottom, which if not drank, still comes home at the end of 12 hours with ice in. Dual purposer here, to keep cold items cold and provide a cool drink later in the day. In the upper half I put in two 32 oz bottles of gatorade (chilled) he claims they stay fairly cool all day, along with a napkin and utensils. The lunch box is very attractive and looks more like a portable tool kit rather than a lunch bag. By far the best lunch box he has ever had!

A great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and silly","review":"This is the silliest album I've ever heard. I was a fan of Yngwie's up until about the time of the Fire & Ice album. At that point, I discovered Yngwie is never going to progress past playing speed solos with no thought to the choice of notes. He pretty much butchers the intent of these songs.If you want *musical* chops, listen to Allan Holdsworth or Eric Johnson. I guarantee that if Yngwie is still making CDs in 10 years, it will be the same pointless speed solos...with the same 3 or 4 \\"licks\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Yngwie Sound","review":"If I was rating the guitar solos alone, I probably gave it a 4.

Yngwie Malmsteen really chose great classics of rock to put in this kind of tribute album. He called great musicians who worked with him in the past (Joe Lynn Tunrer, Jeff Scott Soto, etc.) With good production also guaranteed, he went on into the recording. But he destroyed the songs filling they with endless, fast and boring solos all the way, from beginning to end!!! Why do that?

All of the arrangements are excellent. I truly could not think of anything wrong with this CD. All of the songs are classics, and showcase perfectly Yngwie's bravura style. The vocalists he chose are especially talented to sings those particular songs.

Being a big Deep Purple and Rainbow fan; this album is musically superb. Gates of Babylon, Mistreated, and Child in Time are excellently arranged. The song that impressed me the most was In the Dead of Night which I had never heard before. The line-up of various Malmsteen musicians who are very talented makes this a worthwhile treat.

We now have a professional gas cooktop with very large burners. As a result, we get burning along the sides of the pots.The base of each unit has a thick copper core that promotes even heating.

The hollow handles look like they would stay cool, but in fact they get blazingly hot. If you want to use it for everyday, any kids in the kitchen must be warned. It is fairly lightweight and so food tends to burn, even if the heat is low. Not what you would expect, for the money. The stockpot is fine for boiling water in which to cook pasta (for example) but for simmering, a heavier pot would be more suitable. Not a particularly good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love My Pots!","review":"I don't even remember how long ago I bought this cookware. My first set was a Farberware which fell apart after a few years- all I have left from it is a handleless stockpot. When I bought this cookware I could finally make unburnt puddings and sauces. I love the handles- the only time they get hot is if I put the pot on a too big burner and the heat from the burner gets on the handles. I love being able to brown a roast, slap a lid on the pot, put the whole thing in the oven , and then save the leftovers in it in the refrigerator.Of course, I'll stick it in the dishwasher when I'm through. The only damage they have suffered, is a ding in the lid when I dropped it. My daughter in law, knowing my frugality, was shocked when she saw these pots in the store. She called to make sure I had really spent that much. And they are worth every penny! I bought her a set (she hasn't complained) and plan to get one for my prospective daughter in law as well.

I bought this as a replacement (when I could have just purchased new bowl & locking cover for the old ones) thinking it was time for a change. BIG mistake.-The so-called wide feed tube must have a narrower feed tube inserted for the machine to actually turn on -- and it is very tricky to get the feed tube in place and out. So not really a wide feed in practice, when you need it.-It takes real strength: much too much, kind of like wrestling -- to get the lid off after use.-It took a few tries to understand how to turn it on at all: there is a small white plastic lock mechanism in the narrow, inner feed tube that must be pushed to the left to lock and right to open.The whole thing is very unappealing to use, in short.

For example the cord is short and light weight. The bowl is actually smaller...11 cups is really an exaggeration. The motor is 5.2 amps compared with the 6 amps of the DLC-7 and the DLC-8S is lighter. The deciding flaw however is the poorly designed switching arms on the feed tube. They are flimsy and an accident begging to happen. I am going to have my old machine repaired and look at the Kitchen Aid processors. Very sad to lose an outstanding product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad end to a noble name","review":"Cuisinart is practically synonymous with food processor. When the French were manufacturing them years ago, you couldn't touch another blender, processor or kitchen appliance that would do more. But the manufacturer changed, and so did the Cuisinart.My cuisinart bowl cracked at the base. To their credit, they did replace the bowls. Now the knives, the most critical part of the food processor, are no longer the same.In addition, if you do heavy breads (we like to do rye) you will find that the stem can overheat and the bowl can stick on it for a bit (until you figure out how to get it off, not easy, let me tell you.) I once even had the plastic dough blade stick onto the stem.The bowl isn't so easy to clean, either. I give it three stars because it still slices and dices with the greatest skill, but overall, I would not buy one again.

But the number and the specs are.You can swamp the machine in too much liquid - I can process up to about four cups of fairly liquid stuff, but no more or I have an overflow to deal with.A dishwasher does a good job of cleaning the bowl and knife, and the knife has held its edge well. The bowl has a certain number of scratches after heavy use.I've hardly ever used the plastic blade - even for dough, I use the steel blade. I have a few shredding/slicing disks, which have seen a reasonable amount of use for large scale salads, turkey stuffing, and sauerkraut. (sp?)It doesn't dice.

I have owned this model for some years and just purchased the same model as a replacement. I did a lot of research, including checking out the new Cuisinart Elite line. I ultimately concluded that the Pro Custom best met my needs. The greatest feature is the additional, flat top. No other food processor out there seems to have one. If most of your processing is mixing or chopping, you don't need the large feed tube. The flat top takes up minimal room in the dishwasher and is a snap to clean by hand. In contrast, the Elite bowl(s) and lid took up most of the top shelf of my dishwasher, and even then it was a struggle to get them to fit. A number of reviews of that model also note that it is difficult to clean the gasket that seals the top, by hand or in the dishwasher.

I definitely see poorer quality in terms of the plastic bowls, feeding tube, etc. It is difficult to slide the bowl into locked position and also difficult to get it to release when you are done. The feeding tube top is very cheaply made and I am surprised that it has not snapped yet. It is also difficult to get the lids to slide into a locked position which, of course, is necessary in order to get the machine to turn on.

However, after daily use for my family of eight, it was beginning to wear out, so I purchased a new Pro Custom 11 cup DLC-8 Cuisinart this past month. I am absolutely shocked to find that the new appliance barely holds NINE--NOT ELEVEN-- cups! What is the deal? I need the larger size for many recipes, and am upset that if I return the new one, it is going to cost me approximately $20.00 in shipping fees. What-the-heck are my choices?

The bowl started cracking and crazing within a month. Eventually those parts weakened to the point that plastic pieces started breaking off. I had not kept the receipt as this model replaced a smaller Cuisinart that I inherited from my grandmother (product was 20 years old)that I was in love with. I, however, needed a larger bowl. I didn't think I would need the receipt. So I kept using the product since I couldn't return it. Yesterday, the plastic \\"pin\\" piece that locks the bowl in place broke in half.

I purchased one about 2 years ago, and even though I have used this one infrequently, usually just for grating cabbage for slaw or for making mayonnaise and aioli and only occasionally for slicing potatoes, the bowl is already cracked. The company that now makes Cuisinart is the old Ronco manufacturer. Apparently to bolster their corporate bottom line they have taken steps to cheapen the product and diminish its quality. And to add insult to injury, replacing the bowl, lid, chute and pusher--just the Lexan pieces--will cost you about $100, not significantly less than the cost of a whole new food processor. It's a shame, really, because I've read that the processors made by Kitchen Aide slosh liquids like oil and purees out of the bowl. So the bottom line seems to be that in the USA there are no high-quality, well-designed food processors being made. Kind of sucks, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety interlock is problematic","review":"I just donated my Cuisinart food processor to a charity after many years of fighting the safety interlock on it.

Last week I'd finally had it (I found myself using a small mallet to get the bowl on and off of the base and positioned over the safety lock), and ordered myself a 7 cup unit from Kitchenaid.

They don't care about or empathize with their victims at all. Many are actual or borderline sociopaths. But, Kevin Bacon portrays the minority. A pedophile who actually wants to change.During one scene where he is talking to a little girl in the woods, I actually found myself holding my breath and then breathing out \\"Don't do it. Don't do it.\\"Yes, this movie had me talking out loud to the main character.I guess my only real fault with the film was Bacon's new 'girlfriend'. As much as I felt for the character, there is no way in real life that I would knowingly consort with a pedophile.Overall:An excellent film with an astounding performance by Bacon."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCARY, TENSE DRAMA. KEVIN BACON'S BEST PERFORMANCE","review":"Kevin Bacon gives the performances of his career in THE WOODSMAN (Sony), a provocative drama about a convicted pedophile re-entering society. Bacon and his wife Kyra Sedgwick co-produced and co-star in the film adaptation of Stephen Fechter's disturbing play. The movie version never loses focus. For the entire film, I was in a state of growing tension, trapped between sympathy and repulsion. It was only during the end credits, with Patti LaBelle's extraordinary a capella rendition of \\"His Eye is on the Sparrow\\" that I felt relief, and possibly hope, for Walter, Bacon's unfortunate and unforgettable character. (And yes, the movie makes it clear that pedophiles cannot be \\"cured.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Many A Sore Bottom Finds A Sorer One to Kick","review":"Kevin Bacon plays a man who is trying to adjust to civilian life after twelve years in prison for molesting girls between 9 and 12 years old. Tough subject. Bacon gives a fine performance as a man trying to find his behavior as monstrous as society sees it. Tries, fails, tries again and perhaps succeeds when he finds a kind of co-traveller lurking around a schooyard across the street from his apartment and shows him less mercy than he did himself during recent stalking trips through a public park. His redemption comes through the kind of vengeful violence that he rightly fears (and to some extent, suffers) from others, but the darker implications of this redemption are unfortunately left unexplored. He even gets to move in with his new and very mature girlfriend, well played by Bacon's real-life wife, Kyra Sedgwick. In other words, a very Hollywood ending to a very un-Hollywood movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine acting","review":"Bacon makes us feel for a guy we don't want near us.

This is a tribute, I suppose, to the superb acting of Kevin Bacon as one sick and immensely troubled child molester. Kyra Sedgwick, Mos Def, and Eve all perform extraordinarily well and are all utterly convincing in their roles as well. The directing by Nicole Kassell was dead-on from start to finish. All of that being said, I found the film content and script so incredibly disconcerting that I could scarcely bare to finish the movie.That is, after all, a true testament to the cast at pulling off their roles such a disturbingly convincing manner.

It is nothing like you would think it would be considering the subject matter. Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick are fantastic. At their best. And , from what I understand, it was Kyra, Bacon's wife in real life, that really wanted to do the film and talked him into it. He deserved the oscar for his performance.

I was expecting to experience something profound, but the movie was fairly banal. I like Kevin Bacon a lot, and I'm very interested in the nature of pedophilia and its management (and sympathetic to pedophiles trying earnestly to manage their condition), but the storyline here is just lacking. There is very little emotional movement of any of the characters, so the movie is very flat. I was constantly waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever did. So maybe someone will argue that the movie is \\"realistic\\" and real life is pretty flat. Well sure, except that the movie is *not* realistic. When a 40 year-old guy is sitting alone on a bench in the park, a cute 11 year-old girl does not ever sit herself down next to him and say \\"how's the view\\". It doesn't happen.

However, the performances could not cover up the fact that almost nothing happened the entire movie. I was so bored I almost left the theatre, but just forced myself to finish because I already bought my ticket. I don't understand how watching Kevin Bacon pace around his room, and occasionally break down to his therapist and Kyra Sedwick over and over again can make up a two hour movie. That is really all that happened for three quarters of the movie, then an unfulfilling ending. I'm actually quite suprised so many people wrote all these great reviews about it, it was painfully boring and bleak. Don't see it if you're expecting a powerful, thought-provoking film like I did, you will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I like Kevin Bacon which is why I watched this movie.

Or maybe, the author thought it was a clever word he made up and decided to make the most of it. At times I told myself that if he uses that word again more than three times on one page, I would just have to lay it down and walk away. Maybe I just failed to recognize the significance or symbolism of Danlo's \\"membrum\\", but I really got tired of reading about it.

The plot ends before any big issues are settled except for the continuing inner journey of our hero. Our hero has more concern for the suffering of a tortured snow worm on an oiled hot plate than he does for the growing evil influence of his 'friend'.

It contains campy humor but it's not a fluff piece. It may have been produced in 1955 but it has stood time well, probably because it is set in the 19th century on a relatively obscure island. The puns and deliberate pace of the comedy are classic. There's a dark edge to the humor, but evil never really triumphs. The film takes the old adage--God works in mysterious ways--and gives it a nice stretch. Not to reveal the plot, let's just say it's a film about three tattered 'angels' attempting to flee Devil's Island penal colony who do a bit of good along the way. It is thankfully nothing like the gagging 1989 Penn, DeNiro fiasco.

A lot of the comedy movies have a few really funny scenes with a lot of empty space in between. But this movie has clever little humorous things spread throughout the movie. This movie gets funnier every time I see it because I notice more of the little things in the background that are hilarious. For example: when Jules is acting like a distinguished attourney, he is wearing a tie but no shirt. The plot is very entertaining and the characters are loveable (except, of course, for the villains). The movie has its touching moments as well, and the song is very enjoyable also.

The owner, mean Cousin Ardre (Rathbone), pays a surprise visit on Christmas Eve.Ustinov, Bogart, Ray and \\"Adolph\\" relate so beautifully with the other characters.

It stars Humphrey Bogart, Aldo Ray, and Peter Ustinov, as the convicts, they each did a great job of acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A holiday favorite at our house","review":"This classic features an outstanding cast and script that looks and feels more like a stage production than a movie. Audiences brought up on flash-bang special effects and sweeping visuals will likely become frustrated waiting for the action to kick-in.

I believe I am a sucker for a movie that happens in one or two days like this one. The comedy, plot, and acting are all great. It is a good Christmas movie for the whole family.The story is about escape cons who grow soft hearts when they try to rob a salt-of-the-earth family then kill them on Christmas Eve.

She shows astounding insight in her 13 versions of dis- and non-functional supervisors and self-diagnostics on how you might cope: change yourself (since the bosses won't change), lower your expectations, or simply leave. Though her case studies appear to cover more the commercial than government sectors, I have to agree with the first reviewer that she nails the descriptions. While she claims not to be diagnosing the reasons/pathologies for the bad boss behaviors, it takes very little inference from the reader to do just that. Since leaving a tenured professorship to go into government work, I have seen examples of -- and have been subject to -- every case she cites, even some compound versions, heaven help us.And my colleagues are thanking the Washington Post, who first brought this book to our attention.

Anyone familiar with the visual material of \\"Spies Like Us\\" will experience the well known \\"audio paint brush\\" effect of coupling music and image. What is lacking, however are the two strongest musical moments in the film, namely the title track by Paul McCartney and the mind-bending \\"Soul Finger\\" by The Bar-Kays. If these moments were to be found on this disc, the essance of the 'Spies Like Us' experience might remain a little more intact.

This album is Liga's first one, and has great songs that he still plays on his shows, truly classics, like Bambolina and Piccolla Stella Senza Cielo. Also, probably the most positive song ever, called Balliamo Sul Mondo (We dance over the world). It has so much energy. However, I have only given this Album 4 stars because of the rough, low sound, considering that is not such an old album (1990). A remaster wouldn't be a bad idea.

I bought the patio kit since the other kits would not fit these windows.I previously had bought a kit at a local hardware store for around the same price. Even trying to heat up the trim with a hair dryer I could not get the double sided tape to stick. The trim is painted, and I had cleaned it off. I had no troubles with the 3M tape, it stuck well, went on easy, the paper backing was easy to peel.Since it was in the garage I was not too careful when hanging the plastic and it had quite a bit of wrinkles in it. Once put to heat they all went away, can hardly see the plastic. Only reason for a 4 star is I wish they had more sizes available for \\"outdoor\\", since i did not use a lot of what this kit had.

Housekeeping has become one of my favorite movies of all time. The characters, played by Lahti and newcomers Andrea Burchill and Sara Walker, were so convincing as aunt and nieces that they make the story compelling and heartbreaking. Forsyth was very faithful to the spirit of the novel. I highly recommend the film to anyone who likes offbeat characters, beautiful location shots, and good old-fashioned story-telling. Then read the novel and it will enrich your viewing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet and haunting film, with the great Christine Lahti.","review":"One of my all time favorites, this is an underrated film about the deeply felt sensibilities of ordinary people. Christine Lahti brings her amazing talent for understated elegance and subtle strangeness to the role of the odd aunt to whom falls the care of orphaned girls, whose mother has driven her car into a lake--purposefully. It is heartbreakingly beautiful, charming, entrancing, subtly mysterious and absolutely engrossing. The film sweeps you off into a place you can scarcely imagine, captivates your senses completely. I find something new in it each time. To you, I highly recommend this film if you like purity of acting, with a gentle trip into the soul of the innocent. This is an amazingly subtle film to see, to remember, to cherish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the DVD???","review":"Great movie from a great book, why is this not available on DVD?

Yes, there are passages which really grab you with their insight and beauty, but there's also WAY too much ridiculously dated \\"go, man, go\\" hep-cat nonsense.

The use of the real names of the people behind the entire book is also very refreshing as opposed to the names used in the normal \\"On The Road.\\" Gives it more of a feel like a documentary of sorts to me. Admittedly, it is my first time reading any of Kerouac's work, but definitely a classic due to the language (wild at the time) and the \\"plot\\" since it was a radical thing during the 1950's with the subject matter.

I played as team dark first (Mainly because i think shadow is way cooler than sonic, and I love Rouge's attitude). Team Dark has the highest level of diffuculty. So it was kind of stupid playing as them first, because the other teams are pretty much the same levels, in the same order, just a whole lot easier (especially Team Rose...I hate Big).Anyways... what I'm trying to say is that i agree with the others in saying that it's replay value is really low (not including team chaotix). I love the team vs team battles though, especially when playing with a friend. I really loved the Team Dark VS. Team Caotix battle...You show them who's boss Rouge! =) The music is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE, especially \\"This Machine\\" (another reason Team Dark's my favorite). Anyways...

There are 4 teams of 3 characters each. Team Sonic has Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. Team Dark has Shadow, Rouge, and this new robot guy that was created/betrayed by Eggman called Omega. Team Rose has Amy, Cream and her chao friend Cheese, and Big the Cat. Another excellent thing as well. The people from Knuckles Chaotix returned. Team Chaotix contains Espio, Vector, and Charmy.

After about 3 months of intermittent use my new replacement stopped working completely. I contacted Cuisinart via email to request a replacement since it supposedly has a two year limited warranty. Initially, they told me the serial number indicated that it is out of warranty. When I sent them the purchase order as prove they admitted that it is still under warranty and that I should give them permission to process the replacement order with the understanding that I pay the $5 shipping and handling. So I did but no response came back from them. Thinking that maybe the first email did not go through I re-send another email and never heard back from them again. As the saying goes - They don't make them like they used to! And I might add they don't service customers like they used to either!

I shipped it to Cuisinart, paid for return shipping, and the thing did not run even once!

I agree with the reviewer who wrote they should be ashamed of putting their name on such a poor quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer!","review":"This unit burned out the VERY FIRST time I used it. Nor was I rough with it in any way. Unfortunately, the first time I used it was just past 30 days from my Amazon purchase, so Amazon.com won't take it back. From reading other reviews, I can see that this has happened to several other buyers. Evidently you pay $10 shipping on a $20 item to send it back to Cuisinart. Wish I'd read the reviews before buying -- this not-so-nifty little item is now in my trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply AWFUL","review":"So, I bought this AGES ago, for when my cheap-o mini-chopper died. It lasted several more years, and still would be fine, except the heat of the dishwasher finally made the plastic bowl give out. Last night I pulled this out of the closet where it's been and used it today. I chopped ONE banana in it. Scooped that out, and tried to put avocado in, and...the motor whirrs and the blades sit in place. It is a total waste of your money. Find something else. I wish I'd bought two of the little ones from CVS when I got the one now sitting in my trashcan (and it was hardly perfect). After a single use, I'm looking all over Amazon for something else to replace this one, which worked a whopping 5 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Stopped working first time I used it. I managed to chop 2 biscuits and then it stopped working. Blade wouldn't turn or did so very slowly. Had to repackage it and send it in for repair.

Made much more cheaply than older model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, and it shows","review":"This is a lesson in why cheap products are wasteful. This chopper is fine for the most part, but apparently the way it prevents being overloaded is by having the blade attachment \\"lock\\" to the motor shaft via a little bit of plastic that simply breaks if it's put under heavy load. This plastic is part of the motor shaft assembly and appears to be nonreplaceable.In other words, if you use the chopper incorrectly, it will simply break, permanently and irrevocably. And an otherwise perfectly serviceable chopper goes in the trash.What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart Mini Mate Chopper/Grinder","review":"I am very disappointed in Cuisinart.

Bought several due to wear from heavy usage, giving as gifts, etc. I lost the blade of the current one, and I thought of just replacing the entire unit. However, the one I just received - and promptly returned....:-( - has been made a lot worse by bad reengineering.

Well, hopefully I will be able to buy a replacement blade for my \\"old\\" unit !"},{"rating":"1","title":"cuisinart mini chopper","review":"Disappointing. I had one of these for years and used it almost everyday. When the motor finally gave out, I ordered a new one. When I use cottage cheese in it, it leaks out over the side.

It came, worked very well on the first try. When I removed the blade to wash it, I touched the blade (as I did many times before on the old one), and my finger began spurting blood copiously. There had been no warning about the sharpness of one (not both) of the blades, and the old blade had not been sharp at all (but still did not job well). After stemming the bleeding and bandaging it, the next day I saw that I had suffered a fairly deep cut. I believe that there should have been a warning in the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received","review":"I was very disappointed with the company, since this item was never delivered.

It's also tricky to fit the two pieces together to make it run."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chopper","review":"I purchased my first chopper at a yard sale years ago and was thrilled to find it still being manufactured. I ordered my second chopper and am so pleased with it. I use it for chopping small seeds such as chia, sesame, pumpkin and sunflower. It rapidly turns these into a fine, powdery meal. This works better than a blender because the blade sits close to the bottom of the container. I prefer this to a coffee grinder because the base and blade can be washed, which is necessary for oily or sticky projects. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The first one I ordered did not work so I returned it for a replacement. I have used this one, perhaps, 10 times.

I figured it would be better suited to grind spices and other items. After receiving it, I used it first to grind some coriander seeds (no problem), but as soon as I tried to grind up a mix of spices for Garam Masala, the thing stopped working. It simply could not handle the combination of spices (which is no different than grinding coffee and probably less taxing). I was careful not to run it for too long, but it just didn't spin at speed and then stopped working.I hope I can get my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until it died","review":"This product worked awesome and then after a few weeks it died.

Disappointed (and just past the warranty), I mentioned it to my sister who bought me the second for Xmas. I rarely used this one and sure enough, right after the warranty period it died. I was trying to chop almonds this time and it only created a fine powder of some, leaving huge chunks. Then it died, smoking. Also, this is VERY hard to get clean when you're making sauces and such; I don't think food safety is very good when you can't wash something in hot water and soap (the top comes in direct contact with food).

That's what this beautiful Russian film takes as its premise as it assaults the viewer with an overbearing father whose approach to parenting will outrage modern kinder/gentler parenting theory proponents. Although the point of view (from the perspective of the younger boy) encourages us to understand the film in psychological terms, those familiar with Russian Orthodoxy (a version of Catholicism) will recognize that the argument being made here is theological. The parallel between the film's assault on the viewer and the father's assault on his sons suggests a pious attempt on the part of the filmmaker to awaken modern, secular man to what the film argues is truly important."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than meets the eye","review":"Having heard in advance that the director is a devotee of Tarkovsky, I was expecting to be baffled, and was, at least in part. At first watching, the movie comes across as \\"National Lampoon's Siberian Vacation\\", but I don't think that was the intention! Some things I wish I had been told before seeing it... pay attention to the days of the week (there's evidently some sort of Passion of Christ symbolism going on).

Is this film about the tensions, pain, longing and love of a father for his sons, his sons for his father? Or, is it a mystery film about \\"what's in the box?\\" buried on a deserted island by a man we know nothing of, but wish we knew more of. And, just how does this mystery of this man, his past, his behavior, his actions, connect with the message of two boys who long to understand their father more?

If you're one of those people who hate \\"bad\\" endings, better skip it. I mean bad in the way you might be left hanging, wondering.... Hate that! The cinematography wasn't all that exciting, the landscape rather dreary, but I suppose most of Russia is that way. The boys did an outstanding acting job, that's about the one good thing about this movie. Makes ya kinda wonder about all those RAVE reviews.Two hours I can't get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviews on this movie. I have seen plenty of Russian films, and many of them have been slow and entirely reliant upon the emotional component. Mikhalkov, for example, is a director who can do this. This movie suffers from pretentious screenwriting, and a lack of underlying meaning or moral lesson. although the acting isn't necessarily bad, you don't get attached to the characters. I got the feeling that the cinematography and the colors didn't match the movie's theme and plot. At times it got so boring that i wanted to stop watching, even though i never do that. Anyway, I do not recommend this movie. IF you want to watch some good russian movies, go with \\"Brother\\", \\"Burnt By The Sun\\", \\"Prisoner of THe Mountains\\", \\"War\\", or \\"Unfinished Piece for the Mechanical Piano\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"Douglas Preston has not yet disappointed me with any of his novels, this one included.

Have fun and enjoy it.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Ideas, but","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I am a fan of Douglas Preston, and the book certainly was an easy read. Also, I enjoyed being exposed to new, thought-provoking ideas like the ones that form the spine of this story. So, if for no other reasons, I would recommend you read this book.However, that said, many parts of the book sharply recall to mind previous passages his other books (Relic, Thunderhead and Codex)that you just have to ignore. You cannot become invested in the characters, they draft too shallow. And a couple of the scenes are entirely too trite (\\"Don't just follow orders Sgt, think about what you are doing!\\")Bottom-line: if you are longing to read a new book, with some escapism and with some thought-provoking science behind it, this is your next order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this PM and just finished the book.","review":"Outstanding book because its believable and thoroughly entertaining! My first time with Douglas Preston. Picked it up on a whim at the bookstore today, then absolutely could not put it down. There are several interwoven plots and the actions, even the science, is believable. A fast easy read.If you like adventure books and want something to light up your brain for a while, then go for Tryannosaur Canyon.Thanks,Jim Burke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Crichton???","review":"Many reviewers compared this novel to Jurassic Park, saying it was a better book than Crichton's. What absurdity. I am not saying that JP is an awesome book, but it was far better than Tyrannosaur Canyon.Tyrannosaur Canyon is a fairly intriguing story, but poorly executed and VERY poorly ended. It's as though Preston suddenly realized that he was going to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put them in, and didn't know how to do it. The ending is too fast, too unlikely and too unrealistic.The book closes with a theistic comment by one of the characters, which I believe is Preston's way of attempting to belong to both camps, having his science AND being religious.Overall, I had high hopes for this book and I am sorry to say that in the last 100 pages, I was greatly let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, Light Reading","review":"This is my first Douglas Preston book, and I certainly wasn't expecting fine literature. I saw it on sale at half-price at the supermarket, and thought it might be a good adventure story in the Jurassic Park mold. Well, this story completely delivered in its ability to keep me reading it - it had a lot of adventure, some interesting dinosaur theories, and was kind of fun in that implausible, unrealistic way that adventure stories often have. I loved the book, maybe I loved it precisely because it was not very believable - I mean seriously, who keeps his word to a dying man (and a stranger, no less) when it could mean going to jail for the rest of your life or getting killed?The book was fast-paced, the characters wonderfully one-dimensional, in all, maybe it was a little hard to take seriously at times, but if I wanted to read literature, I'd stick to Dostoevsky. Tyrannosaur Canyon is a good, light, summer book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have spent more time on the science, and less on guns, hostages and 'black-ops'","review":"This book has been described as \\"Crichton Worthy\\". I cant recall a Michael Crichton book this dull. Readers would be well advised to skip through the unoriginal passages where the characters are getting kidnaped, or escaping from mines, or chasing people who have escaped from mines, or getting shot at every second paragraph,or getting chased by oh-so-secretive-and-unaccountable-government agencies (wow, how original...not). Suffice to say that the most original and interesting character in this book was the 65 million year old dead fossil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I actually liked the plot of this book but the writing style was terribly boring.

I am sorry but i have been reading books my whole life and it just seems that the caliber of writing and plotting has gotten worse over the years. This is not even an idea worthy of a story! If this were a movie i would demand my money back at the ticket office. Mr. Preston quit writing storys alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tyrannosaur Canyon moves at the speed of Fossilized bones!","review":"The story started well enough, with the mysterious discovery of blood red colored sand on the moon, and came back to Earth with the murder of a Dynosaur hunter who had found the remains of a Tyrannosouras Rex in the desert. The Story then sunk into complete boredom as Tom Broadbent from Codex attempts to find the daughter of the murdered man, and finds himself in the gunsights of the man's murderer, along with a host of other periferal characters unnecessary to this boring novel.I gave Codex five stars because it was at least interesting, and adventurous, this one I give two stars, because the author plods along, with all the many characters, and nothing interesting happens to them! At least not in the first half of the book!It's about as exciting as watching paint dry, or ice melt!Try Codex instead, or any one of James Rollins's books, if you like adventure stories with some action!"},{"rating":"1","title":"could not even read it...","review":"I was very excited to read this book at first after reading all of the Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston books but I only got a few pages in when this police officer started cussing and using God's name in vain. When will authors realize that Christians read books also? There are very few novels I can read let alone buy any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Churned out formula.","review":"Skipping over parts of this books isn't just easy it is necessary. The basic formula is that all the bad guys end up dead and all the good guys end up heroes. And the especially sad thing is that it is possible to tell the bad from the good in the first introduction of the character. While I like to use books to escape from reality I also expect a certain amount of realism in them. Please tell Mr. Preston that scientific research, peer review and publication takes much longer than 3 days to accomplish. This comes from an author once worked in a scientific environment and should know better. But Mr. Preston's most damning fault is that he has set up a line of sequels. If this is what to expect from future books then no thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm amazed","review":"This book has received some good reviews. That's what I'm amazed at. Wow. This was a pretty awful book and this is why I feel compelled to write. I was at the airport recently looking for something to read and came across this one. The jacket exclaimed Preston as good as Crichton. I thought, okay, I'll give it a try. I like an adventure story with science thrown in. I'm not giving anything away when I tell you that the science twist didn't appear until at least page 300 of this 400 pager. And that's generous. Crichton sets up the premise quickly, then keeps it coming. No one really has any business comparing this book to any of Crichton's works.If you enjoy implausible storylines, unrealistic characters, and bad dialog, by all means, pick this one up. Just because this is supposed to be an adventure story doesn't mean you throw out good writing. It's possible to have both. Don't settle for a \\"page turner\\" that is this poorly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-fi plot twist makes this very interesting.","review":"A book by Douglas Preston which follows after The Codex (a wonderful book!). We follow Thomas Broadbent thru another exciting and surprising adventure. It all starts out with a crazy old treasure hunter in the lost valleys of New Mexico. Of course there is a treasure map which falls into Thomas' hands when the crazy old guy dies. OK, by now you are saying, sounds stupid. Well, let's just say that the CIA becomes part of the story and there is a Sci-Fi twist in the plot. Sound better?Just finished listening to all 10 CDs of this unbridged book. Preston is now on my list of authors to keep an eye open for new materials. Great story, moves well, great descriptions and characters you really get to like. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot full of holes","review":"Did I miss something, or did this guy risk his life based on a promise to someone he just met? Too much irrational behavior to mention. I had to force myself to finish the book just to see how much more ridiculous it could get. The (paperback) cover refers to Michael Crichton three times, the praises inside, another three, and one reference to Stephen King. These are two good authors that I enjoy reading but this book was not even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyrant King","review":"Astronauts, rocketships, cowboys, Indians, hardened criminals, evil geniuses, goldmines, FBI, secret military ops, unmarked helicopters, alien life forms, dinosaurs, high-tech weaponry, high-tech science, kidnapping, murder, a threat to the entire human race, government conspiracies...sorry. Can't think of any reasons not to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Fast Read","review":"I have to admit I judged this book by its cover. The eerie title sucked me in, and I couldn't resist grabbing the book off the shelves.I love to read, but I always find the first few chapters of a book to be the hardest. Not this book. Within the first few pages, you have a murder and a HUGE mystery. The story is well-written and the characters are well-defined. There are a few unexpected surprises, but don't expect to be constantly shocked - the story is a bit predictable in some spots, but gratifying overall.My only wish is that a little more thought would have been put into the ending. The ending seems to drop off, leaving the reader wanting a bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Science Thriller","review":"Douglas Preston earns his place among our best thriller writers with this well-considered solo novel. There is mystery and adventure galore.If I have any complaint with Tyrannosaur Canyon, it's that portions of this novel read slowly. Twice there are even chase scenes that feel ponderous. I grew impatient with the heroes and the villains for not winning their battles one way or the other. Having said that, I enjoyed this novel and will be looking for more of his solo work.Four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unoriginal","review":"Douglas Preston is one of my favorite writers but he has really been slipping lately. Maybe its just me but i don't understand the excitement about finding dinosaur's skeleton. And there is actually a conspiracy and people get killed over that? Oh, please! I can also do without all the descriptions of the canyon and mesas. It seems like there is one every other page-one time would have been enough. I love suspense of his other novels but this one definately a lemon. If i started reading his books with this one, I wouldn't even try reading anything else. I think he is running out of ideas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, not spectacular, entry from Douglas Preston","review":"While, not as much of a page-turner as \\"The Codex\\", \\"Tyrannosaur Canyon\\" is a good read that will appeal to the fans of Preston and Child. Reuniting Tom And Sally Broadbent (from \\"The Codex\\") was a welcome decision for this reviewer. Both characters are well-drawn and interesting.The plot takes off when Tom stumbles upon a dying prospector who hands him a small notebook filled with coded figures. The prospector asked Tom to give the notebook to \\"Robbie\\". The next 300+ pages are filled with Tom's attempt to return the notebook while at the same time tying to solve the mystery left behind by the prospector.Spectacular scenery and interesting gadgets abound in this book. Preston even manages to mix in a little government conspiracy and a \\"black ops\\" group in the quick-moving plot.Through not necessarily a memorable novel, fans of the genre' and of Preston and Child will no doubt want to add \\"Tyrannosaur Canyon\\" to their \\"must read\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Novel","review":"Preston's latest solo outing is a solid action thriller with a minor scientific inclination. There are a lot of action scenes, a highly improbable villain, an equally improbable supporting hero who has all the believability of the tooth fairy, and some entertaining speculation about dinosaurs' origins and geneology. If you want depth, read John LeCarre or Frederick Forsythe.This book is for readers who want to be entertained. Enjoy it for what it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical aspects interesting; Character actions horrific","review":"Tyrannosaurus Canyon is pretty interesting at times. Preston evokes a fairly decent Michael Crichton imitation when it comes to the technical aspects of the story, dinosaur knowledge, etc.The problem is that the character motivations for their actions are absolutely absurd.Why did Tom go on this quest for someone he never met before?Why did Coirvais strike up a relationship with a crazy person in prison?Why did the monk stop being a monk to help Tom?Plus, every character was amazingly capable of walking hundreds of miles with like two Dixie cups filled with water in 110 degree heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read The Codex first!","review":"I have enjoyed all the books that Preston has co-authored, so I looked forward to reading this solo work of his. When I learned that this exciting adventure is the second in a series featuring Tom and Sally, I was thrilled, but a bit disappointed that this fact was not featured anywhere on the cover or in the back description of a book! This is definitely a standalone novel, but there were definite moments when I got that sense of missing something that had been in the previous book,The Codex. So while I would have preferred to read them in order, starting with this second book was still quite fun! Preston created a book with plenty of sympathetic characters, and an interesting (and unpredictable) plot. At least now there is no question of what I will read next - I just hope that this book did not give away too much of the plot ofThe Codex!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preston mailed it in and cashed easy paycheck","review":"The writing is clearly not as strong when Preston isn't paired with Child.

Lewis uses the experiences of four major companies - Motorola, Philips Consumer Electronics Company, Marks & Spencer and Chrysler - to show the benefits of creating an alliance with your suppliers. The book, which is thorough and complete, if a bit long-winded, explains the benefits of such customer-supplier alliances, shows how to get started if you want to form a partnership and spells out how to maintain the relationship. The obligatory tables and figures are conveniently listed right after the table of contents. If you are in a huge rush, you can skip the book and just read the tables, because you will probably get a condensed version of the same information. But we at getAbstract think you'll enjoy reading how these four companies fumbled through the awkward initial stages of customer-supplier alliances and then emerged into trend-setting, money-making success."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fine film","review":"Why this film is so reviled is a complete mystery to me. Its a very gritty and realistic view of the participation of some \\"ordinary\\" people in the American Revolution. Its production values are excellent and the acting is fine. What is particularly striking are the nearly identical story lines later used in the Patriot, a truly unintelligent and historically inaccurate film. But instead of the absurd distortions found in the Patriot, this seems to be a much better effort to give us a feel of what life was like in the 1770s. The conflicts faced my the heroine in dealing with her Loyalist family was particularly interesting to me. After reading all of the negative reviews, I watched it again. Perhaps the scarcity of American Revolution films led me to be too kind. But no. I still think its the best fictional treatment ever done on the subject and a fine film by any standard.

For Dobb, the war doesn't concern him, but he finds himself swept up in the events after his son foolishly enlists. Eventually they desert, but soon Dobb comes to realize the importance of the struggle, and becomes a willful participant. Yet in the end, his struggle and sacrifice is compensated with broken promises and a paltry wad of devalued specie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different style to a different time","review":"Well if you want a spectacle click on BEN HUR or the PATRIOT.

It shows the simple horrors of the battlefield as well. I don't know why it didn't do well in the movies, but I really like this movie. The kids enjoy it as well.

Weston La Barre's academic prose and insight trace the sect in its relationship to greater society, the culture (through psychoanalysis and comparative symbols), and the individual. The style is interesting and succinct as it traces the origins of the practice in 1909 to the phenomenon in crisis in the 1950's; the writing does not offer insight into contemporary snake-handling traditions and may seem dated. La Barre does not humnaize the practioners as does Covington in Salvation On Sand Mountain, but his insights and parallels to the snake as symbol are stimulating. Referring to the snake-handlers as a cult is problematic for their beleifs, aside from snake-handling and poison drinking, are in allignment with Christianity.

Now I appreciate it for being a decent film about a teacher trying hard as possible to make students depend on education. There's not too many familiar faces in this. Lou Diamond Phillips and Edward James Olmos are the only ones around you'd remember. This film stays true to the true-life of the teacher and unlike Lean on Me doesn't rely on fictious elements to make the story move. Stand and Deliver also doesn't spend the entire film showcasing the students and blaming the teachers for everyone's problems.

Though based on the real-life classroom success of teacher Jaime Escalante and the Latin-American students whom he led to new heights of academic achievement, the film is badly undercut by a surprising lack of conviction. The classroom scenes are tame and the interaction between Escalante and his supposedly hapless students lifeless. The alleged troubles of his students are painted in such broad strokes that they quickly disappear into the background, making the kids'eventual triumph seem trite and cinematically inevitable rather than inspiring. A tighter script and more imaginative direction would have made this a much better film. As it is, this is more of a light documentary than a movie, and pales next to similar films like \\"Lean on Me\\" and \\"The Blackboard Jungle.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling True Story","review":"I have nothing but praise for this inspirational true story of a determined teacher -- the Bolivian Jaime Escalante -- who pressed his students relentlessly to take their fate in their hands through one of the most difficult pathways imaginable for a high school senior -- the Advanced Placement exam IN CALCULUS.

The message is greatly inspirational and it's hard not to want to jump up and cheer at the end, but for anyone who's ever stood in front of a classroom there are some problems with real-world issues. First off it looks as if Olmos teaches only one class at school - what about his other classes? All the kids are eating out of his hands before long (they are able to keep their home/peer problems separate from school), and everyone succeeds at the end, even after they've all been accused of cheating and take the test again.

Does the NY Times pay its writers enough to do this and what were his fears of Canada's public schools? The public schools up here are decent so I sort of lost a bit of respect for his views after reading that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthony's Soul","review":"I looove this album! Anthony put his foot in this one. The music, the voice, the lyrics and trifecta! I'd recommend this album to ANYONE, whether you'r a r&b enthusiast, neo sould lover, or soul seeker! Even rockers and metal heads can take a listen to see what soul is all about. If you're a true lover of music you'll like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Man this is a classic, I mean his first project was exceptional and this is even better. The production, lyrics and collabo's impeccable. Love & War with Macy Gray is a jewel. Perfection is the most appropriate word for this CD. Absolute perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not moved","review":"I tried to like this CD. I went out and purchased it on the release date. I understand that this project is some of his unreleased music....I really am having a hard time adjusting to the lack of specialness I know that anthony can bring. The worst songs are with Sunshine Anderson who talk sings through the song and just tears my ears apart. Macey Gray sounds like a drunk two year old. I love the passion of Anthony and I love his voice and I know the third album will be better than this. PLEASE let it be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sucks!!!","review":"I am an Anthony Hamilton fan even though the review of this CD does not depict my loyalty. I was very disappointed with this release. I went straight out and bought this without listening to it before I bought it. That was definitely my bad. There is not a song on the CD that I like. I Cry started out OK but then it got on my nerves. Anthony Hamilton is a very talented brother. I know that on his next CD he will give us new material that is worthy of his gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"about a 2.5. if you combined this album with His 2nd","review":"Album coming where I'm coming from then you would have a serious Good Album.you hear things on here that have moments as did the Coming Album,but balance isn't in place as of yet.Anothony Hamilton hasn't even scratched the Musical Surface as to what he could Become with the right balance of songs,Music&Overall Presentation. I dig His Woodsy vibe.stay tunned. I don't really hear a stand out track on this set,but you hear a Promising Career coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proving He Belongs...","review":"Anthony Hamilton is quickly establishing himself as one of todays Great Artist thanks in Part to his sophomore album \\"SoulLife.\\"Tracks such as \\"Georgie Parker\\" \\"I Cry\\" is enough to make you fall in love with the vocal stylings of Mr. Hamilton if you haven't already. He later pays homage to Roy Ayers with his sound and arangement on the song \\"Last Night\\" which will be sure to be as big a hit as L. Hill and D'Angelo's \\"Nothing even Matters\\"This album does nothing but pick up from where the last one left off. You will not be disappointed if you werent dissapointed with the first one. Very Good Production, vocal arrangements and compositions. Sure to make it to your \\"A\\" rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"These don't sound like demos!","review":"I was reading somewhere that this album is full of material from a demo that Anthony cut prior to releasing \\"Comin from where I'm from\\". Believe it or not, I like these tunes better! Don't misunderstand me, I was impressed by his debut album as I have it as well as Soulife however; he \\"cut a rug\\" on this piece. I really like it a lot especially the cut with Macy Gray, and the tune \\"Georgie Parker\\". Good work, and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOUL-FULL","review":"This is like a bonus CD from his \\"Comin' From Where I'm From\\" CD. This cat's voice is just gravy and grits! Love it! \\"Georgie Parker\\" is a gem. \\"I Cry\\" takes you back to the doo-wop days. \\"I Used to Love Someone\\" is real smooth. \\"Exclusively\\" feels like a collabo with Cee-Lo and Dre 3grand, real eclectic. Even the strange voice of Macy Gray sounds a bit better as she duets wtih him on \\"Love And War\\" (Imagine that). Think of this as like a thick EP. Get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish there was \\"More Than This\\"","review":"I bought this primarily for the Elbow Mix. For those who own PG's Growing Up Live DVD, the Elbow Mix is the version used as the background music for Tony Levin's View. I am technological challenged, and I was unable to separate (burn) the DVD audio tracks for my CD listening pleasure. I like this remix better than the original, and it would be probably best described as a \\"quiet\\" version. The deconstructed down beat seems to better capture the feel of the song lyrics better. The first track sounds like a typical radio edit (i.e.,a short version). I have only listened to the Polyphonic Spree Mix a few times. It is quite an unusual intrepretation as it rapidly changes/mixes instumental styles from a twangy folk guiter to a full string arrangement (Is this a polyphonic spree?). While unique, I think it will grow stale very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoking Funk!","review":"Smoking! Mike Clark and Paul Jackson sound incredible rocking it over these \\"Headhunter\\" style grooves. The vocalists are absolutely top knotch, Reggie Watts from Soulive and Alex Veley from Maktub. That's like Marvin Gaye singing with Al Green, these are two modern soul giants.I'm not familiar with all the players work, but Darius Wilrich burns on the electric piano and the trumpet player, Jim Knodle, sounds like Miles. A tight purchase for anyone interested in progressive hip-hop, soul, fusion, rock, or funk.Like going to a music school for the hip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the Motorola MD71","review":"I purchased this system 8/05 with two handsets.

Replaced a similar system with the Motorola and i am shocked at the crappy features...looks pretty but I can't find it functional for our office. Everyone has had problems with the hold feature ...we may just be use to our old system..but this is driving us all crazy. There is no clear hold button it goes from a conference lcd button to a hold button depending on the 2 line status. Sounds confusing, but in a busy store it's even worse.We don't like the volume control either. Don't like the handset on the wireless it's too wide! So..form and function don't follow this one anywhere.Hope we can find something else soon...WE got this for the 2 line feature and expandable handsets...we won't be expanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible phone","review":"I purchased this system with the 2 extra handsets. The unit is 5 months old and the answering machine usually does not work and if it does it keeps the line open after the caller hangs up. The 2 extension units do not hold a charge and the screens are illegible. This was a bad purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"display stopped working","review":"The display on the cordless stopped working after a few months.

Lost volume of calling party on cordless phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ringer problems with MD7091","review":"I tried three different phones (same model) from three different vendors (thinking that I was one of the unlucky ones to receive a bad unit) and they all have very similar ringer problems -- Line 1 ringer doesn't work, or the phone doesn't ring at any of the extensions when you are on one of the lines, or it Line 1 rings but line 2 doesn't.I am very disappointed at the quality of this phone. When I called Motorola tech support, they passed the buck to my phone provider saying something about baud rates and that the company needs to adjust it in order for the phone to work reliably. What a bunch of crap from tech support!!! I currently have a Siemens two-line phone that works just fine, so its obviously an engineering issue with the phone.I can't believe a company like Motorola would release such a sub-standard phone to the market. How long have they been in the phone business?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features and poor performance","review":"I purchased this phone with 3 extensions based on the company's reputation and the array of nice features. Unfortunately the phone system behaved in unpredictable, erratic ways and require lot of time for debugging. For example, the answering machine would stop picking-up for no apparent reason. Technical support did their best - but after resetting the whole system and still having problems, I have gave up, swapped it for the similar Panasonic system that so far has performed superbly."},{"rating":"1","title":"phone","review":"1-on a desk, the craddle doesn't hold the receiver that well2- no signal or light to be seen or heard re: messages on answering machine"},{"rating":"1","title":"loser !","review":"I, too, bought this phone with 3 extensions based on reputation and features. The range of the cordless handsets is mediocre (compared even to my old cheap Vtech). Worst of all, the handsets won't hold a charge ! Even after overnight on the charger, I pick up a phone to answer it, and get beeping for low battery.There is something bad with the circuitry, because I bought a NEW battery for a handset ... and it is somewhat better, but still runs out of gas after only 40 minutes or so of talking.I'm tossing it out"},{"rating":"1","title":"DOH!!!","review":"Well, it looks nice, it's small, setup isn't hard, the sound is good, and it has several cute little ringtones. However, this phone has a major design flaw that makes it unusable for me:There is no way to tell the answering system to record silently! Every time it answers a call, it broadcasts both the OGM and the message that the caller leaves, through the speaker! There are volume buttons but they make only a slight adjustment, from loud to medium loud.Sometimes, you might not want other people in the room to hear the messages being left on your phone! Sometimes, you might be sleeping, and don't want to be disturbed.Apparently, this never occured to the Motorola product designers. DOH!!! What a boneheaded mistake. Mine is for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE SYSTEM","review":"Have had my Motorola system for well over a year now. Many, many complaints:1. the handsets buzz2. battery life is bad - one of the handsets now lasts about 3 minutes3. no headset plug on the base unit, which I have to use often because the handsets are so bad.4. You can't read the display on the base unit unless you stand over it and look straight down.5. If you take the time to assign names to all of your handsets, you lose the names when the power goes out! This happens even if you put batteries in the base unit.6. The headset jack on the handset units is nestled into a soft plastic area. Some headsets also have a soft area on the male piece that plugs in. Two soft areas do not connect well... the headset falls out. I finally found a headset that stays plugged in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that","review":"I was expecting to be wowed by Breakfast on Pluto, but it just didn't do it for me. I thought that Pussy's character was overblown to the point of triteness. Really, even with all her issues, she was quite the one-note sreechy diva. And the violent, o-the-brutality-of-The Troubles interludes just left me shrugging my shoulders. Overall, the book felt like a patchwork of gimmicks, from the narrative structure to the transvestite prostitutes to the torture scenes to the...well, I could go on. I haven't given up on Patrick McCabe, though; I'm planning on reading \\"Butcher Boy\\" to find out once and for all whether there is any truth to the McCabe hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get to the brilliant part","review":"I'm sorry, but i couldn't get past the first hundred pages. I must be crazy but I thought this book was boring, and hard to read given the crazy way Paddy talks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The author assumed that the reader knew the history of the political conflicts & religious wars between Ireland and London, and wrote in unknown jargon, making the book confusing and hard to follow. Pusey, a transvestite prostitute, was desperate for love. All Pusey really wanted was to find his birth mother and have his father acknowledge him. He knew he needed to fortive his father, but allowed rage and lust for vengenance to control him against the man who would never acknowledge him. Pusey slipped in and out of reality, making it difficult to differentiate between what was real and what was only imagined. Escape for Pusey came in fantasis of Vic Damone, Dusty Springfield, and music.

I'm honestly astonished at the other reviews that said they could fit 6, maybe 7 utensils in, since I could only cram 4 in. The utensils are weirdly curved, the actual scoop part of the spoon makes scooping difficult, and the fork's tines aren't conducive to actually spearing anything. The case is difficult to open also. I tossed the spoons and forks and used different utensils, but I'm seriously considering ditching the case too."},{"rating":"1","title":"price is right","review":"We have several travel cases for toddler utensils - this case, and the utensils, are my least favorite. The tines on the fork are so wide that my 15-month-old can't stab anything with it. She does like the spoons. Because the handles on these utensils are a bit longer than most toddler utensils, it makes it easy for her to grab the handle of the spoon while I help guide the spoon to her mouth. The case is large and takes up too much space in our diaper bag, so we haven't used it outside our house. Like other reviewers, I could only get 6 of the 8 utensils in the case at the same time. For just a few dollars, the price is right since we use only the 4 spoons. I would trash the forks and find another use for the case. I would not recommend this product to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift from Mother Earth","review":"This book teaches us the how to communicate in a deeper and more personal way with ourselvs and the earth.

It's a lot of book for the money. It's tidy, with picturesque schemes, drawings and pictures. However, at a more careful reading, it sounds like a Native American version of the Western zodiac astrology. The wheel is split into four quadrants (the directions), each quadrant is divided into three sectors, thus making 12 \\"months\\" (aren't there 13 moons in the Native American tradition?). Each sector is symbolized by one stone, one plant, one animal. Everything is geometrically boxed. Everything makes perfect sense. Every page is smudged with a little bit of tribal names, a little bit of tribal cosmology, a little bit of the Kokopelli stuff, a little bit of do-it-yourself ceremonies ... Of course, the Great Spirit is there, as are Mother Hearth and the Thunderbird.Cheesey New Age at its best in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Figure of Water","review":"Swim around in this book.

She also offers a chapter on diagrams to make your own patterns which includes borders and block designs. There are lots of color illustrations that work very well with the text.

I've been an on-again, off-again comicbook reader since about 1970, and recently fell into the graphic novel habit... A friend who's a diligent DC fan recommended this series to me, and I gotta say, he was right on the mark.This second volume of this revamped Catwoman series isn't quite on par with the first... Artist Darwyn Cooke is sorely missed, though his replacement Brad Rader does hot his stride after an issue or two... The art reminds me of the Terry Collins \\"Ms. Tree\\" crime series of the 1980s -- cartoonish, but with a certain elegance and unpretentious stylishness. The storytelling is less nuanced as well, but still pretty compelling... There's a sense that the reenergized Catwoman is just getting up to speed herself, and you really want to be around to see what happens when she finally lets the throttle out...

He really like the white noise generator and nature sounds and the sound quality on the music isn't too baby (kinda like Baby Einstein). One set of batteries lasted us about three months. Good buy!

I was about ready at one point and time to give up until I was about 2/3 of the way done with it and I stuck it out. I enjoyed the ending, but this book could have been so much more promising. Believe it or not, I thought this book was maybe 3 3/4 stars, but not four. In my opinion, Bunn fell short because I really didn't see much of a witness all in all for Jesus.

Of the 30 some odd stories in this book, maybe a third of them could be considered noir. I guess the editors expanded the definition to any crime story. There are some good stories here, particularly by Carroll John Daly, Mickey Spillane, David Goodis, Max Allan Collins and Norbert Davis, but there's also a lot of mediocre stuff (most of the stories in the second half of the book range from fair to awful). Even terrific writers like Lawrence Block are represented by pretty bad stories (and as bad a Block's story is it's not even remotely noirish). I don't know, I have to think that if Spillane and Collins took this book more seriously they could have come up with a better representation of noir fiction. Even a noir master like James M. Cain is represented by a mediocre story that doesn't even classify as noir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent stuff","review":"All fans of noir will love this.

The shape allows easy access for a whisk, spoon, spatula etc. The pan heats quickly and evenly. Because it's not as heavy as high-end (i.e., expensive) pans it doesn't retain heat as well, so you have to use some additional care in use; but, if you're making sauces, you're probably standing over the pan the whole time anyway, so this is a minor quibble.The reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is: 1) the handle is spot welded on rather than riveted, and, 2) it's not as thick as the very top of the line sauce pans (Falk, All-clad, etc) and may not take as much abuse over time. If you plan to use this as one of the workhorse pans in your kitchen, then consider buying a heavier saucier with a riveted handle (but you'll spend a LOT more).But, if you're like me and most home cooks, this pan will be just fine for everyday use, and the price can't be beat for a pan of this quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"THRILLING READ!","review":"I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN.

It now works perfectly.Perhaps other customers have different output strengths (video cards in PC's) or just different monitors, but I would check the price difference between this and your brand name DVI cable at your local BB before taking the risk.

Amazon, this is the thing that defeats online purchases, but, since I am one of the few that takes the time to complain, it will probably serve no purpose.

If you want to hear some good mc work that actually compliments the music (which is really good too!), pick up Hive's \\"hip hop 2023\\" cd. Anyway, if the music was good it still could have saved this cd. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't anything new. I know ak1200 can do better than this.

Trust me passer-byers this disc is not that bad. The only reason I give it 4.5 stars is because I have listened to Fully Automatic and got blown away by it. The only difference (if you liked Fully Automatic) is that they used an MC to try to get back to the level they have achieved. Listeners probably don't take to it because the MC bastes attitude all over the disc, however it still remains an up-beat dancable attitude and doesn't quite reach the ranks of rap. The only thing keeping it from a five star rating is that this Cd in my opinion starts off much stronger than any of the other AK1200 discs I have listened to but begins to falter about half way through. However keep in mind it doesn't trip too bad they retain thier sound throughout the disc. They simply take a step down from the incredible high that is immediatelly brought into the Cd.Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"quality ak; one mc less please","review":"Moonshine's a top-notch label and Ak1200's past releases have been excellent.

Okay a little harsh, but navigator's GPS was broken at this show. he had very little flow and absolutely nothing to say except the fore mentioned things. Usually an Mc will at least hold his ground or really add to the mix but navigator was just stale and annoying. The album would have actually been better without him in my opinion.Other than the Mc, AK1200 brought the goods. the track selection was very solid and his mixing skills made the mix better than other jungle mixes. he ends the mix with his beloved 'drowning' by cleveland lounge. it's a dope track and it's nice to hear his remix of the song.Pick up Lock and roll.it's a 5 star.
