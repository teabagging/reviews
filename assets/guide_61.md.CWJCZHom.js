Ken Shapiro steals the show and Chevy Chase does a couple of sketches that he later copied in Saturday Night Live. It also reminds me of the TV show \\"Laugh-In\\" that came later."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Kentucky Fried Movie\\" is still my all-time favorite, but...","review":"... \\"Groove Tube\\" certainly gives it a run for its money. The sketches here are perverse, gratuitous and completely over-the-top. The only reason it rates a couple clicks lower is because I thought the \\"Dealers\\" segment was a little too drawn out. Everything else was great- especially Koko The Clown, the cooking segment and the news program. The fact that Curtis Mayfield's \\"Move On Up\\" opens and closes the film scores bonus points with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my was this bad.","review":"I have no idea how it came to be stuck in my head that the the Groove Tube was a \\"great, funny,\\" movie. I saw it in 1974 at a drive in theatre and over the years had remembered it to be wonderful. Oh how wrong I was.I finally got a copy to show my wife this little \\"gem\\" of a movie from my youth. With the exception of about three mildly funny scenes, it was horrible. I don't even want to give this away to anyone as I would feel bad for wasting their time should they watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Unfunny as the TV it mocks","review":"First of all, in response to an earlier review, I grew up in the 70s so I get it and it is crap. I liked LOOSE SHOES, KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE and AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON, but this film, from the man who brought us MODERN PROBLEMS and then faded from humanity's recorded history, is utterly lame. I guess P.T. Barnum was right about a sucker being born every minute and they are posting the positive reviews here. I challenge anyone to tell me what is funny about Chevy Chase singing while someone plays air drums on his head. The hitchhiker scene sets the tone for this junk - naked flesh and toilet humor aplenty. I have got nothing against toilet humor.....when it's funny. The clown sequence was mildly amusing for a fleeting moment and that is about it. The Dealers segment makes you appreciate Cheech & Chong all the more because, even stoned, this skit is a bummer, man. I could go on, but there is really no point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and amateurish - you can have my VHS for free","review":"I'm a great fan of all kinds of comedy, but this is incredibly amateurish and boring.

Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, Uncreative Excrement","review":"If Amazon.com let me, I would have rated this dvd NEGATIVE 5 stars. Some actors really do some movies that stink, but this is one of the very, very, very few movies Chevy Chase acted in that smell like it had been floating in a sewer for centuries. The true indication that comedy is uncreative is when they resort to nudity as a crutch. One scene was really obscene. The scene was a children's clown asking every non-kid to leave the room before he read sexually explicit passages from romance novels. If you are thinking of buying this, do this. Cash your paycheck. Pay your bills and with what is left, flush it directly down the toliet so you can cut out the middle man."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"Me and my girlfriend bought this movie one night and I was appauled.We turned it off after 30 minutes.And when the store didn't let me return it it went right into my fire place.I hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a dated classic","review":"How can any one who saw this film as a kid ever forget it? Many of the scatalogical blackout sketches are no longer as provocative as their original release, but who cares? The film is hysterical. Sure there are low points, the all too long the dealers, the evening news (although of course Brown 25 is classic), but the high points are extaordinary; The Kramp kitchen, Safety sam, Chevy Chases' brilliant 4 leaf clover, the extremely subtle and amazingly funny, Koko the clown show. Best of all though is writer, director, producer Ken Shapiro's manic pas de deux down a busy Manhattan street, while he sings Nat King Cole's Just You Just Me. It is forever etched in my mind. All that and Curtis Mayfield as a bonus. Definitely dated, still, The Groove Tube remains an unrelenting jolt of joy in an era that is certainly in need of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly hot -scrumptitiy scrump!!!Delicious!!!","review":"This is one of my all time favorite movies,I first watched this movie in 1984?it was on a movie channel and I was compleatly fascinated with it!!!From the first naked boy skit to the rest of the classics,My eyes completely bullged at how muny and exciting and interesting this was!!!This movie greatly inspired me with my own local t.v. comedy sketch show I did on a local station,back in 1993!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feed Your Head","review":"I'll probably revise this later because it's been many years since I saw this. But back in the 70's this was a late night and drive in favorite. Like I said I haven't seen it for many years and I'm guessing that it's probably not as funny as it used to be afer a few tokes, but I think it'll still be worth a watch because this was the beginning of the kind of humor we found later in SNL. Much of the humor is subtle and can easily go over your head if you're not aware of what's going on, but if you are then there's a lot of fun here. In fact I still remember having to take a second look at the end VD talk to realize what that puppet actually was...It was the absurdity that made it so funny...."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a lot funnier 30 years ago","review":"I bought \\"The Groove Tube\\" as a gift for my husband. We did the grind house / cult movie / midnite movie circuit when we started dating 30 years ago. Although it was fun to see Chevy Chase and Richard Belzer (among others) when they were just starting their careers, this movie has lost something over time.

I bought it inspite of the fact that it features the voice of Whoopi Goldberg, because I collect and watch as many versions as I can, and because it features the voice of Tim Curry, whose work I do admire.I thought Scrooge's dog was a cute addition to the classic tale, but I stopped watching it when the Ghost of Christmas Present appeared looking like Oprah Winfrey in a gigantic green bathrobe, and sounding like Dame Edna. Apparently, there was a disconnect between the cover illustrator and the animated graphics department, because the Ghost of Christmas Present is white on the cover, but black in the movie.Too disturbing! The only version I've seen more disturbing than this one is Tchaikovsky's \\"Nutcracker Christmas Story,\\" which features men in thongs, one of them with devil horns on his forehead, cracking a whip at the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Animated Version","review":"This is the best of the many animated versions of the classic tale. It is also the best musical version with songs that far surpass the 1970 (Albert Finney)musical extravaganza . You will come away remembering such songs as \\"Santa's Sooty Suit\\", \\"Random Acts of Kindness\\" and \\"Tale about Christmas\\". If you like animated versions, check out the Mr. Magoo , and the Flintstone versions as well as \\"The Stingiest Man in town\\" with the voices of Tom Bosley and Walter Matthau."},{"rating":"1","title":"The screen moving up and down at its own will","review":"I have returned the screen because of the malfunction. It only comes with the remote control and does not include the wired wall-mount control ($50 + shipping if purchase from elitescreen.com). When I first set it up and connected it with power, without touching any button on the remote control, the screen started moving down for a few seconds, then going back up for a few seconds, then moving down again, and then moving up again, .... It keeps doing that at its own will for no reason and I have no ways of making it to stop. Removed batteries from the remote control did not help. At a point, the screen started to tilt and eventually stuck in the middle of the operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen Trigger","review":"Screen quality is excellant but the trigger function needs improvement.

This was quite difficult for a non technical user.After changing fuse it still remained blocked in open position. After calling again they sent me a replacement circuit board and told me I had to change it myself!!! This was even more difficult and absurd for me. However I tried disassembling the whole screen removing old circuit board and rewiring all the wires, the hardest part was putting everything together again. The result: the screen went all the way up and then stayed stuck in that position!!!Called back and they finally agreed to replace the whole thing.

At first her Things I Hate list was longer than her things I love list. In the middle of the book she found out that her mom was pregnant. Near the end of the book she starts to try stuff on her Things I Hate list and moved it to her Things I Love list. At the end of the book she finfds out that her grandmother died and the only thing only thing on her Things I Hate list is liver because she tried new things.

I like it just as much as I do Burn Up, Burn Up W, and Burn Up Excess. Rio isn't as whiney, Mia isn't as nuts, but Lilika is a lot better in this one in my mind.

He is a free thinker who tries to suggest that the Gospels are not based on historical truth but are fictitious. The broad method is to suggest that a number of things suggest that the gospels are not historical. These relate to a lack of knowledge about Jewish customs and some other issues such as the geography of the area.It is then suggested that different parts of the gospels are a transcription of some aspects of the story of Joshua and that other parts are a reworking of the fate of the Jewish community in Alexandria under the Romans. (Some prominent Jews were crucified)The book is a rather plodding read. The main problem however is that the book simply relies on assertion to suggest the central thesis rather than anything else. There is no real explanation of who is meant to have written the material, their social background and the motives and mechanics of the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written work","review":"The book is good. It has detailed information as well as stories that encourage the reader and Grey owner to 'do whats right' with their grey.

I would caution other readers/purchasers not to be put off with some of the overly cautious, and sometimes caustic comments, and perhaps be too scared to get one of these birds. The reader is cautioned so much that it is offputting at times and might lead people to say that raising one of these birds is impossible. To be sure, a new owner must be committed to being able to provide significant time and patience with one of these birds, but please do not be put off by all of the warnings. I am sure that is not what the author intended, but that is what came across to me, so please do not feel intimidated by some of the comments. These birds are incredibly good companions if treated with love and respect, and this book can certainly help the new owner in so many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"African Grey Parrot Handbook","review":"Being a proud owner of an Afreican Grey this book is a good source of reference"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful way to create your family tree","review":"I think it is beautiful and am enjoying it.

To unfreeze I have to close down the camera window and rerun it.I found a driver update at Creative site. Downloaded it and followed the instructions, but it failed to install the latest version driver which claims to fix the freezing problem.Then I tried the update function that came with the camera software.

This is a novel of spiritual growth and self-discovery of the necessities of compassion. It's well worth your time, especially if you are in a spiritual crisis or generally having a problem understanding \\"the ways of God to man.\\"I highly recommend this book. It reads well even after 43 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best novel I have ever read over the past 1/2 century","review":"I must admit that this is the third time I have read this particular novel. The first time I read it, I was 17 and had not previously enjoyed reading. After reading it, something in it spoke to me. I read it again while in my thirties and just recently as a 57 year old. I still could not put it down. West gives life to a broken-down, cancer ridden priest who has lived his life without any passion while working in the archives of the Vatican. He is sent to a small town in the poorest section of Italy on his last assignment. There, he comes alive as he researches the life of man who was known to many as a Saint. As he becomes involved in the lives of those who played a role in the \\"Saint's\\" life, he learns what it is like to live in the shoes of characters he must interview. It is a beautiful story in many ways and shows the humanity and friendship which develops between the sick priest and the Jewish doctor who attends to his needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good yarn.","review":"One of Morris West's strenghts as a writer is his characters. Reading through \\"The Devil's Advocate\\" you get the feeling that you are being priviledged with the oppurtunity to observe real people's lives as they interact and explore the concepts of faith, love, and redemption. Each character, the cynical Jewish doctor, the jaded countess,the dying preist, and all the others, is portrayed with a depth and compassion that shows the author's hard work to make these people real.Everything in this novel is well placed. The pacing is good, not so fast that you miss the deatails, not as slow as to bore you. The backdrop of a poor Italian village is beautifully painted so as to make you think that this place could have existed. The story draws you in and makes you want to know not just what is happening, but also why. This is not a non-stop action thriller, but rather a study in human emotion.I enjoyed this book and have no compunctions about recommending it."},{"rating":"1","title":"my opinion is this book is boring","review":"My opinion on this book THE DEVILS ADVOCATE is boring. I've read other books by west, but none of them this lame. My opinion is this way because the title of this book makes the story sound interesting but it's not that interesting. It's kinda like a regular old story about a normal day life. In the beginning the story was boring,than, every once in a while during the rest of the book it would get interesting. But, overall ,the middle of the story, is the most interesting part of the book. Especially, when the doctor is approached by a stranger and asked him to be the devils advocate. So that's why my opinion is that the book is lame and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longines master Moon phase","review":"I have had the Master Moonphase for some time and have had no trouble, the number of complications is high for the price and the gulloche face is of high quality.

Star Ti Lung plays both a father and his grown son in separate scenes. Although the English dubbing is terrible, there is a very nice score of original Chinese music. The photography and set design are above average, although the plot does get confusing.

I found myself re-sewing half of the costume after an hour of wear, so that she could wear it on Halloween night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book on deliverance","review":"This book goes a long way toward encouraging faith in those caught up in the ravages of addictive disease/behavior to believe in the power of spiritual deliverance. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is there is still much more to be said on the subject than was captured in these pages. Sherri is on to something very powerful and she is brave to put it in print in the days of anti-Christian practices and beliefs. There is much more to learn about the power and effectiveness of spiritual deliverance to many of life's struggles. Perhaps the next book will take that on.

The price was right and the reviews looked great. When I first got the wallet I was excited and I liked it immediately. Two months later I'm very unhappy with the wallet for two main reasons.1. The pockets for cards don't hold anything after they've been used for a short amount of time. I definitely don't keep a lot of cards in my wallet, maybe 8 all together. After keeping cards in there for about one month, if I hold the wallet upside down, all the cards will fall out. I can't stress how annoying this is.2. The pockets are starting to come apart at the seams. The wallet is about to fall apart. Nothing more to say about that.Although I wouldn't have spent that much money on the Coach wallet, I realize now that wallet was good to me for more than 4 years. I'll be going to pick up a higher quality wallet now.Don't be fooled by the looks and the great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Wallet","review":"I bought this wallet for my husband's birthday and the day he opened it we discovered that the wallet is really cheap. It rips pretty easily and it is difficult to fit many credit cards (it is even harder to remove the cards after you shove them in). Also this wallet lacks a big enough billfold for cash. It looks great and is priced nice but be warned it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right book...","review":"...for my 3 year old! I was looking for a book to teach my daugther manners and came across this book. This book is utilizes \\"opposites\\" - it puts good behavior and bad behavior side-by-side as a teaching tool.

It may be bad form to criticize this last book by a writer who succumbed to the very disease around which the subject matter revolves, but I'm afraid that's what one must do to be honest.It's surprising that someone of such obvious intelligence could write a book that epitomizes Fran Lebowitz's remark that one should not detain a fleeting insight. Most of the essays cry out for the patient pen of a competent copy editor, and there is very little here that hasn't been said with more grace, insight and craft elsewhere. Fans of Feinberg's novels will no doubt want to investigate this, but the self-indulgent prose and pretense to outrageousness will probably get old fast for almost all other readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding resource","review":"David Jonassen's book served as the text for a course I took at Arizona State University West.

And \\"rip it up\\" is an understatement!The vocalist are from the \\"big bands\\" you know too.Same with the drummers and bassists.If you're seeking a VH album this isn't one...If you're a VH fan looking for the world's most tasteful cover album I'll best this in the tops!!!But in spite of all that, as I'm writing this...

I really like the way he cares to pinpoint every important aspect about the case, how it went, what might have been diff and off course, what he learned.. and that too in a genuinely funny way. A simply remarkable piece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and quietly arrogant","review":"I know that many find this book to be very special and I freely admit the writing style is engaging. That being said, the reader is left with the distinct impression that there is more work to becoming a surgeon than any other profession in the world, especially medical profession. I'm not an M.D. myself, but this book is a slap in the face to any family physician, pediatrician, or cardiologist, who have their own unique sets of pressures that a surgeon couldn't possibly understand. The Making of a Surgeon contributes to the public perception that a surgeon is a higher ranking physician than a primary care doctor. I commend the surgeon that treated a problem I had, and certainly appreciate it. But when it comes to followup, listening to me, and on a scientific level, balancing out all of my medical problems and history, there is nobody that works harder and puts in more time than my family doctor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This book is an absolute masterpiece.

The puppet is very well made, with excellent details and craftsmanship, from its nails to the way the fur is cut to simulate wrinkles to the soft foam which makes its ears stand out to the rings which make its trunk go up and down. This puppet has been a favorite of adults and children alike--I'm only sad that it sold already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Adorable!","review":"Again, Folkmanis has produced a high quality, realistic, beautiful product.

Joshua Bell is interviewed for about 1 minute and plays very little. The interviews of people attending the School of Violin are excellent. Joshua's Mom is also interviewed and is very interesting. The students do play a couple of pieces which are excellent, but this is not a musical video. I guess I was looking for violin concerts, with special features of interviews from the artists. To watch Joshua Bell grace a Violin is unbelievable! He will literally stop you in your tracks no matter what you are doing at the time! So I am still looking for some of Bell's videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, I can't give ZERO stars....","review":"Nothing but a rambling, idiotic, paranoid and pointless rant by a complete idiot for other complete idiots.

These concepts are easily available for free on the internet or through other free sources. Any author that can only come up with 50 or so pages on a subject such as this isn't trying very hard, and half of the book is full of cartoons. In addition, one of the reviewers, Mumia Abu Jamal, is not a \\"political prisoner\\" as noted. He is a member of the Black Panthers, and is a convicted murderer who shot a police officer in the back and then stood over the gravely wounded officer and shot him in the head.

So much of the people supposedly screwing up America in this book are simply entertainers. They wield little to no actual political power (power to tax, power to make law, power to use the military, power to influence the market, etc.)The people who are really screwing up America are those with power: The Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld war cartel. They have started an unnecessary war, been responsible for the deaths of thousands, and have provided the rich war-profiteers with boom times. They also have assisted the terrorism-financing Saudi Arabian royal family with plenty of money.Goldberg is clearly an idiot, and so is anyone who takes his descriptions of entertainers as \\"powerful\\" seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney... With Elegance","review":"When it comes to making and recording songs for Disney films, they can often bring gigantic drives to so many people. That was the case in 1994 and 1995, with the Oscar-winning triumph of The Lion King for Elton John & Tim Rice, and it happened with Pocahontas for Vanessa Williams. She proved to have the midas touch when it came to Adult Contemporary tracks throughout the 90's, and she scored it here. Colors Of The Wind is a very graceful and loving song that not just matches any Disney Ballad we see today, but it is truly one of the most elegant Disney tracks that has ever made it onto the big screen. Still, I feel very dissapointed that many people don't give respect to Vanessa Williams these days in the music industry, thanks to Manufactred acts that are out, but she still has a voice that is just breath-taking. I just hope that the former Miss America can come back to the charts with a song like this.

Although proving itself as a huge underground anthem, upon its initial release the single failed to sell as well as it ought to have done. Almost two years on, this dark, melodic fusion of progressive house and trance has received a long overdue re-issue, with Way Out West & Mara remixes to boot. Featuring the beautiful ethereal vocals of Jan Johnston, who has the distinction of being the most famous and revered trance vocalist in the UK, (having previously worked with the likes of BT, Victor Imbres, Paul Oakenfold, Jamie Myerson and Tomski), Ms. Johnston's sultry performance helps to distinguish the track from the mounds of progressive material already available.

I can't think of anyone else who could have taken a piece of mid 60's cheese like The Monkees \\"Last Train To Clarksville\\" and transform it into a really swinging Jazz number. Her reading of U2's \\"Love Is Blindness\\" is beautiful as well as making songs by Hank Williams and Neil Young all her own. There are also a a couple of standardJazz numbers here and she's no slouch as a writer. Case in point: \\"Solomon Sang\\". There's also her arrrangements which feature a Joni Mithchell style of \\"Whack Tuning\\" as it's refered to in the liner notes, as well as some very diverse instrumentation.

Her interpretation of U2's \\"Love is blindness\\" is awesome, it's so gentle and caring. But also her own material like \\"little warm death\\" and \\"Find him\\" shines greatly. In my mind this record has no bad tracks.Cassandra has a thoughtfullness simular to that of Miles Davis, it's in the way she weigh her words, deliberate and careful at the same time.

I didn't like it when The Monkees did it. \\"Harvest Moon\\" was great when Neil Young sang it--I just don't see Wilson in a wheat field on the prairie. Hank Williams's \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" is one of the few tunes on this CD that does work.

So who is there left to root for?The art direction seems to out-shine the series... That's pretty sad, though, isn't it, when all you can recommend is the art direction?RE: Extras. Nifty.

The majority of the plots are original to me. For example in \\"Home Coming\\", soldier zombies got out of their coffins to cast votes against the Iraq War! It's entertaining but not scary or suspenseful.There are 2 bad things listed below.1. There are only about 3 suspensful and scary scenes in all 20 shows!For example in \\"The Right to Die\\", the male character was in the bath tub by himself. Suddenly, he saw his wife appeared right in front of him. What happened next was very scary to me.2. All of the shows have many extremely logical holes that make them ridiculous.

While you are watching \\"Incident\\" you get this feel from the film that this is something special and unique, unlike anything seen from the Masters series. You can tell this film is directed by someone with high skill as soon as you get 10 minutes into the movie. The acting is very convincing, and the monster/maniac looks very well made. Anytime you bring a monster into a film like this, it just makes the film so much cooler and scarier.

It is not the best movie made, but will do. The gore effects are good, but you can easily tell that some of the scenes are fake (the gut-puking scene and the head-drilling scene), but are effective. The reason why I'm giving this movie 4 stars is because of the plot and the acting. The plot, not as great as the one in The Beyond, is suspenseful. You can never know what happens next. As far as the acting goes, it is great for a Fulci movie. Despite the limitations of the movie, the acting puts it above average, with Fulci regular Catriona MacColl as the lead character. Like I said, not the greatest Fulci movie made, but is effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Dull","review":"Fulci could never seem to find a decent script to waste his directorial talents on, and he fails here as well. After a priest's suicide, the gates of hell open...huh? I am also sick of intrepid reporters trying to save everyone, the plot wreaks.

City flooded with crowds of hungry for flash cadavers. At this point it was rather disappointing for there is nothing like that in the movie. But there are many things familiar to Lucio Fulci fans: creepy and monotonous music, rather slow action, some gruesome close-ups and so on. If you really enjoy Fulci's films you'll enjoy this one too although maestro had much better - \\"House by the Cemetery\\", \\"The Beyond\\", \\"Cat in the Brain\\" for example. But \\"City...\\" was shot in the most creative period of Fulci's career so you'll easy put it at the end of the line of his best works. It's not bad at all, besides it has an infamous scene of intestines-puking which every gorehound I guess would want to have in his collection.My verdict - average Fulci's level."},{"rating":"1","title":"city of the living dead","review":"I'll make this quick.

But dont be fooled, it was junk then, it is now. The italian horror industries is hurting bad, from movies like this one. It has a long confusing begining, then a middle and end confusing. ex. D.

I think if anything that is what bothered me most. Not that the zombies were \\" ghost \\", or the fact that the story line bored me. But the way the zombies would grab someone by the back of the head, and squeeze their brains out.

Why do people always have to compare things to Bergman, or Kubrick, if all movies were at that level that would suck! Anyway, this movie is unmistakably Fulci, at his peak, I prefer this to Zombie. And if the scene with the beautiful Daniela Doria doesn't seal the stamp, isn't the cherry on top, doesn't tickle your fancy, make your day, make you watch it in slow mo, and make some kind of gargling noise with your stomach, then I don't know, your're messing with the wrong genre.

I browsed the reviews at Amazon and decided to buy City of the Living Dead. It was a big mistake. There is absolutly no excuse for making films this boring. The direction was boring, the script was boring, the acting (what there was of it ) was boring, the zombies were boring, the music was...well interesting, and even the scene of head boring was boring. Zombie 2 was well paced, with a coherent plot, good characters, regular scenes of zombie munching aswell as scantily clad women in peril. Everything you could ask for. City of the Living Dead was pants. The picture quality was ok I guess for a film of this budget, as was the sound, but then maybe I'd have been better of if I couldn't have seen it or heard it so well...it would have been a less painful experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of leisure time.","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this movie,as I expected something along the lines of a good horror flick filled with lots of gross, real-looking zombies and their associated gore arising out of the opening of the gates of hell--especially after reading all the 5 star reviews. This movie was so cheesy, with laughable special effects that might have been jolting in the 1950's, but were unbelieveably stupid after seeing even the original 1970's \\"__of the Dead\\" movies. I kept waiting for something interesting and scary to happen, I kept waiting for a storyline to emerge, but nothing came. In the end, we did not watch the whole movie, primarily because the effects and the \\"plot,\\" were so very, very cheesy and boring. I can't believe I wasted money on this movie.

The movie gets some creidit for trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombies from Where?","review":"Fulci's movies are, as i have now seen 4 of them, quite terrible. This film follows in the footsteps of \\"The Beyond\\" except that it is dragged through overkill by psycho babbling doctors who can't believe that the dead are eating people and stupid children running away from mind numbing zombies. The ending is one of those \\"they are back\\" endings that doesn't even make sense. The only reason to watch this if there are no drugs or alcohol in your house so you need a reason to fall asleep. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame would-be- shocker","review":"Whereas Dario Argento has managed to turn sheer brutality into a form of high art, Luci Fulci has to rely on brutality simply to disguise the fact that apart from it, there's - well, not much really. \\"City of the Living Dead\\" (also known as \\"Gates of Hell\\") is downright boring because all attempts at creating some gothic flavour or atmosphere OR suspense fail miserably. Instead, we're kept awake by repeated scenes of (badly made) intestines pulled out of something or somebody, and an electric drill forcing its way into (and out of) the head of a retarded boy! wow! Attempts at creating suspense (and keeping up the viewer's interest in the plot) are undermined by bad timing, editing, and worse acting. could have been high gothic gore, but it's just boring gore. silly. At least, \\"the Beyond\\" is better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par Fulci film","review":"\\"City Of the Living Dead\\" is perhaps the weakest Fulci film in the gore realm, relying on some rather effective, suspenseful sequences to create more of a horrific \\"moodsetting\\" for the audience. While these suspense-carrying vehicles are fantastic at times (such as the premature burial and tomb-raiding scenes), much of the film's screen-time is spent on character studies that really have little purpose. The gorey aspect is at a minimal as well, where only the gut-vomit and head-drilling scenes are memorable. I also get tired of Fulci's extreme close-ups during dialouge between minor characters. Most of them can't even act!If you are an avid Fulci-fanatic, check it out! But to newbies, I recommend The Beyond with confidence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombies with obfuscate","review":"Last night I watched The Gates of Hell, aka City of the Living Dead. It's an Italian horror flick made by Lucio Fulci. Fulci may be best known for his movie Zombie! in which an eyeball is pierced in slow-motion by a sliver of wood, and in which a zombie battles a great white shark (with predictable results). Personally, I find Fulci's movies confusing, boring (aside from a few key scenes), and just plain bad. The cut scenes are abrupt and often make no sense. The \\"good\\" scenes in The Gates of Hell include a drill press to Bob's head, and a teenager puking up all her internal organs. The movie is set in New England, which makes the recurring howler monkey sound effects entertaining. And when the dead all awaken, the sound effect is of crinkling cellophane layered over howler monkeys, which makes a lot of sense when you think about it.Or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy...","review":"First of all, Lucio Fulci apparently has an eye fetish. He focuses on the eyes way too much and it starts to get ridiculously annoying further into the movie. The zombies in this movie aren't your run-in-the-mill slow walking, lagging, etc. They disappear and can reappear behind you or right in front of you. It's one thing to do a different take on zombie movies. It's another to ruin it. The only cool part of this movie is when this girl pukes up her guts. Gory, and a nice touch to a really bad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"City of the Living Dead","review":"Okay, I love gore just as much as the next depraved freak, but City of the Living Dead pretty much disappointed me on all levels. Yeah, it's quite gory and all, but the film just isn't very good. It's rather bad actually. Check out Dawn of the Dead or Night of the Living Dead... They're fare superior horror films."},{"rating":"1","title":"City Of The Living Dead was a great Disappointment","review":"This movie, in my opinion, was a boring excuse for a horror film. Aside from the gratuitous violence & graphic gore, this film has very little redeemable qualities. It's as if Fulci is using these graphic violent scenes to make up the fact that he directed a turkey here. The plot was so incoherent, I found myself caring little for the movie as a whole. The zombies in this movie were a real letdown compared to his other films (ZOMBIE, THE BEYOND).All in all, I thought this movie could've been better. Too bad it wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad just bad","review":"This movie is one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. The acting is terrible the gore is pointless and this isn't really a zombie film. Good story and atomisphire but it all leads to nothing, a confusing stupid ending (Fulci lost the origanal) and two gore scenes both are bad too. The gut puking started to look good then it shows a close up of her mouth in which her mouth is BARLEY open and some plastic cups resembling the guts fall out. The cheek drill scene is soso but the guy doesn't even scream he just sits there with his eyes closed getting drilled in the top part of his cheek and last one is a part of someone head getting torn out, the rest of this movie is so slow and the soundtrack is annoying.

His solo music is much better and look out for tracks like Hammerhead, Rip it Up, Reckless (this version is better than Aussie Crawl days..) and the best track is Always The Way - not a very well known track which makes it even better and has one of the most awesome guitar solos I have ever heard!!

In \\"Hex and the City\\", we find out who she is. \\"Paths Not Taken\\" is primarily about the steps Taylor has to take to destroy her. A journey through time is in order, to the very beginning of the Nighside. Several stops along the way, we find out about some of the background for some of the Major Players in the Nightside. Suzie Shooter is right; Time really is a circle. \\"Paths Not Taken\\" is a background book, a setup for things to come. Though it may not have the noir of the previous books, it has just as much emotion. We see glimpses of who John is fated to become. Taylor is extremely haunted in this book, as his oblivion to who he actually was is shattered. Suzie Shooters destiny is also being fufilled in many ways and it couldn't scare John Taylor more. Read this book. It's a key link to what is to come and it will leave you salivating for the next Nightside novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have to agree witha previous reviewer who didn't quite feel right about this book. It has all the general plot lines of the earlier books, but it lacks something...cohesiveness perhaps? I realize that these books (well for me anyway) are good quick reads during the semester, but this one lacked the excitement of the others and as I read it I felt as though the author wished he was doing something else entirely. I hope the next book \\"Serpents Tooth\\" either wraps up the series or has a little life injected into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Déjà vu in the Nightside","review":"I feel somewhat surprised to be giving this novel only 2 stars. However, this would have to be the most disappointing book in this series to date. John indulges in some time travel to find out the secrets of the Nightside's beginnings and how he can prevent future catastrophe taking place.This book neatly wraps up a lot of loose ends in the series to this point - however, its also very much like reading similar plots in the author's Deathstalker series, and doesn't add a lot of forward momentum to the series overall. This book is more of a place-marker in the series rather than the resolution of an interesting mystery and not one I would bother reading again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"Simon R.

I don't know what that is and I don't know why you can't buy a hairdryer without it any more! All I know is it doesn't get as hot as I need it to dry and style my hair. I have to take twice as long to get my hair done and I can't get enough heat to give it a curl where I want it and not enough to straighten the parts I want straight! I get no volume or frizz control when I use that type of hairdryer either. I even called Conair to ask about it and they told me it doesn't change the temperature of the dryer....but I don't believe it. I was so excited to see a dryer with a retractable cord on it....but forget it. I will keep my old dryer with the messy cords and give this one away at Christmastime. :PPS- No problems with Amazon though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Redemption After Childhood Traumas","review":"Michael Reagan writes from a child's perspective here. He details traumas that he suffered as a child including adoption, molestation, the divorce of his parents, and boarding school.Although he is in his 50s now, he is still affected by childhood events, particularly the molestation. During the course of his life he has engaged in high risk behaviors and had suicidal thoughts stemming from his experiences.It took decades, but he finally found redemption through his relationship with Christ. His wife was a major player in helping him overcome this as well.This book would be good to read for those who have experienced some of the issues mentioned above. Additionally, I think it would help to provide great insights for adoptive parents, all parents, and those who work with children. I also recommend it for anyone who likes to read an inspirational story of the redemptive power of Jesus in one's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me angry and I am ok with that!","review":"I was very angry after reading this book. Michael did such a good job of explaining his pain that my heart just ached for him. Micheal helps the reader understand what it is like to be sexually abused as a child without glorifying sexual abuse or negating its lifelong influence. This book left me with a sense of how important it is for adults to protect children and listen and watch what they are trying to say. Break the silence! Sexual Abuse hurts! Stop the violence!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Reagan - The GOOD son.","review":"Buy it. Read it. Enjoy.

The pain of sexual abuse and its life effect is clearly stated. You learn first hand the hidden, and not so hidden, influence abuse has on a life and the life destruction it causes. Michael also shares how unconditional love helped him to overcome, but not forget, the stronghold the abuse had upon his life and how it impacted his family life. You also will learn how you can help change our society for the good and stop the cycles of abuse. Read it - your life will be changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!","review":"The book deserves some credit because it does list contemporary training techniques in a comprehensive fashion, but it does not bring them together in a practical manner. There are also certain errors: 1) That you should do plyometrics last in a training program. Yeah right, high intensity training when you're tired. That removes the benefits and sets an individual up for injury. 2) Not mentioning true periodization for strength training. 3) Presenting impractical programs, especially for high school athletes. 4) Giving credibility to a fad diet (i.e. The Zone). That's almost shameful. If I had time, I'd list some other complaints. It's sad, but I have to admit that this is the best book out there for speed training. Just read it critically!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book is mostly a kitchen sink approach to speed training methods and is a sure fire perscription for overtraining. And as previous reviews have pointed out, the book does not provide an overall logic that helps the athlete or coach properly integrate the training elements. The book does not properly explain how the components of its sytem interact with each other and how they should be balanced against each other when determining the needs of a given individual athlete. In addition, many of the techniques, most notably overspeed training, are highly dubious and most likely counter productive. For those interested in proven speed training methods, I highly recommend Training for Speed by Charlie Francis, which is light years ahead of SportSpeed. Also be on the lookout for Charlie's new training manual which should be released by the end of 2002 and will make every other book on speed training obsolete."},{"rating":"1","title":"very fun!!! but breaks too easy!!!","review":"Hello,I bought this toy for my son, He enjoyed it very much, he played a lot with the track, i even bought a cople of other cars from Tonka that fit perfectly, the problem is thyat the track only worked on the first week of use, now it only makes the music, you can hear the motor running but the spin wheels are not moving at all, i opened it to see if i could fix it, and I Saw why it was no longer working, the spin mechanism is VERY WEAK, it depends only on two rubber chains that are so thin that tey start losing grip and movement very easy, i could'nt fix it, they only way to fix it is to make a new spining mechanism.Dont spend your money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"They have fun with it for a short period of time","review":"Yes it's fun.But...It's noisy and it did break down to soon.

Very frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!","review":"For $70 you get about 3 weeks play out of this before it fails to work. And it's not the battery.

I felt that I had done great research as I didn't want his aunt to waste her money or have a toy that my son wasn't interested in. Well, as it turns out, I was wrong on both counts! It stopped working after 2 weeks! I changed the batteries and called the company. They informed me that it was discontinued and sent me another toy for free.

It was very loud when used, my son loved it and it was a neat idea. But it broke within 2 days of being played with, I suspect once his older cousin started playing with. The kids tend to lean on it and want to make the spinning wheels stop which caused it to break. I emailed Hasbro and just received a response yesterday that they are no longer making this product so they cannot send a replacement part out but that they will send a comparable toy out to us as soon as possible. I don't know what this toy will be but I hope that they do something, this toy is targeted at age 18 months, you would think that they would have made it more durable for a toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept ...Poorly made","review":"My son received this for his first Birthday.

I had read some reviews that said it breaks easily, but some that sounded like it lasted well, so I decided to give it a shot. This was the toy he was the most excited about when he opened it. He played with it, and it was his favorite of the whole birthday. By the next morning, the motor was no longer working. I tried replacing the batteries, but no luck. So, I packaged it up, and sent it back for an exchange. He was so happy when the second one arrived, and he played with it a bunch. He loves this toy!! Well, by day 4, the motor no longer was working AGAIN! I got a refund. I could not keep breaking his little heart until I got one that worked. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great toy until your 1 1/2 year old gets a hold of it","review":"My son loved the race track. He laughed and danced as the cars went round the track. It was a Christmas present that we recently opened (in May) because I felt he was not old enough. Within one day the toy doesn't work. My son pressed on the track, apparently too hard, and now the track doesn't work. Though that was not what he was supposed to do, one would think that a toy made for an 18 month + would be able to withstand a little rough play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My children love this. My Son got it for Christmas and 3 months later it is still going strong. Pros- no tracks and few parts to get lost or clean up. Cute and fun cars safe for young toddlers. Easy to use and makes fun noises. Cons- can be a little loud. I wish they had put a volume control on the bottom, and not just a on off switch. Even though it comes with 2 cars, not all the wheel pal cars work well on it. The beach car set has some cars with a larger wheel base that can get a lttle stuck on the track, but you can easily get more of these cars at most stores that sell toys and even other small cars work well on it. Overall this is a great toy. We have had no problems and both my 17 month old and 3 year old love it. Love the concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...

They all broke my heart and made me bawl my eyes out every time, but I wouldn't miss them for anything. Then they stopped showing them. When they finally came out on video, I was overjoyed.The artwork of this version of Little Mermaid is simple compared to what people expect of animated stories today but that just allows the poignancy of the story itself to come through. This is the story as it should be seen, as it was originally written, in all its bittersweetness. Thirty plus years after this version was produced, it still has the power to reduce me to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"I allowed myself to be misled","review":"I had failed to read all of the available information on this set. I'd thought it was 23 hours of early Carson, which it was on 1 DVD and the first 2 segments on disk 2. On the Carson stuff, you could definitely see the evolution of most of the bits that became famous on 'The Tonight Show'. Way too many of the rest of the set were absolutely and abjectly boring and I LIKE a lot of the early shows from TV's infancy, seemed like these folks went out of their way to find the worst of it to show here. Oh well, read all of the info available here before deciding to buy, although, unlike one reviewer, I was well aware we weren't dealing with 'The Tonight Show' here.

I disagree with one of the posters. If you read the back of the set it tells you exactly what programs are included, so you know Johnny is not on all the shows.

Even more frustrating, I emailed her people asking for the ingredient list for her product line. They wouldn't give me a straight answer.

Dr. Taylor is very good at promoting herself and appearing on television, but I do not believe that she is better than any other dermatologist at treating the skin of people of color. She is more style than substance, I suggest that you SAVE YOUR MONEY and check this book out of the library if you have the time to read it but don't spend any money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"I would have loved to read this book. Unfortunately, the company who was to sell me this product allegedly refunded the cost to me and did not notfify me that they were out of stock to give me the opportunity to seek out another vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing! Entirely too general to be helpful.","review":"The book would probably be informative to some people. Overall, I didn't learn a single thing. THE BOTTOM LINE: If you don't know anything about hair and skin care, if you are starting from scratch, then this book might be helpful. If you are like me, and you already read Essence or already have some knowledge of how and when to wash your hair and face, then the book will seem like a waste of money.Another drawback --most of the advice is incredibly general. A woman of color with skin or hair problems would be better advised to make an appointment with Dr. Taylor or another black dermatologist to get specific advice to help your specific problems. If you have health insurance, one appointment with a dermatologist should not cost to much more than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Flawless Find!","review":"In the midst of the summer's challenges for skin and hair,I am thrilled to have found Dr. Taylor's book. Dr.Taylor has included so much valuable information in a very accessible format. She appeals to our common sense which makes her suggestions palatable and easy to follow. The reader does not walk away feeling bad about choices previously made in the area of hair and skin care. Rather you feel motivated to succeed in moving in a new direction. So often advisors in these areas relish giving advice with out regard for the client. Dr. Taylor's approach is quite different. Her specific suggestions along with product names leave the reader feeling capable. Finally, the fact that Dr. Taylor is a physician gives this reader greater confidence in her advice. Additionally as a woman of color and mother of two girls, I know she can relate to my experiences. Thank you Dr. Taylor for walking us through the maze!A MUST FOR THE HOLIDAY LISTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for.","review":"I didn't realize there weren't any pictures in this book. Based on the cover I thought there would be pictures to go with the recipes. I thought the recipes were a little weird and they did not sound appetizing. The only thing \\"bariatric\\" about this book is that every recipe can be blended into a pure'. But any food in general can be turned into a blended meal just by throwing it into the blender. I didn't see any thing special about these recipes and with out a picture to go with it I have a hard time immagining what it should look like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"I found this book to be both informative and very practical.

I received this book as a gift after my gastric bypass. It has been a pain trying to adjust to \\"real\\" food after several months of soft food. Plus I am an inexperienced cook. So I tried out a few recipes. The victims of my culinary efforts consist 1 WLS patient, 1 dieter and one regular eater. ALL pronounced the shrimp bisque one of the best they'd ever eaten. Trust me it was the recipe, not the cook. I've made one of the desserts and the partially finished product tasted great (gets served tonight).

After trying many others like this, I found too many focused on the word \\"diet\\" instead of the healthy lifestyle change that really occurs with bariatric surgery, and many others had hard to find ingredients for strange recipes.

And even a timeline as to when you can eat it.. and how.I have tried several recipes and they are very enjoyable. The cover recipes is especially good.The only thing I caution is that the time frames for many of the dishes are not in accordance with what my doctors advise. However, each doctor is different and you should follow what they say no mater what. The book is only a guideline and can't encompass every doctors wishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I thought it'd be...","review":"This cookbook was soooooooo disappointing. Judging from all the good reviews this book has, I thought it'd be great. I was wrong.There are tons of omelet recipes - who doesn't know how to make an omelet?!And there were only a few pages of desserts, while there are almost 20 pages of sauce recipes.Most the other recipes have ingredients I cannot find in my local grocery store. Maybe if you live in a big city it'd be easier, but I live in a small town. I even tried going to a grocery store in a bigger town (35 miles away!) and STILL couldn't find 3/4 of the ingredients.I thought this would be a cookbook about \\"everyday eating.\\" Like conversions of 'everyday recipes' into more manageable portions, or variations thereof. When it does convert a normal recipe, it's usually just \\"use splenda instead of sugar\\" or some generic statement like that. Now that's just common sense.It was a complete waste of money for me.

Let's not kid ourselves or others. Without the latter, this series would not have been as commercially successful. Comprising some shorter pensive stories, the two longer stories here are quite surprising. The first involves Asaemon in diffusing a volatile situation by agreeing to a marriage proposal. The final outcome also was a surprise. The second long story involves an erotic tale of a woman with an ugly tattoo on her back. She is nicely drawn here, though. The depictions are not suitable for the young. So far, the artful depictions of this nature indicate that the artist was pandering to the expectations of his audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"fishing for kids","review":"One of the reels had the line very tangled up and had to re-line the entire reel.

I also found the incest to be a little disturbing, and not in a good horror movie kind of way. Like an I want my brain scrubbed out kind of way.

It includes the first AMITYVILLE which has some geniuine scare. The number two film is pre-equal and based loosely on the tragic Defeo massacre, this particular flick has many chills and subversive elements. Film number three is the reason this collection only got a 4 star rating. Its awful it was originally released in 3D and has nothing to do with anything. The collection is redeemed by AMITVILLE CONFIDENTIAL, which includes behind the scenes of the remake and two compelling HISTORY channel documentaries HOOROR OR HOAX and HAUNTING.

If you are just looking for lots of waves, fun music and great maneuvers, this is not the film for you. The film goes through a daily routine of professional (yet unsponsored) surf champion Pauline Menczer with other female surfers, and makes a great point that it is completely wrong that a female surfer of this caliber has not received a sponsor. It demonstrates the lack of support for women's as compared to mens surfing. Unfortunately, between the lengthy unnecessary off-beach scenes and the annoyingly feminine commentary, it was difficult for my husband and I to sit through, unlike the other 20+ quality surf films we own.

Hinduism is not as oppressive as Ms. Mehta would have you believe. The majority of Hindu women in India and around the world have equal opportunities to go to school, have a family, work and become business and political leaders.Hindu worship includes prayers to goddesses. Ancient Hindus saw women as the giver of life and thus women and goddesses were revered. India has even had a woman Prime Minister.Please keep an open mind. Don't believe everything you see and read.

Although there is not much gore and nudity, the film would have easily been rated R for the language if it was actually in English.Although I feel it probably does misrepresent Hindu culture, I have different qualms about the film.The ENTIRE movie is heartbreaking and there is NO positive resolution. I think Sophie's Choice is a softer movie. Very few films I can think of other than horror films could match the amount of disturbing story contexts this movie presents.I had to watch this movie for a class and am SUPER glad I did not waste my money on a film I may have watched for beauty that was obviously very ugly at the core.Save yourself a few hours of agony and do not see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dishonest movie","review":"This is a dishonest movie made by Deepa Mehta. This movie was made with prejudice and innuendos and on lies. Why is this a dishonest movie? Imagine some anti Christian makes a movie based on the LDS and their penchant to have sex with little girls and then project that as Christian culture and character of christians. Now, Imagine such a movie is presented to the non Christian world and they all believe what a horrible religion Christianity and christian people are on how they treat little girls. Although such a story may be based on facts, the lie is the extrapolation of such exceptions to the overall group. Such unfair treatment of widows is somewhere close to 1% of 1% of people there. This is not the culture of Hindus at large. IF you want to see an honest and wonderful movie pn the same subject (Widows) , check out \\"Dor\\".

When her husband dies, the half of them are dead too.So, in this context of prejudices and sacred precepts, between both of them a warm friendship will emerge, but tragic and dark clouds will hover over both to change their lives irrevocably.Remarkable, superb and potent film of this brilliant, talented and sensitive filmmaker.Do not even think for a moment to miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must watch","review":"This is an amazing film about women's oppression as widows in India.

Good and long but doesn't feature Left Eye's extended raps.3.Untouchables Mix- The first remix on the single to have the Left Eye extended rap. Good beat and old sound to it.4.Super Smooth Mix- This is the best remix to me! Has just pads playing through the verses and the drums/beat doesn't come in until the chours & Left Eye's extended rap. Sexy sounding with T-Boz's mature voice belting out the verses.5.DARP Mix- The Dallas Austin produced remix with a Barry White Melody under it. Left Eye raps again and has more vocals during the song. Not too good but it will grow on you after a while.6.Untouchable Instrumental- Self explanitory.......Overall a good single and if you don't fots you should gots!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tlc forever!","review":"i love this song its still the bomb after all this time and it has a rap from our angel lefteye (rip) that you can have access too which is cute with her voice. and also the things that you can also get from creeping. a must have for every tlc fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear -today, but not tomorrow","review":"My major musicial disappointment of the year 2000.

As I've previously stated, I'm a Tempts fan from waaaaaay back, however I have to admit, I won't be playing this very often. Most of these songs are forgettable.

The lead singer has always had a distinct rough quality (David, Dennis, Ali-Ollie) in their voice. The lead on this disc has the more recently popular soul sound - too smooth and nasal. It's OK for Boys to Men, Back Street Boys or N Sync, but I expect the Temps to sound like the Temps. I was disappointed in this disc. I hope things change in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Ears Found This One Very Resistable","review":"As a Temptation's fan for over forty years, I was quite dissappointed by this Grammy winner. I found the tracks to be mediocre at best. It seemed to me that they just rushed to get something out. The Temptations have set a standard over the years that I have come to expect them to live up to. This is a sad follow up to Pheonix Rising. I don't think Temps fan get any more hardcore than I do.

The Temptations have once again proven that the older you get the better. These classic musicians haven't lost their flavor.

My favorite \\"Kiss Me Like U Miss Me\\" is a mood setter with its dramatic bass and smooth melody it is guaranteed to get someone into serious trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TEMPS ARE BACK!","review":"As a life-long, die-hard Temptations fan, I am so happy to see that this new incarnation of the group is living up to the standard for tight harmony and slickness set by the previous members of this legendary group. Otis Williams - the only surviving member of the original Temptations - has obviously taken his time to find the right singers to step into the shoes of David (and Dennis), Eddie and even Ollie. Gerald Levert, et al, have done a good job of capturing the essense of the group's signature style on songs like \\"Elevator Eyes,\\" \\"Party,\\" \\"Selfish Reasons\\" and \\"Got To Get On The Road.\\" \\"Proven And True,\\" and \\"I Just Go Crazy\\" are my personal favorites. And Wanda Hutchinson of the Emotions turns in an inspiring performance with the Temps on \\"Error Of Our Ways.\\" I highly recommend this tape to anyone who is a true fan.

Phoenix Rising is a CD that is worth listening to over and over again. Those who are into \\"Steppin\\" or \\"Swingin' Out\\" know that this album is our anthem. Ear-Resistible just left me hanging on waiting for the tunes to get better but they never did. Whatever chemistry was used to make the Phoenix Rise, the Temps need to go back and get it. In my opinion, it is only on the talent of the performers that this album is able to bring a touch of pleasure.

I waited, and read up to page 111 when I decided I was done with it. And the words are small font so 111 pages should have covered a lot of story, more so than the average book.In this book, history is the main character, so I read a lot about that period, the laws, the landscape, the people, etc. But, I still felt like I didn't know the characters very well. And I also must say there is one main character (beside history) but another character who is close behind. So far the book was from three different character's point of view. Which, sometimes really works (Francine Rivers) but when you throw in tons of historical facts, it leaves you lost and bored. So, needless to say, I am putting it down -unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this (North Star) audio version","review":"Luckily I took this one out from the library.

If you like historical fiction, Bodie Thoene writes some of the best. Her husband, Brock, does the research for the books and their joint effort has produced some of the most interesting books that I've ever read. Her characters are very human and the story line is gripping.

Two months later, I am reading the next series, The Zion Chronicles, about the fight in Jerusalem. I can't get enough now of WWII history! This book and the four others taught me so much. I was a little disappointed in the ending of the last book. It was excellent but some characters were not developed to their utmost. A hurried ending. I am just so impressed with these series, and I want another series with these characters expanded. I liked the character of Lucy and I think that she could have been developed more.

It's a great book to read again and again. I really learned alot about WWII. There's lots of suspense, action, and romance. I highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping look into the world of 1930's Europe...","review":"With our culture's memory of World War II fading fast, the lessons to be learned grow more important with each day. Bodie Thoene's Zion Covenant series offers a gripping work of fiction with a solid grounding in historical fact. The year is 1936; Elisa Linder lives in Austria as a vionlinist, and considers herself safe from the growing German persecution. With an Aryan mother and a Jewish-German war hero for a father, who would lay a finger on her? Soon, though, she realizes that a well-to-do family and a fake passport won't be enough to keep her safe.When her path intersects with that of John Murphy, a grating American reporter, the story takes a more dynamic turn. Their romance, and the danger that surrounds it, foreshadows the later books in the series. I'd say that Vienna Prelude is the literary equivalent of prime rib and potatoes; there's some great meat, and you'll come away wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"The romantic parts of this novel are not very believable, but the historical setting is fascinating. It reminds us of the horrors of Germany/Austria during the late 1930's and how some people must have reacted. Some of the characters were in denial and refused to acknowledge the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"First of a series of excellent historical novels about pre WW2","review":"Bodie Thoene has written an excellent series called the Zion covenant that deal with Hitler's efforts to exterminate the Jews and take over the world in the late 1930's. This book is a historical novel that begins the story and does a better job of accurately telling the story that current history texts. And it does it with romance as well. It should be mandatory reading for High School students."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Are Starting A Great Book","review":"This is the first book of \\"The Zion Covenant\\" series.

The design [form-factor], and are a bit smaller than the standard controller. I don't like the placement of the back and start button.

A waste of fine acting talent. A waste of time watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middle class tragedy","review":"I hate movies like this one. I'd rather watch another James Bond.The issue is, they are too true. Bond is reassuringly irrelevant.A professor and a lawyer in Connecticut are driving at night with their kids in the car. One gets a call from his nervous ex-wife, is distracted, has an accident, kills the other's little son, is afraid to lose his own little son, drives away from the accident, and has become a criminal by personal weakness.I hate movies with dead children.I think the Brits are right, they have introduced new laws which make use of handphones while driving punishable by prison time, irrespective of the effect of the call.Good acting, a truly tragic basic constellation, but not a perfect script. The tension, the suspense, get wasted by hanging on too long. The story line would require a shorter solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excruciating","review":"Great plot in this suburban hit-and-run tale that puts two mild-mannered New England guys on a collision path. Mark Ruffalo is ideal as the lawyer who doesn't stop after hitting Joaquin Phoenix's son on a dark road in surburban Connecticut. This is so well done that it seems almost plausible, except the cops would not give up so easily in real life. The most glaring unlikelihood is when a trooper doesn't bother to look in Rufallo's garage during a neighborhood canvas for the crime vehicle. Otherwise, this is top notch movie making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overcasting at it's Finest","review":"This is a perfect example of overcasting and further proof that even the greatest actors can't save a poor screenplay.

A young boy is killed in a hit and run accident and it shows how the parents deal with the loss and what the man who hits the child goes through.While the plot at first reminded me of a lifetime movie the actors and actresses made all the difference in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo give stand out performances in this movie. For me they presented themselves like I have never seen them before. The emotion Joaquin gave in his performance was unbelivable. Even the two child stars of the film gave great performances and added to the chemistry of the film.Great movie with wonderful performances!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Performance by Mark Ruffalo; Not so much for the rest","review":"As a father I found this movie almost difficult to watch at times due to its honest and raw portrayal of the loss of a child. Mark Ruffalo turns in a truly incrdible performance I thought and shows a whole new side of his acting that we haven't see in his other performances. The rest of the cast I wasn't as impressed with. Jennifer Connelly was either not given any direction or didn't have enough material to work with other than to look sad. Joaquin Phoenix I've enjoyed in his other roles but I didn't find him very convincing in this film. His dialogue and performance felt forced and unnatural."},{"rating":"2","title":"OSCAR material","review":"Sometimes the sad things in life make the best movies. All characters were excellent in their performances especially Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo. I think of Ruffalo as a \\"good\\" guy. I didn't like seeing him as the \\"bad\\" guy in this movie.

Come on guys ... were you in THAT much of a hurry to get this book on the shelves that you couldn't have reviewed it first? Did you write this book in one night? Syntax is very important, ESPECIALLY in a programming book! This book is HORRIBLE and USELESS because of all the typos. You stole my money. Mind giving me a refund?2. Screen Shots WAY too small ... I had to break out the magnifying glass to read the screen shots. The screen shots (for the most part) are actually correct. The text is usually not.3. Last but not least, the flow of this book is enough to make you want to give up learning ASP.NET. The instructions are too confusing. For example: \\"Step 1: Create a new web form\\". Huh? This example on page 92 has nothing to do with creating a web form!I would not recommend this book to anyone. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent release","review":"I am not much into live albums, but this is one of the best ones i have ever heard. For me to like a live album it has to be really good and this one meets all expectations. THe sounds is great you can feel like your part of the audience. The track listing is UNBELIEVABLE. ALmost every great Danzig song is on here. Its like having a greates hits and a live album all in one. If you are a Danzig fan then this is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs, TERRIBLE Sound Quality!","review":"I'll keep this review consise and to the point. This live album features some of Danzig's best songs. However, the sound quality it terrible. Danzig's voice often cannot be heard at all and the instruments also tend to fade in and out. For comparison, only the Misfit's \\"Live Evil\\" has worse sound!I cannot recommend this album. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should've known.","review":"I remember seeing Danzig in 1995 and even though I love Danzig's studio stuff I remember finding their live performance very weak. I have read that Glenn dislikes doing concerts and it is cleary audible in this CD. The vocals are weak and inaudible in many parts and the overall mix and recording make it sound as though it was done on a concertgoers contraband tape recorder. I wanted to believe that Danzig had gotten better in the last few years but it is obvious that the live stuff is still weak. And even though, as a previous review says, it is a \\"truly\\" live CD that doesn't mean it is fun to listen to or that it is worth the price. So in my opinion wait for the next studio album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance and Recording","review":"The old Misfits live recordings sound better than this. All of the performances are lame and the only reason it gets one star is because of John Christ's guitar playing..... and even that isn't worth the price of this CD. So far Glenn owes me about $40. $15 for that horrible fifth album (Techno?) and $25 for this one. Until I get a check, Jerry and Doyle are the keepers of the flame in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to say this, but........","review":"First of all I would like to clear up that I am a huge Danzig fan and I love all the cd's he has put out, untill now. The song selection is incredible and with all the hype that was going on for this cd coming out I was really excited when I bought it, only to be dissapointed. There has got to be better versions of the songs that were put out, as on most of the songs you can bairly make out what Glen is singing. And when he is singing it is not the normal deep smooth voice that we are accustomed to, but it sounds very raspy as his yelling goes from high to low frequency. Basically it sounds like he is constantly moving the microphone towards and away from his face, denying us the full potential that this album should have given us. Again I'm sorry to have put out a bad review on an Album from Danzig, but that's how I feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be much better","review":"The sound recording is rather poor, not just because of vocal drop outs but also the overall quality. Live albums should have that stereo depth sound that makes them cool; this one does not, as it sounds more like it was recorded on a cheap tape recorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't wait for the \\"Remastered Version\\"!","review":"Granted, the setlist is glorious, but the sound quality of these cd's suck. Ok, Disc 1 ws recorded in '92 and 94', (it's very much listenable as a good bootleg), but that doesn't excuse it for sounding bad, it was only 9 years ago. On to disc 2. Simply put, sounds even worse. Sounds like it was recorded on a \\"boombox\\"! Man, I dig Danzig alot, but if my garage band put this out, I would be embarrassed. Long live Danzig!! Peace out."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible mix","review":"To say this album was mixed would be at best, stretching the truth. Vocal's are buried, so buried that you can't even make out the lyric's. It's bad on disk one, gets a bit better on a few track's on disk two and then proceeds to get even worse. Band sound's thin, which any Danzig fan will know is not true when your there live. Not a good recording. I love live recording's and I will listen to this one again, but believe me this is as raw as it gets. At one point John Christ's guitar goes out for a quick second or two. Nice looking j-card, some good pix's. I always thought it should be the other way around. Bottom line, as a music fan you have to have it for the collection, just don't expect a quality live recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at Best","review":"I love Danzig but have to admit that this cd is a waste of money. First of all I thought the cover art looks...cheesy. Does not have the same classic dark look as I'm used to with Danzig. The first cd I think sounds pretty good. Not great but its very listenable and I enjoy it. The second cd recorded during the Satans Child tour is [not very good] though. ...I'm only halfway through it and I'm about to turn it off. I cannot recommend this cd set because its only mediocre at best..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, Save Your Money","review":"I'm a big Danzig fan but I cannot believe how bad this album is. Not only is the recording quality awful but Glenn couldn't even bother to keep from pulling the mike away from his mouth before he was done singing. You end up with words cut off and what you do hear is bad, anyway. I should have listened to the reviews but I thought, \\"How bad can it be?\\" Really, really, bad. On the other hand, I don't look down on overdubbing live albums so much anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"what's with the free frisbee?","review":"This is a terrific live album, the last chance we'll ever have to hear the real Danzig--but why in the world is the price a little inflated just for the inclusion of a miniature flying disk with the tribal skull logo on it? (The one put in behind the album itself, in the double jewel case). I mistook it for a CD and made the mistake of putting it in my player; boy, did I ever regret that! I think it might have torn it up or something, at least it sounded that way. It made terrible noises. Never mind; give the frisbee to the kids and enjoy the October 31 show."},{"rating":"2","title":"definatly live and rare","review":"The first cd is awsome with the origanal line up and has rare tracks from that era of the band. the second cd gets a little weird with the 90 s techo songs but has old school songs at the end of the set .Definatly a keeper even if the second cd is is more experimental Danzig.If you like Danzig or have seen any line up the band you will like this cd set ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad sound quality..Even for a Live Album.","review":"1 disc is for the \\"Oldies\\" and the other one is for the newer songs. the quality leaves little to be desired. what Happened? some of the songs could have come out awesome, but Ive heard bootlegs with better quality than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Bad Review???","review":"Why would someone review this in a - manner?

This has to be WITHOUT A DOUBT the worst sounding live record ever recorded. Evilive sounds like THX surround sound compared to this pice of dog crap. How could someone put this out for sale? The mixing engineer needs to be beaten repeatedly. Did I mention that this album is AWFUL? ESPECIALLY disc 2. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ollie's review","review":"I am a die-hard Danzig fan and I agree that disc two has some recording flaws but the album itself is great. A lot of cool songs are on this one, lots of stuff you might not hear at every show. It's not an album I would give to someone who's never heard Danzig but if you're familar with Danzig's catalogue no doubt you can enjoy this album. The above review is a bit harsh. I give it four stars; one star off for technical problems and for no new/unreleased songs. However, Kudos to Glenn for including Haloween II and Deep from the X-files soundtrack. If you own three or more Danzig albums....get this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed! If I wanted a bootleg a would have got 1 !","review":"\\"Official release\\" BULLFLOP!

I hope Glen understands this and releases something better. Marc G.

It is too bad that it sounds like it was mixed with equipment from the Big Band era. This is a very poorly mixed disc; the sound quality is often terrible. Sometimes they even lose Danzig singing. If you like Danzig, wait until the next studio. If you love him, I'll sell you my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry this was released.","review":"Let me start off by saying I'm a huge Danzig fan. I have loved every project he has been a part of. When I heard there was a live album in the works that spanned the last 7 years, I was excited to say the least. After hunting this album down (No one knew when it was being released due to bad planning) I rushed to the nearest cd player. Well...let me say, from start to finish, this 2 disk set sounds like a bad bootleg. Not only can you not hear Danzig's vocals, but the insturments sound out of key and muffeled. I have seen Danzig in concert 3 times and never has he sounded this horrible. The reason I give this album 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the interseting set list. However, what's the use of having great live songs if you cannot understand them. Try again Mr. Danzig."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy it used..if you have to buy it at all","review":"1st disk not bad...but the 2nd just sucked a**. Sound quality is horrible and sometimes you can't tell what is the song being \\"played\\".Luckily I didn't buy brand new and found it on the bottom shelf of a used cd store....If you paid more than $5.00 it's not worth it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never thought I'd say this, but I expected better...","review":"Glenn Danzig has always done what he has pleased, but I think he should have reconsidered his live album. Disc 1 is good, its the old lineup and the sound quality is great, but Disc 2's sound quality is so bad its not even funny. Glenn sounds like he's singing in a paper bag, and the distortion makes it sound worse. If you want a Danzig live album, check out his bootleg live albums, they might cost a bit more, but they're sound quality is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not worth it.","review":"When I first got this album, I was highly dissapointed, but I wanted to like it, because I've always been a big Danzig fan. Anyway, I came on here, wrote what was probably the only good review on here, and wasn't surprised to find that not one person found it helpful. Okay, the time has passed and I have to come back and make things clear. \\"Live on the Blackhand Side\\" is not worth your cash, folks. It's a very shoddy recording and I'm surprised that Danzig let it get released. Pick up the albums instead and leave this one sitting on the shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest headphones i have ever heard","review":"when you plug these in a stereo and turn up the bass, mid, and treble it is quite amazing. the also cancel noise very well too. with this price it is the perfect product"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"these headphones are ok. slightly too tight (i do have a big head). and the sound quality is average. i do not reccomend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than average headphones","review":"I would rate them with 5 stars , but the cord is about 2 foot to short and I had to buy an extender in order to use the headphones as I intended to when I purchased them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carpe Diem","review":"When I first bought these headphones I was quite pleased with them. They delivered richness in sound while effectively neutralizing outside noise. But after about a month the sound in the left earpiece began to fade in and out leaving one to fiddle with the cord until some semblence of sound quality had returned. Now unless one holds the cord at an odd angle around the volume control there is no audible sound from the earpiece. I don't know whether it's just my pair or not because a very large electronics chain wouldn't give me another pair(I'm looking at you Circuit City).

A few weeks later I always regret it because these guys are the definition of a sell-out band. Their first CD \\"Lemonade & Brownies\\" was much heavier than any of the subsequent releases. They strike me as a band that is always concerned with writing that radio hit. Mark McGrath, self-admittingly, can't sing and the rest of the band is competent, but nothing spectacular muscially.I'm not against mainstream rock at all, I just think this band is too into it for the hits. It's too bad, because I don't think they are such bad songwriters. There lyrics suck, but that's another review."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INCREDIBLE MASTERPEICE------W+O+W!!","review":"I am just too shocked to hardly make sence of my suddent incredible admiration of sugar-ray! This is amazing, sugar-ray suddenly went from an \\"ok\\" previouse album to an incredible burst of brilliantly built masterpeices of music. This album has some of the best pop-rock you will EVER find, it has melody (and I mean MELODY), rythym, attitude, classic-ness, modern-ness, and a mixture of music that is hardly beleivable to beleive has come from sugar ray, who used to be a hard-rock oriented band. Each and every song gave me goose-bumps, I LOVE this album, it is absolutely great. If you want a flawless mixture of melody and just plain great music, from the talented Sugar-ray main singer, this album is something that you just CANNOT miss! Dont hesitate, because sugar-ray has just reached their absolute peak, they are currently at their best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1st time buyer of Sugar Ray music and very happy!","review":"This is the first CD of Sugar Ray's that I have purchased and I am very pleased.

The songs are catchy, upbeat, and definitly worth listening to. Since I am a diehard SR fan, I knew i would like this album, but I had no idea that it would never be leaving my CD player. My favorite song from \\"Sugar Ray\\" is \\"Under the Sun.\\" It makes everyone think back to their summer days, even those of us who weren't teens in the 80's. \\"Waiting\\" and \\"Ours\\" proves that Mark McGrath is more than a sexy lead singer <which we all know he is,> he can sing pretty darn well too."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not love this album?","review":"It is very, very rare to find an album out there by any artist that contains songs that are all equally great. You've probably heard \\"When It's Over\\" on the radio or seen the video on TV. Thats a great song, but when you buy this album you might be thinking like I did, that there would be a couple good songs and the rest would be nothing. There's where you are wrong, because every song is great. It's one of those CDs you can pop in your CD player and set the skip and let it play for hours, and you will never have to worry about hearing a bad song. Most of the songs have very cherry up-beat rythyms for depressing topics. Its great to listen to. A few of my favorites include: \\"When It's Over\\", \\"Under the Sun\\", \\"Satellites\\", & \\"Sorry Now\\". You know, it was difficult to pick some favorites because I love them all! You can expect many radio hits and TRL videos out of this album! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great.","review":"I've been a Sugar Ray fan for a while, and I also have their last CD. The new album is a little less diverse, and alittle less fun than 14:59, bot maybe that is because they finally found one sound and decided to go with it. Plus the music is just better. Mark McGrath's voice sounds more experienced, and the CD has a new unity. I love the new rock element, and I also enjoyed Waiting and Answer the Phone. It's a great CD, and I would definitely buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown after their previous efforts ...","review":"I've enjoyed both \\"sides\\" of Sugar Ray, the breezy Fly / Every Morning side and harder-edged RPM side. I though Floored was great, and 14:59 softer overall but still great. However, this self-titled album is just not that interesting. Only the hit When It's Over caught my attention, and the rest of the songs just feel like mushy top-40 radio crap. (Of course Fly was top-40, but I never considered it crap.) There is little of the edge, humor, or fun of previous Sugar Ray CDs on this release.If you have the two popular albums already, I would suggest that Lemonade and Brownies is a much more interesting and fun (and LOUDER and raunchier) CD than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"ya gotta buy this one !!!","review":"Sugar Ray is back and this cd is different than their first two cds (less heavy metal)but I think this is their best cd so far there isn't 1 bad song on this cd the guys of sugar ray have major talent and mark has such a great voice if you don't have this cd go and buy it right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocking!","review":"This is an awesome Cd.If you like rock you would love this Cd.From slow to fast in beat.The beat is great.Great singing.Really smooth.My favorite song would have to be When It is Over track 2 and track 6 these sounded best.Great for all Sugar Ray fans and alternitve fans.Reminds me me of Blink 182 a little except not the bad lyrics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY dissapointing!","review":"after i bought this cd, i got sick of it after 3 listens.

I thought 14:59 was amazingly good, bordering on great. This album is okay. I like a lot on it. But not much of it grabs me, and makes me just crazy in love with the songs, like the last one. I've only listened to it once, so maybe it will grow on me. But I loved the last album instantly. Mark McGrath and Stan Frazier went to my high school (I missed them by a year) so I have a sentimental reason for wanting them to be GREAT. And I'm sure they will be again. This album still ranks better than most other stuff out there. But it's more good background party music, than one you sit down with headphones, and listen to with no distractions like 14:59... It's NOT a reversion to their old sound (which I'd read this might be, and was something I dreaded). The songs here have the basic feel of the sounds of 14:59's EVERY MORNING and FALLS APART...but not nearly as good as those. Not nearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"i listen to it all the time!","review":"sugar ray so rocks! ok i really like this cd (aposed to the sugar ray cds) because, i don't know but i did. it had a really cool sound and all the songs were really good and you hardly ever find a cd where that is true. and mark mcgrath is not the only fine member of this band either (but he is fine). so go buy the cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This is the best example of selling out I have ever seen.

RPM was an enjoyable little diddy, but as soon as they found out they'd make more money with that poppy acoustic rock, they got on their knees to make the audiences happy. Although the CD is okay, it's too poppy for me. The best treat is by far the song \\"Stay On\\" with Nick Hexum, frontman of the band 311. Many people fail to realize Hexum's vocals on this though, therefore it will be skipped. Overall, this should appeal to all the bubblegum pop fans, as well as the blink 182 teenyboppers out there.Music fans can pass on this one though, you've heard it before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cookie cutter LA band....so what!","review":"Sugar Ray is meaningless fun and nothing more.

It is definitely more pop than Sugar Ray's past albums but it works for them! They have some great stuff on here, my favs are \\"Stay On,\\" which has a funky, reggae beat that forces you into a good mood, and \\"Waiting,\\" which is very pop but also a great song. I cried when I listened to it the first time.. the lyrics are just really touching.

Parker's Spenser series. I'm done waiting. The last three books, ending with Chance, have bored me to death. Chance is the piece-de-resistance. I kept waiting for the mystery to show itself. Turns out, there wasn't one. Spenser spent the whole book following someone around Las Vegas. Parker's early Spenser books are gems, but don't waste your time with Chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally Well Done","review":"The thing about Spencer novels is the presentation of the main characters; Susan, Hawk, and especially Spencer are cool. Because the books are written from a first person perspective, there is a special opportunity for audio books. Burt Reynolds takes advantage of that opportunity. His character portrayals are excellent.Reynolds delivery is outstanding. He doesn't try too hard. His timing is great. Sometimes it's almost like he is talking specifically to me, not to a room of people - like he is responding to my feedback or something! He portrays the characters as I imagined them before I ever listened to a Spencer audiobook. (I didn't watch the TV series more than a couple times.)Even without Reynolds, \\"Chance\\" is an interesting story, with a good balance between action & dialog, plot & character development. With Reynolds, it is six stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chance is no gamble","review":"No need to gamble when you pick up a Spenser novel. You know the tough wisecracking hero and his supercool sidekick Hawk will beat the odds and come out fine. Spenser stirs up the entire Boston mob scene, and takes some of them along on a junket to Vegas in this highly entertaining yarn. Fights and dead bodies pop up almost as frequently as Hawk's sage advice to Spenser. One thing you can bet on - Spenser's justice will prevail. Anybody who has ever enjoyed a Spenser novel will certainly not be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Spenser","review":"No fat, terse good humor, best good bad guys out there. While the story is great (Spenser and Hawk go to Vegas looking for somebody and things become convoluted, of course), what's wonderful about Parker's books are the writing itself, his dialogue and the characters. I didn't like the first Spenser novel I read (a more recent one) and waited a long time to try another but am glad I did. Parker's terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burt Reynolds is a \\"tough guy\\", sight unseen","review":"Being new to Robert B. Parker, I listened to this tape because Burt Reynolds as a narrator seemed a good fit for the synopsis. It turns out that he does more than just read the book - he becomes almost all of the characters. By the end of the story he has become 7 or 8 different people, and kept all of the voices straight -- even the women. If you like his style and you like mysteries, you'll be sitting in your driveway when you get home from work, waiting for the right moment before turning off the engine and going inside"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chance by Robert B.

Even before the trip, my son was practice casting in the back yard with a casting plug on the line and problems became evident immediately. The retrieve was gritty and hard for him to manage without help. The line would occassionally foul inside the housing and I had to perform \\"open heart surgery\\" (which *never* happens with \\"real\\" Zebco kit). I wound up replacing it shortly after the trip with a Zebco Authentic 11 Micro combo which is still going strong almost 4 years later.

These rods are impossible to take apart in order to rewind the spool.

The color is well coated on the wood, they are thick enough that my young toddler (she got these at 13 months and is now 17 months) can pull them off and place them back on metal. The colors are bright, the shapes are rounded so no hard edges. The box has one A-Z in upper case, and one in lower case. My daughter has been playing with them for four months - she sticks them on the dishwasher, the bottom of the fridge, plays with them with her blocks, etc. No issues with chipping, fading, disentigrating, peeling, etc. She has put them in her mouth, but hasn't bit or chewed them so I can't say what would happen if one did that.

They were very well received, however after less than 30 minutes, they were showing wear on the colored sides. Granted, they were briefly sucked on, but I am totally disappointed in this product. Kids put things in their mouths, and creating wood magnets that seem to have a sticker front that is susceptible to this kind of wear is ridiculous. When I ordered wood magnets, I expected them to be painted wood with magnetic backs. I was not expecting a sticker front that doesn't last well and doesn't wear well getting wet. If you want good looking magnets and you can keep them dry, then these would work. If you have any children that want to taste objects, don't get these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as I had hoped ...","review":"I received these a couple of days ago, and frankly am disappointed with the quality. They are ok, but be warned that previous reviews stating that the magnetic letters are painted with a nice shiny enamel appear to now be out of date. Mine appear to be wood with a shiny colored paper adhered to the front. Not awful, but not what I was led to expect. Also, I wish the sizing were more uniform -- some of the lowercase letters (t,f) look like they are a little bit too small compared to the rest. Again not a big deal, but I expected something better from Melissa and Doug. My kids so far love to play with them regardless of these shortcomings. I do like that the full backing of the letters is magnetic so I don't have to worry about little magnets coming loose and being a choking hazard for my little ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!","review":"We were looking for magnetic alphabets for our 2 yr old daughter but we were really concerned with the ones available in the stores. We were finding the alphabets that had small magnets that if they fell off she could swallow it. The entire back of these alphabets are magnets.Our daughter absolutely loves playing with her letters. My only complaint is that while there are 52 pieces, I wish there were more pieces because some words take more than 2 of the same letter. Also, you need to be careful with them near water. We have a water and ice dispenser on our fridge and our daughter put some of her magnets on the little shelf of the dispenser when we weren't paying attention. After a few minutes the wooden letter had soaked up some of the water from the tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting better from M&D!","review":"I was expecting better quality from Melissa and Doug since I have some of their other products.These DO NOT fall into the better made quality I am used to. The letters which I thought would be all wood are not.They have a paper coating which will come off with use. But the part I hate the most is the acrylic sliding cover that comes off wayyyyyyy to easy. All the child has to do is tilt the box just a little and the lid slides right off as well as all the letter we just put back in the box! This could have been prevented by just putting a little lip on the lid so it locked into place just a little but still allowing the child to remove and replace the lid. Since these are not going to last long and the price was ok, I will replace with better quality ones later.DISAPPOINTED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT durable! So disappointed!!!","review":"We just got these for our 12 month old daughter. I know that it says not for under age 3 because of choking hazard, but after reading other reviews, I was convinced that these weren't likely a choking hazard. And they're not. But they're not durable for a child who puts things in their mouth. The magnets are the entire size of the letter, so ingesting or choking on a small magnet won't happen and the letters are quite large. We put them on the refrigerator about an hour ago and my little one just crawled up with the letter \\"I\\" in her mouth. When I took it away, I noticed that all the paper/colored part of the letter has completely melted off or bubbled up. These letters are not going to survive the mouthing stage! I just went and took them all off the refrigerator! She can have them back when she's a little older.

Welll, the dimensions are the box dimensions (who cares.??.)...needless to say when I got the set, right on the box said it \\"not for children under 3\\"...It might be a good idea for the maker or Amazon to put a piece in the ad so we can see the actual size of the piece.

It has bright colors, and unlike most sets, actually comes with lower-case letters. My toddler is totally in love with these letters, being at that age that just now identifies every letter with ease. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because my son, like quite a few his age, likes to chew on things, and although I don't find these large letters to be a choking hazard, I did notice that the colored \\"enamel\\" on the front of the letters is just a glazed paper that begins to peel after a few good chomps from a 3-year old.

Pressed wood that reeks of formaldehyde with a white paper layer on top and thin color paper (no paint on these).The magnet layer is thin and is not cut well, leaving many black pieces out of the box to fall all over the place.The best thing about this is the storage box it comes with, but that isn't worth the price or mess of dealing with the useless letters.

The wooden letters are covered on one side with a thin piece of colored paper instead of being painted. The paper peels off too easily and the wood is coarsely finished which makes them easy to splinter. They do hold fairly decently on surfaces such as the refrigerator or oven door.

My son is already thrilled to point out all the letters he knows and put the baby letters (that is what we are calling them for now) with the momma letters.

So when my son was around 2 years old, I figured it was about time to get a set for our home. We were fortunate enough to get this set as a gift. I was truly impressed! This set is by far superior to any others I've seen on the market. They're large and colorful, and the entire back of the letter is a magnet. Not just one little square. They really stay put on the fridge! I also like that they're wood. Sure, bite marks would probably show up more on the wood than on plastic.

It's good to be careful these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Typical Melissa & Doug Quality","review":"I have purchased many Melissa & Doug toys, because I feel quality and safety is worth the higher price tag. But I was not pleased with the magnets. All of their other wooden toys are painted, so I expected the letters to also be painted. They aren't. Instead, it is a paper lining over the letter, which easily came off into my sons mouth moments after opening the package. My friend purchased cheap plastic letters at a local store, and is much happier with hers. I wish I had done the same.

These magnets are supposed to be wood- but it's more like a very thin balsa wood with a thick painted paper glued on top. Not what I was expecting.On top of that, this set has a lead warning on HealthyStuff.org. It contains medium levels of lead - much higher than what is safe or even acceptable for toys.I used to really like Melissa and Doug toys when they were actually hand made in the USA. Now everything is made in China and apparently they are not keeping on top of their lead (and other toxins) levels in their toys.

Can't do it...there seems to be only one upper case A and one lower case a, and mixing the two in a word is definitely confusing. I would have assumed most of the extra letters would be vowels. I also dislike the \\"font\\", if you will, because the letters don't always seem clear to me or fully representational (like ones you'd print block style if a child asked you to). I think next time I would go with an upper case only set...when she asks me, \\"What's this letter?\\" it's a bummer that I don't know whether to tell her it's an L or an I. I'm going to get a new set, maybe with smaller letters for actually making lots of words...she's almost three and I'm not concerned about the choking hazard issue.

I initially was going to purchase the fridgephonics ones but the when i heard the letters , I decided the sound was too annoying to be heard everyday and bought these instead. Like any M&D; fan, I did not think twice once i saw these. really nice looking, seem sturdy enough ..most important a whole magnet instead of little pieces which can easily come off. The only con though is that they are too easy to be misplaced.. especially when a toddler grabs and runs them around the house..not a real con of the product though. i emaild the customer service and got a very prompt reply that as of yet they do not sell individual letters so i made a couple of alphabets at home to compensate the ones I lost.Overall a great product which pleases the eye and is wonderful to handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"The \\"behind the head\\" design and low price are the best aspect about these cheap headphones.the sound quality is ok... but if you want to hear bass you're not going to like these and you will be disappointed.

Well, Koss seems to be a company that doesn't get it.The sound of the KSC11 is pretty good. The bass isn't the deepest, but it's $10. If it were more, like $20, we would have a problem. The sound of these is truly a value.The main problem I have with these is a big one. They hurt badly. Not badly like if you move them they feel better, more like pounding someone's head. They sure are uncomfortable.Another problem with these is sound. They have a low output, making the highest volumes quiet.The sound may be good on the KSC11, but because of the comfort and output, these are unrecommeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts with Bad sound and bad design","review":"I was looking for some cheap headphones so got these since Koss had good name in headphones. They hurt above ear when you wear them even for 2 mins. When I hooked them to my Onkyo system, the sound was bad. Only treble and no bass. Sounded like stones rattling in Tin Cans. I ordered Seinheiser HD202 with this for my office use and man ! those rock. Slightly larger than it seems in picture on most sites but the sound is so amazing that I am returning these Koss and getting those by putting some $14 extra.

We find this product to be well worth the money and are completely satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"I purchased this bean bag and it only lasted three months.

More of a very bright orange, instead of the more natural, subtle color shown in the picture, but my son doesn't mind.

This novel restored my shattered belief that you should never give up on searching for that divine soulmate. It made me laugh, cry and even exhale!

It's so easy to swear off love and relationships. But reading this book reminded me that you must continue to trust your inner voice.

The novel was written more like a poorly written romance novel. McCann had some good story ideas and some touching moments in the book, but overall I found the book boring and predictable--I knew what was going to happen before I got half way through the book. I just could not feel anything for the charachters. For those of you who found the book great and realistic, I suggest that you try Cheaters by EJ Dickey, Waiting in Vain by Colin Channer, Cup of Love by Franklin White, or If This World Were Mine by E.

You understood Betty's hesitation when it came to relationships with the opposite sex; you understood Jacqui's harsh attitude towards men and you felt for Drew and his lose.

Drew suffers hearbreak over a lost love, but the reader is never clear as to whether that love was fully reciprocated.Betty and Drew both make attempts to find love and affection in the arms of others while developing an on-line friendship.

You can't judge a book by its cover! McCann tells this cyber-love story wonderfully. We've all been down those romantic roads a time or two in our lives; if only all of us could end up with such joy and successes. What I liked most is that you McCann makes you feel like you are a fly on the wall - there during the whole thing.

Blues players who sing, play guitar and put a harmonica on a neckbrace, sometimes playing a little percussion or bass with their feet. Mr. Downchild fits into this subgenre of Blues very nicely.Born in England in 1950, Mr. Downchild, who's real name is Stephen Brazier, has been a student of the old Blues masters for most of his life. He got his stage name from a Sonny Boy Williamson II song and since immigrating to the US in 1985, he's been a real fixture in the midwest Blues scene.In live performances, Mr. Downchild is sometimes backed by a live group, somestimes he goes out as a one-man band. This CD provides an outstanding sampling of what Mr. Downchild can do as a one-man band. He plays all of the instruments on the album live and the results are simply great. There are a lot of full bands out there who should sound as complete as he does. This CD is definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Her Best, but Good Enough....","review":"I agree this is NOT an essential Carmen McRae CD. But repeated listenings grow on the listener. There are studio and live takes on this collection so it presents Carmen in different settings. The live tracks are what make this CD worth getting. Carmen lets loose on several live tracks, even throwing in a 'cuss word on \\"Ain't Nobody's Business\\". The audience responds to Carmen's onstage persona and the listener feels they're at the show as well. Technically, Carmen's voice is in great shape. This period (mid '70s) captures her at a vocal peak. I think this CD is still worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong","review":"Strong introduction to Jaffe's poetry. Raw, quick read.

I love them. I was looking to save a little money and buy on Amazon instead of at a running store, and I was delighted to find these for $20 cheaper than store price. I hadn't seen this color in the store, so I figured maybe this was just last year's model. However, when I got the shoe I noticed that the tongue said \\"Radius Cushion\\". Nowhere on the site did it say that this was the 'cushion' version as opposed to the neutral version. I still like the shoe, it fits very well, but I have had a bit more trouble with shin splints because this shoe is a little less rigid than the ones I was used to wearing. As long as you're ok with a cushioned shoe, this one is perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful clock!","review":"I highly recommend this alarm clock.

My only problem is the dial is not lit up which makes it very difficult to see in the evening or night. At those times you have to depress a light button and then you can see the numbers. Not necessarily desireable for an alarm clock. Had I known this I probably would not have purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU PLAN TO USE IT AS AN ALARM CLOCK","review":"I bought this clock and received it 2 days ago. I like most things about it, it's stylish and sleek...it doesn't seem to be able to use the r wave feature (even though I am in a midatlantic state) but that doesn't bug me too much. What I hate, and find to be an inexcusable flaw, is that the alarm completely shuts off if you press the snooze bar twice... it just stops going off, and I just keep on sleeping, thinking that my alarm is going to go off at any minute. Really seiko, don't you think the alarm should only be turned off by physically turning it off?

Many of these ideas were imbibed at Harvard, in a Cold War culture that saw only a bleak future. It is Ted Kaczynski's mind that fascinates, especially because so many of his views are those of educated Americans. Just how and why the Unabomber turned these views into a murderous passion is absorbing and compelling reading. Chase's great work, rich with new material about the Unabomber, is worthy of major literary prizes. The book is more than a biography; it is a serious reflection on our times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Using the Unabomber","review":"When I started reading this book, I was enthusiastic...but if this is the best book about Kaczynski, it's only because they are all bad. There are interesting bits of information here, but the bits are never developed into detailed facts or believable theories about Kaczynski's life.Instead Chase uses the subject as a way to write yet another diatribe against environmentalists. According to Chase, \\"Restoring 'pre-Columbian conditions' and 'recreating the primitive scene' had become national policy, pursued by all federal land management agencies, including the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Land Management.\\" (p. 99)By the time I managed to stop laughing at the ludicrousness of that comment, I wasn't able to take any of Chase's opinions in the book seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential text for Chinese martial arts","review":"This book gets to the core of everything you can learn about the ancient martial arts of Tai Chi and Chi Gung.

Like Blade Runner, it has a lot of action, it offers something (without hammering it into your head) to think about and surprise... A great yet unannoying love story.The acting is great, story line efficient and visuals will pleasantly keep you lost for the length of the film, and wanting more.Like Blade Runner, it will take you many painless viewings to appreciate how good this film is.To the director, cast & crew: Please send more...

Topics range from her mother moving in with her (which leads to a need for pie) to the Cutest Boy in the World, whose mother makes the Sweet Potato Stuff.

In other words, you have to hold the VCR in place with one hand and push a button with the other or velco it in place. No problem, you might say, cause I'll use the remote all the time.

You have to use the up/down buttons to scroll through the channels. No biggie. Also fast forward/rewind are very fast so when you press stop the tape keeps moving for a while. Again, no biggie.

The remote it terrible. After one month it stopped working. Sony site said to remove the batteries and then press each button twice. This fix lasted about 5 minutes. You must constantly remove the battery and put it back in to get the remote to work.

Don't believe in book burning but I might consider burning this movie to save some future innocent person from having it inflicted upon them."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!","review":"I am easy to please, but this has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! I don't think I laughed once. It was disturbing, stupid and quite \\"racy\\" in spots, there is a lot of sexual talk.

Well, I was wrong. It is downright awful. Vince and Reece do the best job they can with a terrible script that reads more like a horror movie than a holiday comedy. There are a few humorous moments, but for the most part, I shuddered throughout the entire film, wondering what horrible things would happen to these poor people next. The one good thing about the movie is that it's super short, so if you do decide to be brave and watch it, you won't have to suffer for very long. However, I suggest steering clear of this one altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"You had better watch out...this movie will make you cry (it's that bad)!","review":"I believe this is my first one-star review. I was really looking forward to a new Christmas-themed movie when I saw this film last Christmas (2008). I thought that with such a star-studded cast the film would be fantastic. What a huge disappointment! The film was full of opportunities but failed to follow-up in any meaningful way. I'm not against comedy (and comedy can be meaningful), but for the most part the jokes and physical comedy were rather lame. If you saw the promotional trailer, you saw the best this film has to offer. Save your money. It's not even worth watching on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing makes for a poor movie","review":"We watched this hoping for a good laugh & ended up with an occasional smile. There are several Oscar winners in this film. But there were also four writers. Doesn't matter how good the actors are if the material is poor, there's only so much that can be done with it. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like","review":"Thought it would be a fun Christmas movie to watch. It turned out to be a bit raunchy from the onset for family viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No heart, more crude than cute","review":"I was attracted to the star line up and the story had promise but fell very flat. This could have been a classic holiday movie unfortunately this movie has too many crude moments to be funny. Makes fun of red necks, Cougars, and aging California hippies to an extreme I found tiring. For some context to this remark, I liked Billy Bob Thorton in Bad Santa but it had more depth than Four Christmas which does not have the heart one looks for in a holiday movie whether a comedy, romance, drama or action movie. I made it through once but, I will not watch this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dvd stopped in the middle and I could not see half of it so not satisfied with instant play.

It was totally unwatchable after about 10 minutes. I was stunned by how terrible it is in acting, story line, egos, etc. I let a younger co-worker borrow it since she had not seen it yet. I hope she is still my friend after she watches it. OMG!!! It is soooo awful. Put your hard earned money in a shredder rather than buy this disc. It is toxic to the senses!"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Christmases to forget","review":"I agree with the 1 star reviews. There are some great stars in this movie and I love Reese Witherspoon.

I am donating my copy to Goodwill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!","review":"Updated on December 24th, 2010;In honor of today being Christmas Eve, I thought I'd review this movie.

Both Brad and Kate's moms are cougars, and Brad's dad is old skool country.

I exspected to see a funny family comedy. Dont get me wrong, i already was prepared for some things my children shouldnt watch but people said it was a \\"Great Family movie\\". Well they were wrong. In the first 3 minutes there are VERY sexual references, about 3 or 4 cuss words, and Reese and Vince went into the bathroom and it shows them kissing and her wrapping her legs around him and suggests some very innapropriate behavior. Also there are very innapropriate things like a six or seven year old boy streaking, a woman talking about the \\"pains of breast feeding\\", and a thirty or so man having an affair with like a 60 year old woman, who often talk about what they do in bed.Trust me there are more than that but you get the picture. My kids were horrified at this movie. If were you i would steer clear of this bad apple."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a family film","review":"I love Romantic Comedies - this wasn't either.I did not make it through the first 5 minutes of this film. I had to turn it off and warn everyone it was nasty. Within the first five minutes, you have a sleezy bar scene where the main characters have a less-than-wholesome discussion (full of vicious put downs), the man Reese Witherspoon's character is supposed to fall in love with calls her a B**** and the next thing you know, they are in the next room with her legs locked around his waist and he has her up against a wall.I guess Hollywood thought a fade scene consists of what happened above followed by the couple exiting the room adjusting their clothes. NO class. If I could give it a negative 20 I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Christmases","review":"This will NOT be a Christmas tradition at our house. It was mean and ugly. Shows only the bad aspects of the holiday and families, none of the good things.

Witherspoon is someone I know and like from other films; I am not a fan Vaughn but he didn't actually annoy me (at least not much). The supporting cast includes people I would watch read the phone book which, come to think of it, would probably have been more entertaining. How any group of people, let alone people as talented as the cast of this film, would decided this script was worth doing, and why any studio would finance it is beyond me. There are at least 6 dozen Christmas comedies that are better written and funnier; find one of them instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie will never become a holiday classic that everyone must see. Disappointing in story, delivery, content, etc. Even for a PG-13 movie, the language and sexual implications were over the top. It weighs in at the bottom of the barrel and personally, I'd recommend you avoid it at all costs. There are simply more delightful ways to get in the spirit. Try Love Actually or for romantic comedy, While You Were Sleeping for your holiday viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good Christmas movie!!!","review":"I did not enjoy this movie for one moment. I love Christmas movies and this one is not to add to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more...","review":"with all the great actors cast in this movie I just expected more from it. The concept was good and I think they could have done a lot more with it. There were a few funny parts but not a lot, I fell asleep near the end of the movie so that tells you how interesting and captivating it was to the viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"triteness + tastlessness=terrible","review":"I think that my title says it all. This movie had real potential with an interesting concept and two bankable stars, but somehow the writers totally missed the boat. The two main characters are live-in lovers who plan to spend Christmas in Fiji, as far away from family as possible. When their flight is fogged in, they feel obligated to visit all four households in their fractured families. The households could have been amusing, but instead they are tasteless and over-the-top. Somehow projectile vomiting by a baby and wrestling matches between grown men did not seem amusing to me. My advice is to rent \\"White Christmas\\" or \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Movie","review":"I was so disappointed in this movie. It was very predictable and parts were plain old annoying. I would not recommend this at all. I love Reese Witherspoon, but she should have thought twice before doing this movie. I bought it is blu ray too because I assumed it would be good. I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't impressed","review":"Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon \\"who could do much better than this movie\\" play an unmarried couple looking to spend their Christmas vacation on an exotic island. Things don't go as planned when their flight is canceled and they wind up visiting relatives which they wanted to avoid doing the most.I found the movie a bit un-involving and even boring at times. Vince Vaughn seems to just do movies if they are a comedy and Jon Favereau is co-starring in it with him. I don't think he even reads the scripts to his films any more. Fred Claus wasn't fantastic, yet this movie makes that look like a Christmas classic. Plus that at least had some charm and heart-warming moments. I'd honesty even watch Christmas with the Kranks again over ever viewing this again. The film has mild laughs but it lacks fun or joy even."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Christmases were enough for me","review":"While this movie effectively alienates or offends married couples, homosexuals, seniors, adult children, mothers, and Christians, it surely has one redeeming quality. Alas, I was not able to endure the film long enough to determine if there was anything that redeemed this film. Indeed, half way through the film, I decided that the ratio of moments of humor to moments of awkwardness, inappropriate sexual situation/double-entendre, or offensiveness did not warrant my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie, not funny, Save your money","review":"What a waste of money and now I see it's only $6.99. What a shame I spent $15.99 on it because the trailer looked funny. This money is a chore to sit thru. Reese is as darling as usual, but the script is lacking. I would not recommend it. My copy has been given away already to someone who wanted to see this movie because she likes the actors in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie","review":"This movie is not intertaining at all. Very crude and disgusting scenes add nothing to the movie. The actors involved in this movie are certainly too good for this \\"let down\\" movie. I was very disappointed in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The terrible, horrible, no good very bad movie","review":"The other one-star reviews say almost everything that needs to be said. 4C's is an absolute stinker of a film.The only thing that hasn't been mentioned by other insightful reviewers is that Vince Vaughn is not really funny at all. He's sarcastic in a rapid-fire but predictable manner.

She shines in this movie. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I really like Reese Witherspoon and had seen a lot of positive promotion for this movie. What a major disappointment. In all honesty I would rank this film among the top 25 worst films I have ever seen. I found very little humor in it. Many of the attempted gags are ripoffs of other successful Christmas movies, including Christmas Vacation. In this film they fall flat. The adult characters all act like back woods idiots. The kids are ill mannered brats. The movie was so annoying I had to turn it off after an hour. Nobody has a perfect family, but Four Christmas paints such a cynical and negative view of families it's actually offensive to watch. I'm really surprised that Reese Witherspoon would agree to this script after her critically acclaimed performance in Walk the Line. This is a major step back for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY??","review":"WHY was the movie made? Really - what was the point? Absolutely pointless and tasteless.

The title track is played first. It starts out like a melodic call then the whole band joins in, a young looking Herbie Hancock is on hand on the piano. This is wonderful music for contemplation because each peice is at least six minutes long, giving one to meld into the improv and tap to the beckoning beat. It is never overdone, it's just right. It's also worth while to read the liner notes written by Bob Blumenthal in 1976. It's very informative and helps with your understanding on what it took to make this music. I appreciate it more so because, I am kinda new to classic jazz and loving it.

I have never had a mouth full of toilet cleaner, but this is what I would imagine it tasting like. Very strong chemical taste with a very gelatinous plastic-like texture, highlighted in a dull orange-brown. I looked at the ingredients and the main ingredient is High Fructose Corn Syrup, a healthy dose of cornstarch, and some oleoresin paprika mixed in. I found the taste to be so horrible, I threw the rest of the container away.

I ordered a case of this stuff for $ 19 and was very disappointed in it. The sauce I received is a brownish color with bits of red and green pepper in it. It's not very sweet like you would expect (and hope) it to be. The label on the sauce I rec'd was totally different also. The one online is the 'New and Improved' label and the one I rec'd was not.My opinion is that if you're looking for the traditional restaurant style sweet n sour sauce then this is definitely not it. Now I have to figure out what to do with an entire case of this cruddy stuff. It would be one thing if the sauce was just different but I actually don't like the flavor at all. Oh well, I'll just keep looking. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The worthy farewell for a great rock band","review":"The way Big Country finally fell was sad. But as their last stand, \\"Driving To Damascus\\" (or \\"John Wayne's Dream\\" as a later re-issue with extra tracks) is a mighty effort. It easily contains some of the Big Country's best songs ever (starting from the stellar title track) - and it rocks like hell! Stuart Adamson sings and torches his lead guitar like never before. \\"Dive into me\\", for example, is certainly a TOP-5 Big Country song of all times. A rock classic. The general style on this album is, maybe, somewhat different from their previous albums, and more towards straight rock. Songs like \\"Bella\\" or \\"Grace\\" would not have appeared on Big Country's earlier albums, but they work great.Finally, Big Country left the stage with grace, producing an album most rock bands would die for.Rest in peace, Stuart Adamson! And all you lovers of great rock, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"bury me where the rose is sown","review":"Unfotunately, Stuart Adamson took his own life and this album is the last Big Country recording he gave it his all to. What is most evident is the influence of his new home, Nashville, on the sound. Instead of a blast of Scotland, we get a much more country feel, which is fine.

In the evening, I cooked rice, soup, a main entree and cut up some apples. I immediately put them in the different compartments accordingly and left the container out overnight. Next day, during lunch, the soup, rice and entree were still hot and the apples cool. It's such a nice overall package, well made and comes with chopsticks in a neat little case. The compartments are tidy and the serving sizes are just right for a sensible meal. I will get these for other members of my family shortly. I'm actually more motivated to cook and pack lunches in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for brown baggers","review":"i recently purchased this item for $50 the price is a little steep, but it definately is quality stuff. it does what it says. it will keep food for hours and cold stuff longer. i found that if i wanted to keep frozen microwavable foods in the container and put the container in the fridge, it will be cold for at least 6hrs!the portion size is just right. i would prefer to have more, but this will keep me intact not to eat more. for those people that might need alot of food, this is not for you. no heavy meals here. the only thing that i did not like, was that the soup container was a bit small. i end up just putting other foods there that might spill.the other containers were spill proof also, but they dont mention it. it is as tight as a tupperware container. ive enjoyed this product and would recomend this to brown baggers. they dont mention the chopstick that are included...nice bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nom nom!","review":"Got this for my fiance as the cafeteria food at his work is pretty dubious.

I take my lunch with me to work to save money and this allows me to bring more than just a can of soup or something like that. With this I can actually bring meals. The only major downside is that you must let your food cool before you seal the jar or your food will sweat and get a little on the soggy side. Beyond that I have nothing bad to say. The stainless steel spork is hilarious and useful.

It will not keep your food warm or cold. For this reason, the instructions say to avoid using it for dairy products, and to consume food withing a few hours.Second, and perhaps most important, all of the bowls leak. Even the soup bowl, with a screw-on lid and gasket, leaks. The instructions say to always keep Mr. Bento perfectly upright. Try doing that in your car on your commute to work. It's impossible.In practice, the only thing Mr. Bento is good for arranging your food in pretty ways, so that you can post photos on Flickr. That's not very practical when your yogurt is spoiled not to mention spilled all over the inside of the container. I've since gone back to using a couple of $1 food containers, which at least don't leak. Also, when I put them in the fridge at work, my coworkers don't constantly ask me why I'm taking up valuable fridge space with a Thermos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I bought this set after reading the rave reviews posted here. Ultimately, I was not at all happy with my purchase due to the following factors:1) Did not keep food at the adequate temperatures (3 hours later, my soup was cold, and any other items were as well). I followed the instructions and didn't mix foods of different temperatures, and even when using all-cold items, i can't say everything stayed the correct temperature.2) Lids would stick. This is especially true for the soup lid, that had a small latch under the center part - this latch would detach and it would become close to impossible to open the lid.3) Stains / Smells - Being plastic, food stains and smells stuck to the bowls. I assumed this would happen so i wasn't surprised - however, this happened after the FIRST use, even when i washed out everything at the end of the day.In the end, the only thing i kept from the set was the Spork.Completely and utterly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small","review":"It's really too small.

A great idea, but not practical in any way. I am a doctor and currently use a plastic shopping bag to carry my sandwich or small tupperware to work. Not very glamorous, and hence the gift.The Lunch Jar is well constructed, but there are so many parts, and it's so heavy, that I have never even once used the thing. I don't have the time and creativity to pack a 4-course meal, room to store the non-compressible tin, a place to eat a multi-course meal, and the energy to wash the containers at the end of the day. I understand the appeal, and there is certainly a cult following, but it's really not useful for everyday use if you don't have much time or space for lunch. Sadly, I'm still using the recycled shopping bags a year later. Mr. Bento is still occupying space in the back of a cabinet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"My boyfriend bought this for me as a present, and I thought it was the most useful thing for bringing lunch to work. It was pretty useful if you don't bring anything soupy. My mistake was that I decided to bring soup to work one day, and thought the soup bowl was leak proof.

A LOT! I can fit healthy size lunches (or dinners) and it stays hot/warm. I noticed people talking about the smells their containers picked up. I'm happy to say mine is smell free thanks to a trick a friend taught me. Place cabbage into it and let it sit over night (especially if you had something extra stinky). The cabbage absorbs the odor and the nasty smell is gone. (Don't eat the cabbage after though, it might taste a little funky.)If you are up for a unique approach to healthier eating, than this is for you.

Of course, the description doesn't say that it DOES come with chopsticks, but one would think that a Japanese lunch box would come with them.

I enjoy the four insert jars, they are easy to clean and fill with fresh food of most sizes. The outer case can be chilled or heated (with hot water) to keep foods cold or warm until lunch time. A drawback here: all the jars would need to be either hot or cold, so I usually keep them cold to reheat whatever needs it later. The canvas carry case is trendy and discreet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice way to pack lunch","review":"I do salad, soup and a sandwich, sometimes with chips or a few pieces of candy.

It keeps food warm for hours & I use it when I have to take lunch to a place where there's no microwave available. I can also fix nice healthy meals which conform to my Weight Watchers program. I just fill the big container with boiling water to preheat it & heat the hot food in the bowls. The instructions say to preheat the bowls with hot water for a few minutes & then add heated food but that takes up too much time & means using more dishes so I just heat the food in the bowls which,of course also heats the bowls. The carrying case is very good & has outside pockets for condiments or whatever & a \\"spork\\" (cross between a spoon & fork) is provided & has its own holder inside the case.

I don't preheat the bowls with hot water as the instructions specify, I just microwave the food in the bowls (without lids!) in the morning, and my food is still pretty warm by lunch time.The container is larger than I had imagined it from the pictures (A good thing). The spork (or as they call it 'forked spoon' is great to have, and the cover for it is a nice addition. Also, the carry bag is nice. You can fit a granola bar or two in with the container, and there is a small outside pocket that can hold a few small things (Soy sauce, salt and pepper, or mustard packets for example)The product is on the pricey side, but I think it will make up for it in the money one saves from avoiding buying lunch every day at a restaurant or cafeteria.This is a pretty good product and I'd recommend it as a healthier, more economical way to pack a lunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously Amazing","review":"I was hesitant to get a \\"lunch box\\" that was so expensive, but I caved and did it anyway.

I'm vegan and I like to have fruit and vegetables with me, but I'm usually in a pickle because everything gets mixed up and carrying oranges is a pain. It's great with this lunch jar, though, because my oatmeal goes in the soup bowl, a fruit salad in a side bowl, cut up vegetables in the other side bowl, and a yam in the main bowl. I mix and match what I fill the bowls with, but it's amazing what I can fix in this thing. What's really great is that I can have all of that and a few cuties in the bag for a quick bite.

They include the tip to warm up the outer thermos container and the two bottom containers by filling them with hot water for a few minutes prior to putting your food in them.

Eileen Cleary, a devout catholic is nominated for an award, Catholic Woman of the Year. Her subsequent soul-searching, and efforts to make her not so perfect family perfect is the seam that holds this family drama together. I found it believable. Having grown up in the catholic church, none of it seemed over the top to me. Emily Deschanel does a fine turn as Shannon Cleary. She has several really well played scenes with Kathleen Turner.

I can only hope that this inspires a more gifted writer to address the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"In its own class","review":"Try to find another 22\\" widescreen LCD at $2499 that isn't an Apple Cinema Display.

Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be Worse","review":"Even though the latest editions have been dumbed down considerably by Snider, what remains of Harry F. Davis are still far better than the similar book by Marsden and Tromba.For example the introduction uses the word roughly, which is an important qualification. When i read parts of Gibbs original book (available free on-line), Elements of Vector Analysis, i see that he left some wiggle room in his definition. I don't think this was unintentional. For it makes Gibb's text quite adequate even for today's scientists and engineers. Gibbs probably anticipated others working on a more exact definition than his work provided (though not by Procustean means and methods as is common today).Anyway on page 1, here's Davis-Snyder defition:\\"Roughly speaking a vector is a quantity that has direction as well as magnitude.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introductory book.

Hopefully we get then in the next edition.A good book for those who want to get into the embedded field. More is expected from a great author like Jack G.

He takes on the persona of many identities as he meets up with like minded individuals. Liam comes across in a cold and calculating manner, indifferent to the feelings of other that he meets, uses and discards along the way. His one night stands are unfulfilling and it is never clear just what he really wants.

The pegs have no resistance in the holes, so that when you place them in the openings, they fall to the floor (in other words, children can't pound them in).

Worst of all, the very first time my child tried to hit the pegs with the hammer, large pieces broke off the pegs and scattered all over the rug! They were sharp, and not only were they choking hazards, but they could easily cut a hand or injure an eye. Each time my child hit the pegs, bigger pieces broke off.

However, the decline that began midway through \\"The Mammy\\" continues apace in this sequel. The Browne family is growing up into steretypes industrious or shiftless, artistic or bumbling, straight or gay, while the quality of the writing sinks to the amateurish. The author's attempts at humour become pathetic and the attempts at pathos humorous. I shudder to think to what levels \\"The Granny\\" might sink to if the slide continues.

The writing is beautiful, the characters well developed, the possibilities of story line are good. Except the author never does develop a story. The characters are developed and explained and over explained for the first 90% of the book. The actual plot and story appear in the last chapter and then the book ends abruptly. Like the author got tired of writing the story and didn't want to finish. In addition, none of the characters end up likable.

Althought certainly not my favorite album of all time, I thought \\"Ace\\" was a worthy effort for a breakout artist and looked forward to the next as being a more mature and developed sound. What happened? After listening to the album a few times, I feel this artist took a step back. It could have been so much better. I hoped for more variety from her sexy-smooth voice, but 90% of the tracks sound the same. I hoped for more. I can't recommend something I won't listen to again.

Anybody that recommends this has SERIOUS problems on all echelons of sanity. Nobody in their right mind would write a review so ironic as the one entitled on this page \\"Average commercial trance/pop\\".

The female vocalist dominates this cd and if you liked the previous album called \\"ACE\\" you will also love this one which has good beats, synths and tempo. Things start out great with \\"Can't Let You Go\\" which is about love longing, then things move onto a nice \\"Inspiration\\" which is a bit cheesy, then followed by a strange song called \\"Crying\\". My favorite track in the whole album is called \\"My Own\\" is slower paced than the other tracks but has that romantic overtone to the lyrics and mood of the music. Overall the songs have sad lyrics but upbeat tempo which conflicts to the positive mood in trance genre. But if you keep in mind that not all trance songs are about love, and positive energy there is the other side and it is shown here.

It does not boost the low UHF channels very much, and it makes channels above 30 noisy. It attenuates the mid to high UHF channels (has negative gain).

I bought a new Monster THXV100F50 THX Certified Coaxial Video Cable (50 feet)because that's how much I needed. I connect this cable from the splitter to the amplifier and lost 50% of my digital channels. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Is the cable too long? I don't know.

After about 100 pages, I was frustrated with the complete lack of character development and breakneck pace of the book. The concept upon which the book is based (multiple parallel worlds that are worlds stacked on top of each other) isn't that great to begin with, and the author does absolutely nothing to make it seem interesting.I had purchased the first five books of this series in hardback from the Science Fiction bookclub, thus I was motivated to finish the books and not just donate the books unread to charity. However, after reading some of the other negative reviews on Amazon, I can tell that my initial impressions with the book were spot on and that it is only going to get worse.

Examples: second cousin suddenly becomes brother; a character is killed in a highly dramatic way and is later killed again in another highly dramatic way; Wolf makes peace with the queen of the harpies and asks for her help, and suddenly, this never happened.Jose Farmer had a legendary imagination, but he was overconfident when he wrote this series.

I don't want the scent around long after I've cleaned.I bought Beach Days last time. I'm going try a different scent this time.I was surprised how long the beads lasted. I use probably 10-15 beads per application, and the beads last until the bag or container needs replacing.I don't vacuum often, but I found the beads lasted quite a long time, the whole bottle lasting several years.For me, the effortless scent is my favorite feature.

I have since had this ball for almost a month and it is still somewhat intact. The large size of the ball was a great deterrent for him because he couldn't get a good grip on it to destroy it. After some incessant chewing he was able to take off a few pieces and now the ball is half its original size. But I am happy because I know that the company guarantees their toys so I can exchange it for a new one. I am also happy that the ball lasted longer than 10 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huck very strong...si","review":"I bought the large huck for a active lil beagle with a monsterous appetite for destruction and mayhem.

This is one tough toy, solid confusion for Madam Destructo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands up to my aggressive chewer!","review":"I bought this ball after searching online for an indestructible dog ball that could stand up to tough chewers, and also would float. We used to use the old Buddy Balls, but they just don't make them like they used to. I have a dog who loves to play ball in the pool, so it had to float. And another dog who just wants to chew and destroy the ball, so it had to be tough. (He has shredded the kong in the past). This Huck ball is great! I don't know how or why it is so tough, but so far the 2 balls i purchased have lasted 5 months. Past purchases - about 5 days! It is heavy and has a thick feel, but it floats. My shepherd mix plays in the pool with it, and it's the right size for him. Not too small. But my beagle can also carry it around, thanks to the grooved shape. Beagle loves to chew, and is surprisingly destructive for his size, but so far no problem with this ball. We like it! Worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for everyone","review":"I got the large blue color Huck for my 21 months and 31 months Labrador dogs.

Christian Walker was once a Power, and he knows more than anyone about what it is to be a superhero - a LOT more, as the later books show. In this book, without Walker being a \\"Dirty Harry,\\" he risks everything he has to bring the case of the \\"FG-3\\" murders to some kind of conclusion.

The sheets flopped initially but after a few sheets, it laid neatly in place and with its heavy base, sheets tear easily. The top design great, to grab easily to take from one counter to another.

Everything Israel does is praised. Everything goes back to WWII. Everything is Islam's fault. It kind of seemed like there was an agenda. Maybe it's not the book.

I will look for more books written by Beth Gutcheon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A luminous novel","review":"Gritty characters that love and hate hard, from both sides of the grave, linger in the reader's mind long after the book is closed.

Beth Gutcheon weaves this novel carefully and with great patience. An elderly woman begins to reveal the story of her life during a memorable summer and suddenly you find yourself drawn into a tale that weaves past and present into an inescapable quest to understand the human heart in all it's vagaries.

Where we travel back in time to the 1800s and meet the Haskell's. The two stories mingle together because it ends up that Hannah is trying to learn more about Haskell's and the only known murder in the small town. I do have to say that I did feel like I missed something or more could have been told.I have to say in my opinion the story got off to a slow start. If you stick with it you will find a charming story about lost loves.

The book jacket describes this story as \\"chilling\\" and promises to \\"keep you guessing until the last page.\\" I didn't find either to be true. Half the would-be suspense is removed when the entire plot is plainly outlined in the first ten pages by the narrating character. The ending to the \\"mystery\\" in the parallel story in the past is telegraphed right from the beginning. I'm normally terrible at figuring out mysteries and I guessed the whole thing by page 50. The writing is adequate but very stark, to the point where you cannot really sympathise with the characters, not even the one who is telling the story in the first person. The descriptions of the Maine coast are accurate and poetic, but they only make the rest of the story and characters seem even flimsier in comparison. If this is what passes as good LitFic these days I'll stick with my genre reading (SF, horror, and fantasy) and my Dickens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down...","review":"I read this book in one sitting.

The love story is intense and unforgettable, the ghost story is scary as hell (the scene with the ghost in the rocking chair kept me awake the night after I read it!), and the connection between Hannah's ghost and the old island family that slowly emerges as the stories progress will totally surprise you.

Some may think that this is the next Christmas classic I say do your research. King Island and their people are a dying culture.

I'm a big fan of Lee Morgan and he does not disappoint, but the entire band is on fire from start to finish on all three discs. As other have pointed out, most of the music performed here is more avant garde than Lee's classic Blue Note work. I love \\"hard bop\\" as much as the next jazz fan, but this album will surprise you with twists and turns that will stretch your ears and mind. This is music that truly deserves its status as \\"art\\" and it's delivered with all the inspiration and passion you could hope for.

It might be too heavy for an admirer of Nusrat's pop works but still it is an essential listening. It symbolises the true music that Nusrat is known for.

Vivid characterizations of both British expats and their Burmese subjects; Orwell spares no expense in gutting English attitudes toward the indigenous inhabitants. In the view of the book's anti-hero Flory, to be a Pukka Sahib is to be a narrow-minded, arrogant racist.Orwell is generally identified only with '1984' and maybe 'Animal Farm', which is a great shame. His prose is direct, and his body of work is consistently top-shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burmese Days stinks","review":"i was disgusted by the behavior of the British in this book and felt like i did not need to read more of it. i only read 30% into it but did not like it at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insightful but boring","review":"I read this book because it was written by George Orwell, and Animal Farm is one of my favourite books of all time.The interesting parts of this book are its descriptions of Burma. Burma is such a foreign land, and few stories exist in its setting.Many people love this book for its comments on racism... I didn't learn anything new. People are people. They form groups and screw each other. Big deal?I couldn't have cared less if the book ended with the earthquake, by every character dieing off in one whollop.It took a concentrated effort to finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slightly Different Take Twenty Year Later","review":"First read this about 20 years ago and have to admit I did not remember this aspect of the book at all. Certainly reinforces the idea that for some books, one really has to reread at different points in one's life. What intrigued in this reread was how one can choose as one's \\"other\\" someone so ill-fitting because of one's projections onto that other, spurious assumptions, and presentation of a non-dominant part of self as primary and important. All this complexity, Orwell delivers in such readable fashion (I finished up Jewel in the Crown right before this and I have to say that Orwell summed up the moods and angst of colony living more succinctly). This may be a book of days way way past, but it is hardly anachronistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quasi-Autobiography of Orwell's Time in Colonial Burma","review":"This is my first Orwell novel outside of his famous \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984.\\" I was pleasantly surprised as \\"Burmese Days\\" is not only a compelling story but an informative take on early 1900s British colonialism. In the book, Orwell is clearly extremely critical of colonialism but seems not willing to throw the whole thing out. The book seems to be fairly autobiographical in tone if not details. The English are almost entirely unlikeable but the Burmese are not much better. The whole setup seems like a failed marriage where neither group is happy but realize they are stuck. The story and writing taken alone are extremely interesting, especially its exploration of human nature and its failings. It is a love story but also a story of intrigue. The plot with hold you right up until the somewhat predictable ending. An excellent read--very enjoyable and informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Shipping-Good Quality","review":"The title pretty much sum's it up.

The only bombshell is that multiplayer online isnt so good. It is more of an individual self reliance with no strategy on team play. THE BEST WORLD WAR II FIRST PERSON SHOOTER IS DAY OF DEFEAT:SOURCE (AKA DOD:S)! DOD:S emphasizes team play and requires that each player hone their individual skills to better the chances of the team. Bud DOD:S doesnt have a single player. My suggestion is to get COD for single player and DOD:S for multiplayer. Once you're done with single player, the game can get boring, but multiplayer always depend on how good your opponents are (always varies, there are some crazy good players). Well hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall very good","review":"Just got into this game - overall very good with very realistic video and play.

She gives them an invitation to come to the kitchen for this home-baked treat while they carefully hang up their coats and put their shoes on the shoe rack. Sound familliar? Probably only on TV. Americans can no longer cling to the false myth of this type of family; and Ms. Coontz presents arguments why they cannot live this myth any longer. But America as a whole seems to believe it must have existed. It had to. Ms. Coontz suggests that we must work with diversities of our families towards the future; and while we can gain some insight from the past; we need to look forward instead of backward for solutions. In this book, she concentrates on what we have and how tohelp deal with the good and the bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be afraid. Be very afraid.

Why blame broken families on a lack of morals and poor personal choices, when we can simply say, \\"Society made me do it.\\"Who knows? There may just be enough lost souls seeking to avoid blame and responsibility to make this a best seller.

He compares this work to a \\"Monty Python\\"-like look at The Beatles but it is more like the ramblings of a teenager high on pot. Nonsensical, very boring & dumb.

The texture of the rice (I have only cooked brown rice to date) is excellent, well cooked but still somewhat chewy.The cooking vessel has built in handles that make moving the hot vessel safe and easy. I have burned my fingers more than once on the National trying to get the cooked rice out of it, but no more!Cleanup is a breeze. I can't emphasize this enough. Because of the way the unit disassembles, it is a snap to clean properly, something that wasn't true of the National. Reassembly is simple and fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does rice perfectly, but wait there's more","review":"I love this tool. I use it for white and brown rice almost everyday. I use it to cook Oatmeal. I've been experimenting with Mixed rice dishes (recipes in the included manual). It doesn't steam like my old on/off rice cooker, but I don't miss that function at all. This is the real deal, it treats rice like the sacred grain that it is. Induction heating is very efficient also. The non-stick pan is a breeze to clean. You can customize the rice to your preferences (softer/harder). Don't let the price scare you away. If you are serious about all manners of rice and grains, this is the only rice cooker for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rice cooker!","review":"Zojirushi really knows how to make a rice-cooker.Be ware.. 10-cups refers to Japanese cups, which are smaller than American cups.Pros:-- can cook a variety of rice and other grains (even more than its predecessors)-- extremely reliable results-- can keep rice warm for extended periods of time-- very easy to useCons:-- as with other models, the instruction book leaves a little to be desired-- very loud, annoying sounds when the rice is done. This only lasts a few seconds, but it is very assertive (if this is one of the 'cons', you know that the product is pretty much perfect)-- fairly large footprint, but it is light enough to store under the counter or in a less conspicuous place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This rice cooker is the best rice cooker I have ever had. It cooks rice perfectly. It is easy to clean. I highly recommend this rice cooker."},{"rating":"2","title":"rice review","review":"I postponed this purchase for a few years because I was daunted by the price--I mean, after all, this is a RICE cooker; can't you just get one for $29.99? Then I remembered the rice cooker/steamer combo unit I still have in storage that cost about that. It had about 20 pieces to it; I had to find & review the manual every time I used it just to figure it out (that's obviously why it's still in storage). Then my husband and I got really into Asian cooking and I took the plunge. I'm so impressed with this cooker I can't believe it. I own just about every kitchen device/appliance on the planet. This is one of my favorites. Nothing could be simpler, it makes perfect rice every time, keeps it warm for well over 24 hrs., which means I have rice whenever I want it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better if the timer is not run on a bettery","review":"We very much enjoiy the rice cooked in this rice cooker.

Not only does it make great rice of all types but you can use it for dishes like jambalaya, oat meal and many others. I use this rice cooker at least twice a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great for brown rice","review":"After reading all the fantastic reviews I had high hopes for this machine. Unfortunately, there are limited options for cooking brown rice, which is the only kind I eat. For example:1. There are no 'firmer' or 'softer' controls. The brown rice program produces rice which is too soft for my taste.2. No extended keep warm mode. The manual advises not to keep anything except white rice warm, and for no longer than 12 hours.Mostly, I wish there was a way to create custom programs, or tweak existing ones. In the meantime I'll have to choose between undercooked (using the semi-brown setting) and overcooked rice. However, this rice cooker is so convenient that it still scores high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control Failure ?","review":"I just finished returning the replacement for this cooker from amazon. The first one did not work for anything other than white rice and the second one has an out of control touchpad that spontaneously starts beeping all of a sudden.

Only saving grace is the fact that Amazon has been very good about the return process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for people with Cardiac Pacemakers","review":"I was excited to receive the Induction Rice Cooker. However there is a specific warning in the instruction manual that people with cardiac pacemakers should not use this machine because it cooks with magnets which could affect the pacemaker's operation. This warning should be included in the manufacturers description. Because I am pacemaker dependent, I now have to go the the trouble and expense of shipping this rather large and heavy machine back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"I'm still waiting for a funny line from this icon of comedy.After listening to it, and not laughing.

Is it Marcus Miller's eclectic mix of jazz styles, moods and voicings? Is it his lyrical composition? Is it his incredible bass-playing? Nup...all these feature on both albums. Where M2 really evolves is in the broader use of brass, orchestral and synth arrangements, giving a fuller, more mature sound that never impedes the energy flow of these great songs. This is shown in the various Ozell interludes, each adding another layer to its predecessor. And even more powerfully on songs like the remake of Billy Cobham's classic Red Baron, where the arrangements increase the funkiness of what was already one of the alltime great groove-pieces (see BC's Spectrum album for the original). Brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good, not natural enough","review":"MM is of course a talented bass guitar player, but i would put a 'bemol' on this album: it looks like the recording technique was as for a pop music, meaning nobody plays together, just hearing a background and adding a solo track. It sometimes looks closer to bass technique tricks (with, yes, real good sound) than to real 'together playing'. In spite of all the great players that joined MM to do this album, (Maceo Parker, Wayne Shorter, Kenny Garret, Herbie Hancock, and many others... also Djavan...) I didn't catch the living presence of people in these arrangements and recordings with a kind of synthetic sugar-sound, making all musician too much faded and unpersonnal compared to their usual performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marcus Miller","review":"Very good product with fast shipping. I am very satisfied and would purchase from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power and Grace perfectly sums up this album","review":"In an interview, I do believe Marcus Miller outlined the \\"themes\\" of this album as Power and Grace. These themes, essentially the opening and closing songs, perfectly outline his newest solo CD in 7 years. Marcus Miller draws from both his own original compositions as well as those of greats like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane to create a powerful, yet graceful display of his incredible skill and passion for music. Though his technical prowess may first amaze, his music will reveal many layers of complexity and depth through many listens. Fun and energetic (\\"Power\\" and \\"Nikki's Groove\\"), while soft and beautiful (\\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\" and \\"Your Amazing Grace\\"), this album will surely please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh","review":"After a wonderful experience from Frownie's Eye Gels, I expected great things for the wrinkles between my eyebrows and on my forehead.

My eyes were sore for a day or so.

Every story reveals the undividable nature of their relationship, one that stands for all time in this world and many many others.

The animation is bright, colorful and full of fun shapes but as far as a plot goes there really isn't one. The show just has Pocoyo and his friends doing simple tasks and small adventures. It is not really meant to be educational but rather \\"learning through laughter\\" and showing friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddler obsessed with Pocoyo","review":"My toddler LOVES Pocoyo and this DVD does not disappoint!

The only tiff i have with it is it take WAY TOO LONG to get to the Pocoyo Clips because they over filled it with clips pushing other PBS shows, etc. PS - I'd also recommend the entire Word World collection.

The great news is you don't have to be a runner to love this book. It's not just about running. It is a warm, funny, motivational, and highly inspirational book about being human; about pushing ourselves beyond what we thought we could do; about getting out of our own way and becoming great. It's about endurance, courage, and friendships. It's about accepting what can't be changed, and changing what can. I now know what all my friends are getting for birthdays this year.

Unfotunately, it not only lacks a great deal of facts, but it often gives the opposite. The author frequently falls into tired, false cliche about his opinions of the era, which often contradicts his more factual claims, and speaks about it's figures as if he had known then inside and out, and disliked them. The ridiculous Mark Twain-esque cliches he claims as facts are enough to drop the book, making it just another in the 100 year long pile of falsified, biased histories of the middle ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfull","review":"I agree with the revewer who said this book is amazingly bad, in fact it truly is awful. For example the following comes from pages 41-42: \\"The members of the great families did not like to be alone. They traveled and dined with companions drawn from noble families. They always were accompanied by an armed body-guard of at least a half-dozen mounted soldiers, called knights.\\"This sounds like a childrens book not a serious history book. It contains almost nothing about John of Gaunt and rambles on about nothing in particular. It must have been written by Cantor when he was in his dottage and printed on the basis of his reputation. I too wish I could get my money back or at least sue the publisher for inflicting such a terrible book on the reading public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scattered, Repetitious, Vague","review":"I've always admired Norman Cantor as a historian. However, this book is terrible. It is scattered--I could never tell what was coming next or how ideas fit together. It is repetitious--giving the same general fact or opinion over and over again, as if the author couldn't remember what he'd already said or had no idea of organization. It is vague--rarely does he get into the specific details we know of Gaunt's life that would give us a true flavor of the times. The all too brief section on Gaunt's registers was one of the few interesting sections of the book.A waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Read","review":"This is a VERY fast read. As a lot of the other reviews have noted, Cantor leaves a lot out. Which is just fine. I don't think his intent was to write the definitive text of John of Gaunt and the era he lived in. That would have required several volumes and only serious academics would have been interested in it. Cantor is more interested in writing stuff that sells as opposed to writing the absolute best history on the market. A lot of good writers (Barbara Tuchman, Lord Norwich) do this and I don't have a problem with it. Historical studies will never reach a wider audience if books aren't written to engage the public. Call it popular history. While this book struggles at times to engage its audience, it's meant to be a very broad overview. The purpose was to show that Gaunt lived in at the end of an era and the beginning of a new era - it wasn't to explain in detail the socioeconomic, military-political realities of Western Europe during John of Gaunt's lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but irritating","review":"This history did not live up to expectations set by the fly leaf. Cantor rambles, contradicts himself and fails to support his points. He makes statements about Gaunt's emotional state and motivation which he does/can not substantiate. The editing was sub-par as well: at one point the word \\"there\\" should have been replaced by \\"therefore\\" in order for the sentence to make sense. I forced myself to finish the book, and found it interesting for the most part, but was overall irritated that the author of such a poorly written book could received such glowing reviews from \\"The New Yorker\\" and \\"The Washington Post\\" > did they read this?? I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for kids, but not serious history","review":"I must agree with most of the commenters who found this book appaullingly bad. It's OK if you're dead tired and want something vaguely \\"educational\\" to fall asleep to. But, despite my sleepy state, I did quickly note an early error to which one commenter refers, and that is an error on the period in which chain maille was worn - a very short (less than 100 yrs.) period, but Cantor makes it sound like it was typically doned on a daily basis by all knights throughout most of the middle ages. So, right then, I knew there were going to be problems, if not simply gross generalities, throughout the book. It's basically useless \\"history\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Knight Review","review":"A very disapointing book. It is written at perhaps a middle-school level at best. Although that in itself would not be a negative if children were target audience.The author does not provide an indexed bibliography to bolster his too often broadly sweeping and generalized assertions. He wears his biases so openly as to be comical, and his choice of words, and emphasis is no less inflammatory, opinionated, and biased. This is especially so when he attempts to draw parallels between the modern world's \\"capitalist American Billionaires' and the aristocracy of the middle ages. The author's worst offenses are his immaginary dialogues by historic figures. This book is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and engaging.","review":"I find other commentators all too willing to sit in judgement and demand the book have more \\"facts\\". Obviously they do not understand the job of the historian to complete a puzzle of the past--in this case John of Gaunt--while having only a fraction of the pieces. If they bothered reading any other books on medieval history by Cantor they might realize he is a historian of the first degree and has an encyclopediac memory of the subject. They might try Reinventing the Middle Ages for a starter.It is sad this great historian has passed away. I find his later books such as the Last Knight to be written in a very readable style, not as focused on documenting every reference, but more intent on sharing his valuable impressions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potboiler","review":"The author tells us little about John of Gaunt, but a lot about his personal inclinations. I quick read but with little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!","review":"This is a very short book. The author uses very short sentences. Some have facts.

How did this book get published?How do I get my money back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"There are true artists","review":"Pierre et Gilles set a new standard when it comes to their combination of photograpy and painting. No wonder photographers like David La Chappelle try to knock off their style (imitation is the highest form of flattery).

The imagination of these two is priceless as is this collection of their work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice","review":"I love this bag. The pockets are conveniently located and large enough to accomodate all the stuff we hike along with us. The side cell phone pocket is where we keep spare pacifiers tucked and the net pocket at the end is great for keeping bottles handy for speed-grabbing. The only thing I would change with this bag is that the inside bottle pockets are not large enough for the larger Playtex disposable bottles - they only fit standard bottles and some of them are a tight squeeze). The bag doesn't have childish prints so we don't have to feel silly carrying it around."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this bag! It looks like carry on luggage..","review":"This bag is AWESOME! It is very large (perfect for the weekend trip to Grandma's!) but it's not heavy at all. (Which surprised me based on the other review). I love that it doesn't look all babyish. No cutesy cartoon characters, etc. I like the double zipper flap top..it's very easy to open. This bag holds everything!! The best part is that the bag can be used more than for a \\"diaper bag\\". It really doesn't look like a diaper bag at all. It looks like a piece of carry on luggage! The diaper change pad is a lot larger than I expected it to be too. A lot larger than any other's that I've seen in a diaper bag. I highly recommend this bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than hoped for","review":"The bag was of first quality, everything as promised and then some.

I gave the bag the benefit of the doubt and got another one. Now the fabric on the front pocket has ripped away from the bag, the bottle holders on the inside are coming loose, and the mesh pockets on the side (which I don't even use b/c I use the AVENT bottles and they don't fit in them) is coming apart also.

It was wonderful space-wise but the double zipper on the top was a pain!! It started jamming up and eventually just stopped holding the bag closed.

I only give it 2 stars because of the space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zack's mom","review":"I bought this bag thinking that it was unisex enough for myself and my husband to use.

It has saved us many times with no place to change her and it wipes off really clean with a wet one! There's a lot of space inside to hold any extra bottles I need to take with us and the zipper pouch holds any clothes that we had to change her out of without stinking up the whole bag.

I recommend using a plastic bag from your local supermarket, it works just as well and best of all, it's free with purchase of any food item. Or just ask them for a bag and I'm sure they'll give you one. Plastic bags are easily replaced, whereas spending a fortune on another Eddie Bauer bag might put a dent in the weekly \\"children expense\\" budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle Ripped","review":"I liked this bag because it was masculine but the handle started ripping after about 2 months and finally broke after 4 months. We tried to sew it but that was pain. It is a nice bag with good features but be careful with the handles.Oh and the diaper pad being attached is nice idea in theory but when I use it in public restrooms on diaper changers there is not enough room for the bag on the changer. It gets top heavy and falls and could be dangerous with the baby on it. Plus it's a pretty short diaper pad. You're better off with a separate diaper pad. So overall, I would not recommend this exact item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too BULKY!","review":"This was the bag that I asked for in my registry so when I got it, I was thrilled. However, it soon became obvious this would not work for the day to day. It was way too bulky. My son is now 2 years old and I only use this when I travel. Needless to say I have only used it about 20 times. The pull out, but still attached, changig pad is nice but now that my son is older it gets a little awkward. The clear plastic pouch inside is very annoying also. I would have returned it but my husband thought we could keep it to travel so now that's all we use it for. It has become my son's carry on bag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy it again","review":"This is the only diaper bag I have used with my daughter, who is now almost 2 years old, because it's the only one I have. We've managed just fine, but with our second baby on the way, I am definitely ready for something different. The attached changing pad becomes annoying very quickly. It is almost impossible to use at most diaper changing facilities while you are out and about, and thus required me to pack a second changing pad. The changing pad also adds quite a bit of bulk to the front of the bag. The pad on the shoulder strap ripped off very quickly and the bag is not the easiest to carry around. I would also prefer something with a few more compartments to keep things separated inside. All and all, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much too little","review":"This bag looked very un-diaper bag - perfect for dads too. And since we travel often, this looked perfect for my daughter. It's not. It's too small for any real weekend anywhere. Kids go through a lot of clothes sometimes and this bag does not let you be prepared - unless you cram everythig in and have to dump it out to find anything. And its too heavy for use as a normal day diaper bag - without anything in it! And what's with the attached changing pad? How are you supposed to fit a baby and this big bag on one of those public restroom changing tables? Maybe with a new-newborn, but then the bag probably weighs more than the baby and would drag the baby off the end of the table! Don't even get me started on the airplane restrooms - you the baby and the bag will not fit. If you buy this bag, you'll also need to purchase those disposable chaging pads from Huggies. My advice is to not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Mom","review":"I registered for this bag and received it at my shower. I was so excited to start using it, but it just proved to be too heavy and bulky for everyday use. I tried several times to use it for weekend trips, but it doesn't really hold as much as I expected it to. I have resorted to using the little one I got at the hospital. It holds everything I need and is very light. The fact that it is black and doesn't scream \\"baby\\" makes it absolutely PERFECT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Eddie Baur","review":"I thought this diaper bag would be great because of the size. And really like the neutral colors of the bag for a boy or girl. Several months after our daughter was born, the zipper started coming off track. The middle part of the diaper bag actually has two zippers. And both have been giving us problems. I've been carrying this bag for 15 months and I hate the zipper.

I thought it would be durable and easy to use. Within 3 months the pad on the shoulder strap had come off. One of the straps that held it on the shoulder strap got shredded by rubbing against the clasp on the side. Also, I don't like the feature of the 2 handles at the top of the bag getting velcroed together. When rushing to get something in the bag it is more challenging to get to the zipper and contents of the bag when you have to separate the velcroed handles. With a crying baby response time is critical.To be fair, I have to state the positive. It does not look like a diaper bag so it can pass as a briefcase and Dad won't lose his manliness carrying it. Also, the fold out changing pad is very convenient to use especially with the bathroom fold down changing tables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This is a perfect diaper bag for moms/dads.

The history is accurate and told from the view of characters involved in that history. Young people will enjoy the romance but will be appalled by the actions of Hitler and his followers.

They tried to tell my fiancee that they could not take the TV inside because of 2 steps leading to our front door (did not qualify as ground floor). They were prepared to leave the TV on the sidewalk until some customer complaint threats were made.

It is now February 2012 and the tv is dead! 1year 2 months and that's all $1000 worth of Panasonic tv got me. Simply put, the picture quality is really nice while the stupid thing works, but plan on only having it work for less than 2 years. Panasonic customer service will not assist in any way to remedy the situation and they won't even give me the contact info for an authorized repair place.

One day, it just turned itself off. Panasonic said to try a different electrical outlet. Got most of the picture back, but had a 3\\" black bar down it. Panasonic sent a service rep out and $100 later we were told that the display board went bad. Tech claims that display boards are not replaced due to cost and Panasonic recommends we purchase a new TV. Tech and Panasonic both claim that display boards usually don't go out.

I beg of you do not buy this item. It was made in Mexico, and of poor quality parts. 2 months I tell you, two months I waited to get it fixed and when it was fixed 2 hours later it broke again. Let us count the LED blinks.ONE.TWO..THREE...FOUR....FIVE.....SIX......SEVEN.......This is the most common problem with this product, the board blows out, and if you call Panasonic customer service you need to know the number of blinks so that they bring the right part.

It tries too hard to be funny, and only ends up being annoying, because the points that the humor is trying to make are all pretty obvious. The time taken by the (rather juvenile) visual jokes would have been better spent in elaborating some of the more useful ideas that the program presents.

I especially like the fun takes on nursery rhymes, as in Charlie Takes the Cake--where the guy wants the \\"baker man\\" to bake him a cake of a woman in a \\"curvaceous pan.\\" It's just a fun CD, great vocals, you can picture a smoky ballroom as Heather sings about the Bluebird Ballroom.

About half way through I realised that it was exactly the same as the first one I had read, mad a guess on who was the culprit and was correct, because this story was exactly the same as Pride of the Peacock. The trick is, think of all the people who could possible have a motive, eliminate them all and see who you are left with. Works every time, as I've since discovered. i found many VH books in the library in Germany, auf Deutsch of course.

I bought this on a whim one day after hearing only about a half a song. It made the band sound like a good hard-rock style group.They are not.They are a bad semi-rock band that could pass for easy listening if it weren't for the fact that the lyrics are so painful.From the song revolving... \\"If I was the sun, and you were the mother earth, I'd still be revolving around you.\\" Ouch.I don't understand how anyone rates them 5 stars.

I'm so glad I read this book before I got a chance to share it with my 4 year old.It teaches some horrible lessons. Conformity at all costs. Corporal punishment. Animal cruelty. No matter how hard those ducks race to get on the boat, someone will always be last and will be hit with a stick.I realize this book is a classic and the illustrations are wonderful, but I think it is time to retire this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"duck!","review":"This book is cleverly written, but I wouldn't read it to my children. Basically the premise is that this duck gets hit every day because he's the last on the boat. He gets tired of this and strikes out on his own but nearly gets eaten. Eventually he makes it back home where he gets hit again and he thinks that it's better to be safe back home, getting hit, than out there getting eaten.So, what this book is telling children is that it's better to be abused at home than to chance making your life better by, say, reporting your situation to the authorities. Because, what if they hurt you worse? Just go home and live with the abuse like a good little kid.And, that's a terrible message for a kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book I remember!","review":"I made a long list of books I remembered from childhood when my son was born. He pulled this one off the shelf the other day, and though he moved on to another book more age-appropriate, I continued to read Ping to myself.Though the illustrations are lovely and the exploration of culture interesting, the portrayal of corporal punishment (especially for no offense, not that that should excuse it!) made me sick to my stomach. The \\"moral\\" of the story seems to imply that Ping should be grateful for his physical abuse, for at least he is safe from unknown abuses. This is not a message I want to pass on to my son.As we already own the book, I may keep it around to read to him when he is much much older, so that we can discuss how the message is wrong and that no one, including Ping, deserves to be hit. However, I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ping Story","review":"Ping is a good bookIt is about a duck that goes on a adventure and is left behind because when his master calls him he is upside down. He sees that he will be the last one on the boat and if he is last on the boat then he will get a spank on the back and so he hides and he gets left behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor Ping gets Paddled","review":"This is a long story but the anticipation of a paddling or worse may hold a younger reader's attention. The five year old kids usually have a long enough attention span to enjoy it. There are a sufficient number of events to build suspense by discussing what could happen next and waiting until later to discover what did transpire. It is a good story to use when talking about fear and how to deal with it. My niece enjoyed this tale after Christmas dinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a really cute book. My 6 yo son enjoyed it. He said, \\"Poor little duck.

No wonder the little Chinese Duck runs away from home, getting beaten like that. He learns his lesson though - it's better to stay with the little pat on the back rather than face the pot at dinner.I'm still wondering whether his cousins Traceroute and Netstat had to take their share of beatings, too.I guess we'll never find out.Actually, a very enjoyable book, with an excellent cadence and meter. The illustrations are simply yet richly done, and my kids and I thoroughly enjoy our time with little Ping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Appropriate for 3 year old","review":"I bought this book for my 3 1/2 year old son based on the very favorable reviews and the fact that it is a classic. My son was terrified by this book. He cried when the ducks that were late getting on the boat were spanked for being late. He cried even more when Ping was captured by the little boy and the boy's family said that they were going to eat Ping for dinner and Ping was confined under a basket. We had to read through the whole book so I could show him that Ping was not killed, not eaten, and was reunited with his family; although, he was spanked for being the last duck on the boat (which resulted in more crying). He told me to throw away the book and never read it again. I would wait until around age 5 to introduce this book. It's definitely not appropriate for a 3 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Loved Children's Books","review":"\\"The Story About Ping\\" is ageless and a classic.

Ping always tries to make sure he's not last to get back on the boat because \\"last one there is a spanked duck!\\" One day, Ping's family got on the boat first. Ping really didn't want to be spanked so he didn't come to the boat that night. Ping has an adventure, and you could guess he came back to the boat next night, late or not.

In the end he decides to keep going on the boat because better to be with the master and other ducks, even if it means a spanking than to be off on his own. I am no prude, but I was bothered by the spanking, and even moreso by the fact that the spanking was delivered to the last duck for being LAST, not for any wrongdoing.

It's quintessentially Gallic in style, and Gide inserts a great deal of his Oscar Wilde-like wit into the characters' dialogue; this accounts for most of the reading pleasure. There is a plot of sorts, but the narrative isn't plot-driven. Very easy to read, funny, and well-written. (There is a dour, rather melodramatic climax, but I got the sense that this was dutifully tacked on, as it didn't represent the culmination of the overall arc of the novel...which may have been the point!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lil' Ed and The Blues Imperials - Roughhousin' (Alligator, 1986)","review":"This album goes to time when two extra class slide guitarists, Lil' Ed Williams and Dave Weld still were together. Accordingly, it's no surprise that album is of highest standards. It features ten songs, which are equally good although songs vary within the genre. We have here fiery boogies that alternate slow Blues with crazy solos in an attempt of reaching heights of slide playing. SRV's \\"Pride And Joy\\", Rufus Thomas' \\"Walking The Dog\\" and John Lee Hooker's \\"Mean Old Frisco\\" are all well packed in Lil' Ed's distinctive style of playing Blues as are his original songs.This album was released 24 years ago and still sounds modern.

What an understatement! Khadra has somehow succeeded in portraying a hero caught in the turmoil that is Israel today, without taking either side. Instead he shows us the senselessness of the violence which begets more violence. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who seriously cares about the future of the Middle East, and probably the Western World, as well.

It's easy in the West to see Palestinians only through the stereotypes of Hezbollah and Fatah, but Khadra's Dr. Jaafari is just a man trying to live a decent life and do some good in the world.

When I started reading it I seemed like it would be good but there seemed to be a lot of lectures through out the book which I found boring and started skipping parts. The main character seemed to have heaps of issues and seemed unable to ask for help to get through his problems with out inflicting pain on himself. I thought the book left a lot of unanswered questions as well. The subject matter was interesting but as another review suggested I thought this was pro Palestinian.

This 1958 shows that Bud Powell could still play very well. This CD has 14 Charlie Parker songs and \\"Salt Peanuts\\" by Dizzy Gillespie near the end. The songs are taken at a pretty fast pace, and luckily Powell had a good rhythm section to help. George Duvivier on bass and Art Taylor on drums keep things interesting and fill in any spots Powell lays out. Most of the songs have good melodies, and Powell doesn't overstay any of their welcomes.

But for a maiden of 23 she is spoiled and sullen and she has not one redeeming grace for her personality. At first she longs and desires for Hadrian-Braxton Lowell the Duke of Clayborough, then when circumstances finally allows for them to marry, she goes through one big long sulk worthy of a 5 year old all because of built up insecurities and petty jealousies and imaginations and mostly because of her pride. She didn't deserve the Duke and he really should have thrown her over for another since she was so adamant that she didn't want to marry him. Sulky spoiled childish heroines are just not appealing. Yet they persist in making this personality type the dominant one in many romance novels. Because of the unlikable heroine, I rate this novel 2 stars. Lindsay could have done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading!","review":"This is my favorite Brenda Joyce novel. Two people reluctantly drawn to one another by an attraction so strong that each is miserable in each other's company and when they are apart.

I don't have anything to say about the hero since he doesn't seem to try very hard to get the girl at all. She just landed in his lap and his life.This book is not a keeper.

While their mimicry of Mr. Parsons' music comes off well and respectful, their handling of the more complex tunes of Supertramp is mundane at the least. The accents are worse on this one than the APP tribute, and the mixing/arrangements are sparse and barren. Only the later hits of Supertramp---\\"Goodbye Stranger\\", \\"Take the Long Way Home,\\" \\"The Logical Song,\\" and \\"Breakfast in America\\" come across marginally effective. In trying to \\"Sound\\" like Supertramp, they come off as an amateur Top 40 band, covering their tunes, and not covering them all that well. Unlike their APP tribute, which they merely tried to suggest the same vocal feel, they go for the all out vocal stylings of Hodgson and fall flat on their face. It's more a mockery than a tribute. Not an awful CD, but not one you'd want to recommend too strongly to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of You Know What","review":"I guess I need to be honest and admit right from the start that I never was a big fan of the band. I had purchased their \\"Acquainted With The Night\\" cd when it came out and there are a few songs on that one that I liked, so I figured what better cd to check out than their \\"Best of\\" cd. Well I was wrong about that. Four out of the fourteen tracks are previously unreleased material, and I didn't care for any of them.

But, with this novel, he has accomplishe a master work. He has traded (in a philosophical and literary sense) a lifetime of good novels for the immortality of a masterpiece. Is this novel merely a popular fear stated of the Cold War? In a sense yes, but not \\"merely\\". it is a sociological and religious statement on the nature of mankind. Much a precursor to the plot line of The Gripping Hand, this novel proposes the horrors of apocalyopse, the cyclical nature of developemnt, and the hope for something grander than repeating history.The literary style is captivating and moving, intellectual yet common. It is a work for the future written in a time of fear in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"This book is well worth reading. Set in the future, after a nuclear holocaust on Earth, the ideas presented are compelling, and there is a slightly dark humor throughout all of the events.

I enjoyed it immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latin no problem now with Web","review":"To the preceding review, I might add that, while the book has no footnotes translating the many Latin phrases, the Web contains many sites with study guides that do, and all free for the asking. The Latin is mainly quotes from the Bible, but it adds to your enjoyment to be able to understand it so use a search engine and download and save the translations before beginning your reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science fiction for those who HATE science fiction.","review":"Miller reminds me of Bizet, the composer of the great opera \\"Carmen\\". Both Bizet and Miller are essentially one-work men, but what a work each has created! Just as \\"Carmen\\" is recommended as an opera for those who otherwise hate opera (poor souls), so do I recommend \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\\" for those who otherwise hate science fiction (like me). It is a stunning book. I've read it several times, and our book club went crazy for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post-Apocalypic Excellence","review":"Push \\"Mad Max\\" and [[shudder]] \\"Water World\\" out of your thoughts. This book deals with humanity's struggle to recover after global nuclear war. An order of Catholic monks are devoted to preserving as much of the scientific and technical writings (others as well) of the pre-war civilization. This means protecting it from angry mobs, marauding tribes and warring nation-states as well as the rigors of time. Though for long centuries no one understands the concepts contained in the writings (which they refer to as \\"Memorabilia,\\" they faithfully preserve, copy and even illuminate the works.This book is in the genre of science fiction, but there is a strong (not off-putting, in my opinion) religious perspective. It's a meditation on human nature and history. Pessimistic almost to the point of humor, \\"Canticle\\" is a compelling, thought-provoking read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"A splendid story of human disaster, survival, recovery, further disaster, and ultimate hope, well written and well told, unlike most religious-themed writings.Even devout agnostics like myself can read \\"Canticle\\" without feeling annoyance or spouting derision.

Regerdless of what or who you believe in, do read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The anti-atheist drivel at the end ruins an otherwise brilliant book.","review":"The prolonged conclusion in the book almost negates an otherwise brilliant work.

Doctor George Kumler Anderson, in his \\"THE LEGEND OF THE WANDERING JEW\\": too formless to be satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment!","review":"I bought this book with high expectations--after all, it has been highly recommended as a classic of science fiction. I couldn't finish it. The lack of women characters made it impossible for me to relate to the story. It may be a good book, but with so many other thoughtful science fiction books out there that more realistically include women, why bother?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"A very good post-apocalyptic novel. A story that is clearly a cautionary tale about nuclear war. The book postulates about whether or not humanity can manage to avoid such cataclysms and the destructions of major civilisations, while also looking at the story of some local monks who work hard to try and preserve and recover knowledge to improve the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie view of the future","review":"It's after the atomic war, and the earth is in a new dark age. What organization take control in the dark ages. Yep, the Catholic Church. Only this time, for a change, the church is an organ of positive change, although still within the usual religious superstitions. This is dark, though, and the future is not a wonderful place for most people. Miller is an excellent writer, though, and he presents his ideas with great skill.

My husband read this one and thought the ending left too many gaps unanswered and simply just ended. It reminds me of one of those 'art films' where there is no true closure and you wondered why you just spent the last 2 hours watching something horrific that was pretty crappy. (like Shame) Perhaps I'm just not 'intellectual' enough, but I doubt it. This is a poor excuse for a book posing as some timeless novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"School book","review":"Strange.

I feel fairly well versed in SF and this one ranks as low as the last few books in the Dune series. There were interesting flashes in the book. The idea of technology being held by the church was fairly interesting, but never panned out for me. Thon Taddeo's visit had my interest, but lost it because nothing that interesting transpired. One thing I will concede, the literary level was high for SF (no, I am not just saying that because the book contains Latin). I hope that you are enjoying, enjoyed or will enjoy it more than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot imagine someone who would not like this book.","review":"Walter Miller's \\"A Canticle For Lebowitiz\\" is such a brilliant subversive story, it is for me almost the penulatimate example of what literature is supposed to be. Not romanatic seduction, not escapist fantasy, but a story that somehow gets past your conscious mind with an idea so powerful that after reading for a while and following the story for a while a larger inescapable idea about human universals looms into view. This story and the ideas in it are really great. I don't want to go into the story here, I'll just say that if you are real human being this book should be a delightful experience to read. I had to read it for school the first time, and it was such an effort until all of a sudden I got how great it was ... why they call classics classic. 5/5PS. It's sad for me to imagine that someone would actively dislike this book so much as to give it a 1/5.

The book asks: Does civilization have any hope for survival without blind obedience to religious institutions? The title is a joke (a lame joke)- A Canticle is an old Catholic tradition- a chant, hymn or song, with words from a biblical text (often in Latin), while Leibowitz is clearly a Jewish name. Get it? The author converted to Catholicism after he took part in the WWII air bombing of the Benedictine Abbey at Monte Cassino, Italy. This book reflects a lot of knowledge about the Catholic Church, but also reflects doubt and expresses wavering faith. Miller also despairs of humanity's ability to avert self-destruction. Perhaps Miller would be unsurprised by the misinterpretations of some reviewers here on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I was really shocked at how unintelligible most of this book was to me. I am obviously not a big fan of stream of consciousness narration. I prefer a story that goes somewhere and not a probing search into philosophies. That was my real complaint. I felt that the book was just a jumble of ideas and not a tangible story. I did enjoy the last \\"book\\" more than the other two. I guess I liked it because it had the least narration, latin and covered a smaller chunk of time. It actually contained more dialogue than the other two books as well. Sorry I didn't get it, but I guess that's mumbly-peg!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST AWFUL","review":"I read about 1 book a week and this was the biggest waste of that week in a LONG time. I kept at it thinking it would get better but even the ending was garbage. Slow and boring as heck and whats with all the latin? Am I really expected to know the latin? And the ONLY interesting character, the old man, the writer never really brings to resolution or conclusion. I never write these reviews but this book was so ridiculously bad I thought I might save just 1 person the horror of reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and pointless","review":"Nothing really happened in this book, and that includes the nuclear war. Divided into three parts, the first involves the story of a young monk discovering some of the artifacts of the title character centuries after the apocalypse. Unfortunately, it takes 120 pages to convey what could easily have taken ten or less. The second part, set centuries after that, has an argument with no winner. Nothing besides that happens, including the land war among the barbarians. The third part, set centuries after that, shows that society built itself back so well after the apocalypse that another nuclear war is looming. Something finally does happen here, and by this time you're rooting for the apocalypse. The story did come full circle and showed the church as the antagonist, but a nihilistic story with no protagonists at all does not make for a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"exceedingly boring","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. Given the rave reviews I saw prior to reading the book, I kept reading in the hope that it would get better. It never did.

It could have been a great short story, 60 pages or so.

How do you screw up a post apocalyptic book? This was by far the slowest 300 pager I ever read. Gruelling indeed. Read On the beach instead. Or The Road. Or just read the ingredients on the back of the Cheerios box."},{"rating":"1","title":"You had to be there&#65533;.","review":"I would love to have read this when it came out first. I truly would. I think it is the only way I would have caught the spirit which seems to imbue every other review here.But to pick it up in 2001 as I did ..... well, the closest parallel I could make is watching one of those creaky old black and white episodes of \\"The Outer Limits\\". In other words, one and a half minutes into it you're saying \\"saw this before, thank you very much\\".I had to abandon it before I managed a hundred pages. My lingering memory of the experience is that is was like the Key Stone Cops in graphic novel format, small characterless figures stretched across an empty landscape, plodding through set pieces at pre stand-up pace.I adore good SF, but Canticle is unbearably dated.Let it rest in peace with \\"Duck and Cover\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, very different for science fiction.","review":"When science fiction deals with the Catholic church it is generally hostile this book is a little different. I sometimes wonder if that is because it is made of novellas that appeared in the Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction when Boucher was editor. I think this book shows good & bad things about the Church so non-Catholics will enjoy it too. Ultimately, the Catholic feel is there & so it made me feel I could enjoy sf without being apologetic about who I am. It'll read more like an alternate future to modern readers & it is a little bleaker then I usually like. As for Miller himself, I read that he became disillusioned with the religion he so eloquently described, that along with the depressiveness the book hints at might explain his end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinarily powerful","review":"A Canticle for Leibowitz is an extraordinarily powerful book. Its message, once one cuts past the Catholic overtones, is one that applies as much today as it did in the fifties, perhaps even more so than it did then, in light of the insanity in India and Pakistan. If ever there was a stronger literary work against nuclear war, I have yet to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science fiction can be literature.","review":"It's a sad commentary on literary types that the only way they can take this seriously is by denying it's science fiction. It's just as sad that science fiction types accept dressed-up dark fantasias like Hyperion as science fiction & list this as \\"fantasy\\". And you guys wonder why these days fantasy is getting more literary respect than sf. To be honest ,though, I didn't entirely enjoy this. Much science fiction is dark, but this is bleak. However it's nice to read SF with a Catholic perspective & it actually had some funny moments. In an anthology I read a different version of the Brother Francis section that was less bleak & I must say I liked it better. Still, since I have a strong dislike for post-nuclear holocaust stories the fact that this could break through that says a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read","review":"What a great book! As a person who favors technology and space related fiction, I had serious reservations about reading a book concerning, what I thought to be, a rather dry, heavy topic--nuclear holocoust. From the standpoint of someone who never lived through the Red Scare or Cuban Missle Crisis I've never been particularly interested in books that explored the fears and social ramifications from that era. However, based on the reviews, I decided to give it a try. I was thouroughly impressed. Miller writes in a readable style and the plot was driving enough to keep me interested. But what impressed me the most was the way that Miller divulges the thematic issues in the book. It is as if they are subtly layered. They develop rather than force-fed down the reader's throat. The breadth and depthness of the issues explored in this book should give any reader plenty of material to chew on. I highly recommend this book and hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"And round about we go!","review":"Nuclear war...Dark ages...Rebirth of learning...and once again, a technological world that is about to destroy itself in nuclear war. All seen through the eyes of an enduring, yet changing religious order which manages to help to hold things together, somehow. There is mysterious symbolism in, for example, the buzzards. There is a curious old man who keeps reappearing at intervals of thousands of years. Who is he? There are times when we can't find a simple Right Side to a controversy that shakes all society (ie, is it good or bad to uncover ancient knowledge, [that is, 20th century knowlege] when the parties in power are evil? Should euthanasia be routinely available to persons dying of radiation poisoning?). Nothing is constant; human beings keep making the same mistakes! And yet, there is a gleam of hope at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those who Will Not remember The Past...","review":"Walter M.Miller Jr. offers us a look into the years of a post-apocolypic world run by gangs and highwaymen. The work begins in an almost medevial time, with the clergy protecting the pre- deluge spoils of Rome with a fervor. The day to day machinations of these poor acolytes with their dedications is to look into the past instead of the future. The appearance of the strange \\"Benjamin\\" heralds a journey into that future that none knows or would care to see. Walter M. Miller Jr. handles this tale with such aplomb that we are led through hundreds of years of time and changing circumstance with a smooth, unveiled cadence that lulls the reader into a calm look into a history that never was-until the last chapters where we realize that technology has been reborn in its most monsterous form-and that it's all about to happen again. Hence the title for my humble take on a CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and uninteresting","review":"This is a book that has a decent premise hidden somewhere under the layers of yawn-inducing detail. For the amount of pages this book contains, almost nothing happens. This isn't necessarily a fault, since plot is not necessary as long as the ideas and detail are still intriguing. But alas, this book falls short in all of these except for a spattering of comical details. I kept reading because I thought that, it being the classic it is considered to be, it HAD to get better. Sadly it didn't, and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me","review":"I purchased this book on the many five star recommendations that I read, only to be disappointed.Between the overly verbose conversations and droll tedium there were parts where the story progressed. The continuity between the ages and church vs. state dilemmas are interesting, but you really have to dig through the fluff for it.Unlike some of the other 1950-60's books I have read that stood up (i.e. Heinlein's and Aasimov's books), this one did not stand up to the ages well - and I'm not just talking about the use of Latin.This story could be half as long and accomplish just as much, but it was written in a time when literature was ornately over-worded (i.e. Lord of the Rings, Atlas Shrugged, etc.) so I feel this story fit the generation from whence it came.

The plot idea is quite interesting, if hardly novel even for its own day. But the writing is quite clumsy, and the theology is increasingly ham-fisted. The book has three parts, set several hundred years apart, each further in the future.

This CD is amazing. It is especially wowing to hear it knowing that Django played without the use of two of his fingers, which were tragically injured early in his life. I have often been concerned about the musical quality of older recordings, but this CD has absolutely no signs of distortion or lack of quality. First rate recording. Django plays amazingly quick and clear rifts that are astounding. He is joined in many of the recordings by Stephane Grappelli on the violin. Grappelli was one of the few that could match Django, and they play off each other wonderfully.I highly recommend this CD to any lover of Jazz and/or Swing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Innovator at his best","review":"The genre of Gypsy Jazz has always facinated me with its rhythm.

The first lick Buchanan plays is sufficient to wake the dead; the remainder of the track--and there's a lot of it--would kill 'em all again. The rest of the CD ain't too shabby, either.

A couple of things though:Gently twist the ends of the butt splices onto each end of the stripped wire BEFORE you are ready to crimp it down. Sometimes the little hairs from the wire prevent you from getting one end on, after you have already secured the other end. If you twist them in advance before crimping, it will smooth out the end ends of the wire so that when you're ready to make the final crimps, they slip right over the wire.Other than that, I saved a ton of money.

There's not even the relief of violence, and the comedy (\\"but she is a virgin!\\") is so threadbare as to be almost invisible.I like Nicholas Cage. Some of his work, such as \\"8MM,\\" has been unjustly overlooked. But this film has been *justly* overlooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE..I didn't even watch it all","review":"I am an enormous Nicolas Cage fan...they trapped this man into this movie, or something. Total let down. I about went to sleep. So so sosososososossosososo boring. No story, except he's a EMT that needs some sleep and coffee (and maybe a shrink). Gosh, I can't believe they wasted Cage's precious time on this one. I can't believe it has more than one star as an average rating, either...and trust me...I am a BIG movie person.

Nicolas Cage gives a very haunting and disturbing as a burnt-out paramedic looking for a reason to quit his job. This movie is about the hurt and true terror that paramedics go through on an average day. The movie doesn't just give us drama. It intertwines some dark comedy in it as well. Mainly the people cracking the jokes are Ving Rhames and John Goodman, both playing partners to Cage. What more can I tell you? Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRINGING OUT THE BED!","review":"Watching this movie...I kept thinking to myself...why am I torturing myself this way?

I understandthat it's showing that paramedics go through alot.. Butwhy is nothing is to offer? I mean, the case leads youto believe it's going to be more worth while than itreally is... I think Cage plays well and does what hecan with such a limited script.It isn't so much that it's a depressive movie thatturns me off... There just isn't a reason to watchit more than once. I remember I just kept waitingfor something to happen other than just hearing Nickramble on and on for so long. It might have stood achance if it had more to offer and had more depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Perhaps the biggest problem of this film is that it indicates the deterioration of a great director.More of a star vehicle than an actual film bringing out the dead disappoints minute after tedious minute. Perhaps scorsese should disregard his own hype and take a look at some of his work from the 80's, particularly the very neglected After Hours, or perhaps he should stop hanging out with spielberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some things never change","review":"I lived for 3 years at Bellevue Hospital training to become an R.N.. While not having much contact with ambulance drivers, I did see a great deal of the E.R., then and later at Kings County Hospital.. back in the days when the neighborhood was totally Puerto Rican and the 3rd Ave El was still running. Being able to function at in these circumstances was a major victory. As the film shows the \\"hero\\" can only be sustained by lives saved.

Very well put together movie with good acting showing the life of a paramedic who is on the brink of insanity. Thought it was a very good movie which definately deserves to be watched at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleak journey","review":"It is easy to see why this has been compared to Taxi Driver. The same lost soul looking for redemption, the same urban decay, the same intense yet washed out colours. I even expected that percussive music style that resonated through Taxi Driver to follow the ambulance around.However, this is not Scorcese's best, but being Scorcese it is still worth watching Nicolas Cage's haunted descent into the edge of madness while he partners with a mixed bag of associates.As you would expect, the acting is good. Goodman, Sizemore and Rhames play Cage's cohorts in very different styles: differnt values, different rules. But what pervades this movie is an overwhelming sense of failure: the inability to achieve something meaningful and the cycle of meaninglessness that the staff and patients of the hospital go through.However, interspersed through the mayhem is Scorcese's humour and respect for humanity.I guess it is one of those movies that needs more than one viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaving Out The Plot Line","review":"I sat through this film (I should've received an award for that)and I really wanted to rip it in this review. But then I realized, maybe it was a good film, just not my cup of tea. I will say though, that if there is any factuality in this movie about the EMS system in New York City, I hope I never become sick or injured within 100 miles of there. If you like no beginning, no middle, and no end; this is your film. If you like choppy-justabout-make-you motion-sick editing; this is your film. I'm sure as an actor, you just don't turn down opportunities to work with Martin Scorcese, but this directing legend should've gotten a lot more out of this all-star cast. But for me, and for them, this movie was just a waste of time, and I'm not sure what I was supposed to get from it--because it was certainly not entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bringing out the dead. DvD","review":"Being a Nicholas Cage Fan, I eagerly snapped up the DvD expecting Snake Eyes, Leaving Las Vegas Et Al, Sorry to say I was sorely dissapointed. The film has no continuity, The plot is thin to say the least, Cage must have been having a few down day's during Filming, The film seems to dray along leaving the viewer expecting the one scene that may drag this boreing Epilogue up from the cutting room floor, this does not happen. Sorry Nicholas this is a dog and even your previous great acting cannot make this a DvD anyone in their right mind would require for their collection. I Resold the DvD within hours of purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my two hours back.","review":"When I sit down to watch a movie, I generally find something about it to enjoy - its humor, its characters, its action, its drama. But there were only two high points to this movie - the cinematography and the end. Not the way it ended, but the fact that it did. I found the plot depressing, the characters shallow, and the pacing painfully slow. We spend so much of the movie waiting for a change, for an improvement in poor Frank's condition - but we don't get it. Even his successes are disappointng - to him and thus to us. It just wasn't worth the time or the dime. I have a lot of respect for the actors and the director, but for their other works, not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"Normally, I like Martin Scorsese's work.

However, this movie just doesn't deliver, its all over the place, and in my opinion Nicolas Cage hasn't been in a good movie since Leaving Las Vegas. The guy is just way to melodramatic...and dull in this film, which goes further to all characters..(why the hell is Marc Anthony in this movie, and exatcly what kind of hair does the guy have...a spanish guy with dreadlocks? ...i don't know seemed a bit fake to me)There were some sequences that were really cool, like when Frank was helping out ghosts out of the cement,...i thought was cool..as well as a section of the film where he passes by some people who are filmed walking backwards as forwards...in other words their steps are all over the place..cool visual. However, as a whole the movie doesn't hold itself together..a big disappointment.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic self-parody","review":"Scorsese & Schrader seem to be running on fumes. I wanted to like this movie, but it's empty. Everyone both in front of and behind the camera seems just to be going through the motions. But Scorsese is the 'visionary' and has to be saddled with the responsibility for this slapdash movie that veers from slapstick to pathos with abandon. Scorsese and Schrader have gone to the well once to often. To see a *good* movie that re-tills the soil of Taxi Driver see Schrader's Light Sleeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, ugly, and sad","review":"A long disheartening look at an occupation one would normally count on in a crisis. However, after watching this film I have my doubts. If the intention was to skewer the medical profession, this succeeded admirably. I don't ever want to count on a hospital or ambulance drivers/paramedics! If it was meant to be satire, it wasn't funny.Well made, yes, especially the arresting imagery, but, on the whole unrelentingly depressing.

The screen play for this movie was really terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome movie, but..........","review":"\\"Bringing Out The Dead\\" was an awesome movie, but..... It had NO story line. Nothing. Nothing was building up, you don't anticipate anything, you just WAIT WAIT WAIT for something to happen. Since when did medics smoke and drink in an ambulance? NEVER! Okay, but made medics look bad......"},{"rating":"2","title":"A future classic.","review":"Some of the reviews here claim there is no plot to the film, and that takes away from the overall package.Personally, I feel the movie would not have rang true if there was some kind of a plot. Much like Taxi Driver, it's a film about one man's internal meltdown.Maybe the fact that there really isn't much of a character development adds to the feel. Frank doesn't know who he is himself, which makes it impossible for us to truly know him.The film seems all too real. Maybe not a film for all tastes, definitely not Marty's best, but truly an amazing film that deserves a second look.The film is also about forgiveness of self. Frank beats himself up over a girl he couldn't save. So many times we don't forgive ourselves, even after we've been forgiven. It isn't until the end when he truly realizes this.Lastly, have you noticed that Frank is actually more stable than many of his partners?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst movies I ever saw.","review":"I usually like Scorsese's movies, but this one does not even deserve a single star. Where's the plot? The only good thing about it is that it might be realistic and true to the subject. But is that enough? It just a real-life ER episode with a medic near a burnout... I could not care less for the story (what story?) or the people involved. The guy see ghosts, works a lot and is getting crazy. It does not take 2 hours to explain; 10 minutes would have been enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pull the plug on \\"DEAD\\"","review":"What does Bringing Out the Dead mean to you? In all honesty this films means nothing to me ... except how much sleep i got the night i watched it. For granted the films actors were great but thats all they were ... The charactors themselves are just plain BORING! ... and as for Martin ... what was he thinking taking this project ... maybe he was just half ... Dead?"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow...this is a bad movie","review":"A mood piece..hmmm, well i guess that says it all. If i want a mood piece i'll listen to Eno's The Secret life of plants or that video with the continuous burning log for 2 hours thank you. As a movie, bringing out the dead is horrible. Its a combination of Cops and ER which tries to elevate itself into art with the Madonna-esque MTV video style footage - and portentious voice overs, the result is terrible. I got bored 20 minutes into this movie, waiting for this movie to make a single point, its full of useless racial stereotypes and just totally unrealistic in depciting New York in the early 1990's as the film attempts to do, It would have worked better if this was a story set in the 1970's since it breaks no new ground about New York, ok, lots of violence and hookers - gee, havent we seen this before? in fact if i want \\"gritty\\" drama, i think an episode of cops is more enjoyable than watching Nicholas Cage deadpan his way thru this pretentious and boring mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WAS SCORSESE ON TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS?","review":"I could not watch this film and take it seriously. There seemed to have been no script. No point. Nicolas Cage is a burned out ambulance driver. He is tired, fed up, and starts to see ghosts. His fellow ambulance drivers are a strange bunch of people. Cage meets a strung out character played by Patricia Arquette when he tries to save her father's life. But there is no plot really tying him to any of the other characters. There is no story, and this is the least compelling film I have seen in years. The soundtrack was probably the most interesting part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insomniacs Should Watch It","review":"I'll keep this short. If you have ever had firsthand experience with an ambulance or EMT's, you will not like this movie. Even though Nicolas Cage and Martin Scorcese teamed up on this one, the plot is dry, and it is a fantasy. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin Scorsese's Take On Taxi Driver 20 Years Later","review":"This movie draws a lot of comparisons to Taxi Driver and it's easy to see why. A man, working for the city of New York, is changed by the atmosphere around him.This movie has Scorsese written all over it. New York settings, introverted, nearly psychotic male leading character, atmospheric change in personality. Another one of his most underrated works.The DVd doesn't offer much but if you haven't seen it I suggest you do, and buying it is also a worthwile buy.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily one of the worst movies of 1999","review":"This movie is easily one of the worst of 1999 and a major disappointment personally since I love Martin Scorsese movies. This movie is MS's failed attempt to make a Natural Born Killers type movie, which I happen to consider a great film. You see all this movie has to offer in the first five minutes. I'm in shock at how dull and boring this movie is. If you thought Leaving Las Vegas was a good movie and Nicholas Cage deserved the oscar over Sean Penn in Dead Man Walking, you'll probably like this movie.And why all the compliments on the cinematography? This movie has one style: bright white overhead lights with cut scenes of the flashing lights on the ambulance, weeeee!

But I only gave it a 2 because nothing else happens in the film. It just goes back and forth of Cage's character going 'nuts' because of the outcome of his daily/nightly job. There is no real plot other than the general burn out. I would suggest, at least, renting it before buying it-though I don't regret buying it, it's just not for everyone. Especially to watch it over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"rent it... and rent a backup while you're at it","review":"well, i hate to be the wet blanket of the bunch. everyone seems to love this movie, but i am not as taken by the quirkish effects. i see (and appreciate) the underlying message of the film, and i'm glad to have watched it; but the experience came at the price of 2 hours of boredom. i kept saying to myself \\"it's GOT to pick up soon\\", and hoping it would get better - then the credits started rolling. the movie was more message-driven than plot-driven, and while the stop-frame effects helped build feel & atmosphere, they came off as cheap and unoriginal. i love offbeat movies (pulp fiction, being john malkovich, high fidelity) but this one left me totally unsatisfied. think twice before plunking down that credit card - go rent it first (on a night when there's NOTHING ELSE to get!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bringing Out a Dead Film","review":"I am a huge Scorcese fan, and this one left me sadly disappointed. I'll be brief.Cage talks way too fast, in a too-wooden voice. Here, screenplay dialogue is way too thick to easily drink in. In other films, Scorcese has always been able to proffer meaty and philosophical ideas, often imparted through style, setting, symbols, and cinematography. But unlike like Taxi Driver or Age of Innocence, here he depends on dialogue way too much. Scorcese usually tells a lot in visuals alone; not so in this film. Oddly un-cinematic in that respect.Positive note: most amusing are the ER doctors who seem to be satiric (or one could say more life-like) versions of the main doctors on TV series \\"e.r.\\" This is a fine little touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked Taxi driver you will like this..","review":"I really think it desreves 3.5 stars, mainly because it is very very similiar to Taxi driver and it takes away from the originality of this movie... ON the bright side, there are enough differences that make this movie well worth the watch and even the own.

The book provides a historical outline and an analysis of our current situation (the new edition dates from immediately after 9/11), for the general reader to be able to understand and discuss our military policy.

I recommend it mostly to students under the age of 18 who find it too dificult to engage themselves in those thick, confusingly-worded political books. Bottom line is, it gives the basic information about the U.S. society and its militarism, but not the inside details. Overall an O.K. book.

This course is for you, as it is for me!This is an excellent course by all standards: structure, progression, vocabulary, pleny of practice and enjoyable exercises. But there is also something very special about this course that suits my learning requirements and I had not found before. This is what I would call a mid-atlantic course, with Portuguese you can use wherever you need it, a neutral Portuguese for both sides of the Atlantic. This is what I needed for my work takes me to more than one country where I have to communicate in Portuguese. And the course works. They can understand me! I strongly recommend this course."},{"rating":"2","title":"From zero to quite a lot","review":"This is money well spent.I cannot say anything negative about this course. Book and Audio are packed with good stuff. I just want to highlight what I think makes this a top course.It starts from the very beginning for the absolute beginner, but the time you finish you are doing quite well. How this is achieved is through the steady build up of structures and vocabulary. In the first 5 units you learn how to survive in the language, then all you have learned is there again for you at a slightly more advanced level and so on and so on. You really feel you are building up something.Another good point is that it exposes the learner to different accents so you are not limited to one and can understand different voices which has been really good for me for I have to use my Portuguese in Brazil, a number of African countries and Portugal.This course holds the secret of good teaching. It has worked well for me and I am no linguist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great textbook!","review":"This book is a reading book for second grade at our school.

You have the typical heroine who can do almost anything, with her catlike eyes of unusual hue and her ability to wrap absolutely everyone and everything around her, like some kind of tremendously powerful magnet. Friends and enemies alike come to adore her. She comes to the rescue time and again, until you roll your eyes by the time everyone is singing her praises. And only one thing keeps the story going through all of this--the oldest cliche of all: The Hero Who Just Can't Seem To Get The Words \\"I Love You Too\\" out.

Every song is one you find yourself listening to over and over again. Sonny is back to his wicked rap stylings but its been fused with the harmonic vocals of their last record. The Intensity of the \\"Satellite\\" days has returned and it seems Truby has finally come into his own since taking over lead guitar for the band after the departure of Marcos. The reggae song is just gorgeous and the cover of \\"eyes of a stranger\\" is something I never knew POD could pull off but its sure to be a fan favorite for years to come. The first Warriors EP is now going for over 30 dollars on ebay, so do yourself a favor and don't miss out on the second one.

The other songs are incredible as well. \\"If it wasn't for you\\" still assures you that no matter how acclaimed you become, Jesus is what gave you that gift and you need to give back to Him daily. I can only attempt to fathom the depth their next album will display. Typically, December is a month which in retrospect goes quickly, but I find the days to drag on as we near Testifys release.

My kids tried it at first and soon thereafter decided that they didn't like it, so they went unused for sometime. But a few months later, I have a child who wants to be more independant about brushing difficult hair and the item is successfully being used. (They don't want me to get the knots out for them.

I don't understand how so many tangles are produced in a single day. Anyway, bath time is filled with her screaming and crying. This product though has made bath time enjoyable again!

Our usual morning hair routine is to spray well with a good detangling spray and to brush it out for about 5 minutes, 3 on a good day. The Tangle Tamer gets through her hair without any spray in just 1 minute! We both loved it! She even asked to comb her hair with it as soon as she got home from school today! It did catch on a couple knots here and there the first couple times I used it (but even then it did NOT hurt!) only if I was running it through a thick section of hair but it would get them untangled on the second run through no problem. This thing is AMAZING! As long as you take you follow the suggestions for using it, it doesn't hurt. My 7 yr old & I both highly recommend it! I took off 1 star because it is a little rough only if you try to rush it. You need to go slowly and it will still get the job done in half the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Tender Headed","review":"We bought it based on all of the five star reviews, but are so disappointed in it. My 7 year old has nearly waist length hair and a very tender head. Yes, it is true that it gets the tangles out, but the pain is worse than any brush. It is bulky and awkward to hold. The teeth on it are made out of hard plastic, so if it touches her head or back she cries. The Tangle Tamer vibrates to help remove the tangles, so it grabs her fine hairs and pulls so hard that it snaps and breaks the strands. We used it 3 times before I gave up. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"whackkkk","review":"Broke the first time I used it on my daughters hair. So annoyed that I waited like a week to g it and when I.

I have tried many methods and hair products to make detangling easy on all of us but so far nothing worked until I came across the Tangle Tamer!!! I was so shocked at how easy it detangled their hair and they could hardly feel a thing. I love the fact that I could use this on wet hair which aslo makes it easier to glide through. I am so satisfied with this and I highly recommend it...you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy tangles","review":"I bought this for my six year old daughter who has long thin hair that tangles at the drop of a hat.

It is worth every single penny! In fact, lets hope Remington doesn't figure out how great it is because it's worth more than it sells for. My son is 2 1/2 and I've let his curly hair grow since birth. It gets these awful rats nests that I just pull back in a pony tail each day because they are impossible to take out. They are so bad I'm tempted to cut his hair. When I do wash his hair it's a horrible hour long battle getting the knots out. I just used this for the first time and it took about 15-20 minutes. He didn't cry or complain, hardly even tried to wiggle away. I just ordered another for my 3 nieces. If you're on the fence, go for it!

Stripped of all Hollywood excess, it blows a puff of wry recognition into our eyes and charms us with meaningful conversation. Rarely is a slice-of-life tale so intoxicating. The acting, often captured in long, stationary shots invites us with words and teases us with stories. The most shattering of these being the Christmas story Auggie (Keitel) relates to Paul (Hurt) toward the end of the film. Director Wayne Wang and writer Paul Auster give us reason to cheer for their lackluster but likable characters building lasting relationships and taking life one day at a time. Smoke's a real killer, but I guarantee you'll die with a smile on your face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoke.....a timeless saga","review":"The first thing to do is to rip the photo off the cover of the DVD package. The cover photo is just silly and has no relevance to the film. This film is a study of extremes....the common denominator is a smoke shop. Everything revolves around the smoke shop.....and, considering this film was made in 1995, the motifs are timeless.....everyone seem to be trying to \\"connect\\" with the world as they know it.

Not is the focus solely on military and political details, although these things are paid due attention; Reilly also takes in culture, society and technology to paint a broad picture of Muslim, Christian and Jewish life in Iberia. A great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise yet broad introduction","review":"Bernard Reilly would have a difficult time convincing anyone that he is an exciting writer. Fortunately for us, he is a good writer. Reilly manages to give a solid omniscient introduction to an obscure topic in just over two hundred pages. If the book were any longer it would be difficult to get through; if it were any shorter it would not be as informative.What is unique about Reilly's book is that it takes an omniscient view of medieval Spain. Most books tend either to concentrate on Al-Andalus or on the Christian states in the north. Here, each is represented (althought the Christian states do seem to get more attention) well. Reilly spends plenty of time on the \\"fun stuff\\" of history, but also on the economic, legal, and religious issues.As I alluded to above, this book is dry. It is, however, necessary. So pick it up, get through it, and then you will be able to move on to some of the more exciting books on the subject (Hugh Kennedy's, for example)."},{"rating":"1","title":"mislabeled product or wrong product sent","review":"This product is mislabeled!

The performance dates from 1984 and, from what one can make out, they are both in good voice and in front af a very enthusiastic audience. What makes this unfortunate is the execrably bad recording itself. There are drop outs, a tremendous amount of \\"surface noise\\", and lots of \\"wow\\" and \\"flutter\\". It sounds as if the microphone was dangled and spinning at the same time. Only as an archive document for die hard fans should this be purchased. 2 stars for this wretched excuse for a recording, 1 for Caballe and 1 for Carreras. Zero otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"So not what I expected","review":"At first Listen I was really disappointed. As I continued to listen my feelings didnt change. I love Choirgirl, Venus, Earthquakes and Under the pink. I even love so many of the singles and covers she has done but this album was just to out there. However, Happiness is a warm gun is great. A very unique treatment. Perhaps my disappointment with this album was that I was not really ever a fan of most of the music she covered in the first place. But then I love depeche mode and didn't like that song either. You know, if you worship tori you'll like it. I beleive everyone can have a bad one or two and this and boys for pele are her two"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic and eccentric-- but what did you expect?","review":"I have been an on-and-off Tori fan throughout the years, but none of her albums seemed to me to feel whole. Strangely enough, this album, a covers album no less, is the first that made me think 'album' instead of 'collection of songs.' The covers themselves are beautifully produced (especially the leslie on \\"New Age\\"! Yes!) and I didn't recognize \\"Heart of Gold\\" either, but my favorite, and I expect a lot of other people's, is \\"Strange Little Girl\\" itself, which is a wonderfully and oddly uplifting piece of pop. This album is not perfect; \\"I'm Not In Love\\" drags on a bit, and \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" is more message than music, but overall, this album satisfies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intuitive and challenging","review":"These songs are stripped down to the bone- made bare, essential and dire. It is through this daring transformation that a new interpretation is born, one that recognizes the feminine perspective that has hitherto been ignored or viewed as being invalid. It is especially nice that all lyrics are kept intact. This shows how subtle meaning is, and we women are very sensitive to the subtleness of meaning. This album is not for everyday listening, but it is what it is, and it is worth a listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like","review":"Strange Little Girls, actually isnt strange, its a very good album. For a female to cover songs written by men is a good idea and she has carried it through with style and has done so by adding her own unique style. My favourite tracks are, Enjoy The Silence, Time, Raining Blood and Rattlesnakes. Any true fan of Tori will love this album, and revel in the idea of new material. Top Album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tori does it again!","review":"After waiting patiently for the new CD from Tori I was not disappointed. This is a great CD that includes some fantastic songs with a new twist. Some outstanding tracks are \\"I'm not in love\\" (originally by 10cc), \\"Strange Little Girl\\" (The Stranglers), \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" (Depeche Mode), and \\"Rattlesnakes\\" (Lloyd Cole). The Eminem cover is chilling as is \\"Happiness is a warm gun\\". Some puriest won't appreciate what she has done to Neil Young's \\"Heart of Gold\\", but you've gotta pay her for originality. A must for all Tori fans (especially if you loved her early work)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not in love....but it could be lust","review":"Tori has grown up..and grown into other's influences more than she has let them influence her directly. This time she lets everyone know what her take is on the words of others...even though they are not \\"her words\\"...in a month i know i will think of them that way...only because her longing and hurting voice taints them in a way that removes them from the original so far its impossible to go back. a haunting album...if not her best...but deeper and worthy of more intent listening than, say, a song from her early years like \\"crucify\\"...make sure you listen to \\"i don't like mondays\\" and \\"real men\\" if no other song on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aww ... disappointed!","review":"Much to my surprise (as I am a die hard Tori fan), I am actually disappointed with this latest effort from Ms Amos. As far as I can see, they are all remakes of other people's songs - why she has done this I don't know, as her own pieces are sooooo much better. The earlier remakes she has done, such as Angie, Smells Like Teen Spirit, Thank You, and so on, had a really lovely feel to them with a whole new sound (compared to the original) and some ZING! Is this why she has chosen to do this album? I don't know. But these new ones are not as good - in my eyes - as previous efforts. And I must say I am still surprised by Bonnie & Clyde - as sick and twisted a little story as I've ever heard put into a track! It's a whole new style for Ms Amos, but I'm not sure it suits her. The album cover has new and interesting photos of her, and you should check out some websites for further info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concept Album Where The Concepts Falls On Its Face","review":"Albums that consist entirely of covers are automatically cause for scepticism. The aim behind this album was to reconstruct songs written by males in a female perspective: however as Tori doesn't actually change the lyrics, and the fact that some of these songs don't actually have cause for female interpretation anyway, make this album subjectively confusing. As for musical reinterpretation, it's a very hit and miss affair.Top Cuts: Strange Little Girl, 97 Bonnie And Clyde."},{"rating":"2","title":"jeez it's not THAT bad","review":"this album got pretty ripped up by the other reviewers here so i feel the need to defend it. no, it's not like her other albums but i think that's the point isn't it? i do think that some of the life of some of the songs was taken out, especially enjoy the silence, but she is just interpreting these other artists' work thru her own lens. i don't think that this is an indication of her making bad music for a while or anything like that. but i do wish that she had put smells like teen spirit on there. when tori amos does covers, they are invariably worth listening to, and i think that that alone makes this cd worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"great without question","review":"It could be argued that this album is the only new CD on the market which is guaranteed to be good before you ever listen to it. One of the best musicians around today does covers of 12 great songs--it seems very hard to believe that such a thing could end up being bad. Well, the album is just as good as I expected it to be. Each song is given an interesting twist, particularly Tori's rendition of Eminem's '97 Bonnie and Clyde. I highly recommend this album and can't imagine anyone not appreciating it. Buy it, and you will definately be satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Little Girls","review":"If you are a Tori Amos fan of course you need this cd. However a few of the songs may give you a headache like Heart of Gold. But as long as she pays attention to her piano, and stays true to her music, and not the \\"New Age\\" hype the heart of her music will show through. However Time and Rainning Blood are excellent examples of the Tori we love. Get it to finish your collection but make sure it is cd so you can skip the bad tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori Tori Tori ??","review":"This album was awful. The Tori Amos of years ago, the originality and sound are gone. We get to hear covers of songs we didn't listen to from their original artists. Go back and listen to \\"Little Earthquakes\\" or \\"Under the Pink\\" for the awesome and haughting sound she is known for. What happened to Tori? Horrible album, very disappointing!I already traded the album in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I just don't get it","review":"I love Tori's music and have all of her CD's, unfortunately including this one. While I will agree that her remakes of these songs do give insight into their meaning it's mainly just because she slows them down and sings to minimalist music so that we can actually understand the words. I mean who was confused enough to think that Eminem's Bonnie & Clyde was a happy song anyway? This CD is like modern art -- the artist is really just doing it for themselves, not their audience, and as a result very, very few of us really get it, but many more will lie and talk about how profound it is. So I'm not going to lie, I don't get it, I don't like it, and I seriously doubt the people who gave this CD 5 stars will still be listening to it a year from now. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori and the three M's","review":"This album sounds like she got so caught up in the mood and the message, she forgot about the music. Except for a few moments here or there ('Real Men', 'Time'), almost completly lacking the melodic content that drew me to her earlier albums, and even in those two tracks, she seems to be stretching out the melodies so she can cram in more words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Road Less Traveled","review":"Tori Amos' new album Strange Little Girls is, as you all may know, a cover album of songs by male artists from a female's point of view. Though many times cover songs fall flat, Tori really covers them well. Her almost whispered take on Eminem's '97 Bonnie and Clyde is the best track on the album and gives me chills every time I hear it. Though most of the songs don't have the depth and intricate piano tracks that many of Tori's original songs have, this is not an album to be ignored by the true Toriphile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange and Great!","review":"Tori does a fantastic job covering all of these songs and at the same time putting her own twist on them.

This is definitely an album that grows on you. The piano/voice ballads where my favorites. \\"Real Men\\" and \\"Time\\" touch me every time I hear them.

The bluntness of this album was a pleasant shock.\\"You don't need my voice girl you have your own\\" - Bells For Her, Tori AmosMy voice:"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece... in its own right","review":"After multiple, multiple listenings, I have determined that this album is a post-structuralist, post-modernist, feminist masterpiece. Tori tears down each song and rebuilds it according to it's own set of Tori-centered/female-centered rules and constructs. And it works. Her re-telling of \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" is too disturbing to listen to repeatedly - I find myself skipping over it mostly - but it stands on its on, creating its own logic & unity & world quite apart from the original by Eminem. Most of the songs require an emotional detachment, something Tori fans may not be accustomed to, with the exception of \\"Rattlesnakes,\\" which is my personal favorite because of the sense that she inhabits this small, touching world for four minutes, and allows us to see its beauty. Although her label has dropped Tori because of the sales of this CD which have not been phenomenal, I believe that history will judge Tori's efforts here kindly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"As a huge Tori Amos fan, I was really excited to find out that Strange Little Girls arrived. On the first listen, I thought, \\"okay, maybe it needs to grow on me\\" but after several listens, I can still find no other conclusion: Miss Amos has finally gone out of her freaking mind, and we're all being subjected to some terrible delirium she is suffering. I mean, come on, a song about a man who kills his wife and talks to the children about how mommy wants to go for a swim? I was prepared to deal with Tori's often-controversial subject matter, but that song really disgusted me. I couldn't even enjoy it for it's artistry, because it had none!!! This album is total (...). As much as I've loved Tori through her many experiments and changes through the years (Boys for Pele was a big stretch, but I've come to love it also), I simply could not stomach this terrible failure any longer. I will think twice about buying any future albums of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Tori what were you thinking?","review":"I was very excited to see a new album from Tori Amos on the shelf. I have enjoyed all of her previous albums and looked forward to her newest album. That excitement turned to dismay as I listened to the second song on the CD. In it she used a first person style to describe the violent murder and subsequent disposal of a ex-wife by her former husband. I admire Ms.Amos's work in RAINN (sp?) and believe that we need to stop the violence towards women but I can not condone her actions in producing this song. I also can not believe that there were no warnings about explicit language on the CD. The graphic descriptions of a bloody knife and floating a dead body into a lake are disturbing to say the least. The rest of the album was lackluster with several covers of other songs. I can not reccomend this album to others and will be hesitant in buying anything else from this artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's skip the large amount of BS, and say We Did!! 1 star.","review":"I applaud this chick for making a remake of Bonnie and Clyde 97. But she wish it had half the Heart and Soul that Eminem possessed in early 2000s.She tries to prove a point, but falls flat on her azz.

This is the worst collection of drivel and dreck I've heard in years. Ms. Amos has piqued my interest in the past when she has taken her music in a new direction, but his cover album is nothing but limp imitations of the originals and hardly worth the pain and effort required to get through it.I must compliment her though on her taste in music as evidenced by the song selection here. Do yourself a huge favor - save your time and money on this one and pick up some of the originals (Lloyd Cole & the Commotions, Joe Jackson, Depeche Mode, Neil Young, Bob Geldof) that \\"inspired\\" Ms. Amos to make this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell....","review":"How can she murder the Eminem's song \\"97 Bonnie & Clyde\\" in that terrific way????

Don't waste it in \\"Strange lil' girls\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the talent?","review":"Her first CD was fantastic, and everyone after that alright but not as great as the one that preceeded it. However, even if it wasn't good music, it was _her_ music. Now, she's just doing covers. I didn't recognize a lot of the songs, so I can't compare, but none of her takes on them made me want to go out and listen to the originals, either. They're mostly very slow songs; it was her fast-paced songs with brilliant lyrics that made me love her in the first place. Certainly, it wasn't her voice. Not that she has a terrible one, but I don't want to pay money to listen to her use it to recite every song she can her talentless hands on. As the old commerical went: Where's the talent?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy of Tori Amos","review":"This album was a huge disapointment. The songs don't began or go anywhere, and they are dry and boring. The music, everything is underdevoleped and seem to be fillers. This is my least favorite album of Tori's, and is not even worth buying in my view. It seems they took all of her rejected songs, and created an entire album composed of filler songs, instead of being put out ontoan other albums. I suggest buying Little Earthquakes for a music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"Not much to say except I DON'T recommend it. There were a couple ok songs, but I prefer to hear her originals. Maybe I'm being a tiny bit too harsh, but I found it hard to listen to.

I can agree with another reviewer about \\"Boys For Pele\\" that I didn't like it, that she went off the deep end on that one. So after reading the reviews for this new one, I will not be buying. So Thank you for helping me decide to buy or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"tori amos is one of the few artists who i buy albums from immediately upon their release because of her consistency. but this cover album is really full of nothing but complete trash save the tom waits cover of \\"time.\\" seriously, don't buy this album. i thought the idea of coverring really \\"manly\\" tunes was neat. but where can you possibly go with a slayer tune? i like slayer, but only because slayer is slayer and no one else can do that. the same goes for eminem. save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring little girl","review":"I would give this cd zero stars if this were an option. The thing about Tori Amos that has always amazed me is that she can release an entire album on the strength of one or two average singles and then fill the rest of it with absolute drivel. Dreadful, absolutely terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rapid degeneration","review":"Over the course of her recording career, Tori Amos continues on the downward spiral of horrible albums. This one is no exception.The material on this album and what it is supposed to represent is completely naive and insulting to intelligent musick listeners-of whom she is trying to appeal to on this album.The approach to the songs is anything but interesting...if you like her covers of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" stay away from this recording.In summation, Tori has become obvious. Obvious by attempting duplicate the successes of one Diamanda Galas-who is by far a more than competant singer and accomplished pianist. One thing that Tori has still not learned from Ms. Galas, is to take the voice as a serious instrument. Tori Amos has furthered the sound of marbles-in-her-mouth-while-singing style to the horrid Nth degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO disappointing..","review":"I have all of Tori's albums, and it seems like ever since the Choirgirl Hotel she's gone downhill. Venus was alright, but this is just awful. At first when I heard she was going to do covers, I thought \\"Hey - not bad! I love Smells like Teen Spirit and Famous Blue Raincoat, this probably won't be so bad.\\" But the album is devoid of emotion as well as any resemblance of the Tori we used to know. The only songs worth listening to on this album are Real Men and for a listen or two '97 Bonnie and Clyde. Some of the other songs are a good effort, but they honestly just fall flat. Don't waste your time on this. If you're looking for a Tori album to buy, start with Choirgirl or any of her earlier stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"For a Tori CD, this seems low quality, and almost rushed. It seems that more effort was put into the cover art and concept than into the music itself. While the cover of Eminem's \\"Bonnie and Clyde '97\\" is striking, its subject matter really isn't something i want to delve into over and over again. I understand the point she is trying to make, but it is really a song I only need to hear once. I respect what she is trying to do, but i think, almost know, she could have done it better. A few songs, such as \\"Rattlesnakes\\" and \\"New Age\\" stand out, but the rest of the album just trails off. As a longtime fan, i am really trying to like it, just because its Tori. Get it if you've been a fan for awhile, but if you are new to Tori try her older albums to get a true feel for her, this simply is not her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"o.k.","review":"I think Tori Amos is a very talented artist. This collection of songs doesn't necessarily back up that statement. Songs such as \\"Strange Little Girls\\" and \\"Rattlesnakes\\" shine and sound as though she wrote them herself, which is a good thing since they seem to be the most Tori-like songs on this project of cover songs. They are also the most effective. The track that seems to be getting a lot of attention is \\"Bonnie And Clyde '97\\". It is very disturbing and violent and almost caused me not to want to go any further into her CD (it is track #2). It is not at all easy to listen to unless you enjoy listening to Tori talk about murdering a child's mother, from the father's perspective. Overall, the CD is disappointing with a few good moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Should Have Read the Reviews Before Buying","review":"...oh no, I was in Montreux, Switzerland when I bought this last Thursday, Sept. 27 and I thought I was buying good stuff to bring to the Philippines and be ahead of fellow Tori Amos fanatics. When I opened it in the Philippines 2 days after, I was shocked thinking that I got a wrong CD inside the lovely Tori Amos CD Sleeve. Nothing wrong with the CD but the tracks were really un-Tori. I really think artists come into phases like these and I believe Tori will be back to her senses....really, I should have opened Amazon.com before I bought it...what the heck, I am a Completist, I need Tori Amos' new album in my collection, even if it is a 2-star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a fan of Tori Amos, I was excited to hear she had a new album out. What a letdown. A big part of Tori's appeal, as evidenced in her previous work, is her ability to write unique, moving lyrics and accompany them with talented piano playing. Unfortunately, Strange Little Girls offers none of these things. SLG is just Tori, singing along to a collection of songs written by other artists. Let's hope this isn't the beginning of the end of this gifted artist's career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori, you OK?","review":"Though I think she has yet to top \\"Little Earthquakes\\", I look forward to Tori Amos's concise, luring, measured songs and vocals. I'm still looking, sadly, with little to recommend as I'm still haunted (or maybe just annoyed) by wanna-be-hip-techno-scratch sounds. The drawn-out \\"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\\" is like a refugee from Open Mike Night @ Cafe Late, more in need of bongos than strings. \\"I'm Not In Love\\" takes a whole MINUTE for Amos to start. Tori herself resorts to reciting and/or muttering lyrics, with little lift in her voice save perhaps the title track. Consider it a failed experiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm...is this tori...?","review":"Sorry, but this is the worst release from Tori Amos ever. None of the tracks are appealing and they all sound too different to even slightly resemble Tori's amazing sound captured on all her original albums. Please do not purchase this unless you are extremely hardcore for Tori or you think listening to bad piano music is trendy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a Listen","review":"While I think the idea in and of itself may not be entirely original, I found this album far more enjoyable than I originally imagined I would. For anyone who enjoys Tori's style and musical talent, the album is obviously a must-have... however, that being said, a newcomer to Tori should probably start with 'Little Earthquakes' or 'Scarlett's Walk'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toriness all the way","review":"I really don't understand these people who say they own everything Tori's ever done and don't like this album. Are you kidding me? I think this cd is amazing, I bought it a few days ago, it took me some time to finally decide myself to get it because of the bad reviews. But I had to prove it, so I bought it. And what a surprise it was. New Age is the best opening, it catches you and from there to the end of the album it's the most amazing journey. I love Tori's covers cause she transforms the songs and make 'em her own, so this album is toriness all the way. And toriness is that magic with the piano and the voice and the whole attitude towards music. I think you could say that you feel her honesty cause you can really feel that she gives her heart to the music.Highlights: New Age, 97 Bonnie and Clyde, Strange Little Girl, Rattlesnakes, I don't like Mondays, Happiness is a warm gun and Raning Blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Artist icand Different CD","review":"This is a CD that left me feeling like I had just been walking through a museum. The work is very artistic and different. Some of the songs really make you think just because of the way they are performed. It is weird to hear some of these versions of covers, particularly \\"I'm Not in Love\\" and \\"I Don't Like Mondays\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss Tori the songwriter","review":"While I applaud the reasons and spirit behind this album, I am disappointed in it nonetheless. It is a very slow-moving playlist and, with the possible exception of \\"Heart of Gold,\\" nothing has the energy or excitement Tori can generate (a la \\"Raspberry Swirl\\"). \\"'97 Bonnie and Clyde\\" is every bit as disturbing as \\"Me and a Gun\\" and she definitely retains a reputation as an artist who takes nothing lightly. But this is background music, not driving music. The saving grace are her trademark vocals and piano. She should have saved these tracks for B-sides and taken the extra time to release an album of original music. None of her originals have disappointed me yet, but this collection has."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fine art of cover versions","review":"When I held this CD in my hands for the first time, carefully studying the booklet, I wondered what the heck was going on in Tori's mind now - why did she have to do an album full of cover versions, while she's a brilliant songwriter in her own right? Well, after tuning in, I knew why. I should have put more trust in her - of course, this is NOT just a collection of dull rehashes to squeeze out some more money out of a couple of popular evergreens. The songs are arranged and interpreted in such a way that it is sometimes hard to even regognize them, so these old goodies have actually become new songs, almost. Well, that's Tori! Five stars for this daring undertaking, and for another great listening experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the piano?","review":"I've been a fan of Tori since I heard \\"Crucify\\" when I was in the 6th grade. I own all of her CDs...I've even listened to LE to the point where it was scratched beyond all recognition, and it wouldn't play anymore. I thought I'd be a Tori fan for life.Then, I heard this album.I'm sick of the weird synths, and the strange echos in her music. I want Tori back at the piano, where she made the best music. This album made me want to cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori's Downward Spiral","review":"I've been a big Tori Amos fan for 10 years and am sorry to say that this latest effort is quite possibly her worst. Although great in concept, the final product pales in comparison to her early efforts. The album has a distinctively dark mood, but that's not the reason for my lack of interest; Tori's interpretation of these songs lack the power of the originals. Her \\"breathy\\" vocals give each a forbiding spin and a new \\"twist\\" on the meaning of the lyrics, but a little of that goes a long way. Although it has been apparent for quite sometime that Tori has been heading in this darker direction, I still miss the young woman that gave us \\"Silent All These Years\\", \\"Winter\\" and \\"Corn Flake Girl\\". Tori, go toward the light!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and creative","review":"I just cannot connect to the songs in this album!I know it an over statement but her earlier albums are so easy to digest that straight away, I am fond to her evocative style of singing.No doubt there are songs which are lyrically witty and 'strange' to listen to such as Bonnie & Clyde, Tori never fails to create that momentum to chant in this album.Her dubious style of singing and song picking is definitely there as I do enjoy occasional listening to Time, Happiness is a warm gun and Heart of Gold.Personally, I feel that this album strongly portrays Tori's creativity in singing women perspective as the originals are sung by men.Perhaps, this album is not my favourite amongst others like To Venus and Back or Little Earthquakes, but new fans of Amos can find this album as an escapism to her different style of singing and her glossy photos that captures various styles for each song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real interesting....","review":"This isn't a real interesting Tori Amos album. The idea for the collection is a good one and Tori has done some great cover songs in her time, but most were b-side tracks. These songs may have worked better as b-side songs to a stronger collection of Amos's own work. If you're a die-hard fan, you'll want this album just for the sake of having it, but if you're looking to sample Tori's music for the first time, or you're new to her, start with some of her previous works. She's done some great work of her own. I give it two stars solely because it's Tori Amos behind this collection of songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least Tori didn't write these songs.","review":"This CD gets two stars because I do admit Tori can sing, and at least on this CD she's not writing the songs herself.If you have to buy a Tori CD, buy this one. However, I'd recommend instead that you buy or download all of these songs as sung by their original artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"The fact that this is a cover album will saddly turn many people away from listening to this masterpiece, she reinterprets these songs in such a fascinating, and often times beautiful way (her cover of Tom Waits' \\"Time\\" is gorgeous, and if you saw her on David Letterman on 9/18, you know what I am talking about).Don't look at this in the aspect of \\"the original is better\\" cause it's not about what is better, it's about opening your ears and hearing what power words really do have and how the meaning of a song can change drastically when you hear them from a different perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a CD for all Tori fans","review":"I've been a loyal Tori fan since \\"Little Earthquakes\\", but I'm afraid this is the last Tori album that I will buy without hearing all of it first. I had great expectations of this album, as Tori's covers are frequently compelling and fun (and I have several collections of covers she's performed in concert), but there are only two tracks I like on this disc, and none that I love. Overall, I have enjoyed each new Tori album less than the one before. One problem with success is that famous writers stop being edited and popular artists start producing themselves. The result is often self-indulgent, and I feel this has happened to Tori. I don't begrudge her room to grow and change, but I can't help but feel an objective producer would have produced a better album. Perhaps her direction and my tastes are drifting further and further apart, but I don't think this album achieved its potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album. Smart people like it.","review":"I like this album. Tori is great. New Age rocks hard like an acid rock song from the 60s. 97 Bonnie & Clyde is a slap in the face to the original song by Eminem and it has a cool Psycho-like instrumental in the background. Strange Little Girl is a sort of easy to sing along with pop song with a subtle dark undertone. Enjoy the Silence is very pretty, yet hints at some danger. It ends in a pretty ambience. I'm Not In Love is dark, creepy, and sounds like something Massive Attack would do. Rattlesnakes has a great chorus, and Tori's voice sounds great on it. Time is a pretty song that Tori does a good rendition of. Tori reinvents the song, Heart of Gold, gives it more meaning, and makes it rock hard. I Don't Like Mondays is given a more serious tone with Tori's voice. Happiness is a Warm Gun is an orgy of sound. Raining Blood is very haunting. Real Men is traditional Tori and piano, and it sounds wonderful. The reviewer, Daniella P., is clearly an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come back to the five and dime Tori Amos, Tori Amos","review":"I must say having been a fan of Tori's for some time that I am quite dissapointed. Maybe it's due to the fact that I'm a guy or what I don't know. I guess that I really like the original versons of the songs better. I just don't get what she is trying to say. What ever she is saying I found it rather boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tori's Little Girls","review":"After reading a one-star review from Midvale, Utah, allow me to redeem Utah by saying that few people could pull of such a diverse selection of covers with such aplomb and style. If you know the originals, it is much more fun to hear her version and the way she molds and shapes it into her own statement, her own sound. Annie Lennox pulled it off beautifully with Medusa, but you could recognize the songs because she kept very much to the original's sound. Tori takes Joe Jackson's Real Men and The Jam's(?) Rattlesnakes and creates a haunting echo of the original. Where's the talent? Right there, in every note she sings."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon Tori, you were on to something...","review":"Venus contained some of the most passionate, beautiful and well crafted songs I have heard any rock artist make in many years. This is half hearted, self serving garbage. Yeah, she is supremely talented. None of that was used on this album. Yes, she is a modern day Goddess. No, do not waste your money or taste on this weak, weak effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sound clip?","review":"Dear record company...If you don't put downloadable sound clips online, how am I supposed to get excited about it? No sample = no sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange little garbage- Horrible Horrible MISSTEP...","review":"What happened? This seems like such a good idea on paper- Have Tori cover a bunch of songs in her own brilliant style. I own every Tori album, most of her b-sides, videos and more, so this was a no brainer for me. Tori didn't show up the day of conceptualizing how she was going to 'cover' these pieces. Each and every track seems taken from the Phil Collins idea that, \\"We'll record it in the basement and if it sounds good enough just release that as an album!\\" Ugh. Every track has a repetitive casio drum loop that never seems to change. And while Tori sounds passionate with her vocals, we know she's really not because the songs have little or nothing to do with her own personal experiences.I can almost here the record executives, \\"When's the next album gonna be finished? Oh. You haven't written anything? Hey, why not do an album of covers?! You like? Can we have it tomorrow?\\"\\"Sure.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori, where did you go?","review":"Sniff, sniff...where are you Tori? Sad, one of the better song writers in the field decides not write any songs. Maybe life changing things like marriage and baby producing have staved off creativity...I have always enjoyed the occasional cover, a treat as a b-side, a nice little surprise in concert, but a whole album of them is unneeded. Plus the song selection, saving the Boomtown Rat's \\"I Don't Like Mondays\\" is pretty poor. Alot of repeatitive nonsense. Adrian Belew is a nice touch (thank christ she finally ditched Caton), but I can't imagine ever taking this CD down from the shelf to give it another listen. Come back Tori!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncompelling","review":"This is the first Tori CD that I just can't get excited about. The \\"pained\\" singing mentioned in another review comes across as very flat and dry to me. As a fan of some of the original versions of the songs on this CD, I am just not happy. Enjoy the silence is so slow and flat it sounds like she is on Valium rather than capturing the original essence of the Depeche Mode song. All in all, much of the CD reminds me of someone on heavy sedatives.The one song that that is done well, '97 Bonnie & Clyde, is just too emotionally painful to listen to.I wish she would quit trying different styles and stick with what drew me to her in the first place. Primarily Tori and Piano on songs on \\"Under the Pink\\" or covers like \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\" or \\"Angie\\".Right now, Tori reminds of U2 after Joshua Tree before they got back to making good music. Hopefully she follows the same pattern and returns to her roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a big Tori Fan","review":"I can easily describe this CD in one word...ICK!!! What the hell was she thinking. Is she trying to sabatage here career?! I'm a big Tori fan, but this CD is (...). Her singing on this CD sounds like she's on her death bed, and if she continues to release stuff like this that's where her career will be. I've never heard anyone butcher songs so badly. Her version of Depeche Mode's Enjoy The Silence is so bad it's almost painful to listen to. Don't waste your money! Strangling a cow would sound about the same as this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting CD","review":"The Cd came to me very quickly, and was very inexpensive.I will continue to do my searching, and research and perhaps purchases on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange, yes... But it grows on you","review":"Fans of Tori's original music may be disappointed at first by Strange Little Girls. But what got me really hooked into it are the pictures on the inside of the disc, showing the \\"girl\\" each song is about or being sung by. Once you see who they are, it makes a lot more sense and you can fully appreciate this album. Even hearing the original versions of the songs helps you got into it. Standout tracks on this CD include '97 Bonnie and Clyde (which is eerie bryond belief, but absolutely incredible at the same time), Rattlesnakes, and Strange Little Girl. I'm starting to get more and more into this album, loving the tracks I hated at first listen (like Heart of Gold and New Age.) Worth the money, if you're willing to branch out your music a bit. If you want to start listening to Tori, I suggest starting with Little Earthquakes and Under the Pink-- they're a bit more accessible. This may not be Tori's best work, but it's definitely one of her most intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting new album . . .","review":"I was incredibly excited to hear that Tori had a new album out, and while I knew to expect the unexpected, this album was completely different. Not that that's a bad thing. I have always enjoyed Tori's covers of other artists songs, and this album demonstrates how she can combine her own altered sense of musical style with music that is not her own. My favorite from this was \\"Real Men,\\" which, while closely matches the original, is set apart by her vocal inflection of the words, and makes it softer and more outstanding. Also a favorite was Neil Young's \\"Heart of Gold,\\" which truly shows that this woman can completely rock when she sets her heart to it. \\"'97 Bonnie and Clyde\\" is a song I cannot listen to at night - her version is so haunting it sends chills up my spin when I listen to it.On the whole, this album was very inspired, and while I miss not hearing any new songs (or a rarity and b-sides album please!) , the songs she has covered feel new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting takes, very well done","review":"Some people might not like the idea of a whole album of covers from Tori, being that's she's so creative herself. But she definalty takes these selections and make them her own. Some tune are really good, some are only so-so, but none are bad. Worth the $$. I really enjoyed the take on \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\". Errie with the sound bytes from when John Lennon was shot. \\"Time\\" cover is very good and faithful to Tom Wait's. (one of my fav artists). \\"Heart of Gold\\" demanded several replays.And if nothing else, it's worth it for the pictures inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark","review":"I think it is the darkest album of Amos. Waited for the opening of Borders on Sept. 18, 2001 just to grab it first. One single word: dark. Anyhow - just appropriate for my mood now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tori has done it again","review":"Tori is just amazing on this album. i mean when is she not? every song sounds like her own. Every track has it own special flare to it. i got it today, the day it came out, and although i heard mostly all the album before i got it, it just takes me in awe and i have been listening to it non-stop. enjoy the silence and time are just, damn. very \\"little earthquakes\\" and that is one of my favorite albums ever.if you like tori you won't be disapointed, and if you have never heard of her(shame on you) take a listen, you won't be disapointed either."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A POS","review":"As a fan of Tori I can only ask \\"What the Hell happened?\\" Listening to this disk is the most excruciating experience this side of poking myself in the eye with a sharp stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely depressing!","review":"I hated this cd! It was depressing, and extremely weird. As a longtime fan of Tori Amos, I was so disappointed with this album. I sold it immediately. I couldn't wait to get it out of my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's great art, but it's a pretty bad album.","review":"I'm a Tori fanatic. I own everything including rarities and singles. I can admire this album (Strange Little Girls) for it's bravery and artistic endeavors. But SLG is just unlistenable. It's boring and it hurts my ears.Pick up \\"From the Choir Girl Hotel\\" probably the most public friendly Tori Amos album. CGH is a good \\"gateway\\" album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori Amos fans won't like this album","review":"I am a huge Tori Amos fan and I was so excited when I bought this CD. I was very disappointed upon playing it to find so many uninspring cover songs. Most of the songs are dull, slowed-down versions of the originals. I will still anxiously await a new CD of original material while I let this CD collect dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a Fan, and I Hate This!","review":"I would say that I am a pretty devout Tori Amos fan, although not fanatical. This album is a huge letdown. The arrangements for all the cover songs are original, but just not very interesting to my ears. In my opinion they didn't improve upon the originals, and they just sound uninspired. While I love some of Tori's previous cover songs (\\"Angie\\", \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\") the songs on this album are bland in comparison.Listen to the sound clips before you decide to buy. If you like the clips then you might not be disappointed, but don't expect to find any hidden gems on the album that you didn't hear in the 30-second-previews."},{"rating":"1","title":"sigh.","review":"I adore Tori - but I could not get into this album. Although I don't doubt the depth in this piece, all but perhaps two of the songs are bland, sounded un-inspired, and are simply boring. I give two stars for the concept and for 'Raining Blood', but that is about it...if you want an introduction to Tori, look into any of her other albums, particulary her first three - Little Earthquakes, Under the Pink, and Boys for Pele. They are the masterpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Talent Tori","review":"I have been a long time fan of Tori Amos and loved most of her music. Unfortunately for my pocket book \\"Strange Little Girls\\" is her worst CD produced and not worth buying. I was quite dissappointed with the entire CD. I should have guessed she had reached a block after listening to \\"Venus\\", but I was ever hopefull and paid for going against my instincts. The CD is slow and dull, her vocals monotone and the music uninspiring. What happened to the vibrant/alive bounce on the keyboard Tori? When listening to this CD I had a difficult time staying out of the kitchen to grab every munchy I could find to fend off the ensuing depression from the CD. Sorry Tori this CD is a dust collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this happen?","review":"First of all, I think Tori is phenomenal. She walks on water. However, this CD is horrible and I don't know what she was thinking. It is virtually unlistenable, definitely not the pristine, auditory perfection that she normally delivers. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge Tori Amos fan -- and that may be the problem. Her clever but disjointed lyrics are missing on this album, as is the sly familiarity she normally sings her boys and girls with.With the exception of \\"Time\\" (a Tom Waits tune), none of the songs on this album called to me. They bored me. The originals, I felt, were fine -- she didn't bring anything to them other than a gimmick. Yes, it was amusing listening to her sing the Eminem song -- but it wasn't something I'd play over and over. Not because of the material, but because it just wasn't *interesting*.And that's confusing, because Tori HAS done covers I like (Joni Mitchell's \\"Case of You\\" being one that immediately comes to mind). So is it me, or is it the album? If you are a diehard Tori fan, you probably already own this album. If you've never heard of her, you might like this album. And if you're in the middle (like me), you'll probably toss it in the pile with the rest of the discards, shrug, and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it...","review":"I own just about everything that Tori has put out, but this album ... I was very disappointed. I listened to the album twice, just to make sure my first impression was correct. It was. If you really nead your fix of Tori, buy some of her singles or some videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching to the choirgirls","review":"I'm an enormous Tori Amos fan. She is one of the greatest artists of our time. But this CD is horribly flawed. Tori's strengths lie in her musicianship and her lyrics. Though she is adapting the songs they are still someone else's songs and someone else's lyrics. So what is left is a great artist's take on songs that weren't very good in the first place (Enjoy the Silence) or songs that should never be touched (Happiness is a Warm Gun). Ultimately all it is worth hearing the disc for is the concept. But you can't really listen to a concept. You listen to songs and these are average at best. The concept of a woman's take on male skewed music is intriguing, but who does she think buys her records? She's preaching to the choir. She'd be far better off producing more wonderful original music and perhaps making some converts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Boring","review":"When Tori Amos released Little Earthquakes I was taken by it's sincerity and complexity. Each song seemed like a journey into her tormented mind and the originality of her style was griping and exciting to listen to.On StrangeLittleGirls, we see a generous application of the \\"Tori Amos Formula\\" to an eclectic gathering of cover tunes. She slows down tempos, removes instrumentation, and sings in trademark torment which now comes across as affected rather than honest.Depeche Mode's Enjoy The Silence was originally a beautiful song - stark and plodding with a walking beat. Tori drags it through the mud. The Beatles Happiness Is a Warm Gun gets a lame \\"industrial\\" treatment with trite soundbites.There are likely fans who will enjoy hearing Tori's \\"emotions\\" applied to these songs, but I left unconvinced. It seems like these days Tori could sing a song about going to the grocery store and still perform it in the same overblown way. I'm beginning to feel duped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable","review":"I love Tori Amos (especially Boys for Pele) so I naturally had high hopes when I purchased this CD. '97 Bonnie and Clyde hurt my ears. Lennon/McCartney's Happiness is a Warm Gun and Neil Young's Heart of Gold are rendered completely unrecognizable. The only two songs I can listen to are Strange Little Girls and I Don't Like Mondays, the rest of the CD is just too painful. Tori Amos has immense talent, I don't know what she was thinking when she recorded this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tori Amos's Spaghetti Incident?","review":"Anyone who has thoroughly enjoyed any Tori Amos album or performance will probably find something to like here, although it is not what one might expect. These are all cover songs, but they are not done in the style of Tori's previous covers, such as one finds on her Crucify EP. \\"Heart of Gold,\\" one of the album's disappointments, is performed with a fast melody and a harsh sound--unpredictable, to be sure, but not so enjoyable. \\"New Age\\" and \\"Time\\" are each more than worth the album's purchase price, however. They are the kind of easy-to-like songs that stand out on the first listening and continue to sound outstanding as the album becomes more familiar. I think the sound of her band on this record is most reminiscent of her Boys for Pele album, although there are barely any songs here featuring Tori alone with her piano, which is how she has always shined best."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting view","review":"I really enjoyed listening to this album. I find that Tori can amaze me even now when I have been a listener for years. She has shown that she can't only sing her songs but can give a good view on how she interprets other songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is horrible!","review":"I have never been a true Tori Amos fan, and after listening to this album, I don't think I ever will be. Doing one remake on an album is acceptable (as long as it is a GOOD remake, and on this album, none are), but having every single song be a remake? Come on! I never understood the fascination with this artist. Sure she plays piano well, but I can't get past that breathless, whiny, shrill voice of hers. Being a Depeche Mode and 10CC fan, I can say that both \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" and \\"I'm Not In Love\\" are awful. I would not recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech! Beautiful voice, such negative thoughts.","review":"I am a Tori Amos fan since the release of her first album, so I bought this one as soon as it came out. I was very disappointed--it's like she went out of her way to find the most negative lyrics she could. Especially the Bonnie and Clyde song, that's one that sticks in your head when you wish you could get it out. Maybe I'm shallow, but I prefer songs with a hint of hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, I can easily say, this is the WORSE cd I own","review":"What more can I say? Tori lost her touch during this album. The whole concept was terrible, and it proved nothing, but if Tori's happy, I guess thats good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad departure from what made Tori great","review":"I bought \\"Strange Little Girls\\" without ever hearing a cut because I have liked most everything Tori Amos did before it. My wife and I were disappointed in this CD. Other than a couple of cuts that were sort of like the \\"old\\" Tori (strong voice, piano and some decent arrangements in the background), \\"Strange Little Girls\\" seems overproduced and deemphasizes her pianist skills. Each song practically buries her distinctive vocals and surrounds her with needless noise. Add to that the negative lyrics and you have a CD that is not at all like the Tori Amos CDs before it. I have already given it away to someone else. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH","review":"I love Tori. I go to every concert. Die hard fan...the whole shebang. I cannot stand this album. The title track stands out because it sound like something Tori would have written. But for an artist who built a reputation on originality' she saw fit to re-imagine other peoples material. Blah, I think... no, I know... that Tori's first album \\"Y Kant Tori Read\\" surpases this effort (and that is an album Tori refuses to talk about). I am waiting patiently for some new material from Tori. Until then I will continue to use SLG as a coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least the photos were fun to look at","review":"This is by far Tori's worst work. Most Tori's fans would already own this, so I don't warn them, but if you are \\"new\\" to Tori, you should check out Boys for Pele, Scarlets' Walk, Tales of a Librarian, well, anything she has ever done besides this, really.I should admit I don't like covers in general. I find most of the work on this album very blah. Her destruction of Time, Heart of Gold, and Raining Blood are especially harsh.The only good things to come from this album: Rattlesnakes is a good song to hear her perform live; 97 Bonnie & Clyde is amazingly disturbing and while I don't like to listen to it, it does have a kind of force behind it that stays with you; Tori completed her contract with Atlantic without having to give them anymore of her original work (read Piece by Piece for more details, but yes, she admits that was the driving factor behind this concept) and she was then able to move on and continue to create her own brilliant pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive","review":"This book is a great combination of hard facts and good entertainment.

The book satirizes Canadian cultural \\"super-nationalism,\\" but it the more widespread themes of identity, corruption, and reverse discrimination are also explored. ATUK is the novel immediately preceding COCKSURE, and it shows: In ATUK Richler satirizes political correctness and reverse discrimination almost as much as he does in COCKSURE. For that reason you don't have to be Canadian to enjoy this book. Also, if you know that Canadians don't all live in igloos and eat \\"reindeer knuckle,\\" it's hilarious to read a work by a Canadian author who plays with such misconceptions.

Because I bought the book thinking it could teach me to build trust in personal relationships, used the advice it gave in a personal conflict situation, and very much regret doing so.

On the album, he masqueraded as a down-on-his-luck blue eyed soul singer, who was making a comeback album. Unfortunately, he wasn't as good a singer as the guys he was imitating. He is clearly having a good time, but his enthusiasm exceeds his talent. He actually had a Top Five Hit with his remake of the old Staples Singers song \\"Respect Yourself\\", but it isn't very good compared to the original version.

Hooker, Dixon, and Waters cream Willis any day of the week. That's as it should be, and for once, things are right in the universe. I didn't even make it through side two before I was running for Johnny Copeland, Albert Collins, and Keb Mo to save my soul from this paltry impersionation of the blues.

Bruce should appologize for this compelations of songs, or put out an album where he cuts loose and sings. Wearing sunglasses does not make you a blues man. Neither does calling yourself \\"Bruno\\".

About all they have in common is that Bruce occassionally looks cool in sunglasses. Beyond that, he cannot approach these songs and arrangements by a decent band.

And I thought the FOOD at Planet Hollywood was unreasonable and unpalatable!!! This luke warm effort has no soul. Bruce seems unable to conjure up any emotions and make me feel like the music is speaking to me. This is because it's about him, not the songs. Leave it to Bruno to bury the Temtations in the background while attempting to let his baleful vocals to carry the weight. It can't be done.

Finally my scientist boyfriend figured out that without some sort of o-ring to seal it, little bits of air escape out the threads of the lid, causing the water to flow out without stopping. I then read the instructions, and sure enough, there is supposed to be an o-ring in the lid!

It's an important piece in its own right, but apparently just an excerpt of what by all accounts is a much larger and more important work by the director. Lerner filmed extensively at Newport and produced a documentary entitled Festival - the Dylan pieces are excerpted from that larger work. The quality of the film and audio in the Dylan sets makes me desperate to see the full documentary. Hopefully a positive reception of The Other Side of the Mirror will spur th the release of Festival to a larger audience. The current DVD is a great peak at Dylan as he enters the national awareness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great footage","review":"If you like the early folk day footage and to see the emergence of an electric Bob, this is the dvd for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something you'd want to watch over and over again!","review":"This DVD is excellent quality, both for view and audio formats!

Her voice was too vibrating at the beginning, but then she improved and was terrific later on.

The pictures are well done, using a brave lighting technique that is rare, but page after page is so similar.

The illustrations, admittedly the author's strong suit, were strong indeed. The images were of such excellent quality that they almost made the book worthwhile. The beginning of the story held promise, but ended up spending beyond its means into imagination. Either a story of the boy visiting his grandmother for the summer and experiencing adventure on the river, or an imaginary tale of prolific so-close-you-could-touch-it wildlife would have been good. Neither was completed, and the resulting combination left me feeling flat. The experts, my two and five year-old grandchildren lost interest before the book was halfway through.

If you do then you would enjoy The Lorax. This book is about the Lorax, and the Onceler. The Onceler is telling a boy a story. In the beginning the Onceler finds a tree and manufactures a thneed .In the middle the Onceler starts chopping four times faster and the Lorax asks him to stop. What happens to the trees?

Love Dr. Seuss, and who wouldn't. Thanks for timely shipment. Great seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seuss had a bad week","review":"Dr Seuss is supposed to be funny. Even books that tackle serious issues like Sneetches, are still hilarious. Even Butter Battle was still cute (for adults). But something went terribly wrong with the Lorax. The Lorax is heavy handed, preachy, and depressing.For a man who successfully satired racism and nuclear war, pollution ought to be a cake walk. To be fair, perhaps the Lorax reads differently to someone left-of-center politically. We're not, so we tend to disagree with much of the modern environmentalist agenda. However, good comedy transcends politics. You don't have to agree with it to laugh at it. Unfortunately, we weren't laughing, and we never even tried it on our kids.Interestingly, we observed Seuss books read to several groups of children at our local Target today (Dr Suess day apparently.) The kids (aged 5-9) were fidgety for the Lorax, but were engrossed by his dog book and Green Eggs & Ham. Apparently, it isn't just us; the Lorax just doesn't measure up."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap copy","review":"I bought this as a gift and was extremely disappointed in the quality of the book. When I received it I discovered it was printed on recycled paper (this was NOT in the item description). I am all for going green but I don't see the pages holding up well to small hands. I would have returned it but it wasn't worth the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good children's book","review":"I still remember when I was five or six and my dad would read Dr. Seuss books to me. He would want to read this one to me every night, while I would protest and ask to read another Seuss book that was more fun. This one, though it has clever rhymes and a valuable message like all the other Seuss books, it's just not a lot of fun. Let's face it- you're not going to \\"reach\\" a five or six year old child in a book as short as this about environmental issues. Now it would be alright for the book to teach those issues if it didn't drill it in, but sadly it does. This book is not funny like other Seuss books, it's downright depressing. It is quite well-written and clever, so while you may enjoy it, your children's attention will likely soon be lost, as mine was. It is important to remember when writing a children's book who the target readers are. Sadly Dr. Seuss forgot this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocritical","review":"Dr. Seuss, turned holier-than-thou by his elevated status in society, decides to preach to us about the evils of industrialization.

Now, that is not normal in a University setting, but it was perfect. We'd read how Easter Island and other such places died out do to the over forestization of their small island. But nothing really gets the point across as well as Dr. Seuss can. We all giggled at first, but as the prose continued we all just listened. I have never seen a childrens book handle such a serious topic so well before. This is a fantastic book to educate youth on being environmentally concious, and I bet they'll remember the message into their adulthood decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Dr. Seuss","review":"Along with the \\"Giving Tree\\", this is my favorite children's book. I have three children, currently ages 8 1/2, 5 and nearly 3. Over the last 5 years, I've probably read this book well over 100 times and each time it continues to spellbind both me and the children. I began reading this to my oldest when he was three. And while the underlying theme of the book is not understood by a 3 year, by the time he was five, he started asking questions about what the book was about and now he understands the incredibly important lesson that Dr. Seuss had for us. It is amazing to think how far ahead of its time the \\"Lorax\\" was for both the simple lessons it can impart on its young readers/listeners and the very important and critical lessons for its adult/parent readers.It is a true treasure for both child and adult alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Environmental lesson for all","review":"I purchased this book for myself and to read to the children in my family.It has a great lesson on taking care of the environment and enjoyable to read as all Dr. Seuss poems are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save the Environment!","review":"I love all of Dr. Seuss' books but this is my favorite.

Perfect for kindergarten and universities alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid loves it, great price!","review":"My kid loves this book, the new movie sparked his interest in all things Dr. Seuss. I read it to him every other night or so and it seems to be his favorite. It's a bit on the long side for a quick read but usually gives him enough time to nod off a few pages before I finish. Overall it's a classic and you can't go wrong with this high quality hardcover. It shipped quickly and in perfectly new condition as advertised. It was cheaper that the store price by a margin of $3-$4 and in better condition since it wasn't man-handled on the store shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Seuss's greatest work.","review":"The Lorax has to be Dr. Seuss's greatest work.

It is a great example Seuss's typical writing. It is obviously meant for children but is entertaining for all ages. It carries a somewhat of an environmentalist message and in that respect seems somewhat political but is still a very good story due to its well-developed plot and its skillfully done rhyme scheme. Many aspects of it are very humorous especially in the naming of characters and in the names of various places and things mentioned in the story. This element makes it a perfect book for young children as it keeps them interested in the story at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, terrible cassette","review":"The book is of course a classic--I give the book by itself five stars. But this cassette is unbelievably bad, yet another example of his widow's mishandling of the Dr. Seuss estate. Ted Danson's turgid, pretentious reading is so over-the-top melodramatic that it's almost funny--I've been to cheerier funerals.The good doctor wrote this book in part to deflate the dull preachiness so common to the environmental community, but the reading turns out to be a perfect example of what he was rebelling against. Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Seuss books there is!","review":"This story about being a steward for our world and environment is a job for parents and kids alike.

It was one of the hardest things I've had to read in a long time, and even wen I got the jist of what was going on it still didn't flatter me.

Director Frank Darabont leaves no stone unturned in resorting to tired cliches in this fable about this hulking Black man (Duncan) who is on death row for murdering two white girls and befriends a prison guard (Hanks). Through their friendship, it is revealed that Coffey has these healing powers, which, oddly, he uses to save everyone but himself. And yadda, yadda, yadda. The streotypes that emerge in this film are appalling. The performances were okay, but was this really Oscar material? The best thing about this movie is that, at three hours, it's paced fairly well. It goes by so quickly, that you'll hardly realize that you wasted three hours on this preachy, self-important excuse of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film","review":"I really enjoyed this film.

What's so good about seeing somebody fry on the electric chair!!?? I can't believe how the editorial reviewer put it, \\"masterfully and grippingly staged\\". The whole setup of the movie is so disgusting and depressing: a doped guy with saliva runing from his mouth, a prisoner fussing around a mouse, a lunatic guard that gets pleasure out of killing, and to top it all off, a guy coughing up bugs. I think that \\"mastefully and grippingly nauseating\\" would be more like it. I wonder if this movie is frequently watched in nursing homes."},{"rating":"1","title":"will this movie never end?","review":"This movie starts fine enough and Tom Hanks does his usual fine acting job, but the direction on this film is just awful. The blame goes entirely to director Frank Darabont. His heavy-handed direction of The Shawshank Redemption almost ruined that movie. This time it's completely over the top and does end up ruining this movie. Apparently Darabont thinks it's necessary to use a sledgehammer to get the point across that we are dealing with \\"a Christ-like figure\\" here. The movie is at least an hour longer than it needs to be but such is the self-indulgent nature of Darabont. About the only good thing about this movie is that it isn't Darabont's next piece of tripe. \\"The Majestic\\" is so horrid a movie that the ghost of Frank Capra must be haunting Darabont to this day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spineless moving making at its best","review":"This movie was one of THE WORST movies I have seen in quite a long time! The positive quality of the movie was the acting however they weren't given much to work with. The characters were spineless, the storyline was absurd and the movie left me angry and disappointed. I was even disappointed in the mouse! I thought the thing would have a little more character and consciousness than the prison guards who knew the truth but chose to fry John Coffey anyway.

The acting is very good and the plot, while kinda predictable, is entertaining for the 3+ hours that you'll spend watching this movie. Overall, I recommend buying this movie as an excellent addition to your movie library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Show","review":"I had already seen the show of course a long time ago and wanted my grandson to see it. I think it contains an important message about human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very unexpected plot twists","review":"I had heard that this was a great movie, everyone who wrote reviews on here had good things to say about it, so I decided that I would order it. I watched it the other day and five minutes into the movie I though I had the whole plot figured out... not so! it kept my attention for the full 3 hours, i did not expect the outcome to be at all like it was. The only thing i didnt like was the ending... I thought this was a serious movie, but the lines at the end were sooo corny.. I couldnt help but laugh at it. I'm not sure if thats what the writer was going for... but oh well, I still thought it was good"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stephen King movie actually WORTH watching.","review":"As opposed to most Stephen King books made into movies, I was surprised at great this movie actually was. The Green Mile may be rather long, but you don't feel it. It is one of those movies in which you get attached to the characters and when it ends, you end up with one of those \\"That's it?\\" feelings.As far as the special edition version of this film, it is totally worth it.Packaging is also good (plastic packaging, not that inconvenient paper one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a Classic","review":"This movie is a classic, we have this on DVD but wanted the blu-ray. It's one of the first blu-ray purchases we are making because it is one of our favorite movies with such excellent acting and a great cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tear Jerker","review":"I was actually looking for something that my boyfriend would enjoy since he puts up with my chick flicks. Well, even though this is a prison movie, it's really not for guys. I loved it but he just rolled his eyes and asked me to let him pick out our next movie, so careful girls. It's a great story and well worth watching but you may want to consider something else for date night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful. Poignant.","review":"Wow! I can't believe we only just saw this now. What an amazing movie that somehow weaves in the magical without it feeling silly. And what amazing, rich characters. One of my top movies now."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Movie!","review":"The Green Mile is not the type of movie you watch once. It's the kind of movie you need to see twice, to make sure you didn't imagine how good it actually was. The movie starts slow, takes a while to get to the main story, and once there, it never really picks up speed, but it never fails to amaze. Tom Hanks is great, like always and Michael Clarke Duncan is truly superb!! The entire supporting cast are fantastic as well. Not a movie to be missed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very much a King film","review":"This is a bittersweet tale with many moments that make you laugh and others that make you grin as the evil get their just desserts. Good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth seeing","review":"When I first had the opportunity to see \\"The Green Mile\\", I remembered my local newspaper giving it a mediocre review, and I almost passed. I'm sure glad that I didn't...this movie was definitelly worth seeing at least once, and while it has been criticized for its length, the fact is, one of the strengths of this movie was the ability for the director to flesh out each individual character.This movie may not be something I'd want to see more than once, due to it's length (Think about it...if you watched it 8 times, you'd already have spent an entire day of your life watching this movie), but for the one time that I did see it, I saw a movie of masterful artistry and skill, with great acting to boot. For those who said that they fell asleep during this movie...well, they can go on and have their \\"Rambo IX\\"...if you want an intelligent, well thought out movie, I would definitely recommend \\"The Green Mile\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storytelling At Its Best","review":"I seem to be one of the few people who have not read the book, but in this case it probably did not matter. The story itself was captivitaing enough without the help of an excellent cast. Tom Hanks delivering his usual best, Michael Duncan's performance was awesome. The rest of the prison guards were captivating as well, notably the Percy Wetmore character. By the end of the film ( after over three hours ) I was hoping that the film was only half-way. Beats me why it did not win the best film! If you are only going to buy one movie this year this is the one. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic film gets a worthy blu-ray book","review":"Impressive on both the video and audio fronts, this blu-ray represents a significant step up from the DVD (I own both and compared). I personally like the \\"blu-ray book\\" format and enjoy the extra information it provides.Video: Gorgeously shot, richly \\"honeyed\\" in that depression-era-film way, strikingly detailed, some minor edge enhacement raises it's head but it never gets in the way. Excellent and consistent grain field.Audio: The TrueHD mix makes great use of the entire sound field to produce a \\"you are there\\" ambiance. Just listen to that thunder rumble in the distance.Extras: A number of extras that run from the mildly-interesting to the fascinating. I wish the longer making of \\"Myster and Miracles\\" was in HD, but it's still excellent. Skip the shorter \\"Walking the Mile\\".Definitely worth the upgrade if you own the DVD, practically a \\"must-buy\\" if you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Green Mile","review":"I went to see this movie in the cinema a few months ago, not sure on what type of movie this was going to be but for the first 40 minutes it was a standard prison drama. Around now it takes an interesting twist and S Kings influence is obvious and from now on it takes you on a high low emotional ride which even for me left me and all of the rest of the people in the cinema silent at the end. Great movie, the best of Kings films yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Emotions.","review":"Some complain that this movie is too long and it drags on, I disagree. A wonderful film like this needs to be lenghty to set the mood. It is 3 hours of pure heaven. In this time we are introduced to very interesting characters and a VERY VERY well written supernatural fable. The themes hold something for everybody. Weather you are religious or not, you will see into the deep moral ideas that the film has to offer. Even though it is a fable, it has DEEP and realistic emotions that everyone can relate to. The story tackles everything, from overcomming insecurity to true friendship. Plus it has a wonderful little mouse, that provides some comic relief, which fits.An emotional roller coaster. Most Highly Reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really weird story","review":"I wanted to say this movie is disturbing. But I really think of it more as disturbed. What is Steven King trying to say here? This story is just plain weird. It has one particularly horrific scene. The character played by Tom Hanks doesn't seem to act consistently as a decent man. He knows an execution is about to go wrong and does nothing to stop it. He also knows an innocent man is being put to death and does almost nothing to stop it. The movie or story hints at what could possibly have been a better story, but this movie comes accross to me as being \\"Disturbed\\". I'l admit it has some good moments and it is well acted but I can't see any reason for watching it twice. Maybe not even once."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"This is a total touching story and I think it is one of Tom Hanks most powerful preformances! Perfect for both men and women to watch together and both fal in love with The Green Mile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie","review":"I think the green mile was a very well done movie. I thought that it was sort of fun to compare with the shawshank redemption, because they have some similar things about them other than the fact that they were both based on a novel by Stephen King and both directed by Frank Darabont. It was also interesting that The green mile made you sad and the Shawshank Redemption made you want to clap at the end of each movies. I think that all and all the Shawshank Redemption is a better movie but The Green Mile is worthy of a good review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent movie !! Magnífica película !! Superbe film !!","review":"The Green Mile con dos excelente actores, Tom Hanks y Michael Clarke Duncan, es una película de una sorprendente tragedia de un hombre que tiene el poder de curación pero que fue en falso acusado de asesinato. El drama de la condena de muerte del hombre y la amistad del policiaco (Tom Hanks) con el grande hombre de raza negra (Michael Clarke Duncan) son impregnado de una sensacional sensibilidad. Los actores son muy impresionante en The Green Mile y la cualidad de las imagenes son espléndida. Este película de tres horas con una trágica historia es un drama por todo la familia !!!Una película que es necesario comprar !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare gem","review":"Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. The Green Mile isn't a movie about hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Green Mile, A Modern Day Classic!!","review":"The Green Mile is one of my all time favorite films! I had bought the original DVD release, but when this two disc version came out I had to have it. In my opinion it is much better than the single disc version. If you are a fan of films based on the writings of Stephen King you'll love this movie, but then again, if that is the case you have already purchased this. In closing I must say that this film isn't for Stephen King Purists who have already bashed this film anyhow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much, much better than the reviews","review":"Despite not being a King fan, nor usually in love with 3 hour movies, I found this movie exceptional in its depth, its wonderful, incredible cast, and its delicate handling of such a macabre subject. Hanks is as extraordinary as always, but each member of the cast is just as terrific. A must see. You'll never notice the 3 hours. They'll fly by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie, but slightly overdramatic...","review":"This movie is not as good as the book but compensates for the differences in the way things are portrayed to the viewer in each respective medium very well. I didn't think Hanks's accent was good or necessary and the first time I saw Coffy exhale the bugs I thought 'gimme a break... more corny special effects in a Stephen King movie' and it ends up coming off a slight too sappy/overdramatic to me but otherwise this is a solid movie. Wild Bill is a jerk but is a lot of fun to watch and Coffy did a great job too. I also really liked the actor who played Brutal... he did a great job and should hopefully get more chances to show his talent in the future. The acting as a whole here is superb; Delacroix, Percy, the other main guard, and even the mouse are excellent. This movie makes me want to club baby seals... its that good. Yum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better.","review":"This film didn't exceed my expectations. Perhaps it's because Durabont's previous movie (The marvelous, un-paralled Shawshank Redemption) is my all time favorite. Although this movie is not quite as moving, or exhilerating as Shawshank, it none-the-less is a must see. This movie showcases an all around exceptional cast. Even Graham Greene and Gary Sinise make significant impact in their limited roles. This movie is 4 and a half stars all the way. I reccomend you too see it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE STAR IS A MOUSE","review":"Arguably not for everytaste,this supernatural story about a black convict who did not kill the two girls that will send him to the electric chair gets better if you are patient enough to go through it's shakey and long first half.We've got to give TOM HANKS credit for his pick of roles;he is always fun to watch in almost anything.This type of story will always find detractors who can't cope with this kind of storytelling in a movie.A story that has a mouse that lives eternally is after all quite special,even in our time.Don't you think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Green Mile","review":"Throw together a master of suspense in Stephen King, a proven and acclaimed veteran actor Tom Hanks, and one of the largest and fastest rising stars name Michael Duncan, and you have a work of art.The Green Mile tells the tale of a giant man with a giant heart and a gift from above. Splendidly written, acted, and portrayed.Hit the restroom (its three hours and some change in length), grab some popcorn and kleenex, and enjoy what all movies should aspire too. This is one for the men and the women."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Green Mile","review":"For all those people that don't like movies adapted from books because too much is changed from book to script, I say see The Green Mile. I had seen the movie Contact after I read the book and there were alot of major changes. I was expecting some of the same from The Green Mile. I was wrong. Sure, there were some small things left out and changed due to time constants, but overall, I was surprised at just how true to the book it stayed. Every performance in the movie was an excellent one. Especially by Michael Clark Duncan. The movie was also the best of the year. Tom Hanks played Paul Edgecomb masterfully and he and Duncan gave the movie heart. Although over three hours long, you don't feel the time at all. You will become so engrossed in the story it will seem like only a couple minutes. This movie is a must have"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding from beginning to end","review":"Based upon a Stephen King book, this movie tells the story of Louisiana prisoner, seven foot John Coffey. Coffey's mystical powers, his wrongful execution, and the ensuing strange happenings create a movie that's spellbinding from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Prison Movie Unlike Any Other.","review":"O.K., Let's get one thing straight. I'm not one of those Tom Hanks fans who will fawn over his every film and call it the greatest thing since sliced peanut-butter, but this one was good. I have never read the book, nor do I wish to; Stephen King can type far faster than any of us can read. But I must give credit where it is due, and this film stays with you. In some respects it reminds me of \\"The Fisher King.\\" See it! You won't believe it's *only* three-hours long."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Praise of a Featured Veteran","review":"Having not read all of the previous reviews of this excellent King adaptation, I must add to the accolades by singling out one of the film's supporting performers, one who has been a presence for over a half century: Dabbs Greer. Although only seen as the \\"old Paul Edgecomb,\\" Greer makes a memorable turn as the elder version of Tom Hanks in the movie's closing moments. His quiet and dignified soliloquy is truly touching. I cannot tell how moved I was by such a topper to this outstanding bit of storytelling. Greer, as well as all parties involved, magnificently brought one of Stephen King's best works to the screen. Along with \\"The Shawshank Redemption,\\" \\"Mile\\" ranks as the most faithful and cinematically satisfying of any jump from page to the cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forrest Gump, a circus mouse, a gentle giant, Billy the Kid!","review":"This is one great movie that actually works.

The adaptation was wonderful.I admit to not being a serial reader. I read the book in it's entirety, without having to anticipate the next chapter. I could not put the book down. As I watched the movie, and knowing I would be so empathetic to Paul and John, I was still compelled to visualize what my mind had already created.Not unlike \\"Shawshank\\", Mr Darabont has lovingly taken a Stephen King story and put it to cinema. The characters were true to form; Michael Clarke Duncan jumped right out of the book. There could be no other John Coffey.If you've read the book, see the movie. There are some nice positive changes....like Mr. Jingles. If you haven't read the book, see the movie. You will be in for an emotional ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie ever","review":"The Green Mile is the best movie in the world. The cast was great.

In this case, several wardens, who receive into their care a huge prisoner, a gentle giant who happens to have strange and unique powers. The movie is very long - more than 3 hours, but no scene should've been removed, every part has a small meaning which contributes to the larger whole. The casting is superb. The acting is great.

Go and watch it if you haven't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Mile' Electrifies Viewers Everywhere","review":"Tom Hanks, (Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump) plays a head security guard on death row. An imposing, but gentle prisioner, Coffey (not spelled like the drink) was convicted of killing two young girls. During the story, we learn that there is much more to Coffey than his size. We also learn that not every security guard has 'what it takes' to be a good one (even if you are related to someone working for the state.) I loved Hanks and I love the movie.

It's a sappy, cheesy, artificially sentimental movie that opts for a couple of preposterous turns in the story line at the end in order to squeeze a tear or two.If, however, you are the type who like a good cry or you want a date movie to get your chica all weepy eyed so she'll cuddle on up to you, then this movie may do the trick -- just so long as you really don't pay much attention to the story line and how ludicrous and absurd a turn it has to take in order to get the ole tear ducts tapped and aflowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either you'll love it or you'll hate it","review":"*Be Forewarned* - The Green Mile aims straight at the heart and the tear ducts, not the head. Intellectually stimulating fare this movie definitely is not. Does it pander to people in search of a mindless tear-jerker of a flick? You bet.The characters are paper-thin & one-dimensional P>The message of the film - life is hard & we make it harder on one another - is contradictory & self-defeating in that the film's two supposed heroes (John Coffey and Paul Edgecomb) both manage to embody the epitome of cowardice (Edgecomb - moral cowardice; Coffey - spiritual cowardice & self-pity).If you need a good cry, then this may be the film for you.If you like crying for people who feel sorry for themselves and whine about how hard life is, then this may be the film for you.If you are a fan of self-pity and moral cowardice, then this is definitely the film for you!But if you want something of substance then pass on this turkey of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn not watch this in the allotted time frame","review":"Purchased this but unfortuantely I could not watch it in the time frame allowd.

The 3 hour running time may discourage some viewers, but although lesureley paced, The GREEN MILE is never dull and always involving. The DVD keeps the mostly dark colors sharp and clear at all times. However I found the DVD to be a bit disappointing since I expected more \\"extras\\" than was available (a trailer and a brief 11 minute featurette was all). I would have hoped for more cast interviews or perhaps a commentary track or an isolated music score track. Perhaps this title will be re-released at a later date with more extras. Despite the absence of extras, this DVD certainly deserves a permenant place in your home library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Mile [Blu-ray]","review":"Really like this movie a lot.

One of them is a very tall man but would not hurt a fly and there is ride and mean Percy who will make trouble where ever he can.

At three hours this is a vastly and needlessly overlong film and Hanks is wasted in the lead. It was surprisingly nominated for Best Film (not deserving) and Screenplay as well as the nod to Duncan.

The acting is fine, the writing is fine, in fact there really isn't much to critique beyond the fact that film just wasn't all that powerful. The movie ends and that's just it, it's over and it doesn't have any resonance. It's as if a group sat down and decided to make the perfect movie, but in the process left out the most important thing: heart. I can neither say anything glowing about \\"Green Mile\\" nor anything derogatory. It just lacks that special feeling Darabont's last King adaptation had.

I saved 2 hours by not watching the rest :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable","review":"Well-acted, nicely shot, and at moments quite moving, 'The Green Mile' is ultimately undone by its staggering 188 minute running time. Such languorous pacing adds nothing to the film - except fuel the audience's irritation with an unforgivably predictable plot and some pretty heavy-handed moralizing. Darabont tries his best to wring some significance out of King's story, but the material ultimately proves too slight: this tale could have been capably told in 100 minutes or, better yet, deployed as a vignette in a prison film such as Darabont's vastly superior 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Dragging it over three hours stretches the material too thinly, and in the end leaves a potentially deep story looking rather shallow. This is a good lesson in filmmaking: you can have a fine director, a savvy cinematographer, a marvellous score, an excellent cast, and $60 million to play with - but if you don't have a decent screenplay, then you might as well stay home. Just ask Kevin Costner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure why i'm so revolted by this movie","review":"I was disgusted by the way this movie ended and especially the last execution scene. Not because it was too graphic, but because it was such a storytelling cop out. It doesn't make any sense. Nor does the big giant's (John Coffee's) \\"I'm tired, boss . . . yadda, yadda, yadda,\\" speech, \\". . . it would be a kindness you'd be doing to do some physician-assisted suicide on me,\\" speech. But then most of the major premises of this movie are bogus anyway. It seems that the only point of this movie is to play on people's sympathies. That didn't happen for me. instead I just feel disgusted with this film. What a waste.For the emotionally impaired, you'll find this a five star movie and delightful use of an evening.For the more sensible and intelligent, you'll likely find this a one or two star movie and a waste of your time and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"Dull, corny, sappy, predictable .... Where have you ever seen such lovely death row inmates before! Don't kill him - he's just a mass murderer and he has a pet mouse! Hah! And what's with all the urine in this film ... some kind of weird fixation going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"moving story, lame ending. Warning: SPOILERS","review":"SPOILERS. I loved the movie (minus the horrific execution scenes and other disturbing parts), but the ending I thought fizzled out. After John dies, the scenes with the old man Paul and the mouse are just lame. It was already supernatural enough with John having the special healing power, don't go an make it more hokey with the mouse and the old man living an extra 50 years or whatever. They could have done so much more with the ending, to make the message of executing an innocent man sink in...I wanted to see justice. I wanted to see the case revisited, John proven innocent, I wanted to see the shame of the jury, the judge, the town, and the victims' family as they learned the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not matter how many times I watch this movie...","review":"It gets me every time in one way or another. Spoiler)Just the other day a very edited version was showing on TNT and when it came to the part where the guards were taking John Coffy to see the sick lady, I just could not stop sobbing. This really surprised me because first of all the cuts should had watered down any emotional impact after watching the complete version. This is one movie that never gets tired. I love it every time like it was the 1st time and now I'm buying it on DVD. Update (10/12/2011); What's wrong with me? AMC is airing this movie this week on mulitple days and I get hooked every time, even when I just want to see where the movie is at any particular time, but then I'm hooked until (near) the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Green Mile","review":"This is one of the best movie that I have seen so far. The movie pulls the audiences in to feel and have a taste of the life of inmates on death row. The essential part is that, their feelings and emotion while being put on the fine line between live and death.The most touching part of the movie is how prison guards have to stick to their duty while executing an innocent man despite they know he didn't do the crime.Of course, the supernatural power of the big guy does give the audiences a pleasant shock and reflected how kind and little he is despite of his enormous size.All in all, it is one hell of a movie. You won't believe how good it is when it sucks you into the scene.It is just amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GENTLE GIANT!","review":"A compelling look into the lives of men on death row and the circumstances which brought them to prison. One, a gentle giant possesses the gift of clairvoyance and healing. His innocence, and gift is recognized by a few compassionate prison guards and the prison warden whose sick wife is cured by his efforts. Tom Hanks and a superb cast make this film believable.

The writting was exellent and music too. I loved John Coffee.

A wonderful story, well written and beautifully acted. The cast was top notch too. Hanks, David Morse, James Cromwell and especially, Michael Clarke Duncan who played John Coffey were all really good.This last time I viewed it was via Amazon streaming and it worked perfectly with no delays or any other technical problems. The film is excellent. If you haven't yet seen it you should."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great story !","review":"Being an avid Stephen King fan, i have read the book twice, listened to it on tape and seen the film twice. It's a wonderful story. Everyone that i have talked too about it has said the same... GREAT STORY! I highly reccommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough About The Length!","review":"I have to say this movie ranks in my top five all-time favorite films, up there with \\"Shawshank\\" and \\"Matrix\\". I want to emphasize that, though many complained about the 3-hour length of the movie, it needed to be that long. Anyone who read the serial novel first will find that Darabont's adaptation is impeccable. It tells a good story with a moral and is not meant to be a simple, quick entertainment fix. Also, I do agree that it helps to know the length of the movie, being that one ought to be in the mood to sit through a 3-hour movie. However, if the movie had been any shorter, it would not have been \\"The Green Mile\\", more like \\"The Green 2/3 Of A Mile\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best adaption of any book to movie I've seen yet. . .","review":"Though it varies in small ways from the book, this Stephen King adaption still gets the message across. Tom Hanks is perfect as the hero, Paul Edgecomb. (Paul is the kind of guy you would want to give a hug every day, because he is just so damned nice.) In fact, all the actors are pretty much perfect for their part. The Green Mile takes place in a prison, in E Block (Death Row), where the tiles are the color of faded limes. A mysterious, monstorous inmate arrives (John Coffey), with an amazing healing power only King could think up. This movie really has multiple plots, with multiple climaxes, which makes it all the more enjoyable. I don't know what else to say, except-- buy this movie, read the book, rent it, whatever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Classic","review":"Want to see a movie classic in the making? Watch this movie. It's simply outstanding. Very entertaining and excellent acting. Spellbinding story line. Yes, it's a long movie, but like Titanic, you don't mind the time because the story and acting is so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"sledgehammer american propoganda","review":"After seeing The Shawshank Redemption which was an amazing story about the human spirit with believable characters I thought this film would be equally enjoyable. I wonder if I am alone in thinking that the whole story of the mouse fairytale of the mouse city in florida wasn't just american myth making about disneyland and micky mouse at it's worst. And all the religeous connotations of the John Coffey (JC) character being an almost straight representation of Jesus Christ a bit too much to swallow for someone who likes their symbolism in films too bit a bit more liberally chosen and wouldn't have chosen to watch the film if it was advertised as a moralistic tale almost straight out of the bible. I just felt a bit manipulated that's all, I'm not averse to this type of film I just think it needed a bit more of a balancing voice really."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Green Mile","review":"Great service, came in a timely fashion.

I highly recommend this one. For the most part this cd is slower than other Caddies' records but is heavier too.The band has honed its style to a T. It is a mix of ska, reggae, punk, and pure rock 'n roll fun.If you have a chance to see these guys live, don't miss it cause they're great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad caddies return with a better album.","review":"Just one more is a pretty impressive album theres a few slow reggae/ska songs which really stand out like popcorn did at the end of duck and cover and the punk/ska songs still maintain high quality (10 west in particular). It's an instant improvement on rock the plank as the horns make more of an appearance which really make up the mad caddies unique sound. 'Just one more' is not quite up to the standard of 'quality softcore' and 'duck and cover' but it's taken a different direction to those albums as the albums horns sound more jazz orientated at times like monkeys with the trad-jazz sound you hear this on last breath and leavin mainly. The song just one more is one of the best on the cd it has a bit of a spanish feel to it, spare change, 10 west and day by day are also stand out tracks on the album. If you are looking for any ska album though get any album by the mad caddies as they are the most innovative ska band around at the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good, but...","review":"This CD is pretty good, but it's more of a compilation than a full album. It goes from song to song, and only a few really stick out. This is not to say that the songs are bad, it's just that they are almost disposable. It's a very good album, but it just goes from one to another, and you don't know where you're coming from or going to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chlorophyl?","review":"More like borophyl!

I didn't find that many errors although there was some.This was a good book about Kate, an actress, who is working to help support the family. She doesn't like the acting job. To find out if she stays, read this book. It was pretty good and worth the $.99!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice coming of age novel","review":"It's been a long time since I read this lovely coming of age novel; Kate is a teenage actress, and when her actor father is written out of his soap opera, suddenly she is the family breadwinner. But, she's still a teenager, and she's torn a bit between the challenges of being famous and thus isolated from everyone else her age.

I called it quits after page 38! And I rarely ever quit reading a book. Indeed, Hillman is brilliant, and a scholar, but I'd rather read a synopsis than labor through his pedantic style that takes 10 pages to say what could be succinctly stated in one paragraph.

If you expected someone to be able to include every aspect of a 309 page novel in a two hour movie, your expectations are far too high. They included the key elements to capture the true feel of the novel. 3. This movie should be praised for Dominique Swain's performance alone. She played the part perfect. 4.

This movie (and screenplay) captures next to nothing of what Nabokov was attempting to tell. Instead of a witty, sarcastic, intelligent, and clever book on the timeless (and ageless) nature of love, you get a sappy, sentimental, two hours of Jeremy Irons weeping and moaning that adds up to nothing more than a movie that, if it hadn't been for the subject matter, would have been a movie of the week- AT BEST.

B) Motors makes very louds noises during the day and night.The product is constantly loud, but those occasion noises are enough to keep me awake at night, so I had to move the product farther away from the bedroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Petmate fountain","review":"Overall, I really like this fountain. After 3 years, my Petmate fountain motor died. I decided to go with a new fountain instead of just replacing the motor. I'm going to compare the two:How this one is better:Better quality plastic, easier to cleanLooks nicerCan add extra water reservoirsCat likes the stream of water betterNot better:It is a little noisier. (I'm not talking about the awful noise that it makes if it is too low, the other one did that too.) It's noticeably louder, even with the stream of water on low, but not enough that I want to switch back. It just takes some getting used to. I keep it in the kitchen, so if you have it somewhere more out of the way it wouldn't be an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"It was so noisy and loud I had to return it. And it leaked. The cat wasn't sure if she should be scared of it or not. So far, the Pet Mate is far superior. And a lot quieter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful product, don't waste your money","review":"I have been through two of these fountains. Both arrived cracked around the motor. I tried to use them anyway, but they stopped working within a few minutes and the water gushed out over my floor. This is not Amazon's fault, but the manufacturer's fault. It has been a pain to repack and return. Don't waste your time or money. Don't order this Drinkwell item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps the cats hydrated","review":"It does work. Before, the only way my cats would drink water was when I turned on the bathroom faucet. They didn't care for the water bowl because it loses oxygen or something like that. It was pretty annoying and I would worry they would get dehydrated if I wasn't home. But after I got the drinking fountain, I see them drinking from it through out the day. They sometimes even played with the flowing water.Although you can hear the water flowing, it doesn't bother me at all. It sounds like one of those therapeutic fountains. The only time it makes an annoying noise is when the water is running out, which is good because it acts as a reminder to refill the reservoir.The only thing that's a pain is washing it. It's not as simple as washing a bowl, just because the electric cord is attached to the fountain (of course)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet water fountain","review":"We love this fountain! Our cat is wierd and loves fresh water, as in wants it moving and straight from the source. She would run to the sound of water every time she heard it so we needed to do something to keep her out of the sinks and shower. We bought her this and she absolutely loves it! After she took a long drink she sat and watched it for quite a while. You can adjust the flow of water. If you want just a trickle it isn't as loud and the water doesn't move very much, or go up to a normal flow like from a faucet. Even on the full flow it still isn't very loud. It holds a fair amount of water, but if you want to go for about a week without filling you had better get the tank to go with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky fountain","review":"My cat really loved the drinkwell fountain, but unfortunately it leaked and I'm not sure about getting another one,"},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is garbage!","review":"I bought this for my 3 cats, who love the running water part of it. But with multiple cats, it gets dirty quickly. The cheap plastic holds a film on it, that once it is on the inside surface, is almost impossible to get clean. I've used a handheld steamer and a bottle brush, denture brush, vinegar and about 60 miles of paper towels. Then there is the noise. It always made a growling sound when the water was low, but now, even with the water to the top, it still makes a grinding noise that is irritating if you live in a small apartment. I tried setting it on a thick towel, but the noise persists. The filters aren't cheap either and don't last very long. Basically, it's a cheap plastic bowl with a small aquarium pump in it. Save your money and buy the stainless steel model or build your own fountain from a flower pot and an aquarium pump. If my cats had Visas, even they wouldn't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cat likes it","review":"My very picky cat loves drinking out of this. We haven't had any problems with it.

Our first Drinkwell fountain was in constant use for about 3 years until it was inadvertently stepped on and broken beyond repair. Two cheap replacements only lasted 8 and 3 months, respectively. I bought another Drinkwell fountain in July, 2010 through Amazon and after a year and a half, it's still working just fine. I take it apart every 3-4 weeks to clean it thoroughly and replace the filter.The ONLY problem I have with it - which resulted in 4 instead of 5 stars - is that the pump is very hard to remove for cleaning. And it DOES need to be cleaned. It necessarily attaches in a very tight, leakproof seal, but is situated in such a way as to make it very, very difficult to detach from its housing. If there was more space allowed to apply sufficient leverage to remove the pump more easily, I'd have given this fountain 5 stars. Btw: re-attaching the pump is no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit after one year","review":"Great concept. Poor execution. The item started leaking around a year after purchase.

Geez, what a waste of my money in this economy. I can't even get a refund... or at least can't find a way to do such and even if I did the shipping and time alone would be more than the price of the fountain. I guess I am screwed.

I like that the fountain has a large 50-oz capacity and adjustable output. I set it towards the lower end because my cat likes to splash. The set up was also easy. However, the motor is pretty noisy.

Trust me, I folllowed all directions, even cleaned the impeller, it was absolutely clean. No, this is just a bad design, I can't believe they haven't changed a thing in 10 years to make it better. At least pick a better material for its structure! The plastic they chose is just like an amplifier to the motor! Not recommended for anyone.

That's pretty good so I have no complaints. Then I bought another. Worked beautifully for 1 day and then began making a noise, kinda like something was loose inside. Was so loud that I could hear it in every room of my apartment. Could not return it because of where I got it (good price, no returns) so I figured I had a 'lemon' and should try again. Went on Amazon and saw an amazingly good price. So I bought it. I also perused the reviews and saw about a 50-50 split on the annoying noise (a rattling which drowns out the 'gentle hum'). Just got it. Plugged it in last night and was delighted that it was QUIET. Until 4am when I was awakened by a buzzing-rattling-something-is-loose-inside-here sound, just like the last one. I give up. The product is badly made. Fortunately the noise doesn't bother my cats, so I will unplug it when I go to sleep. Will never ever buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pet Fountain","review":"I purchased two of these fountains on the recommendation that it would help my newly blind dog find his way to his water bowl. Unfortunately, since he is diabetic and constantly drinking water, I am constantly having to refill the bowl. Plus, with his long whiskers, he is constantly getting food and such in his water. When this occurs, I have to pick up the entire fountain, unplug it, dump the old water, and then refill it again. This process was taking place several times a day. It was just easier to secure his original water bowl in the same spot and refill it as needed. I did like the idea of him being able to hear the water trickling though, just too bad I had to refill and clean the bowl so often."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat deserves the best!","review":"A few months ago we rescued an adult cat, 'Dexter' from our local shelter. He's absolutely perfect in every way but one---He wouldn't drink from his water dish; he preferred drinking from the toilet! Keeping all toilet lids down really didnt solve the problem, he would then just lap at the sauce from his wet food. We saw this item on your site and decided to give it a try. For the first couple of days he just watched it from a distance. Then my husband came up with the idea to play with him with his laser light and actually had the light moving all over the water. Dexter chased the laser light right to the water, putting his paw in it. He jumped ack at first, and then actually took a drink. Now he drinks from the stream of water several times a day. We consider it a wonderful product and know that our cat is much healthier getting the daily,fresh water that he needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality !","review":"I owned a Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain for years and it needed replaced.

I even caught him drinking from the toilet, which worried me because of chemicals from cleaners I use. But now that he has this pet fountain, he never bothers with the sink or other unsafe sources of water anymore, and I feel better knowing that his water is always filtered and healthy. This fountain is very easy to set up, is quiet, and low-maintenance. It holds a good amount of water, and I really like that the flow of water is adjustable. This fountain is also good for small dogs...after seeing mine, my mom ordered one for her shih-tzu/poodle mix and she loves it also!

Has to be cleaned a lot, even with filter.-It is very difficult to remove the motor when you need to clean it. If you do not have small fingers, forget it. Even with lubrication, it is difficult. I dread fighting it every time. Finally, the bowl cracked and now it is useless. I do not think it is worth getting a replacement.

Hence, I have asked for a RMA and will try one more unit to see if I can get one that works. Of course this only increases the price of unit as we have to pay shipping, and if the second doesn't work I will have to pay shipping again, grr. I suggest making sure you look at who is selling.

I cleaned the fountain 3 times thinking that the problem was food or particles floating in the water. I stuck my hand under the spout to see if the water was cool, and I felt an electrical charge.

I clean it out once a week (you really need to take it apart to clean everything) - the water intake inside the bowl clogs very easily, I end up pulling fur out of it every night - this is why you'll need to take it apart more often. I use the sink sprayer to remove the slimy residue our water leaves in the bowl (another reason it needs to be cleaned every week). There is one area in the water reservoir that is next to impossible to clean just by rinsing - you need a bottle cleaner to really scrub it out. The cats seem to like it - the older cat wants running water to drink - he'd go all day before I got this waiting for the water bowl to be refilled so he could drink the water as it was being poured.

I added water to it three times yesterday. I think it would be great for one thirsty cat, not two. The lid does not snap on it lays on, and gets flipped off all the time by me or the cats. It's super easy to clean with plain water (there is a step by step youtube video on how to disassemble and clean). I think if I would have known, I would have bought the next generation of this item as it has a snap on top and it has another filter that you can pull and clean out that catches hair and bugs that get in the water.

I am constantly cleaning the fountain because the filter cartridges leave charcoal all over the slide. If it is not completely full, it is so noisy that my cat won't go anywhere near it. The flow control broke on the first one, which I returned to the store, and then broke again on the second one the last time I took it apart to clean. The PetMate had none of these issues, and I was able to stick it in the dishwasher on the top rack. In terms of design, the Drinkwell is very hard to fill unless you buy the add on reservoir. I only have one cat, and so did not purchase the reservoir... leaving the only way to really fill the fountain is by dumping the water in the front. Also, since the motor sits on the outside, it is very prone to collecting condensation and developing slime or mold issues.I just reordered a PetMate fountain to replace this one... its a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!

It vibrated and hummed so loudly we had to turn it off in order to have some quiet in the kitchen. I sent a couple of e-mails to the company questioning if this normal but received no answer.

I cleaned it once on my first unit -- not at all on the last two. My cats love this fountain and I want them to have running water -- I'm willing to think of this as a disposable item if I can get a year out of each unit -- but less than 6 months is a little more than I can manage.

It took him a week to get used to it, then he slowly began drinking from the fountain bowl and now, 3 weeks later, he also drinks from the spout and does not touch his old water bowl. At our follow-up visit with the vet, my cat's bad #'s indicating poor kidney function were back down within the normal range because he drank so much...he was flushing the toxins out! This is a great product. Especially for cats on dry food, and dogs, because their bodies were not meant to digest dry kibble type food and need more water to compensate for this. This product is great for cats diagnosed with renal failure. I highly recommend it!

No appliance in my home sounds as loud and irritating as this is!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drinkwell Dunks","review":"Bought this for my cats as one was just diagnosed with diabetes. It is so noisey that my husband can't stand having it plugged in and the cats walk a mile around it rather than drinking out of it. Yes, we've cleaned it, checked the filter and all sorts. I think it was a waste of money as it's a very expensive water dish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China","review":"I purchased the Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain from Amazon.com and upon opening the package learned that the product was Made in China. Because of my concerns about toxins in many Chinese products, I telephoned customer service of the manufacturer to find out more information. The representative could not give me answers to satisfy my concerns so this product is going back. Why can't products be made in the U.S.??? I would gladly pay more--"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My cats have always jumped on the sink to get fresh flowing water. So glad I bought the Drinkwell, now they actually drink from a bowl and never jump on the sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design","review":"The first time the unit had to be dismantled and cleaned, it began leaking. The seal between the motor and the plastic fountain is very poor. Teflon tape and plumber's putty helped seal the leak for awhile, but after a couple of cleanings, the plastic fountain developed a crack and the leak became worse. Would never recommend this drinking fountain to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinkwell Pet Fountain","review":"My kitties love it.

But my cat seemed weirded out by it. It was a little noisey so I think that scared her. She wouldn't drink out of it until I unplugged it. Unplugged there was no point having it because it was just a water bowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats Love It","review":"My cats love to drink out of a faucet and are seriously enjoying the Drinkwell Fountain. Would recommend to anyone with a cat or dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea, But My Cat Ignores It","review":"The product is great. It works well, is clean, not too loud (the water running is louder than the hum of the motor that some talk about but it's relaxing). I've had it set up for weeks. I've let it run with the fountain and unplugged it with just the water sitting in the bowl and my cat has not touched it yet! My cat drinks out of every faucet in the house and begs, literally, for taps to be turned on so he can drink out of them but he stares at this contraption, sniffs, and walks away. He hasn't tried it, not once, even when it's just sitting water. Such a bummer to have spent $70 on the full kit which I thought was a great deal. I keep hoping someday he'll warm up to it. If not, I guess I'll pack it away for future kits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats like it","review":"This is my (three cats') second one. I purchased the first one six years ago and it still works but calcium build up was beyond average cleanings (yes I soaked it in CLR many times). Good value, filters really work. The cats really love it and the gurgling reminds them to drink I think. The old one is now used outside on the front porch sans the filters and even the birds like it. I do recommend the add-on resevoir because it holds several days worth of water and is very easy to carry to the sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"really noisy","review":"I had a petmate fountain that cracked and was looking for a replacement. This looked and sounded good. I read the reviews and thought \\"how noisy could a cat fountain be?\\". I expected a hum to the motor. Then I plugged it in and realized that the motor is insanely loud. It's not a hum. The cat is terrified of it and I can't say that I blame him. Luckily, he's pretty good about drinking water so I am going to try to \\"make it work\\" by running the motor and circulating the water primarily when he's outside. However, I'm sure I'll end up buying another one before too long, and I'll buy the petmate one I had before. It was impossible to clean but it was quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Platinum model!","review":"As others have experienced, I have a senior cat who needs to be encouraged to drink. The unit is a bit noisy so I put it in the hallway on a pad designed for muddy boots (in case of spills), and a soft pad on top of that to absorb some vibration. It helped.The crevices in the unit make it a bear to clean by hand so I rinsed it a time or two a week and every 2 weeks disassembled it and put it in the dishwasher. Have had a LOT OF trouble removing the pump to put it in dishwasher. Last time removing and replacing were both awful. You'd think it'd get easier. Upon replacing the pump, the unit leaked. Thank goodness it was on a boot pad which caught the leakage. Disassembled and reassembled and still leaked, though not as much. Unit is less than a year old.Just bought the upgrade - Platinum - so worth it! Spend the extra $$ for the Platinum!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"3/4 cats love drinking from it.

I purchased it on December 3, 2010 and today is February 21, 2011 and it stopped working 2 days ago. The motor burned out, so it didn't even last 2 months. I wouldn't recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I love this thing. It works exactly as expected. The sound of it running is very quiet. The instructions weren't very good. The only thing you need to know is that the filter doesn't need to be cut; just slide it into the tank. The filter initially discolors the water, so put it under the faucet to get any initial charcoal residue out before putting it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to keep clean","review":"I used this fountain for years and finally gave up and went to a stainless steel bowl. The main problem is keeping the water clean. The thing needs to be disinfected weekly and water changed regularly. The plastic grows a slimy film of bacteria. It's much easier to just wipe and refill a simple stainless bowl.The other problem is the buzzing sound it makes now and then. The noise is not consitent or predictable but can be annoying.Some cats do prefer to drink from a running stream of water and if there was a drinking fountain that solved the above two problems I'd be prepared to try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud... scared the cats","review":"After reading all the positive reviews, I thought this would be a good replacement for the water fountain we already use.It was easy to set up and seemed easy to clean, but the motor was so loud that the cats wouldn't go near it.I hope I can get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fountian","review":"This fountian is great and we liked it but after using it only a few days we realized it leaks on the floor, seems to leaking underneath around the pump area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain","review":"Defective - leakage around the motor housing.

He likes to play with the stream, sticking his paw in there and letting the water run over it. He drinks from it quite a bit.However, I hate this thing. I think it was designed by some sadist who loves tormenting pet owners. It's incredibly difficult to break down, and the pieces have a lot of sharp corners and edges that will constantly poke at you. After a 5 minute struggle to get the motor out, your hands will be streaked with scratches. You'll want to take it outside and smash it with a baseball bat."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I purchased this for a 18 year old cat and she actually took to it right away.

I returned it & went to the pet store and purchased a Petmate, which is extremely quiet and well worth the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece Of Junk","review":"Broken after one week of use. When it did work, it was loud and leaked. With the location it was in, I didn't notice it was leaking until it ended up on the level below where we had it! What a mess!!

Was quite satisfied, as my pets like it. It was running since then, until two weeks back the motor got burnt out, as i left with ignorant hands. Nevermind, immediately I order new one from Amazon,got in two days. Set it up and it was good, until the next early morning, when the motor was being too noisy. There was a huge water leakage. Felt bad, but i ordered another one, just assuming this could be one defective piece. The second order came in about two days, and that also leaked. Was mad now, as had to return defective items. I believe the product is good, but the company who is selling at present is missing quality check on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, kitties love it !","review":"We bought the drinkwell water fountain for our 2 cats.

The water here is pretty good quality so we do not use the filter. At first he was hesitant to use the fountain, but after a day was used to it. I think he drank more often than from just a dish. I found that it wasn't too hard to clean, but maybe our cat didn't make too much of a mess in the fountain. You do have to add water at least every 2-3 days to keep it full. Generally quiet, but if the capacity drops by more than about 15 oz or so it becomes quite noisy. I haven't yet tried the larger capacity add-on yet, though. I also keep the regulator half-way to reduce any noise. Price at Amazon is about $10 cheaper than the retail store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat's personal water fountain","review":"We saw a larger drinkwell fountain at a friend's home for her two cats.

Here's the kicker, I can't more highly recommend that you team this purchase with theDrinkwell Reservoir, 50 Ounceas that seems to last about a week with our 10lb kitty. She loves the running water and the convenience of not having to change the water every day (cats prefer fresh water) far out-weighs the inconvenience of a once every couple of weeks cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"This leaked and was a lemon","review":"The one I received was unusable as all the water leaked out on to the floor within 3 hours. I tried reassbmling twice, but could not fix the problem Ended up throwing it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unshy kitties will love this!","review":"If your cat isn't shy or timid and is open to exploring..then they should fall in love with this product. I originally bought this fountain for an aging kitty, but he was very old and never took to using it.. However, my six year old male Maine-Coon/Tabby mix has taken over the fountain. He is a big, bold cat who loves to explore and this was just the purrfect fit for him. He gets fresh water when he wants it and will seldom use a regular water bowl any more.My girl kitty (very shy), still prefers a regular water bowl, which I have in another location for her needs.For me, there are no downsides, you just need to take the fountain apart about every six weeks to clean it out and change the filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Fountain","review":"It's a very nice fountain and my cat drank out of it almost right away (it took some getting used to#.It works great, but I must say it is just a little noisy. I have it placed in my room, so at night I can hear it rather well. If it wasn't in my room I probably wouldn't notice.It does make a pretty loud noise if you don't put enough water in it. So unless you feel like filling it up frequently it's probably a good idea to get the 50 ounce reservoir (which I'm planning to do). It came with a filter so you don't need to worry about buying those right away.The fountain that I received also was not the silver color of the main picture. It was like the speckled blue pictures. But it still looks very nice and works wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"My cats love to drink out of the faucet, and I was worried about them not drinking enough water. I got this - and they seem to like it. They still beg for the faucet - but not as much. Its worth the value - been running it a month and have had no problems. You need to keep the water level high - filling it daily - otherwise it starts to make a noise as if the motor is spinning not catching water when there is water in the bowl. It just needs a consistent level."},{"rating":"2","title":"If brand new motor is noisy... contact the company for a new one!","review":"When I received my drinkwell fountain, it was so noisy that it drowned out the sound of the falling water! You could hear it rooms away. My fountain was not low on water and my motor was not clogged. I contacted the company and they said it should be no louder than the hum of a fridge. Mine was definitely louder. After emailing with a REAL PERSON at the company, she deemed that my motor was malfunctional. They sent a new one and.... it's about 10x quieter! So now I am happy, and dealing with the company was actually a pleasant process compared to regular customer service!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good but HORRIBLE TO CLEAN!","review":"We have had this fountain for 5 years now and it is the worst to clean and can NEVER be totally cleaned even with the cleaning brushes specially designed for it. If you buy it you will be sorry for that part of it. You can never get it 100% clean as they built it with too many nook and corners. I'm on here now looking for something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product worked wonderfully","review":"I did have a little problem with the initial shippment of this item because it was on back order and they did not tell me so. But, everything was ironed out and got the product and it works GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big pain at best","review":"I bought this pet fountain a year ago and I should have listened to reviews that mentioned how hard it is to clean this thing. My cats love this fountain. Your cat may not--they're unpredictable, which is part of the fun of cats. But even though my cats love the fountain, I slowly grew to hate it. It's a pain to take it apart and clean it out. At first I didn't think it was too bad, but every time I took it apart and reassembled it it was harder and harder to take it apart again. The motor has to be twisted and then pulled out of the base and after a year of use it is now nearly impossible to get the stupid thing out. There are too many corners and small places that have to be scrubbed to get them truly clean. I suspect that most of these fountains are sitting on a shelf somewhere like mine is, unused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Implementation","review":"This is a good idea, and it works fine for the cats, but it was misery for me. I had a heck of a time disassembling the fountain for cleaning, and getting the motor in and out of the casing required me to use a hex wrench as a lever. After less than a year, the motor treads stripped off completely, making it impossible to reattach. I had to throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"None of them work well","review":"Noisy, clogs easily requiring frequent cleaning and started leaking after only four months.... After extensive review, starting with the bad reviews first, I came to the conclusion that all these commercial fountains are problematic. On a quest to build a better mouse trap I found this DYI fountain on YouTube:Filtered Pet Water BowlIt uses a 10 gallon external fish tank pump and I have it attached to a Hamilton Beach mixing bowl with the intake tube covered with a piece of stocking mesh. After four months now I can state it is easy to clean, very quiet, inexpensive to put together and my cat loves it. See the image I've added of my own setup, at this point #30 of the customer images below the Drinkwell images."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control Problems for this Fountain","review":"This pet fountain leaks like a bastard. So it was returned for a refund. The fountain leaks water at the point where the pump is secured to the dish."},{"rating":"1","title":"review","review":"I bought this and it leaks like crazy, cats love drinking from it, but all it does is leak. that really needs to be addressed. why make a water fountain that leaks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought this pet fountain because I wanted my cats to have a fresh, filtered & flowing water source available to them at all times. This fountain DOES NOT provide that. It does not filter out anything. The intake accumulates cat hair and it just sits on the intake...it doesn't get filtered out. Cleaning the fountain is very time consuming, and once a week is not enough if you want the water to stay clean. The plastic was stained and rough almost immediately. I kept this fountain for about 3 months, and decided to just throw it away one day when I was tired of trying to get it clean. The design of it makes it very difficult to get all the nooks and crannies clean. Even with the brushes that they recommend you clean it with! Overall, I would say DON\\"T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Your cats will have a cleaner source of water if you just use a bowl and wash it out when you refill it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Petmate waterer","review":"The Drinkwell is really noisy. I returned this product for the Petmate Deluxe waterer, which is very quiet, and has an on/off switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what's worse....","review":"I have a cat who would rather die of dehydration than drink out of an ordinary bowl...she is such a princess!! I bought this item from a local pet store and it was WAY more expensive than on Amazon (about $20 more), I wish I had looked here first even though I don't think it's worth the $30 they are charging. I have to say that the fountain is incredibly noisy, whether it is full or not and it is about as equivilant to my cat crying for water from the faucet. Also, if it isn't cleaned every week or so it gets so clogged with gunk that it won't even run and cleaning it is no easy feat. You have to take the whole darn thing apart and the electrical chord isn't detachable. I think the filter is just really a ploy to get you to spend more money becuase it doesn't last more than two weeks even with regular cleaning. My cat loves it though and it is the only product that she will actually use, so it's just one hassle trade off for another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it stoppppp","review":"I bought this fountain about 8 months ago; I have thoroughly cleaned it once a week, never let it run dry, and followed all of the instructions it came with. About 2 months ago, it started making a humming sound. Currently, I am about to chuck it out the window because it sounds like a tiny jet is taking off in our kitchen. I don't know what the bugs are with this fountain but I would definitely recommend buying a different one. Our cat likes it and drinks more water but we will be upgrading soon- Drinkwell needs to address this problem because it is a common one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cats love this.","review":"My cats drink way more water now that I use a fountain, which is great. They love this thing so much that if I turn it off for a while for cleaning, they come running as soon as it comes back on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is not the drinkwell I remember!!!!!","review":"My first drinkwell lasted over 5 years with no problems!! However #2 lasted 2 months and this latest #3 lasted one week before the motor stopped and couldn't be restarted!! In 5 years the company forgot how to put QUALITY in their product. I might as well have flushed over 60 dollars away from the luck I have had with the last 2 machines. I am going to try another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"my cats loove this and love having fresh water all the time!","review":"Well worth the money spent because my 2 cats always have fresh, cold running water and has not been a problem as of yet. I do not expect any issues, no drips, leaks, or loud noises. Now if the water does get low you will hear the motor so i have since ordered the 70 oz water reservoir attachment to fix this issue and limit how often I am having to pout water in the fountain. Since the fountain and reservoir were reasonably priced I am not really complaining. Since summer is right around the corner I will feel much more at ease being gone all day with the kids knowing that the cats will have plenty water to drink while we are gone. If something comes up I will update this review, but so far we <3 it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love these fountains. This is the third I've purchased over the years. The first one's motor burned out, probably because I sometimes didn't keep it full enough! But now I have an additional reservoir and that makes all the difference. The second one I cracked putting the motor in after cleaning. Totally my fault. But this one is working a charm - keeps the cats heppy and certainly healthier when they are all getting enough water. You know how picky cats can be! They all love the running water.Editted to add, October 2012:The dish cracked again, right in the area you put the motor in after cleaning. Clearly this cannot be just me. I'm super careful now. After having cracked the previous dish, I even use a tiny bit of cooking oil to limit resistance between the motor and the plastic bowl. Still cracked. Argh. Bought another, but really annoyed that the company that makes this won't sell just the dish. I don't need all the other parts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy...stopped working.","review":"I recently bought this for my little ones. We had another one for years but it was time for a new one.I set it up and everything worked well. One of the cats has a fat head and he tried to drinkdirectly in front of the spout and as he lowered his head the fountain poured onto his ear.He realized that he has to drink from the end. The overall construction is of a tough plastic.I plugged it in and it worked for a few hours. It stopped working and I took out the plug andcleaned it all, but it just never worked again, so I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't filter well","review":"It's not noisy, it looks nice, and it doesn't splash. However, it doesn't do its main job well. The filter is just too weak. My dogs come in with dirt from our backyard and the dirt just got sucked down to the bottom of the bowl, but not sucked back into the filter. For me, it's better to just change their water a couple times a day in a regular dish rather than keep this system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"We have used this for more than a year for two cats and it is an excellent product. Cats love it. Humans put up with the cleaning and changing of filters because it's one less thing for the cats to complain about and cause problems elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor practically inaccessible, AVOID if you have any arthritis or human hands","review":"The fountain worked okay for a little over a year, it did get noisy over time but nothing too excessive. My biggest problem with this thing is that the motor is ridiculously difficult to remove for cleaning. It is a black boxy chunk that is wedged in the bottom, surrounded by plastic that you have to try not to break while prying out the motor. I cleaned the beast this morning, discovered it was happily leaking all over the floor, and now I cannot remove the stupid motor to even TRY reseating it. I am going to look for a ceramic fountain, I am sick of fighting this piece of junk every week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to use, but noisy","review":"This product works well and as advertised, and my cat likes it OK - but it's so noisy that I have decided to return it.Easy to set up. Easy to fill and operate - just plug it in after installing the filter and filling with water. Well designed (except for the noisy pump/motor).But it makes a constant, rattling buzzing sound which can be heard throughout the living area of my apartment. I thought a part might be loose on it, or it might have been cracked in shipment, but no. Then, I thought maybe I could get used to the noise. No good, so its going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a larger filter","review":"I've got the big dog version and even if you turn the flow down, it very nearly overflows a new clean filter. Get a little grime on it, and it just runs over the top, not filtering anything. They need to put a better pump on it and use a screw in filter that can't just be bypassed by over flow. If the existing filter was twice a big, allowing more flow, it would help. I can't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"started leaking within a month","review":"The unit started leaking water where the pump connects to the bowl about a month after I bought it. I removed the pump (as per the instruction manual), cleaned the unit while looking for anything that could have caused a leak, reassembled and refilled the unit, and within an hour I had a puddle of water under the motor again. I had to disconnect the unit and stop using it. I hope I can find my Amazon receipt to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets a small crack in the collar where the motor attaches ..","review":"I have aDrinkwell The Original Pet Fountain and HAve had the base fail 2 times in two years.It gets a small crack in the collar where the motor attaches ..I have not been taking the motor off for cleaning.. after the first one failedI think there must be problem with this product ???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinwell Fountain","review":"Fountain works great.

Totally incorrect....the motor was so loud I could hear it in our guest bedroom with the door shut and the TV on. Plus, if you don't pay attention to how much water you put in, it will overflow in the back. So I returned it for the Pioneer Pet Stainless Steel Fountain Raindrop Design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The fountain leaked and was extremely noisy.

Amazon provided the return postage which was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm buying another one","review":"I've had one of these pet fountains for about 2 years and the motor finally died. I have the extra reservoir. We have 3 cats who are all on special food to prevent urine crystals. It's also a diuretic.3 days post motor dying I notice the lack of urine in the litter box, this means they are not drinking the water not moving in the bowl. I'm not thrilled with the design, it is hard to keep clean. We have calcium build up, I use bleach 2x a month to sanitize the fountain. Buying another unit means I can have one clean on stand by to swap out.BUT! My cats drink more water with the fountain. I have to maintain it, but for me this means less vet bills and my furr babies health. This to me means more than the maintenance which is still less than a bowl of non-running water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinkwell Cat Fountain","review":"In my experience this is a very good drinking fountain for cats. The cat I was taking care of simply could not \\"see\\" a standing bowel of water. There had to be movement, i.e. water falling out of a faucet. Other pet drinking fountains produce a trickle with very little movement so the cat would not drink from them. The Drinkwell Fountain produces a nice stream of falling water (that you can vary) and on the whole it works; the cat will drink from the fountain (usually!).I recommend buying the extra capacity tank.Unfortunately I cannot visit this cat more than once a week and the fountain, over time, was not properly maintained by the cat's owner. Clogging and finally motor burnout occurred. But I am buying a new one - it is not terribly expensive, and this cat needs to keep hydrated. If you take care of the fountain as instructed and do not neglect it it should, however, last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat loves it","review":"I was tired of my cat bugging me to turn the water on in the tub, so purchased the Drinkwell Fountain and she seems to have forgotten about the faucet!Noise is low and I just clean and replace the water once a week"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This fountain is a maintenance nightmare. Within two or three days it has to be cleaned. The device cannot be trusted as it leaks profusely. Even on the lowest setting it will eventually leak water all over the floor. Placing it in a shallow square pan of suitable size helps a little, but be prepared to clean up a water mess anytime you use it. I would not recommend it for in-house use. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy for us","review":"We ordered this to make sure our cats stayed hydrated, They weren't particularly interested in it, but I don't blame the product for that. Our cat are weird. What was a problem was a noisy pump. It was somewhere between a hum and a low buzz, louder than most aquariums I've been around. Too much for 24 hour operation. It's also unnecessarily complex with quite a few parts, and though I didn't use it long enough to have to clean it, it looked like a chore. Removing and cleaning the pump regularly was recommended in the manual. Our waterer gets cleaned every couple days, and it only takes a couple minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleaning Issues","review":"The unit is difficult to fully clean, the filter is only notionally located in the path of the water, and after only a day or two it will start to grow some kind of slime that if was in my fish tank I would buy a water fiber to fix... oh wait, this was supposed to be the water filter. I had to get rid of it after only a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cats love it!","review":"I bought this because my cats are both male and I've heard they can develop urinary problems if they don't drink enough water. Well, they're definitely drinking more now that I have the Drinkwell! They love it! The waterfall fascinates them and one of my kitties keeps sticking his paw under it. The only reason I'm giving them four stars instead of five is the placement of the dial that controls the water flow. It's in the \\"dish\\" part of the bowl . . . Well, one of my enterprising kitty boys has discovered it and keeps moving the dial to the highest setting. It seems to me they could have made it a little less cat accessible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Pet Mate instead","review":"Drinkwell Original Fountain...I got this because I thought my cats would like the \\"waterfall\\" aspect since they both love to drink from the tap.The pump in this thing is noisy as heck (and I had it filled to the brim with water), feels very cheaply made, and is a real pain to clean.For the money the Pet Mate fountain is a much, much better value. The Pet Mate is ultra quiet, easy to clean and is constructed much better.I would not recommend this to anyone I liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kittie Loves It !","review":"Bought this for my son's 8 month old kitten...My two 12 year old furry girls had their own and when he came over to visit he just couldn't get enough.

The fountain and attachment is money well spent......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat loved it, but I didn't","review":"My cats, one in particular, loved this fountain. However, it began to leak where the pump goes in, and I was unable to make it stop. There is a gasket, and there is nothing wrong with it. Neither I, nor anyone I know, could figure out why it was leaking. I took it apart and reassembled it repeatedly, without success. I purchased a Pioneer Pet Ceramic Drinking Fountain to replace it. When I tried to disassemble the Drinkwell for the last time, the pump will NOT come out. I've asked every strong person I know, and nobody can get it out.I clean the water dish often, and the Drinkwell has many parts to contend with. The worst of all was the pump ... it was very difficult to get out for cleaning.My kitty may miss this, but I won't! She's decided to accept the new fountain now, so all is well."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOISY!","review":"We just got this today hoping it would help our male cat drink more due to a recent urinary issue (we switched his food 8 months ago to cans of Wellness, Core, Weruva, and Tiki Cat). He really doesn't drink much from what we've noticed. The vet suggested this unit, and also gave us Science Diet food which is over-priced garbage. So, we put the fountain together real quick and easy, filled it to the top with distilled water, plugged it in, and it sounds like an electric can opener. We can hear it in the other room! We tried putting it on carpet vs the wood floor but it is still noisy. The cat won't go near it. We tried to figure out a way to cushion the motor from rattling against the plastic, but that didn't work. We are so disappointed because this is a great design and so many people have written good reviews. Maybe we just got a \\"lemon\\".

The fact that you can adjust the stream is perfect for timid cats! You can create a smaller, slower stream allowing a smaller cat to feel comfortable drinking from it.

Great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive junk","review":"My Walmart generic pet fountain burned out after a year, so I thought I'd upgrade to this more expensive model bought at Petco. More expensive must be better, right? After reading that the fountain, including the motor, is supposed to be disassembled and cleaned weekly I was hesitant. And the plastic fountain didn't seem any different or better built than the cheaper fountain. After the first cleaning, the Drinkwell leaked and was un-usable. I'll just buy a cheaper but more reliable version from Walmart, and the Drinkwell will go in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"I have owned a Drinkwell Platinum for years and it has been trouble free.

I turned up the TV volume so I could hear over the racket.2. Then I found that it LEAKS--A LOT. No wonder the instructions say to monitor it for the first 12 hours. The manufacturer's FAQ at [...] says to check the pump's o-ring--it's fine. Then try putting Vaseline around the o-ring. No help. Apparently the plastic housing does not mate tightly with the pump.The housing was manufactured in April 2012 and the brand of motor is Resun. Maybe this was one of a bad batch, but I would not take a chance on ordering another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pets Love It","review":"I purchased this one with the extended spout because I liked the flow better than the one I previously owned.

Much too loud and I will put it in a far away corner and see if that helps. If not, I will go back to Walmart and get their $16 fountain. Mr. Katz doesn't even go near it. It is probably frightening him with all that noise. Fountain works except for the noise. There must be a way to get a quieter motor. The $16 one from Walmart which doesn't last too long at least is quiet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinkwell Original","review":"The Drinkwell works fine as expected. Easy to clean and maintain and the replacement filters are affordable. My kitten took to it immediately even though she never used a fountain before.

Not perfect but a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice fountain, but a little loud","review":"Very pleased with this product. Very easy to use, it works well, my cats seem to like it.

By that I mean she would only drink out of the faucet from the sink. Drinkwell has saved my life! Now my kitty isn't thirsty all day waiting for me to come home from work to turn on the bathroom faucet. It took her a while to \\"warm up\\" to the idea of drinking out of the dish, but now it is not a problem. Cleaning is not too bad either. It takes maybe 5-7 minutes at the most and is well worth the time. The cleaning brush makes it a lot easier to clean. I tried 2 other less expensive fountains before I got to this one, and my cat wouldn't drink out of either one. You won't regret spending a little bit more for this one, it is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet Fountain","review":"The cat loves this.

This fountain is great for all. My old cat loves the fact that the water is in motion and drinks right from the waterfall. It's very easy to clean, the first time you do it you have to read the directions to make sure you know how it all fits together. You should at least clean it good once a week, be sure to get the hair out that's stuck on the knob and clean with soap. The filters are easy to put in, but they're not really necessary if you keep the water fresh. Overall, it was a great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"noisy and leaks","review":"well the first one i got leaked all over my kitchen floor. then i gave it to these people i don't like who have six cats, and it leaked all over their floor. the vendor sent me a new one that doesn't leak, but its louder than any of my aquariums. on the positive side, my cat loves it and drinks from it all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy Noisy Noisy!!","review":"I read all these reviews and couldn't believe this fountain was actually as noisy as everyone said it was. But it's WORSE! Right out of the box the little motor was loud, so loud we couldn't hear the water falling from it. We finally had to put a beach towel under and around it to muffle the noise before the cats would get near it. And it is REALLY loud weekly, begging to be cleaned, even when there's no cat hair in the motor. I spend a lot of time tending to this fountain and the 3 cats would still prefer to drink out of my water glass than drink out of this (but they grudgingly do!). I'm getting a CatIt Fountain on Monday and I hope it's better than this one! I think the extra money for the CatIt may be worth it.-----------------------Update: My cats like the CatIt much more.

My only suggestion is that you NEVER let the water level get too low. That is how you burn out the motor and it gets really loud when that happens. It is a very good fountain and my cats LOVE it!

It's pretty simple after the first time. I was glad I chose to purchase the cleaning kit as well as the brushes help get into the tight spots that are hard to clean.

I wanted to let everyone know!As with everything, if it is made of quality and you take care of it,it will last. I have the add on features; the reservoir and stand. Like it say's in the manual you must keep water in the reservoir to ensure that the motor will not burn it self out. I have two cats and the water in the reservoir will run out in about 4-5 day's. If the water runs low you will start to hear the motor running to remind you to add more. My cats love the running water and will drink right from the flowing stream. Cleaning is easy except on one side (inside) where it is very narrow but what I do is wrap a paper towel around a spoon or something narrow to get any build up out.I highly recommend this product and I know my kitties do too!! We look forward to many more years of fresh running water in our home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cats didn't like it.","review":"This was recommended to help my aging cat drink more easily and not use his paws to scoop up water. The theory suggested was that he needed a cleaner, moving water source which would help him lap the usual way. Nope. Didn't help. In fact, he still uses his paws and now creates huge puddles. Plus, the mechanism clogs often. A plain old ceramic bowl is much more easy (and cheaper) to maintain than this! I wouldn't recommend this product to any of my cat friends. Wish I hadn't sunk the money into this totally unnecessary item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Kitties all love this, all 6 of them !!","review":"this is great with the refil bottle, no more daily filling of the water, I clean weekly with the tools bought for the purpose and it is a time saver. No more having to worry about the level of the water, or burning out the motor if I forget to fill. the base is wide enough so even our biggest kitty can drink without discomfort and he loves drinking out of the fountain. Absolutely no sound from the motor and the gentle water sound is very soothing.

I bought the fountain because they seemed to want to drink out of the faucet in my sink and I took that to mean that they were thirsty for running water. As we know, cats are finnicky, and mine just went back to drinking from the old water dispenser despite the fact that the fountain is right next to it. I don't know if they're uncertain what to make of it, or if they're just trying to annoy me. :) At any rate, it works well, isn't too noisy (imagine a fountain) and certainly seems to keep the water fresh. I bought the reservoir, too, since it seemed to run low on water every 3 days or so without it. Good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money.","review":"I love this product.

This appears to be a design weakness, the pump/motor connects below the water line, so there is always a chance of leakage there.The Petmate fountains, which have their own problems (namely the pump clogging and having to be cleaned all the time, and having to be replaces once a year), at least use a submersible pump so there can be no leak where the pump connects to the bowl.Also, the top lid doesn't snap into place, it just sits there, or doesn't sit there when your cat decides to play with it.The reservoir attachment seems to work OK and not leak... but since the motor/pump leaks, you will still wind up with a puddle of water on the floor.I returned it to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat still likes the water in the sink!

My main issue with the drinkwell is that it is very difficult to thoroughly clean the inside of the tower. The new raindrop fountain, is almost entirely clean when it comes out of the dishwasher, the only parts not dishwasher friendly being the little motor and the filter. The drinkwell, on the other hand, has a well where the filter sits that is very difficult to scrub out (and needs it regularly, or the cat won't touch it). Additionally, removing the motor from the drinkwell is painful. It needs to be rotated against the base, and it's impossible to do this without using some sort of lever (for me, a screwdriver, which also cracked the plastic).It is a fountain, and the cat will use it, but only if you commit to a lot of cleaning.

Our vet told us about this fountain and ever since we got it, it has been his favorite place in the house. He likes to drink from it, wash his face in it, and even curl up and sleep around the fountain.Note that you should make sure you clean it every 2 weeks as the manual says. Also, I find the attachment water tank well worth it as we only need to refill it every 4 days or so and don't need to worry about the cats going thirsty in the mean time.Pros:One very happy cat.Nice background noise.Cons:He gets upset when we turn it off to clean it and watches us like a hawk until it is back on. Cleaning usually takes me about 10 minutes with soap and hot water in the sink and there are some small surfaces to clean. Make sure you get the impeller out of the motor and the intake screen clear of cat hair. It tends to build up there.A great buy.

It's also not the calming white noise of- say- a window AC unit. There's no way I would sleep with this running in the same room. My cats will drink from it, but only when it's off.

Right when I plugged it in, my cats went up and played with the flowing water. They seem to like it. However, it was just really really loud. I don't mind the water splashing sound. In fact, I rather enjoy it. It's like the sound of nature. It's the motor that causes a loud rattling sound.Anyways, I'm still looking for a fountain with a quieter motor but a free flowing water fountain instead of a water flowing on a slide as with my current Petmate fountain.

But we thought it was just to be a backup).The new fountain's plastic seems thinner than on our older version.Have decided to try the stainless steel Drinkwell 360 instead and hope to have better luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"It makes A LOT of noise","review":"It works but makes a lot of noise.

She loves to drink from thebathroom sink and tub. I needed some way to give her what she likes, running water, while keeping her out of my bathroom.This fountain has been a life saver. She loves it. She gets running, filtered water all day long.The only thing I wish it did was also keep the water cool. But I guess I could have upgraded for that option.Well worth the money though."},{"rating":"2","title":"DRINKWELL PET FOUNTAIN","review":"I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT TO REPLACE A LESS EXPENSIVE \\" BUBBLY\\" TYPE. FIRST OFF, LET ME WARN EVERYONE, THAT BEFORE USING, YOU MUST RINSE THE WHOLE THING WITH CLEAN TAP WATER, THEN FILL IT UP AS PER THE INSTRUCTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO LET IT GO DRY!) AND LET IT RUN FOR ABOUT 10-15 MINUTES. THEN DUMP IT INTO THE SINK, REFILL WITH TAP WATER AGAIN, AND LET IT RUN FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. I DO NOT USE THE CHARCOAL FILTER UNTIL THE WHOLE THING HAS BEEN CLEANED, AND PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY SOAP PRODUCT AS IT WILL BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLETELY CLEAN!NOW, DUMP IT INTO THE SINK ONCE MORE, AND REFILL WITH CLEAN TAP WATER,{ ALTHOUGH I PERSONALLY USE WATER FROM MY BRITA FILTER PITCHER}. NOW PLACE THE FILTER IN THE HOUSING, I HAVE IT PLACED ON A PET MAT THAT IS DESIGNED FOR THIS. ADJUST THE FLOW WITH THE SLIDER, AND WATCH THE CATS GO WILD! IT IS SO VERY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE AS MUCH CLEAN FRESH WATER FOR CATS, ESP. IF THEY ARE OLDER TO HELP KEEP KIDNEY FUNCTIONS WELL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plugs up","review":"We religiously cleaned this every two weeks, taking it apart, scrubbing, cleaning the filter as recommended ... but it still plugged up inside the control \\"valve\\". Tried to clear it out with brushes and pins to no avail. Finally pried off the control for the flow and got the gunk out, but that broke the control making it useless, so now it always runs at full speed. They need to provide a way to clean this part (like making it removable) before I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pain to clean but worth it","review":"This thing is a pain to clean as it requires disassembling of several parts, in addition to the directions not discussing proper filter placement at all. The \\"manual\\" included with this item is kind of pathetic.The water reservoir evaporates more quickly than they let on. Even with low temperature and high humidity in my apartment, I need to add water in between weekly cleanings. This can be a pain when I'm alerted in the middle of the night of its low level by the terrible noise the motor makes.However, this is the only water fountain that's gotten my cats to drink out of something besides the sink faucet, and for that I assign the majority of my points. I'd give fractional points (7/10) if Amazon allowed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok overall","review":"I got this to replace a Cat Mate fountain that didn't have the waterfall. The first one I got had a crack in the plastic so it leaked, but I was able to exchange it with no problems. The second one seems to work fine, but the motor is a little louder than the Cat Mate one."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy w/ this fountain","review":"Went to pick up a different brand of fountain at another store and they were all sold out. I'm actually glad now because I'm really happy with this pet fountain for my cat. Very good product for the price. It is not loud at all, just a little hum of the motor. It does start to sputter if the water level gets too low, but that's pretty standard for any water/pump mechanism. I've had this for a month now and have attempted to clean it twice... and there's been nothing to clean! I was worried after reading the reviews that this would be a problem. There are a lot of pieces and crevices, but it's not been too difficult so far. My cat was drinking from it on day one. He has had some issues with his kidneys, so I'm hoping this encourages him to drink more water. Very happy with my choice of this fountain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to clean","review":"My cat and I loved this fountain until I needed to clean it. I found it impossible to pry the electric component from its housing. Even my husband could hardly get it loose. So buy this fountain only if you can clean it without completely cleaning it by removing the motor. You could, for example, just wash out the fountain part, run vinegar through it occasionally to clean out the interior, and replace the filter as needed. But if so, your fountain won't last long. Ours finally stopped running, and I threw it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fountain is better","review":"I purchased this bowl for my second floor.I have always found my cats to be drinking more water from the shower than the bowl. My vet recommened purchasing a fountain because cats like to have the water aerated. It has certainly made a difference. I find my cats are drinking more water. There were slightly timid at first, but eventually warmed up to it. In summer, I fill the bowl with ice and little water (for the pump)to keep it cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great!!!!","review":"I've bought 3 of these things in two years. They do not last long at all the pump quits on me. I have never figured out how to get the pump out to service it or clean it. I kept water in it to. I got fed up with paying over $45 for junk that last maybe 6-8 months. My cats love these machices so I had to look around the market to see if I could get one something this one only better.I found the fresh flow pet mate for $19 and was able to buy 2 one for up stairs and down. They appear to me to be better constructed I can get to the pump, and they have a water bottle attached for convience. What I like about it is it is quiet its spout trickles down a slope instead of running out like a faucet and hitting a hump like the drinkwell. I think the cats preferred the drinkwell, but it just did not last. Now will the petmate hold up?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money-glorified water dish","review":"This product was terrible. I got it because my puppy loves to drink from running water, but the water doesn't really run. it kinda just trickles out :-(This thing is pretty flimsy, makes A LOT of noise, and sometime takes too long for the water to start running. It would also be a lot better is it was battery operated, instead of having to plug in.I just really wish I shopped around a little more before trying this. After 2 weeks, it's in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only the finicky cats!!!","review":"Got this for our spoiled cat. But she loves it. Its quiet except when its low then it lets you know.

My cat was a little hesitant because of the loud motor, but then she saw the water fountain and tried it. After a fee minutes of her playing with it, it started to gurgle and sputter, which was extremely loud. She was curious, but because of the noise, she wouldn't use it. I tried everything to stop the noise, but as soon as she would interrupt the flow, it would start again. Also, we used the charcoal filter and even after letting it run all night before giving it to her, it had lots of charcoal dust in the basin. Returned this for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"I had to return this item, the vibration level is very audible. I tried shifting every position and putting things at the bottom to cushion but it was still annoyingly audible. I guess it will be good if it was placed in the kitchen to mask the noise with the other household noises. Whenever I turn it on, the vibration noise would make the cat run away and avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kitties love this and it's so good for their kidney health","review":"Cats have fragile kidneys and they often do not drink enough water to support their kidney health. We're so happy with our Drinkwell fountain because the cats are actually attracted to drink from it. One likes to drop his toys in it, but that's another story. It's such an easy, quiet and well-designed unit - and it feels good to know that we're improving the lives and health of our kitties. It does need to be taken apart every other week and cleaned out but this is not a difficult task at all. I bought a second unit for my mom and her kitty, and I plan to buy fountains for my daughter and my mother-in-law too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great -- for a few months","review":"The cat loves this device while it's working. But, it needs to be replaced every few months. No matter how meticulous you are about careful cleaning and making sure it doesn't run dry, this fragile contraption is the poster child for planned obsolescence. It simply does not last for very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent product!","review":"I got my first one of these 7 years ago for my two cats. After running continuously for 7 years, the motor finally burned out. I'm going to order another one since my cats like it so much. (By the way, the price has come down considerably... I paid $80 for mine in 1999!) It works well, but as other people have stated, it does require some regular cleaning (maybe every few weeks we dump it out and wash it thoroughly). If you check the water level every day and just top it off, it runs beautifully. Definitely worth it to keep the kitties happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more running faucets","review":"My cat Maynard would REFUSE to drink any water other than from a running water faucet. Considering the fact that I was not always available to turn on the water whenever he wished, I was worried he wasn't drinking enough. This water fountain works like a charm! He's drinking water all the time, and never once has asked to re-visit the sink. My other cat, Elmo, doesn't use it, however. I have also not encountered any problems with fur clogging the filter. And Maynard's pretty hairy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, just noisy","review":"Love the product, have had it for about 2 months and it works great with no problems and both my cats love it. The only downfall is the noise from the filter and if the water gets about halfway down in the dish it makes a super loud sucky noise as the fountain tries to suck it back it to circulate it. I just make sure to keep filling it every morning so it's always up high and it's fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"Cats liked it, it was quiet, splash was minimal.

This is my second Drinkwell. The first one lasted for about 4 years. I also have the extra water holder for the back. This new one however doesn't work properly. After only a couple of months now it doesn't want to regulate the flow. Therefore I can't leave the water bottle on the back. I miss having that there and now I have to add water to it daily. Whatever makes my cat happy. Not sure if I'll try the same brand again but I've heard of problems with Petmate too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pros and Cons","review":"The pros are that if your cat likes to drink from a faucet then your he will go crazy for the Drinkwell Fountain. It is also healthier for the cat because the water falling into the bowl helps to keep the water oxiginated.The cons are that if your cat doesn't like to drink out of the faucet then they may not like the splashing water. Yes, you can adjust the flow but even with it on low my cat was getting splashed in the face when he tried to drink from the bowl. My other cat simply refused to go near it. Also the instructions claim that due to the filter and the circulating water you would only have to clean it once a week. I found this to not be the case. Even with emptying the water and putting in fresh water every day the bowl was getting slimy after only 3 days and had to be scrubbed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knuckle buster and impossible to clean with out a dishwasher","review":"I've had our drinkwell for about 6 years now. The cats love it, the dog loves it. But boy is it a b*tch to clean!!! I wish they'd redesign the dam* thing.Attention Drinkwell Engineers1. Take out ALL the right angles AND THE CRANNIES. Design it so it is actually possible to clean with your silly bottle brushes.2. Make it easier to pull out the stupid pump with out causing injury to one's knuckles and fingers. Hint, cut away the back of the fountain where the pump is so you can actually get a grip on it to twist it out.That said, when it's time to wash it, I put everything (except the pump) in the dishwasher and run it on sanitize. It comes out slime free! While it's washing, I nurse my banged-up knuckles with some neosporin, bandaids and an ice cold beer and we're good to go for another 3 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain","review":"Great fountain.

The motor is in very close quarters and it is very difficult to get a finger in the groove to rotate the motor and remove it. I had to resort to using a small tool and that was a fatal mistake...The plastic bowl is not that rigid and I cracked the unit near the motor mount. That rendered the unit unrepairable and useless...so, if you have anything but tiny fingers...forget it! I replaced this unit with The Cat Mate brand and I recommend that model over this Drinkwell model because it is easier to disassemble/assemble and it runs with much less noise..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy motor","review":"This is a great idea, but it leaked from the beginning.

My cat is old, has kidney and constipation problems, and I just can't get him to drink enough. I spent a good week looking at all my fountain choices and reading reviews. I settled on this one cuz I liked the set up with the large bowl and the waterfall effect. Plus it had a 4 stars. Got it, set it up, within 5 min a HUGE puddle of water was around it. Tried to fix it, wouldn't fix. It was leaking from where the motor connected to the bowl on the bottom. I thought maybe I just got a bad one so I sent it in for a replacement. That one showed up last week. Set it up again....same problem. Needless to say, I'm done with this brand. I sent it back as well and now I'm looking for a different one to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy for me, but cat liked it","review":"My cat loved this and had no problems drinking out of it.

I couldn't stand the noise and so got a different water dish for the cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad News Here","review":"I purchased this original pet fountain along with the Drinkwell Reservoir, 50 Ounce. They arrived pretty quickly however when I set it up and put water in it, the fountain leaked all over my floor. There was a warning this may happen so it has happened a lot! When I called customer service as instructed with the warning, they asked me if I got the original or deluxe model.When I said original they sounded like Uhm yeah and told me to put oil on the O ring. I did but it still leaked. I had to fax them my proof of purchase and they said I should receive a new O ring with in 6 weeks. This makes me a pretty Unhappy customer. This one has a design flaw the pump screws into the bowl and if the seal is not just so it leaks. DON'T get this one! If I were to do it again and knew about the O ring and the deluxe model I would not have bought this. I feel stuck!

Rechecked written instructions; followed recommended cleaning/reassembly instructions; still no change. So I got disgusted, and instead went to PetSmart, where I purchased a Catit Fresh&Clear #50053 Drinking Fountain. What a difference! - - just a whisper of a sound, as it's running, and my cat is not fearful of this item, as he was of the Drinkwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but be sure that you service it every so often!","review":"This is a great, durable fountain. We bought ours back in 2008 for our 3 cats and it's still going strong, almost 5 years later! Just be sure that you are able to clean it every couple or few weeks. It requires taking it apart and just cleaning out the mechanisms- maybe about 15 minutes of work at the most. Be sure to watch the water levels as well, otherwise it will make a noise if it drops below a certain level. With 3 cats who love to drink, we usually wind up filling it up with water every morning.If anyone is unsure whether their cat will use it, I assure you they will. Two of our cats were not afraid of it and drank out of it immediately. The third cat is a very timid cat, and it took a few days for her to finally have the courage to go near it. Now she loves it, and sometimes dips her paw into the bowl and scoops the water up that way into her mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moter burned out in 9 months.","review":"I purchased this fountain because my cat has an obsession with drinking running water out of the tap. After 9 months of use, the motor has stopped working.Pros:It distracted my cat from bugging me every time I turned a faucet on.Cons:The motor was loud and made a large slurping noise if the water was low.It grew bacteria faster than a normal bowl.It was difficult to clean.After a while, the bowl and spout became stained an orange color, probably from bacteria.The bacteria growth and staining were probably my fault because I wasn't OCD about cleaning it (about once a week), but I never had this problem with conventional bowls. I won't buy another one and cannot recommend because the motor stopped working not even a year after I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks!","review":"When we filled the fountain with water, it started to leak immediately, from some area under the unit.

It looks nice and is a good size for two or three cats. We followed the directions for basic assembly and first time use. For the first two days, it worked as expected with a nice stream of water for our cats and little or no problems or noise. By day three however, we had to turn the fountain off due to excessive noise. We kept plenty of water in the reservoir to cover the inlet and kept the fountain clean and free of debris. Once it starts making noise, we can turn it off for several hours, then we can turn it back on and it will be quiet for an hour or two before it starts to make excessive noise again. We have a small fish tank with a similar size water pump that has run quietly for YEARS. I'm surprised this product can't run for more than a few days before it starts making so much noise we can't hear the TV over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken","review":"Evidently a design problem (per other reviews).

My cats loved it until it broke just out of warranty.But, as others have noted, it has one annoying design flaw and one fatal design flaw.The annoying one is that there are too many nooks and crannies for a device that is designed to hold water all the time. You get mold buildup in some of the corners and the upper reservoir that pours the water out at the top is much deeper than it needs to be. You need a bristle brush to clean it effectively and even a toothpick in some places.The fatal flaw is that the motor fits much too tightly. You're supposed to take the motor out at every cleaning (and you must if you're going to put the body through the dishwasher), but there is very little room to get your fingers around the motor to pry it out. Getting out the motor just plain hurts. Eventually, the stress of twisting the motor in and out cracks the plastic around the mount on the base and the unit starts leaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, silent, cats like it.","review":"I got this fountain because one of my young kittens liked to climb into my bathroom sink and drink from the faucet. While now my much more ancient cat seems to use it more, I see the younger cats use it as well. The machine is practically silent when filled with water, and when the fluid runs low, you can hear the pump start to pull air, which gives you good feedback as to when to refill.Overall, a useful product that the cats enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if it didn't leak","review":"After just a couple of months use, my Drinkwell fountain developed a leak and became unuseable. It was leaking from the part where the motor is inserted into the base - the rubber ring meant to seal the connection was not sufficient. The leak was really significant; within 30 minutes there would be a big puddle on the floor. I would try reinserting the motor repeatedly to create a tighter seal, but I've given up. I don't want to deal with it every time I have to disassemble the fountain for cleaning. If not for this problem, I do like the fountain and my cat was a big fan. I wish they would fix the design so that the motor is contained in a closed section of the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats love it.","review":"Love the idea of my cats having fresh filtered water everyday.

It is now completely useless. Otherwise it worked well, which is why I gave this product two stars instead of one. Definitely not buying this fountain again.

I took it apart, cleaned the rubber \\"O\\" ring again, reassembled, it still leaked. Went to the hardware store, bought a new O ring, still leaked. I guess I'll be heading off to the store to buy a new fountain and I'm pretty sure it wont be another Drinkwell. (I never did like the idea of that pump being on the outside of the unit.)

I thought at first maybe i had just received a faulty one and amazon was great about shipping me a new one right away when i complained about it. But the second one i received also leaked. It eventually \\"clogged\\" the hole from where it was leaking and stopped. But now after two months its leaking bad again and its too late for me to be able to send it back.

This one has too many cons for it's cost ($50.00 at Petco), so I will be returning mine. Besides being overpriced here are other cons: it's too loud, which freaks out skittish cats. It requires a filter, which costs more money. It doesn't hold enough water (extra water reservoir sold separately, more $$ down the drain). It's not easy to clean and you'll end up cleaning it more often than the pamphlet says you'll need to. The flow adjuster is too cheaply made to be useful and it'll break easily.

It leaked water and rather quickly. Within 4 hours, I had to empty the tray (IKEA plastic one) because it had filled with water. I just did the same thing again a few hours later and then unplugged it. It's a shame, because my cat does like to drink from it, but it helps if it keeps the water IN the fountain and not outside of it. Bummer.For those who complained about the noise, if there isn't enough water, it does make a grinding noise. Otherwise, the gurgling water is a nice sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prefer this over catmate","review":"So far so good.

The catmate's water flows down a little chute whereas the flow created by Drinkwell actually pours out and into the base and seems more like a the stream created from a sink valve that my cat likes. I'll be interested to see how it holds up and whether there will be similar pump issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 4 months","review":"Purchased this for our 8 pound dog. Also purchased extra filters and a cleaning kit.The uint was kept full of water, cleaned twice a week and filters were changed reqularly.It always made noise from day one and finally died after only four months of use.Very disapointed with this product.It is a great idea, but the engineering and manufacture level is a joke.Save the hassel and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome product","review":"Found this at the pet store near our area but thought paying 50 bucks was just little too much so i found it on here for 27 with no shipping and for couple bucks more replacement filters.

Cats loved it but the plastic is so thin it cracked around the motor hole within a month. Directions specifically say to remove the motor and clean it regularly. However, removing the motor wasn't easy for me and the opening cracked the second time I did it. There is a warning that this might happen if you don't turn the motor 90 degrees before removing. I thought I was doing it right but I guess not. The crack seemed small but it was big enough to leak. As I am not handy, attempts to fix it failed and I ended up throwing it away. I should of just not bothered taking the motor out to clean it but I wanted to follow the instructions. Very disappointed, especially since following the directions is how i broke it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last..","review":"This was a great waterer for the time it lasted (which was about 3 months).

Cleaned it every 3-4 days.. and then one day.. nothing. I won't try it again!! $40 down the tubes.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works really well, could be quieter","review":"I bought another pet fountain first, and if I had it to do over again I would buy two drinkwells instead of the other brand, because my cats like the stream of water better than the moving but not streaming teardrop shape of the other brand. My unit of this definitely buzzes and it's not particularly visually attractive, but it gets my cats drinking more water, and that's what I need it for most. My sink fiend has chilled out a lot and doesn't constantly try to get a drink from the faucet.In short, it is really good at it's job, while I wish it were quieter it's not much worse than a fish tank filter motor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Product","review":"I bought this for my little kitty friend. He likes it okay, although he was afraid at first. It makes minimal noises, and I have had little problems with splashing. One drawback is that the charcoal filter leaves black residue in the fountain after being inside for a while. I belive I have installed it correctly but there are NO instructions that tell you exactly how to insert the filter, so actually...who knows. Other than that I am happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked all over and burned motor","review":"We received this a couple days before going on an extended vacation (even paid extra to have it shipped 2nd day so we would receive it on time). We also bought the extra reservoir. We set it up immediately after we received it, let it run overnight, and in the morning found it had leaked all over the floor and there was a smell as if the motor was burning. We had no time to do anything about it prior to our vacation, so we unplugged it and put it away. Unfortunately, because we were on vacation, we also missed our window to return it.

No labels on parts diagrams, but it is expected that one knows the names of them. Many parts not shown in diagram.When I finally got it together, it leaked all over the place. I put it back in the box and returned it requesting a replacement. A couple of weeks later, still nothing.At the time I ordered this fountain, I also ordered extra filters to make the order large enough to qualify for free shipping. I sent the extra filters back at the same time I sent the leaky fountain back, and I immediately received a new package of filters along with an email saying \\"your order is complete\\". The filters are, obviously, useless without a working fountain. Now what about paying for shipping to replace them?A very unsatisfactory experience (so far)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product as Described","review":"This product is exactly as describted.

He was constantly dehydrated and it was nearly impossible to get him to drink enough water. Clean fresh water wasnt enough, he would only drink running water. So i got the Drinkwell pet fountain and he loves it!! He likes to watch the water run and drink out of it and play in it. The motor is a little louder than I would like, but all three of my cats think it is fantastic. My 15 year old cat loves to sit by it and watch the running water. Its a great way to get cats to drink more water if they like the running water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvements","review":"Our cats love drinking from the pouring water, and the small amount of noise is tolerable, but the amount of cleaning required I consider cumbersome -- a thorough cleaning every second or third day. There are too many small spaces, crevices, and corners in the water flow path. These areas stagnate flow and create areas for mold growth.I does the trick but simple design improvements could make it better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked!","review":"I bought this unit and it leaked, so I returned it and the next one leaked as well. Called customer service (very nice and helpful) and they said it was the \\"O\\" ring that interfaces between the motor and the plastic housing that was causing the leak.

She is four months old and cute as a button."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cats love it","review":"(This is a review done by Connie, our cat.)This is almost good enough for me. The humans who serve me bought two of these eight years ago (2 years in human years) and they make the water taste good most of the time. Sometimes the pump makes a funny noise and the humans have to put more water in it. Sometimes fur gets caught in the pump and has to get cleaned out. This is fur from my brother because I don't shed in my water. I'm classy. I like to drink from the stream that comes from the top.One time, one of the pumps stopped working and it was days before that fountain got fixed. I hated that. I had to share only one fountain with 5 brothers and sisters. That was bad.

Needed cleaning in October, so I bought this one. It leaked around the motor, badly. And yes, I tried to remove and reinstall the motor several times in an effort to stop the leak. No luck. So I threw it away and ordered another new one, which also leaked in the same spot. On that one, I tried to stop the leak with acquarium sealant, no luck. When this little fountain works, it's great.

If you have Cat's this is the item you want for your pets health!! end of story....Now, the other side, I dislike the filters and you don't have to use them, but it keeps the water cleaner and with that point you should be unplugging it and washing it out once a week and at least scrubbing it down twice a month to get any slime build up that starts. I would suggest a Pipe cleaner brush for the inside portion.It seems like a pain, but it's no worse then having to wash the water bowl every day and filling it with water and it for a good cause so just mark it down on the old calendar and watch your pet drink lots of water.Happy pet owning"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinkwell fountain","review":"My cats love to drink out of the faucet and this fountain makes a wonderful substitute with running water available all of the time.

Start here.","review":"You have probably heard of The Practice of the Presence of God, a book so popular that it has been continuously in print for the past 300 years. I suspect, however, that more people buy it than actually read it. This version has been edited into modern language, to make it easier to read, and has been paired with the letters of Frank Laubach, a missionary, writer, and friend of God, who died in 1970. The Laubach letters gripped my heart with a sense of hope, and the possibility that I too could have a relationship with God, where I was continually aware of His presence. Brother Lawrence's letters are powerful, but are also more difficult to hold on to, especially the sections about suffering. I expect that my understanding will increase as I re-read them in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely essential reading","review":"by practicing His presence, by trying to constantly connect/converse with God, laubach and brother lawrence discover what the christian life is all about- knowing God personally and resting in what we find. reading about their trek toward the heart of God led me to reexamine mine. after reading it, i was convinced that, like brother lawrence, i would be able to connect with God at least once a minute. unfortunately, i was amazingly far from my goal. yet, the more i practice, the closer i get. as i get closer, i know God better, and the happiness, peace, and effectiveness in my life and ministry that have resulted are amazing. in turn, i have learned that i don't know God nearly as well as i thought; and, if i simply spend more time with him in my thoughts, i will know him better and flourish because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Christians","review":"A wonderfully thought provoking book.

Unlike a how to book this book shows you that growing in the knowledge of God is a process that does not happen over night. I highly recomend this book.

The life he portrays is one of continual communion with God in that all our daily mundane works are intimately connected with Him. One interesting comment he makes, and which perhaps best serves as the central thesis of this book, is that he feels no less closer to God when he is busy doing his earthly chores than in his set time of devotions.

Jerry Miller's guitar playing continues to be excellent, but that's not enough to save this material. This reunion album started as a cassette-only issue and had a number of extra songs when it was released on CD. Interestingly, not a single song from the original album is compelling to me. The only songs on the album that are really worth hearing are the \\"extras\\" called \\"Getting' Used to Being Treated Wrong,\\" and \\"Forbidden Love,\\" both Don Stevenson songs. \\"All My Life,\\" the Skip Spence song is irritatingly repetitious. \\"On the Dime\\" by Jerry Miller is the only song in which they actually sound like Moby Grape.

Of course tossing it in a dryer fluffs the foam back up instantly but I don't typically bring a dryer with me when I camp, do you? I found a simple solution, just open the pillow up an hour or two before you go to bed. I cinched this thing down tight for the trip and was concerned when it didn't spring back into shape when I released it. However, I left it open while I setup camp and by the time I was ready to lay down the pillow had inflated to about 3 times its size. I was quite relieved that the pillow bounced back in a reasonable amount of time, saving me untold neck pain in the process.I'm completely satisfied with this pillow and would recommend it to anyone that wants a travel worthy companion that is easy to wash the nature out of it.

It stores in a small size and is faily light weight. I have both the small and the large one but will only buy the small ones in the future. The large is also good it is just too much pillow for me on a camping trip. Now if they made one that was about 3' x 1' I might get it for side sleeping but that is just a dream. This pillow may not be the best for ultralight backpacking since it does weigh a few ounces and does not compress like an inflatable pillow, but, for car camping or short backpacking trips it is great! I cannot reccomend them highly enough, even the large ones if you need the extra pillow.God bless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"The pillow lofts well and compresses easily. I love the self containing pack that it rolls into. Makes it easy to throw in with my camping gear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Simple","review":"I purchased this pillow to replace one I bought about 10 years ago and couldn't be happier with the product. While I loved my old one which finally just couldn't be mended anymore, this one is much improved. It rolls up nice and tight for packing, and it's not hard to do at all, which I know can be an issue with items meant for travel. I was concerned at first that after unrolling it that it would not be fluffy and pillow like, providing little support, but after a few minutes it expanded and fluffed right up. Currently I use it at home but I am about to travel to Africa for six months and have high hopes for this guy!I should mention that I got the red one and I have a small pillow case that fits it and the color does, or rather, did bleed onto the pillow case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, but not the pillow of my dreams","review":"I originally purchased this pillow for backpacking and it wasn't the only item I realized was too heavy and/or bulky on that first trip (but that's a whole 'nother story). It ended up being a bit too bulky for backpacking and not quite as big/comfortable as I would like for car camping so my use of it will probably be limited. Last time I did use it I dropped it in the dirt when packing up and it survived cleaning via a washer/dryer cycle so that's a plus. If you don't have enough room for a full size pillow but don't need to conserve every cubic inch this may be the pillow for you. For backpacking I went with the inflatable Thermarest pillow and couldn't be happier with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pillow!","review":"Pillow works exactly as described, reshapes shortly after decompression and is very comfortable and easy to roll back up and repack.

First of all the product arrived in the shipping box with no wrapping, who knows wheres its been dropped or dragged. Second, after unrolling it, it didnt fluff up at all.

However, the open celled foam that it contains became clumpy after a wash or two and wouldn't get soft again. It was still fine, until I found out about theNemo Fillo Luxury Pillow. This pillow has no stuffing at all. It has an inflatable air mattress that is covered by closed cell foam on the top. It has shock cords on the bottom to allow you to wad up your jacket and give it extra loft, although I found I didn't need it. There is simply no comparison. The Nemo pillow is much more comfortable, compacts to less than half the size of the Thermarest, and weighs roughly the same. I usually canoe-camp where weight and size aren't an issue, but if I were to go back packing, I'd figure out a way to bring the Nemo pillow. No more stiff-neck in the mornings!

I spent about 45min shopping and came back, the pillow never got better, the fill never expanded.The Thermarest packs into a long, skinny shape and once compressed, it has no give whatsoever. This pillow is so lumpy and pathetic that I can't see any advantage over just rolling up clothes.I bought an 18\\" Teton pillow for $10 and I'm quite satisfied. The Teton's fill doesn't get nearly as lumpy, it seems to stay squishy even when packed. I put the Teton in the bottom of my bag into one of the oddly-shaped voids left by my tightly-packed sleeping bag.BOTTOM LINE: You can do better than a Termarest for 1/2 the price - get a Teton."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"FFFLLLLUUUUUUFFFFFFFFYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!

Absolutely love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected","review":"After reading numerous reviews, wasn't quite sure what to expect. The reviews on Amazon are right on target. The pillows are very compact and surprisingly expand to twice their size once you allow time for them to expand. I have not washed them yet to see if washing them changes their appearance. Only complaint I have is that you can actually feel the chunks of foam in the pillow. Have not slept on it yet, but so far, seems like the cost was worth the purchase entirely due to the quality of the covering and compactness."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"I am quite happy with this pillow. As other reviews have said, once you wash it, it really puffs out. Its quite comfortable to sleep with, I got the medium size pillow and for me its just right.

Bottom line- I am very pleased with my purchase and it was well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this pillow","review":"While the color of this product (\\"Meadow Green\\") is really not as attractive in real life as it is displayed on Amazon, the pillow itself is fantastic. It rolls up small, puffs up big, and I used it instead of the provided pillows in several hotels on a trip through Guatemala, simply because it was more comfortable. It feels lumpy by hand, but soft when laying one's head on it, and is also good on airplanes and buses! I liked the small size, but would consider a larger size in the future if I were to be camping in one place for a long period of time.

Still, the lyrics are incredible, as always, even if the \\"pop\\" sound doesn't really fit. Best tracks--'Worthless Thing,' 'Love Field' and 'I Wanna Be Loved.' Steve Nieve makes a bigger impression on this album than any to date. His parts shine (especially on 'Love Field').This album will only be truly appreciated by the huge fans. I love it but, if just a casual listener, I suggest \\"Punch the Clock\\" or \\"Trust.\\" They're a little more accessable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A guilty pleasure or two","review":"It's commonly agreed that 'Goodbye' is not one of Costello's better efforts. I concur, but must confess enjoyment of two songs that are generally cursed by EC purists: 'I Wanna Be Loved' and 'Only Flame in Town'.While not lyrically compelling, I find the songs musically enjoyable. Love the strange synth feel to 'Wanna' and even the sax solo. The demo version of 'Only Flame' on EC's 'All This Useless Beauty' bonus disc is superior to the standard recording here. Costello originally seems to have conceived the song as a 50s style slow dance number. It's kitschy but fun!'The Comedians', also recorded by the late Roy Orbison, is about the only other cut of significant interest. Like 'Only Flame', the demo version of this song on Rhino's 'All This Useless Beauty' bonus disc is better than the one here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still better than anything U2 or Smashing Pumpkins ever did.","review":"This is most EC fans least favorite album. Mine too, but you know what? I still love it. Even when Elvis is'nt putting to much effort into his music he still is putting out better records than just about everybody else. Yes even U2. In fact, especially U2. U2 groove on one chord tunes and then try and add sound effects to make them work. The same goes for Smashing Pumpkins, who critics love for some reason. Even on EC's \\"I got a bad cold day\\" he sings better than Billy Corgan. Elvis knows and understands how melody and arrangement are most effective when sounding effortless and not forced. It's easy to say this album [isn't good]. EC is a musical genius who just took a day off. A well deserved day off, especially when most critically acclaimed artists are on permanant vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only One Good Song","review":"I admit Elvis Costello's body of work is horrible, but he does have one good song in his hole catalog and it's on this album. \\"The Only Flame In Town\\" is by far his best song and is his only song that is worth mentioning to this date (I can't see him writing anything in the future to change this), but this song is a keeper. Daryl Hall sings the backing vocals on this track which adds some talent to a otherwise untalented individual and song. Listen to this track and you will see that Evis Costello has at least one good tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic R&B","review":"BTMF was the best bar band I have ever experienced.

They explained that they do not have people in-house to test their products with the various foods to be dehydrated and to check the web.I understood when purchasing that this device would dehydrate citrus fruits such as lemons. I did not understand that an additional piece of equipment was needed to keep them.I dried the lemons as per the user manual at 135 degrees and they burned. I then had to do my own research to find out that it was necessary to lower the temperature.

The design is good. the trays fit well together and airflow seems even throughout the unit. My previous cheap dehydrator had no fan so this one dries items FAST even on lower heat settings. The only negatives I can think of are: there is no timer, hence no auto shut-off, and there is no power switch so you do have to unplug the unit when you need to set the top unit aside for any reason.

I was able to dehydrate my ground meat, veggies, and cereal in a reasonable amount of time with no burning. I haven't tried sauces yet, but given the even drying I think they'll work well. You might have to rotate your trays though as it does dry a little unevenly with all trays loaded. I also recommend the screens since they let air circulate and (surprisingly) even the cereals I was dehydrating came off the screens easily. So far the major concern is that the trays themselves seem a little flimsy, and I could see the mesh breaking if one wasn't careful to support and hold the trays correctly when moving them.

Easy to clean afterwords. Storage is not too bad. All in all a very simple way to make jerky. My kids love jerky and this dehydrator makes it a snap to cook great tasting jerky indoors (I do like to use my smoker every now and then - but this has got the smoker beat for convenience - especially if you use ground meat and Nesco's Jerky gun)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noisy","review":"The fan is noisy but I put it inthe kitchen so it's okay.Dry the fruit well, keep it color and flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine for the price","review":"Although our garlic took WAY longer than the instruction book said (it said 4-12 hours, it took over 60), for the price this is a fantastic machine.We also have dried oregano and a few other herbs in it. We got the unit after fruit season here so we haven't been able to try it out for that yet but are really looking forward to it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after four batches","review":"The dehydrator failed after drying four batches of fruit. The manufacturer warranty requires the purchaser to return the failed product at a cost of $13.00 guaranteed shipping. I would not have bought the product for the purchase price and the combined cost of returning for warranty repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT Timer!","review":"There is a simple, inexpensive, PERFECT timer for this product: the Brinks 42-1005 which has 1/2 hr. increments up to 24 hours and costs a whopping $3.97 at Walmart. Since this timer is rated at 15 amps, should not prove to be any problem with the Nesco-75. Basically the timer is a small knob into which you plug the Nesco at the front; it takes up virtually no countertop space. Made beef jerky: 1 lb. round steak and set the timer for 6 hours, put on top tray. Perfect time and results. The Brinks makes using the Nesco a set and forget appliance. Nesco is very well made, and I cannot add any further comments to those already posted."},{"rating":"1","title":"NESCO Dehydrator","review":"We have used a smaller, lesser model RONCO food dehydrator for years and thought the 700W NESCO would be a big step up. It had advertised features that suggested it would work faster and more efficiently than the \\"cheaper\\" models, including a fan to force heated air more uniformly through the drying trays without constant rotation, and a thermostat to set the temperature settings. Actual experience varied, however, as the unit did not seem to dehydrate the food contents any faster than the 120W RONCO convection dryer. While it was said to dry foods in a fraction of the time that a cheaper unit would require to do it, our experience has not been consistent with this expectation. The NESCO is an atractive unit with seemingly nice features, but our experience with its performance suggests it is about the same as any other similar unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dehydrator","review":"This is the second I've purchased.

I had planned on buying one that costs 4 times this one, but I was gifted with this one. Thanks Becca! :)Its very quiet, lightweight, and dries produce in record time.To make the most of this unit, I am buying more trays, and most importantly the flexible screens for each tray.If you are planning to dehydrate smaller vegetables & fruit such as corn, peas, raisins,& cranberries, they will fall thru the mostly larger sized spokes of the trays making it useless for these items without the flexible screens.2 come with the unit and I was able to use them & they worked great. Also, the flexible screens make removing foods easy as it bends & you can just pour them into your storage containers.An excellent deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Love this Dehydrator.

My herbs dry at just the right temperature so that they retain all their enzymes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nesco fd-75pr 700-watt food dehydrator","review":"This is my second food dehydrator and it is a much better product than my first one. Aside from good construction, I like having the ability to select the temperature. The one thing I don't like is that there is no off switch and it must be uplugged each time I want to look inside. It does an excellent job of drying food quickly and I was able to purchase extra trays, leather sheets and micropore sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT buy!!","review":"This is one of the 2 best products I have bought in the last 10 years!!

I have dehydrated apples, bananas, grapes, sprouted wheat flakes, bread for crumbs, chicken strips for my dog, dog treats and cat treats. So far so good. Easy to clean and use. Someone mentioned that their unit melted. It does get hot on top when I ran at the higher temperatures for the meat... but the instructions clearly states to use 4 tiers with the unit regardless if they are full. So, maybe they didn't do all 4.

I've used the dehydrator \\"8\\" times making dried chicken breast for my dog (she is a 3 lb yorkie) and it worked beautifully. Yesterday was no exception. This morning I thought I'd try drying tarragon but when I plugged in nothing happened. Nesco customer service stated \\"it's probably an internal switch, which happens\\". It is a pain to pack just the top and send back for replacment or repair. If the problem \\"happens\\" with very moderate use it looks like they would use better internal switches.I would never purchase a Nesco product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re: Misinformation","review":"The unit is loud and not efficient.

How am I supposed to know how to use it?Very dissatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little machine","review":"This dehydrator is so easy to use and to clean. The trays are ample to hold the product that you are dehydrating. Takes up little counter space. The heating is evenly distributed throughout the entire tray assembly. One feature that I would like to see and that my 1970 dehydrator has on it is an inline switch on the power cord, so the unit can be turned off/on without unplugging from the wall if you want to check the progress of what you are dehydrating. If my idea of the inline switch is used, I would like compensation!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes a long time","review":"Bought this dehydrator because the reviews said it work great and dried fast. Mine takes about 3 times as it says it should to dry fruit. At first I thought it was becasue we were doing fruit leather at the same time as fruit, but now we have done just fruit and it took over 12 hours to dry thin sliced peaches. I do like the fruit leather trays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"I tried drying herbs from my garden with this dehydrator...it took FOREVER!

I was not disappointed. It works great and isn't that noisy - I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and have no complaints. It seems to dry evenly even when all 5 trays are in use. It comes with 2 mesh tray liners and 2 fruit rollup liners - if you are drying sticky fruits or small items, the mesh liners are a must.Like other reviewers, I find it mildly annoying that there's no \\"on/off\\" switch, but on the plus side that's one less thing to worry about breaking..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Great product, the only complaint is that it should have an automatic timer switch to eliminate the guess work ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for raw food vegans","review":"I bought this for my girlfriend who is a raw food vegan and she absolutely loves it.

I called Nesco and Customer service told me that the trays, the fruit roll up trays and the inserts are all BPA free but the top part with the motor is not. As the top does not come in contact with food, I think we are good.I am drying 5 trays of almonds. I soaked them first overnight as per the recipe-then drained them and begin drying them. The small recipe book that comes with the unit said it would be 24 hours.I begin drying them at 500pm on Saturday evening. It is now Monday morning and they are still not crispy. ( I am using the low 95-100 recommended heat setting so as not to destroy the enzymes.) The CR representative told me that it can take between 24-48 hours, so I will see if they are done this evening. I will try to update as I try more items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possitive","review":"Bought this for my husband for christmas and he has used it alot for making jerky..It is very fast at drying the jerky and clean up is easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food Dehydrator","review":"This was a gift to my mother over a month ago and she hasn't stopped playing with it sense.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less than professionally made","review":"I was excited yesterday to finally get my dehydrator. When I put my trays ( the ones that came with it )together, the inside was warped up so the power unit did not sit straight but tilted. I also bought two additional trays. They warped downward. Seriously needs more quality control at the cheap labor end of the manufacturing. I used my cutting board and a book to help straighten out. Hopefully by this weekend everything will sit straight enough to use without air leaking all over. Keep you updated.7:30 PM 2/13/13Cutting board didn't work. Turned on my dehydrator and set to 160 for an hour; all the trays are straight now."},{"rating":"2","title":"quiet and compact","review":"Have been using this dehydrator almost exclusively on my bumper crop of tomatoes this past month. It is very quiet, I can keep it on my kitchen counter while its running and it takes somewhere between 8 and 12 hours to dry slices and halves or quarters depending on size of tomatoes. When I fill up the five trays, I get a full pint bag of dehydrated tomato slices :) Easy to clean (I don't have a dishwasher) and comes with everything you need. For less than $60 with free shipping, this costs as much as the inferior dehydrators sold at discount stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well, but only lasted a few years","review":"I only owned this for about 3 years of light use before the motor died.

I cut everything up according to the instructions, set the dehydrator to 135 and still, limp peppers 2 1/2 days later. When I turned the dehydrator up to 145, it did get hot. So, it seems that this unit will only be good at temps over 135 which is not useful to me as I would like to dehydrate herbs too. It is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Failure","review":"While this dehydrator worked well for about 5 batches of jerky, the heating element failed within 7 weeks. The fan still works, but no heat. Unfortunately, I am outside of Amazon's return window by a couple of weeks, so I'm stuck with a bulky plastic downblowing fan. I also made the mistake of purchasing several extra trays. A $75 dollar lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 15 months, nesco would not replace","review":"Poor quality combined with inflexible customer service. It worked like a dream for a while then broke. The warranty is 1 year, but given I didn't us it much, essentially it broke after about a dozen uses.

This process with the old dehydrator took 2.5 days for each batch, and I had to reposition the trays every 8 hours so the fruit would dry evenly.Following the purchase of this dehydrator, I found that the process took about 18 hours instead, and required no repositioning of trays. Clean up was a breeze, as the heating unit and blower are in the lid, and no dripping get into the mechanics of the appliance. The dried fruit was a great hit as holiday gifts, and I am excited to try other fruit as they come in season. I would recommend this dehyrator to any small scale food-drier. The only thing I felt it lacked was a timer switch, so it would turn off automatically after a set amount of time. It is a wonderful addition to my kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Treat Maker","review":"Wow! This is a good machine to make healthy human and dog treats.

If you don't have a big sink, use a large round plastic tray/saucer intended to catch water under potted plants.

I have made all sorts of jerky and various other things. This was my first dehydrator and it love still to this day it has not let me down.

This one has the heater and fan mounted on the top. I was impressed that I was able to dry 2 lb of jerky in about four hours without having to sort trays or move the meat. This comes with the fruit roll tray, the liquid tray, and five perforated drying trays. Also, I was surprised that this came with three packages of jerky spice. I would recommend this to a friend and am thinking of buying a second one. This would be a five star review, but the unit is a little loud for me, not really any louder than a box fan, but I wasn't expecting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nesco FD-75PR 700 watt Food Dehydrater","review":"My family enjoys the hamburger jerky.

Drying time is less than half the time of my previous dehydrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Expected!!","review":"I was always under the impression that it took days to dry foods, so I wasn't expecting much different when I bought this machine a few weeks ago. I could not have been more wrong! This thing is great! The first weekend we had it we dried apples, bananas, and strawberries. They all turned out great, but the apple chips were by far my favorite. Took about 10-12 hours to do all that fruit (5 trays worth). The best surprise was the next weekend we bought some round steak, sliced it real thin, and marinated it in the provided jerky seasoning/cure packets and in four hours, we had the best tasting jerky I have ever had. It was amazing! I've got the jerky gun on order now so I can try ground meat jerky too. I highly recommend this unit ... it was definitely worth the money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommend","review":"I bought this product based on the high reviews, really glad i did! I've had it less than a months and have already made beef jerky, cantaloupe, a box of bartlett pears, apples, zucchini and bananas. My kids love the snacks. However, I wouldn't use the seasoning packets for the beef jerky because it has MSG in it. I threw it all out and just added my own ingredients. Other than that it's wonderful and would recommend this one to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nesco Dehydrator","review":"It is worth the money, the fan is not very noisy at all.

If it only had a timer, it would be ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad that I chose this machine","review":"I bought the Nesco FD-75PR food dehydrator to replace my old dehydrator (which is no fan and very low). I totally satisfied for what I bought. Great product! The machine is strong and have variable temperatures to choose. I used it to make beef jerky, it turned out perfect and only needed 7 hours to be done. I also used it to dehydrate some fruit candies that I made for our New Year \\"Tet\\". They were awesome. It's a smart design to place the fan on top lid as the juice came out from meat or fruit won't make the fan dirty.The only unconvenient I see is no On/OFF switch. If it's have this on/off switch, it is 5 star product, that's why I only rated it 4 star. In anyway, if you don't mind of this small missing function, I recommended this to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disaster","review":"Waiting time and delivery were great, After getting my first batch of things to dehydrate ready I turned on the machine and it lasted maybe 20 seconds tops before there was a strong smell of burning plastic and a pop.

Great gift for someone who wants to break in to the food dehydration scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"The newer models have fan on top and this makes cleaning wonderful, only have to worry with the racks.

I came across this item through Amazon, and the ratings made it seem like a no-brainer. I am glad I went with Nesco for my first dehydrator. All you do is plug the device in and turn it to the temperature of your choice. Walk away and in the next 8-10 hours you will have the best beef jerky of your life. My beef jerky came out perfect and lasted less than 30 minutes because it was so good. I would definitely recommend buying this product if you are interested in making some of the best jerky ever.Not sure how other food comes out, although I am sure it will come out equally as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"dehydrator","review":"This is a great product and it is a nice size, works great, I highly recommend this nesco.I would definately buy one as a gift for someone in my family,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything most people need!","review":"I was hesitant at first to buy this dehydrator. While I was doing research, I initially wanted to get the largest, fanciest dehydrator I could find, because I wanted to make jerky and have heard anecdotal horror stories about jerky gone wrong. I decided to try this first, and I am very happy that I did. It makes a great jerky, just the way I like it, in only a couple of days. I have also made dehydrated pea snacks, rutabaga chips, green bean chips, and kale chips with no issues. It is important to get a feel for it and check on progress so you gain a good sense of its timing, but once you do that, you should be set for anything besides a large-scale project. This dehydrator should meet the needs of most families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product! Great price!","review":"I wanted to get a dehydrator and was immediately drawn to the pricey Excalibur models because of internet reviews. I cautiously bought the Nesco 75PR because I didn't want to spend $200+. I am so glad I did!!! I love this machine. It runs almost every day at my house. I cannot believe how great the dried fruit is, especially strawberries. This machine does a great job and is sometimes quicker than the recipes state for drying time. I have even made jerky, it does a great job of catching the drips below and cleans up so easily! My only wish is that I had another one. We eat the food faster than I can dry it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great !!!!","review":"SO for this machine works well. I have been using it non stop for about a week now. I would purchase another."},{"rating":"1","title":"LONG drying time","review":"This Item says that is drys in hours instead of days, but it took as long as the heating one that I had WITHOUT a fan. I returned it, but had to pay $17 for shipping it...so bummer of a deal! :_-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it all the time","review":"Bought this for my mom for christmas and she hasn't stopped using it. She dries every kind of fruit in there from kiwi to mango to banana. The fruit comes out tasting just like store bought dried fruit products would. It makes a really loud noise though and takes up a lot of room in our kitchen and it does take awhile to dry the fruit. Nevertheless, it is worth it because you can put a lot of fruit on the stackable trays inside it and the snacks last for weeks. We have not dried meat in there yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Little Machine","review":"I LOVE this dehydrator! My dehydrator went into overtime at Christmas when I used it to make Beef Jerky, and Dog Treats for my family and friends! This machine gets the job done qickly.

This is an excellent price, just make sure you get all your accessories at the same time because you will need them once you get going!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Temperature control a big plus","review":"My wife wanted this model of dehydrator because of the temperature control feature (most dehydrators don't have it) and it turns out that's a pretty important thing to have. We're still experimenting with temperatures/times for different foods but there is definitely a fine line between too hot and just hot enough.Would be five stars for this model if it had a timer built in too (the other important factor in drying being time)."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st time","review":"I purchased a dehydrator to make healthy treats for my dogs.

It has been my staple and savior for years of learning and using Czech, and I still depend upon it for reference. The russian examples, as mentioned by a previous reviewer, are extensive. This is excellent for a slavophile such as myself, coming to Czech after studying Russian. The book does not rely upon them entirely for explanation, however, leaving its usefullness unscathed should the reader have no prior familiarity with slavic languages. My only cause for disappointment is the exercises, which I found to be entirely insufficient. If you won't be practicing Czech frequently otherwise, look elsewhere for a workbook, but keep this one as your grammar bible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whut It Really Dew?","review":"Man, Whut it really dew?

From beginning to end, the songs are smooth and relaxing. My favorite song is #6 - Slow Burn. I think this is the best song that he has ever done. I think it is a very romantic and sexy piece of music. It can also be very calming after a hard day at work or just a hard day. The track - All Night - is also beautiful in a sexy, romantic and soothing way. There are two \\"remakes\\" on this cd. The first is Here and Now (by Luther Vandross) and Nobody Knows (by Kevin Sharp - someone else may have done it but he's the only one that I know). Both of these songs are fantastic because there is no singing, just pure sax and other instruments. There are some great up tempo songs to lighten a mood, such as the title track, Jumpin Off and In The Groove. Fun and fantastic. If you like Richard Elliott, sax music or jazz, I think you'll love this cd. It's one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight blues","review":"Lucky Peterson plays guitar, keyboards and sings on this Alligator release but generally ends up with what I call 'lightweight blues'. He is an adequate musician but fails to deliver much that is substantial. The first indication is that many of the tracks 'fill' the sound with horns which just end up clutterring the listening. There are some worthwhile tracks however such as 'She spread her wings' and 'Over my Head' which produce more on the pure blues lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"The D-link adapter uses up so much of my system's resources that it causes calls to drop.

Finally removed the Skype software and installed everything in the D-Link package and it sort of worked. Downloaded the new version of Skype and it worked a little better. Then downloaded the new driver from D-Link.

I've tried all the driver versions without any success. D-link support couldn't help and suggested I return the product.Update: I bought the eforcity adapter instead.

When the drivers are present and not taking all the CPU time it makes good calls. This product is cheap but not worth the hassle. And yes I used the latest drivers from DLINK. I am now stuck with this software on my PC, no way to remove it; the uninstall utility does not work and Windows Add/Remove can not get rid of it.

The reason I purchased the product was to have the mobility to move about my home freely without being tied down in front of my computer screen.

Had to abandon installation and go to a different solution. Two main problems: (1) it does not coexist peacefully on a computer along with a webcam and sound card & speakers, and (2) it is incompatible with the current version of the Skype software. In regard to #2, uninstalling the current Skype and installing the version that came with the D-Link adapter was a no-go; the installation stopped and insisted on installing a newer version. Even if you could get beyond that problem, #1 is - to me at least - a deal breaker.A possible solution could have been to install on another, \\"clean\\" PC dedicated primarily to being a server for this adapter, but that would be far from an optimal solution for the problem at hand.

There's also no way to access voicemail other than to go to the PC and play it: but you have to change the audio driver setting manually so you can actually hear it.

While installing the software, just don't be panic when you see the installation menu comes out again. The first time is installing the hardware, the second path is to connect the skype. I got pretty confused in the beginning, until I installed it the second time. Installation is really simple. Always download the newest version for installation from company's website.

The next time I tried using Skype from the computer, the adapter stole the call and dropped it (I could hear it click when it stole the call).2. You have to dial 00, the country code, the phone number, and * to make a call, and it sounds like your going to get the disconnected number recording (you know that sound that plays?) 3 times before it starts ringing.If it didn't drop calls, I'd give it 4 stars.

The point of this device was to get away from the computer but that doesn't seem possible.Instead I have tried the Ooma system. It cost a pretty penny to purchase it but it is working like a charm. I figure after a years service it has paid for itself since the cost of the hub is my yearly phone bill. The added advantage is I can turn off my computer and still make calls.

And Spader looks enormous (across). Plus, the book does not include pictures of 2 of the main characters: Courtney and Mark.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It is short. 48 pages of not-that-great drawings. I am serious. If you buy this book, you will think: 'Why didn't I listen to that kid telling me not to buy this book? It's a RIP-OFF!!'."},{"rating":"1","title":"No No No","review":"I am a huge fan of this series, and this really was disappointing. The writing bit was decent, but the illustrations didn't meet my standards whatsoever. i was thoroughly disappointed with a few of the drawings as they didn't even follow the author's descriptions. It was irritating reading a book in a series I enjoy immensly that was so dismal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!!","review":"This book is 48 pages long. Some of them don't even have words. It is one of the poorest excuses for cashing in that I have ever seen. While I enjoy the Pendragon series and look forward to each installment, my respect for the author and the publisher is greatly diminished by being duped into buying this piece of trash. If anyone wants it, it's yours. Free.I gave it one star because the site wouldn't allow me to rate it ZERO STARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my packing!","review":"Love these cubes!

They fit perfectly into the bag and kept everything neat. At certain airpotts the liquids need to be pulled out of the carry on bag and having a cube to just pull out without distrubing everything else made it easy and painless. They are very sturding and so much can fit into each one. I was able to back all of my clothes into the larger one leaving the smaller ones for toiletries, shoes, etc. Because they make such good us of space, I still had room left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for its purpose","review":"I am using these three cubes in my storage for off-season clothes.

It has a lot of action and I think it pretty much follows the book. A few things were left out, but all in all it kept the kids engaged, although it's kind of dated. The scenes were labeled wrong ( they put Gulliver's Travels on the Odyssey.)Speaking of which, Gulliver's Travels put me to sleep, but my husband liked it. Ted Danson was an unlikely giant.

This was one of the first albums of hers that I owned, and for a long time I didn't really like it because the arrangements and Sarah's melodies take considerable listening to before you hear their genius. But its one that never grows old and continually amazes. Her two duets with Joe Williams feature the both of them at the top of their game. As for the band, I think they and Sarah complement each other perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty and Fun","review":"My 4yr old granddaughter, who loves everything princess, and loves craft items was in heaven as we spent a good part of our visit making this project.

For the most part the acting was good with the exception of one or two actors and actresses, but for the most part it was an interesting movie that was able to keep me watching it. The whole premise of the guy going from guy to girl after drinking some weird formula is a little far fetched, but the actor and actress playing those two parts were able to pull it off perfectly. As long as you can get past the premise of he/she changing sexes constantly, and don't take the movie seriously, you will enjoy watching it"},{"rating":"2","title":"COOLEST MOVIE","review":"Alright,this was the best movie I have seen and it was damn funny too. I havent seen it in a while so some details might be off. In the begining the main charicter (a man) creates a formula to make their sexual stamina or something like that go up(for the person who drinks it.) Anyway,he tests it on himself and transforms into a very, very, sexy woman. The first time he transforms he runs into the ladies-room and is starting to enjoy his new body. He feels his breasts alot.(Im a guy so I have to admitt that if I turned into a girl that loked like him (h is a man just in the form of a woman) that I would be excited and do more. Anyway I think that he only transforms when he gets sexualy excited. There was also a part when he was offered a job to be the head of sexual products or something like that.

Solo, both Buddy Guy and the late Junior Wells, are fabulous, but there was a magic when they played together. This 1981 set captures the early days of blues as played on backporches all through the south.

YOU MUST OWN THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw","review":"...and I mean raw in a good way. This CD is old school blues. The combination of two giants in the blues world is wonderful. The combination of a lone guitar and harmonica is blues at its best.

Also, the explanations about skin care were clearly not written by anyone with a science or medical background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This book had very few colour photos, no application techniques, and often incorrect statements about hair and skin types. There were no insightful tips or \\"insider information\\" that would have been useful to back up my current knowledge.

Implementation of these concepts will become increasingly important as baby boomers retire in the next few years; organizations that learn how to build workforce affiliation will attract and retain human assets and will be more successful.Dr. Ron Elsdon has already been awarded the Human Resource Planning Society's Walker Prize for advancing state-of-the-art thinking in human resources.

Great for pre-kindergarten thru 3rd grades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Do Much","review":"This is a simple toy...very simple. It's a flimsy spring between two receptacles and nothing more. The main point of interest is that when each end is put to the ears of two different people and you \\"twang\\" the spring, the two people will hear a \\"twanging\\" noise. It has a bit of an otherworldly, echoey sound but it is not so interesting that the kids use it for more than a couple of seconds before moving on to something else. The toy is described as having the educational value of teaching how sound waves travel between two points. This may be true, but you could make your own simple model with your kids and save some money. By the way, the lightweight spring tangles and gets pulled out of shape very easily so only buy this if your children know how to handle toys carefully. If I'm somehow missing out on a more interesting aspect of this toy, I hope some other reviewer will inform the readers of these reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction, without being superficial","review":"This is probably the best introduction one can read about the Roman Empire, since the author not only gives the conventional information (such as the lives of the individual emperors, etc) but also provides analytical and critical comments from a broader historical perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable introduction","review":"I was disappointed when this book arrived to discover that it only covers the years 44BC-235AD. Thus it is a history of the establishment and development of the Roman Empire and does not deal with its division or its ultimate fall in the West. I was also disappointed by the author's disdain for providing details about some of the emperors' more scandalous doings! That said, this is a very accessable introduction that provides a good base for continued reading.

So many books on requirements focus on organization and structure and they tend to ignore the realities of how to actually interact with users and express requirements in their terms. The book also examines approaches to gathering these stories in situations where you may not have direct access to the end user.The overall approach and examples provided throughout the book equip the reader with a clear roadmap for leveraging and applying user stories in their organization. The book also includes insight into how user stories should be integrated into the overall development lifecycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best agile oriented book I've read","review":"I have been spending the last few months immersing myself in Agile and trying to learn as much as I can. I have so far read five different books on the subject including this one and I have one left.This is by far the most lucid, well-written, practical book on the subject. Agile books tend to sometimes get too anecdotal and speak in metaphors before they give you some useful practical steps. Not this one.Mr. Cohn starts being useful right away and gives practical and useful advice. This book was worth every penny. In fact it made the other books I read clearer.If you want a simple effective explanation of how to write user stories, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great explanation of how to apply stories in real life","review":"This book does an excellent job explaining what stories are, how to use them, and how to deal with the nasty edge cases that may trip up any team trying to apply user stories to their own projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agile Requirements Management Demystified","review":"Finally a book that demystifies Agile Requirements Management. In particular demystifying myths about User Stories themselves.The book puts together ideas from other books on the subject : Writing Effective Use Cases and Requirements by Collaboration :Workshop for defining needs.This book not only explains properly the concepts but gives you practical advice on how you could use user stories on your projects.I particularly liked the chapter : Using Stories with Scrum.Reading this book was truly an enjoyable and learning experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, too much fluff","review":"As you'll read in other reviews this book does a great job of laying the foundation on how to implement XP as a development process using user stories, iterations, and other concepts used in XP.Where the book goes a little overboard is with some drawn out stories and examples that could be cut down. In reality I think this book could almost have 1/3 less long and been a 5 star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any Product Owner","review":"Mike has a gift when it comes to explaining concepts in a format that everyone can understand regardless of their technical level. This book is one of them.User Stories seem like a simple concept, but they can be elusive at first to people used to writing 200-page requirements documents. Writing good stories that stand-up and hold through a project iteration is sometimes more an art than a science.Mike's book provides insight on ways to help add a little \\"science\\" into the mix with practical examples and bullet points of key concepts divided into business and technical groupings. After all stories are supposed to bridge the gap between business and technology and do away with \\"throw it over the wall\\" approach to requirements and foster conversation and collaboration.This is a great book for any Product Owner or development team member who's looking to better understand User Story development. A must have for Scrummasters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a modest title","review":"Everyone has struggled with requirements management; there is even an industry that provides fancy tools for it. In this book, Mike puts them out of business. Using 3x5 cards, common sense, and team work, Mike shows how to how to manage requirements in a straightforward way that minimizes hoopla and maximizes value. Mike doesn't tell us how to do it, he shows us how to do it. And, without making a big deal out of it, Mike shows us how to manage our requirements while introducing acceptance test driven development.When I got done with Mike's book, I knew how to manage requirements with minimum overhead, to only manage the requirements that were important at that time, and to implement requirements traceability. Quite a bit for such an unassuming title. Read this book, give it to your teams, and watch common sense grow in your organization."},{"rating":"2","title":"a leader's favorite","review":"The NLP process is used by military as well as civilian leaders and managers to better understand, communicate with, and motivate troops.

The tempos are often broad but Rattle has the vison and energy to keep the natural flow of the music. Rattle does not disrupte the music's natural flow as let say Celibidache often does.The playing of the Berlin Philharmonic is nigh perfect and the intontion and ensemble continue to amaze. The recording is very good with a good wide range that does not confine the sound of this great orchestra.Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Do You Rock?","review":"Elvin Bishop's \\"Big Fun\\" is just that. He uses that guitar like a weapon and there are some licks captured here that make my hair stand on end, even after eleven years. I was Elvins Road Manager at the time this was recorded and must have listened to this record in process over 1000 times and it still holds together for me. It is a good time record and I'm just sorry that it didn't sell more copies or be better known. The guy that did the editorial review, Hadley or whatever his name is, has one thing wrong. The persona that Elvin took on, or more acurately was saddled during his Butterfield years with was \\"Pigboy Crabshaw\\".

What I forgot was how witty it was, how warm, how accomplished for such an early novel in a writer's career. In short, it was actually better than I remembered, a rare accomplishment for an author I love so much. Not as magnificent as Proust nor as fine a writer as James, but equally as wise as both and much more welcoming than either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Angels Fear to Tread","review":"In E. M. Forster's first novel, an effete English family and their acquaintances encounter an authentic and vital society in the hills of Italy. Vacuous Lilia visits Monteriano in Tuscany and impulsively marries. She realizes her mistake too late to save herself but her English in-laws attempt to rescue the issue of her marriage. Upon arriving in Monteriano, they find that their wealth and education count for less than they thought. Rigid Harriett breaks herself against the local culture and provokes a tragedy, but the more sensitive members of the rescue party, Philip and Miss Abbott, profit in ways that they did not expect.Forster uses a quiet, simple style that lets the reader be moved by his rather sudden plot revelations. While this is a short novel, Forster finds room for a sincere appreciation of the charms of fictional Monteriano and some gentle humor. I imagine that this very approachable novel would appeal to many different types of readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version: serious formatting errors","review":"It's free, so I can't really complain.

Stick with it, it has a slow start, but it has a complete surprise not too far into the book, that keeps you with the story. It has dry British humor that some will not find funny. A quick read and different from his later books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ironic Humor","review":"I wasn't quite certain what to expect I dove into my first experience with Forster. I've heard opinions on him ranging from \\"brilliant\\" to \\"depressing tripe.\\" I'm not willing to go quite so far as \\"brilliant,\\" but it's much closer to that mark than the latter. All right, yes, it *is* depressing in many respects. But the subtlety, the irony, the characterizations, and the downright humor is a delight. I look forward to the rest of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software ok, support is horrible","review":"This program is very inflexible and rigid. On board Help files are very limited and I've never dealt with another company who seems to care less about supporting their product as you can tell just by trying to find out where to write or call. Unless you're paying the bucks for a support plan, you're toast. However, given the price of the software, which is expensive, you'd think some consideration would be given to users.

Sage technical support was unresponsive. I uninstalled 2007 and then 2004 worked fine. The client is considering conversion to another accounting program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peachtree is the best bargain in bookkeeping","review":"I've used Quickbooks and Peachtree. Peachtree is usually less expensive. But that is not important. What is important is that Peachtree was designed correctly from the ground up. If you do some research and find out about the design of Quickbooks, you will discover that it was designed and set up incorrectly. It uses one big gigantic database for all entries in all years. This is a huge mistake for an accounting system unless you are a very small company indeed. I can't speak to the top-of-the-line enterprise programs. But the consumer level Peachtree is a REAL accounting program which evolved from highly sophisticated (and very, very expensive) accounting programs in the DOS era, whereas Quickbooks can be thought of as an accounting program that grew out of a check-balancing personal finance program. Quickbooks can't be ignored since it is so popular. But Peachtree is a bargain since it is a much better program with more features for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective, a bit difficult to lather on","review":"It's so thick it doesn't go on as smoothly as the Coppertone Sport I used to use, but it has none of the bad ingredients, so the extra effort is worth it.

Unfortunately, she has also had problems with the blocking sunscreens. Her dermatologist recommended Vanicream and after looking at all the reviews, I thought this may be our answer. I bought the Vanicream Sport SPF 30 sensitive skin and the Vanicream Sensitive Skin spf 60. She tried the Vanicream Sport for a while and it seemed to work during the day, but after she came home from soccer practice, she had broken out in a rash. Strike one. She then tried the Vanicream Sensitive Skin SPF 60 a few days later and broke out immediately. So, still looking for something that she's not allergic to......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer saver","review":"We adopted a little boy from China, whom we found out on the first day of swimming, is highly allergic to sunscreens of any kind. The allergist recommended this and gave us samples as well. While it is a little thicker than norm, the Vanicream Sport 35 worked well, whether on a FL vacation or for daily pool use. Our other son, who usually gets rashes after a few days of sun and sunscreen on the beach, used it as well. No more rashes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sunscreen, extreme holding power","review":"This sunscreen holds up incredibly well while perspiring heavily or when swimming. It does not seep into your eyes at all when sweating. It takes a bit of rubbing to get it in. If you put too much on you will not be able to rub it all in and you will end up looking like a clown. However even if you do put too much on it does eventually fade in on its own. There is no greasy residue with this lotion, which I really like. I had been using a good lotion for a number of years, and then they changed something in the formulation and now I feel like a greased pig when I use it. This sunscreen can be tough to wash off-but that really is a plus. If it comes off easily, then you're not getting adequate protection. I work as a lifeguard on the beach so there really is no better litmus test than what I go through in a normal work day. This sunscreen does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy sunscreen that's acceptable","review":"I bought this because it was a well-rated sunscreen for its effectiveness and non-toxicity by the Environmental Working Group. Highly recommend using their sunscreen guide, because unfortunately most sunscreens are not nearly effective enough and also include risky ingredients for our bodies.It has a different texture than the mainstream sunscreens I used to rely on. It is thicker and harder to rub in, whereas the others are more liquidy. It leaves a more ghostly look unless you really rub it in. However, especially after trying another similar sunscreen that was like a glue stick (TruKid Facestick), this one is acceptable to me. I will probably buy it again. Health and effectiveness will trump cost and appearance for me. Recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Martial Arts Movie","review":"This is a classic hand combat and weapon-play masterfully choreographed John Woo directed 70's martial arts movie.

Never taking flight, the movie remains as moribund as director/writer Brian Shepp's imagination. Terribly written, horribly acted, and directed without even a glimmer of moviemaking knowledge, the unattractive cast has nowhere to go without a story and without dialogue that makes you anticipate the next scene. The characters that never grow, never change, and really have nothing to say. All I heard through the whole film was \\"Blah, blah, blah\\". I'm amazed this movie got made. It's a complete mess and removes any credibility that gay filmmaking has achieved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this film.","review":"Lacks professionalism in every area - story, direction, dialogue, casting, acting and sound mix. The film wants to be fresh, romantic and hopeful, but its actually superficial pap. Just a rehash of other, better, material. In fact, you can see every plot turn coming miles ahead. If you want a look at the gay club scene, watch the American and/or British versions of \\"Queer As Folk.\\" They treat the same subjects with wit and style. \\"Gypsy Boys\\" is just plain tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap,Crap,oh......and crap","review":"Wow, this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.Most of the actors were mechanical and stale. (read-Boring amatures whose attempts at acting should have never been captured on film)The rest of the movie is too damn cliche...The only appeal to this film is the few male actors who are attractive,but if you were buying this movie for that sole reason, you'd be better off buying an A&F catalouge.

If you just bump it, it stops working and you need to wiggle it into the outlet just right to make it work again. My take on this product is that they are trying to impress you with a lot of bells and whistles, but fail in the long term to supply a quality product.

However, like one of the other reviewers reported, the 3 bright lights soon start to flicker which greatly reduces their brightness and could induce a migraine.

The eye candy in the men's support group scenes (and the notably brilliant performances by the guru and his wife -- an exception in this flick)can't sustain the whole movie. What really turned me off from irritation to outrage is the nasty ending in which the main character has sex with his high school sweetheart, a woman. Granted there was no indication that this encounter meant much of anything, but it truly offended me that a movie all about coming to terms with the funny poignancies of mature monogomy in GLB relationships could end by sending the message that all the confused and silly would-be monogamous gay man needs is a good roll in the hay with a pretty blonde waitress.

The laughs are not big enough and the film barely \`goes there' where there is plenty of room to move. Chris Rock loses almost all of his edgy endearment by going too \`light' here.

The film is a quirky odyssey of a misguided movie director who wants to experience poverty so he can make the great American movie. At first, Sullivan controlls his experiences as a hobo and comes away dissatisfied with the results. It's only when poverty is foisted on him with disastrous results that Sullivan sees the downfall of method directing. \\"Sullivan's Travels\\" is a hard film to categorize because it's comedic elements are tempered by it's dramatic ones. One thing that can't be denied is Sturges delivers some hard truths. Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake are adequate here and just as well. Sturges probably didn't want his actors overshadowing his message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film by Great Film Director!","review":"This is a wonderful film which was the basis for O'Brother, Where Art Thou? by the Coen Brothers years later. A wealthy film director decides that his comedies are trivial and he must make an \\"important\\" film about the lowest classes in the United States.

They combine satire with episodes of character development that give them depth; slapstick humor with smart dialogue; and ensemble acting with deft cinematography that reward repeated viewings. While some of Sturges' films are rich in period detail, none of them are dated. They're just as funny (and some episodes just as moving) as when they were made, and there are no dull parts. Unfortunately, however, two of Sturges' best films are missing from this set - Unfaithfully Yours, and Miracle of Morgan's Creek. His underrated film starring Harold Lloyd, The Sin of Harold Diddleback (AKA Mad Wednesday) is also missing. A set that included all of these films would deserve not just five but six stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't care for it.","review":"I watch movies for entertainment and I did not find this movie that entertaining.

Now I love the screwball comedies of the 1930s, and I like Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, and the Three Stooges. Most black comedy appeals to me. I have, in short, a large sense of humor. But I cannot, for the life of me, fathom the alleged humor in Sturges. A script with a million words, constant and frantic action, and the crudest forms of slapstick leave me cold.

In the bar scenes in both movies you can taste the beer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Great Film -- 1st Rate DVD","review":"\\"Sullivan's Travels\\" is not my favorite Preston Sturges film, but it's close. This DVD however, made me reassess the film. The commentary is amusing (three commentators, with three different moods: respectful, academic, and irreverent). Even better is the very generous 76 minute \\"American Masters\\" documentary devoted to Sturges. It has a wonderful overview of Sturges' career. Additionally, Criterion surpasses its own high standards with a flawless B&W transfer, one of the best I've seen. Well worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Has It All!","review":"I watched this movie on the AMC channel on a gloomy, rainy Saturday and it instantly became one of my all-time favorites! It's hard to believe that it was filmed back in the forties, because it portrays the same social dilemmas that touch all of us over fifty years later. Very entertaining as extremely entertaining as you will be laughing one minute and crying the next. Filmaker Sullivan is determined to make a serious film about the plight of the homeless and sets out with just the clothes on his back. Frustrated, he is continuously \\"rescued\\" by his elaborate Hollywood crew and winds up pairing up with the lovely Veronica Lake. The movie takes a turn as Sullivan gets himself into a bad turn of events, but the resolve at the end is wonderful. Wish they still made movies like this that become part of who you are once you watch them. Great for general audiences - Highest recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant social satire is made up of pure genius.","review":"John L. Sullivan is sick of seeing the audience laugh at his work, so he decides to do a Depression flick. This classic film is impossible not to like (for a normal person, that is) and is one of the greatest comedies ever made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"...For my money (I bought Sullivan's Travels without seeing it first), this was the Fatal Attraction of classic films. In other words, the entire tone of the movie changes (mercifully) half-way through, and suddenly we have a new story. The first 2/3 of the movie is badly acted schtick. The scenes in the prison and in the black church are brilliant, despite Joel McCrea's hideous acting. And this from a viewer who likes Abbot and Costello, I Love Lucy, Gone with the Wind, and the wonderful Criterion Video, Children of Paradise..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The movie is a light frothy comedy, too insubstantial for my taste. There is not much story and no depth to the characters. I didn't really like any of the characters in the movie so there is no incentive to see it again. It ended leaving one with a feeling of dissatisfaction. I got it because of Claudette Colbert but it was way below \\"It happened one night\\". If this is a screwball comedy, I'll be avoiding them in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why aren't the titles available separately?","review":"Being a major fan of Preston Sturges' comedies, I bought all of the separate releases when they came out: Sullivan's Travels, The Lady Eve, Hail the Conquering Hero and The Palm Beach Story (and also Miracle of Morgan's Creek which is not in this set). I need only Christmas in July and the Great McGinty to complete my collection. DVD manufacturers: I challenge you to explain why you think I should pay for the whole set just to get those two movies. One star given as an expression of my disgust at this totally transparent and cynical strategy to rob movie fans of their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bore","review":"A silly, sentimental piece of nonsense from the usually far more sensible Sturges.

Don't buy the series. Not worth the money. Wish I could send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Lovers of Screwball Comedy","review":"Claudette Colbert is brilliant in this fine example of Preston Sturges' work. Vaguely reminiscent of \\"It Happened One Night,\\" this film features a notable performance by Rudee Vallee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film gets 4 stars...but DVD is a dud!","review":"A delightful Preston Sturges classic is destroyed on DVD by Universal with a cheap, VHS-quality transfer. Shame on them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Palm Beach Story","review":"Charming and funny old movie with twists and turns in an entertaining plot. Interesting surprise ending. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Sturges","review":"I strongly recommended these films to lovers of madcap, so-called screwball comedy. (Even 'The Great Moment', a biopic about the dentist who discovered the use of ether as a painkiller, the sort of subject usually given a solemn treatment, is played for laughs.) They are some of the best examples of this cinema form that has had audiences laughing since the 1930s. The settings, fashions and manners might be of another era, but the droll dialogue and effervescent performances that Preston Sturges put to film are as fresh and cutting as ever today. The DVDs offered here are of excellent sound and vision quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preston Sturgis","review":"I have only recently been turned onto Preston Sturgis & his movies & think that this collection is OUTSTANDING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funkadelic Rocks!","review":"How late do you have 2BB4UR Absent? Not sure, but but what we do know is that this new double CD from the Parliament-Funkadelic Funk Mob is right on time! George Clinton's voice is stronger than it has been in many years and the band is crankin'. This CD features George's son and his grand daughter also. Looks like they will carry on the \\"freak\\" tradition. I would have preferred one great focused Funkadelic CD but I guess George was trying to please all of his new post \\"Jerry Garcia\\" fans on this one. You have your R&B; grooves, your Belita Woods vocals and even a 15 minute loop of the classic Funkadelic jam \\"Nappy Nugout\\". Although Prince also rocks on the CD, I would have liked more funky rock n roll guitarisms from Mike Hampton and Garry Shider.Something \\"stank\\" and I want some!"},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly dissapointing","review":"Honestly, when it comes to the master of funk, i expect so much more. i bought this album to add to my p. funk collection expecting to hear some classic bass lines, and funky grooves but instead got a hip/hop infused, almost completely funkless, soulless album. i actually considered throwing it out the window after a first listen, the second listen saved its life. to say ive never been this dissapointed in an album is an understatement. RIP to the funk...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funk Is on the Rise!","review":"I have been reading some of the reviews online for this CD and I am wondering for the P-Funk haters with the state of black music on the radio what do you people expect?

Paradigm, You Can Depend on Me, Inhale Slow with Paul Hill, Because/Last Time Zone, Sexy Side of You and Saddest Day with Belita Woods.

This is the best NON-Fiction book that I have ever read! Her story moved me with the vivid images of growing up in a Somalian desert, and the torture that innocent little girls have to endure through female genital mutilation. We can all gain from Waris Dirie's incredible strength and her tremendous will to live, in order to make a better life for herself, and her family. I plan to share this book with my family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"African Princess","review":"This book was both heart wrentching and inspiring. It was a beautiful story. I would like to use this book in class. I think it should be a mandatory read for everyone. This woman has become my hero. I plan on reading all her other books as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect real-life account of a very real terror","review":"Waris Dirie's story is the second book I've read about FGM in Africa. Unlike Fauziya Kassindja (author of Do They Hear You When You Cry), Dirie actually did submit to the horrifying surgery at age five. She lived to tell about it, and she does so in a mesmerizing way. With vivid attention to detail Dirie provides an insider's view of the plight of African women, millions of whom are forced to be \\"circumsised\\" in order to be appealing to a prospective husband. Although she escaped to a life of prestige and privledge, Dirie is no stranger to hard work and hard times. Not even her supermodel status assuages the emotional and mental distress caused by her circumsision. She reiterates countless times that she is one of the lucky few--most of her fellow African women will never experience life without pain. Their story is the one worth reading within this book, and Dirie tells it beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"This book is enlightening in more than one way. The description of nomadic life from someone who had lived it is very moving. The details of female genital mutilation makes one's psyche hurt. The details of her life, how she was used and in my opinion abused by her own relatives in England is quite sad. Mostly, I was awed by the fact that she was illiterate for all of her youth, and described herself freely as still not able to read and write properly. I'm sure she's quite literate now, but it wouldn't matter. The story, written by someone else and co-authored by Waris Dirie, is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sure the movie will be better.","review":"I would not recommend this book. It is claims to be non-fiction but it doesn't seem authentic. While I am sure her life story is fascinating, this book definitely is not interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desert weed","review":"The premise is outstanding. In reality, this story was like flipping through a magazine on a bus while awaiting to get off at the next stop. \\"Not fleshed out\\" is how a literary agent would probably put it. Remarkable, but topical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting.","review":"It naturally just goes to your heart. The language is simple and honest, so you can read the book in a day or two. Her story was just remarkable and the book was well-written. People should be made aware of FGM and its effects. They should know that it exists. I particularly liked the way she ended the book. She says that if the existance of FGM has any meaningful explanation, maybe she would think twice about denouncing it...but this practice has no significant reason to exist what so ever! There were, however, too many \\"In Africa...\\" generalizations in the book. FGM is not ubiquitous in Africa, in fact, most Africans don't even know that it's there. It is just concentrated mainly in East African countries like Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Djibouti, and some areas in West Africa like Mali for example. I loved the book. Everyone should read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"read INFIDEL instead","review":"I had read Infidel by Aayan Hirsi Ali and loved it so thought this would be similarly interesting. But whereas INFIDEL is well written and thought provoking, Desert Flower is shallow and poorly written and as others have mentioned the author seems to be quite self satisfied once she becomes glamorous in America. The two books tell a similar story but Hirsi Ali learns so much from her experience and shares with us her intellectual and emotional growth as she becomes disenchanted with Muslim fundamentalism after having tried to embrace it, whereas Waris Dirie just doesn't have as interesting a mind or at least doesn't express it. I was very very disappointed. If you read this and liked or didn't like it, I suggest you try INFIDEL, a vastly superior book on the same topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The journey was extraordinary, but . . .","review":"Surprisingly enough, the author did not have much of a story to tell. The author tells a pretty good story about her life in Somalia. Once she leaves Somalia, her life goes uphill, however the book pretty much goes straight downhill from there. Instead of a storyline that flows, she pretty much compiles some not so interesting stories into random chapters. I have never read a book that was so choppy. One chapter does not flow into the next, so it was really hard to remain interested in the book. The author was certainly blessed to make it to where she did, but her journey didn't necesarily translate that well on to paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the greatest book I've ever read!","review":"It's amazing what Waris has been trough and I really appreciate her courage to write things down. She immediately became an idol of mine. Beautiful strong woman. I now realise that I'm a very privileged woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this book!","review":"Every female on the planet should read this book.

It was a pre-release version I think. Still, it was good. It is sort of a mystery story. The main character is a reporter who is assigned to write about 9/11 and he starts to uncover clues and pieces of the official story that don't make sense. He starts out as a believer in the official government's version of events but by the end he knows the government version is bull.It is a mix of spy thriller, docudrama, buddy movie, and road movie.Overall it is worth watching, especially if you have doubts about the events of 9/11/2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing is hidden","review":"full expose on the actual mechanics of kundalini, describes different techniques and effects, especially the most useful ones for a 'modern' lifestyle, gives an overall view, further reading on specific yoga styles and techniques are suggested"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very recommended for learning Tantra Yoga","review":"To learn about the concepts and practices of Tantra, the symptoms and physiology behind the Kundalini rising, this is a book I strongly promote.

There are degrees of awakening.

This primarily involves the counter-culture of the 60s.Why specifically did the 60s yield such HUGE growth in the technology arena? Why did the most important computer advancements made to date all happen within a 8 year period (all occurring within a 5 mile radius of each other)? Read the book to find out...

But Steve Jobs is barely mentioned in this book. Steve is open about LSD being a top contributor to this life views and his creative thinking. As Apple has a market cap now larger than Micro$oft, to give Steve scant mention in this book is really dumb. Steve, along with Bill Gate$, are the major computing culture players in our world today from that era. How do you think it is that Steve was able to come up with ideas like the Apple computer? The Mac? iPod? iPad? His mind had been opened to the higher frequencies of creativity through his experiences with LSD, meditation and so on. For that the book has really failed.The rest of the book has mediocre writing. It is not really engaging, does not read like something you can't put down.

It's more like a really long magazine article."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Its Not the Right Alice\\"","review":"A nice history of the early early days of personal computing.

It can be described as a history of the personal computer (PC), at least as seen through its antecedents in the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly at Palo Alto. But it could also be described as a cultural history of technology, focused upon the turbulent Sixties. Important figures like Doug Englebart, Bill Gates, and Alan Kay who made critical contributions to the development of the PC are presented as confusingly but inextricably intertwined with names like Ken Kesey, the Grateful Dead and Stewart Brand. They share not only their presence in the maelstrom of the Sixties in California, but are part of the feed-back between counter-culture and technology labs such as SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) and the later Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center)...For a full review see Interface, Volume 5, Issue 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good reference, but a tedious read","review":"I've been wanting to read What the Doormouse said since it came out, and finally got the chance to read it this week. I was disappointed, although now I have a lot of other books & videos to dig into as a result of reading this book.Markoff's thesis, that the 1960s psychadelic subculture shaped the ideas that lead up to the first personal computers, is pretty reasonable. The parties and grassroot organizations of the day brought people together, and the dream of a \\"personal\\" computer was just another example of \\"power to the people\\". He gives plenty of facts & tales to support this angle.My biggest complaint is that the book lacks a cohesive narrative thread. I like how Fabio Rojas describes it in his review: \\"There are so many people that just appear and disappear that it's hard to keep track of them.\\" Several times, I wished I had taken the time to draw a \\"family tree\\" of the subjects, so I had some idea who they were and how they tied into everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur","review":"I've read lots of books on the biz.

Neil & Janet's story was too slow, and the events surrounding this story held little interest, maybe because Neil and Janet weren't that interesting.The Diamond King had numerous mistakes in it,which were distracting, but so did this one. Was there an editor anywhere?A man had just told Reginald that Braemoor 'is holding a ball in two days' time.' Yet in the same conversation, a moment later, Reginald says, 'There is a ball in three days' time.'I know it's trivial, but proper dialogue matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good...","review":"What a difference in this book than in The Diamond King & The Black Knave!!! Those were awesome stories but Neil's story was boring. Even the plot was nowhere near as intriguing or interesting as the other books. Come to think of it, there wasn't really much of a plot at all. If Neil had been a stronger hero maybe he could have carried off this subtle, slow story, but unfortunately, he wasn't. And Janet lacked enough personality to make it work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Quite Measure Up to Black Knave & Diamond King","review":"Neil Forbes was a decent, handsome, and tortured man, but he wasn't nearly as interesting as Rory Forbes or Alex Leslie.

The fifth track, Satisfy Suzie, is particularly compelling. Live-Attack of the Killer V could be an outstanding cd. The single but great big problem with Live-Attack of the Killer V is that THE CD IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF REMASTERING. Such remastering would much more clearly accentuate and separate every note, tone, vocal, and guitar part in each and every song so that the listener would be riveted to the music while the cd is playing. As it currently stands, without remastering, all parts of each song on Live-Attack of the Killer V sound fuzzy, far away, and not clearly separated from one another.

It's marked by superb writing and acting by a top-class cast. The dialogue is witty but some of the non-verbal gags are just as good, Fonda gives a nice performance as the heir to a brewing fortune who falls in love with a gold digger and card shark on an ocean voyage. He's very understated but managed to pull off his many pratfalls with great virtuosity. But Stanwyck steals the picture as the world-weary lass who finds herself falling in love with him. One scene where Fonda is trying to propose and a horse keeps nuzzling up against him pushing him aside is priceless.They sure don't make them like this any more - romantic comedy about grownups for grownups."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Preston's masterpieces","review":"I'm a devout Preston Sturges fan -- I love all his films, especially \\"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek\\" and \\"Christmas in July\\" -- his films have no villains -- plot complications arise from misunderstandings, almost never from deliberate villainy or cruelty -- however, in \\"The Lady Eve\\" the scene on the honeymoon train trip when Stanwyck humiliates Fonda makes me squirm a bit -- she wants to get revenge and teach him a lesson, but the cruel way she does it is unusual for a Sturges film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now Playing In Satan's Multiplex ---","review":"The most tortuously unfunny comedy before the advent of Jerry Lewis. Henry Fonda proves that he has absolutely no sense of comedy whatever. Not a single laugh to be had in this monstrosity, which has somehow gained classic status. A complete and total waste of time. Watch The Palm Beach Story to see what Preston Sturges could do when he was rolling. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbara Stanwyck is absolutely hilarious","review":"Barbara Stanwyck - oftentimes playing the driven, hardcore type, certainly had flawless comedic timing. The Lady Eve, along with Christmas in Connecticut and Ball of Fire, showcase her more than versatile comedic talent (she even delivers perfectly timed one liners in Lady of Burlesque). The Lady Eve smacks of Bringing Up Baby, but Barbara hands down takes this film to a much different level.

Her clothes are beautiful in the movie too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Romantic Comedy","review":"Barbara Stanwyck is at her comedic best in \\"The Lady Eve,\\" playing a vamp who tries to con a gullible heir, played by Henry Fonda. Her plans hit a snag, though, when she finds herself falling for him, which leads to some madcap fun. Directed and co-written by the peerless Preston Sturges (\\"Sullivan's Travels\\"), \\"The Lady Eve\\" is among the finest of Hollywood 1940's romantic comedies. The script is quite brilliant (the movie received only one Oscar nomination, for its screenplay, which it lost to \\"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\\") and delivers some genuine laughs. In addition, the tinge of bitterness and cynicism that characterizes Sturges' work is here -- this movie isn't a sickly sweet romance. Sturges also manages to create a wacky screen couple and then make them seem believable; a formidable task. Finally, Fonda has never been better; his all-American looks and blank visage are put to perfect use to convey the innocence required for the role. Overall, a highly recommended film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy Meets Girl","review":"The 1930's and 1940's were the hay days of the innocent screwball comedy and the \`king of the hill' director of many of them was one Preston Sturgis. The Lady Eve represents one of his better efforts. The plot line is fairly simple- boy meets girl, magic, a little plot twist where things go topsy-turvy, a little emotional reverse twist and in the end boy gets girl, girl gets boy. It is the way that this is done that makes this film above the run of the mill manifestations of this theme. Barbara Stanwyck is steamy as \`gold digger' /Lady Eve. Henry Fonda is, well Henry Fonda, the boy next door, if your neighbor is Rockefeller. The gags and gaffs roll right along. If you like your humor dark stay away. If you like your humor and romance light, and you want to know what helped people through the Depression and World War II on the screen, watch on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece of Comedy","review":"As the masterpiece of comedy, people always remember Bringing Up Baby, but The Lady Eve follows the style.

Fleming's writing itself is superb as ever, but the plot here is weak, as though he is making it up as he goes along. Particularly bad is the scene with Honey and Bond half way through the novel, which is really corny.

Ian Fleming's Bond is not as dashing as Sean Connery and bears no resemblance to Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. I think Daniel Craig really captures the spirit of Bond as does Connery, of course.The unforgettable characters of James Bond, Honeychile Ryder, Dr. No, M strike a cord that reminds me of the Sherlock Holme stories. The fast-moving action weaves in important themes such as power and friendship and loyalty.

Later, some other luminaries appear, but the strength of the collection is the depth of arguments by not-so famous authors. Also, the volume breaks globalization into it's political, economic, technological, and cultural aspects, something that seemingly perplexes most people, because their arguments pass too quickly and easily between all of them. There is so much here to read, but, perhaps, some more information for more reading would be useful. This book provides a useful start for those looking for an interesting and rigorous look at what can become an empty slogan at dinner-parties and coffee breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good beginning that slowly grinds its way through.","review":"I like Dallas Schulze, but this story left me wanting more. The main characters didn't really know each other but for a few weeks and the marriage didn't happen until about three-quarters of the way through the book. The heroine's family seemed a bit one-dimensional; the sister was a witch in tight jeans and the mother was a flake, but the author never really gets into what shaped their personalities. The synopis alludes to the hero needing a wife in order to inherit and meddling relatives, but the story wasn't really like that and the love scene was non-existent. I'll continue to read Dallas Schulze, but if you like a good marriage-of-convenience book, try THE VOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had great start but that last 100 pages were terrible !","review":"This book takes place in a small town in modern day Wyoming. The romance between Maggie and Ryan and sweet but was very dissatisfying. Maggie has very low self-esteem and Ryan is just lost even when he finds Maggie. I would not recommend this book it had a good start but it just didn't have a spark. I would suggest books by Kate Angell, Ellen Byerrum, Elin Hilderbrand, and Marlys Millhiser instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing story----not Ms. Schulze's best work!!!","review":"This story had potential. However, the story line dragged on forever. This is not Ms. Schulze's best work, and she is capable of very good work. If you want to read a great story by Ms. Schulze then read a A Very Convenient Marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Dallas Schulze's new book, The Marriage.","review":"I'm normally a big fan of Dallas Schulze, but I must say I was somewhat disappointed with The Marriage. I've always enjoyed her books because she always emphasizes character development, creating people with personalities that jump off the page. The Marriage seemed quickly thrown together. Both Ryan Lassiter and Maggie Drummond, who supposedly fall in love without ever getting to know eachother, lack the depth of Shulze's usual characater's. The believability level is low. The couple meets two or three times, shares one kiss, then ends up married. There is little if any struggle to make their marriage work, and we are expected to believe that, although the two haven't learned anything about one another, they fall in love. I'm sorry to say I cannot reccommend this book, since I have always enjoyed Dallas Shulze's novels. I certainly hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but protective","review":"I wanted as small a case as possible, not to smooth so as not to slip out of my hand, with one small compartment to fit a set of earbuds. Oh, and a removable belt clip would be good. This was one case that definitely satisfied those requirements. It won't let you see the screen but, as long as you don't need to control playback all the time, this will be very practical."},{"rating":"2","title":"I THINK THAT THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK ON MOOD DISORDERS.","review":"It was published in 1997 so it isn't the most recent of books however it is a good resourse. I didn't find it to \\"techy\\" to read. Also it is so important to understand your illness that if you run across concepts or words that you aren't familier with it is really important to familierize yourself with them for your own knowledge. Knowledge is power in managing your own health (and your own healthcare)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic - worth owning","review":"This is a nice little book on bipolar illness that won't choke you to death with scientific terminology or bore you silly. It's cheap and it won't take you months to read. Make it part of your library! Dr. Fieve opened the door for many people to take control of their lives and their healing. There are newer and more technical books available, but this one it very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic and dull--read An Unquiet Mind","review":"I found this book to be simplistic for anyone who had any knowledge of bipolar illness. Lithium is not the answer for every moodswing, as the author contends. Read other material and save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of its era...","review":"This is my first Dexter CD, and I have wanted it for several years. The 38 minutes on here are well-spent, and they impress more with each listen. Still, there are CD's from the same period by John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Paul Desmond, Stan Getz, Gene Ammons, Sonny Stitt, and Art Pepper in my collection that I like just as much if not a little more. \\"Go!\\" is often considered to be Dexter's best, and perhaps it is in the top 25 saxophone releases of the early '60's, but that was an era of jazz giants on that family of instruments, so the competition is fierce for the \\"very best albums\\" list. My favorite of the six tracks on here would be \\"I Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry\\" a lovely ballad seldom given a jazz instrumental treatment. Dexter's friends on this disc, Sonny Clark on the piano, Butch Warren on bass and Billy Higgins on drums really add a lot to the enjoyment here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent product","review":"Marti Michell products are excellent. I am making a Jenny Haskins quilt and tried another brand and it flopped, big time so I bought these and wow, what a wonderful difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate these rollers!!","review":"I can't stand this set. First - it's huge (my fault for underestimating its size). Second - the rollers are so heavy that they fall out of my hair as soon as i move or breathe! The clips that come with it are cumbersome, and leave marks in my hair. This was meant to be a stay at home set. What I'm really looking for is a 6-roller set, like an old Clairol, with velvet flocking, that was compact, stayed in my hair when used, and gave a great set. Oh yes, and with dual voltage for travel. That doesn't seem like it's asking too much. Manufacturers - anyone listening?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy construction. Bad design.","review":"I had read another person's comments about how easily the lid cracked and that is so right. The clips just cannot be arranged to store evenly, and, after finally giving up on trying, the lid just snapped when I tried to close it over the rollers and clips. The unit is, also, quite large and takes up more space than any other hot rollers I've owned. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me want to saddle up and go hiking","review":"The Continental Divide Trail didn't exist when the author took off from the boot hill of New Mexico and headed for Canada. The story is of the land, the people who he meets, but especially his reaction to all of it. There were places I'd been at one time or another and he was faithful to them in his descriptions. It did seem like he ran out of gas (words) when he got to Montana. It was like he breezed through there with very few recollections compared to New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. The author being from England gave a different perspective to the writing, giving an idea of what he thought of the United States and its peoples. For the most part, except for Sula, Montana (I'm not telling you, you'll have to read it), he enjoyed the people and the country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even interesting","review":"Schumann's symphonies are delicate things, as their raison d'etre is easily lost and then they become superfluous. That's what has happened here. It probably was not Harnoncourt's intention, but it sounds like he's conducting Schumann as if it were Beethoven.Where is Schumann in these recordings? Where is the romantic lyricism? Not here. This simply is not Schumann, and even then, i don't think the music works like this but sounds like 3rd rate Beethoven.This a shame. Harnoncourt's recordings of many Haydn symphonies are incredible - my favourites - and his Beethoven cycle is not only interesting but musically wonderful. But Schumann's sensitive romanticism eludes his grasp.Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"Great stuff. As much as I have enjoyed Harnoncourt's interpretations in the past, I was surprised at how much liked this set. In addition to the usual pleasant surprise of his ur text scoring and performance, the playing and sound of the COE is fresh and bright. This is a welcome companion to the Szell and Kubelik recordings I have loved for so long. I should say though that I have based this review on the recordings of the Warner Classics (nee Teldec) box set B000PKG52C which is sadly of out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"States the obvious; misses the less-obvious","review":"This 125-page commentary on Ralph Ellison's \\"Invisible Man\\" was written in 1988 by an English professor at McGill. Its points (except those quoted from other sources) are all obvious and it sometimes descends to the level of summary. It also dismisses every extreme point of view presented in the novel by saying that \\"we\\", of course, know that lack of moderation is silly: no argument or engagement is required. A very poor work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Blues Rock from the late 60's","review":"This is a very good rock/blues album from the end of the 60's.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"$ave Your Money","review":"Although, I took a chance and purchased this maxi, it wasnt one of my better decisions. Yea, she's cute and has a good voice, but the cover of this song this time around doesnt hold anything compared to the Kurtis Mantronik feat. Chamonix(Vocals by Mirem Grey) -How Did You Know.Here's my advice pick up a copy on Amazon.co.uk. Spend a few extra bucks and get a good version and don't waste your time with the cover by Mynt feat. Kim Sozzi. or get the digital versions available now in the Amazon MP3 Store. I have the Kurtis Mantronik version and it's GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"Some purists criticize Sandburg, but he tells a good story and has something to back him up even if his standards are looser than those used by some historians. This book's supplementary collection of correspondence from acquaintances of young Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln is valuable. Noted scholar Paul Angle collaborated with Sandburg on this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"straight, no chaser","review":"An excellent live recording from the fabled Lighthouse club. Expect intrumental prowess and straight ahead jazz with no extras. After all this was the JAZZ Crusaders, before they dropped the first word in their name and became more of a funk-jazz hybrid in the 70s. I love that period too, but this 1966 recording is quite different from the band's sound that evolved the following decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot.","review":"I bought this CD after seeing Saffire live at the 2001 Mississippi Valley Blues Festival. Their set was dynamic, musically interesting and great fun to watch. However, this early recording fails to capture any of that excitement. There are too many tunes that sound too much alike. It's mostly one groove: uninspired blues riffs with not much going on lyrically except for repetitious sexual double entendres that aren't quite funny enough. I actually fell asleep listening to this. Save your money for a live performance or a more recent CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"hot woman blues","review":"got this cd for my wife,now shes got the upitty blues attitude,a must have for any woman over you know better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Saffire!","review":"Saffire is a wonderful blues group. Many, if not most, of the songs have been written by Gaye Adegbalola. Like any good blues, they range from incisive social commentary to just plain fun.A must for any blues fan, and particularly for women who love the blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Mie oh my!","review":"There's not much to be said about this set except that it is truly awful and worth every penny. The skits can be ignored, but the musical numbers are sheer brilliance. The disco version of '42nd Street' done by Donny Osmond and the girls is captivating. The best part of it all is the canned applause: shouts of approval and deafening clapping are heard, but, mysteriously, the audience in view is sitting quite still. It doesn't get better than that. Maybe it does when Bert Parks forgets to start lip-synching with a number from 'Mack and Mabel.' This is too good for words. Buy it and make everyone you know watch it. Learn from it. Embrace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"I actually really enjoyed this show (it was only a summer replacement series). But I'll be darned if I'll pay a rare books price for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst variety show mankind has ever known","review":"NBC, in its non-glory days, produced this, the worst piece of variety show garbage in television history. No wonder the variety show went the way of the do-do. Pink Lady may have been great in their day, but they should have kept their distance from television, let alone a network lingering at the bottom of the ratings barrel at the time. The only good thing about this show was Jeff, the only saving grace of this forgettable piece of TV history. Save your money...stay away from this piece of poisoned sukyaki."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Hey, I love watching bad TV. I loved The Brady Bunch Variety Hour, I'll waste the occasional afternoon watching everything from Kroft Supershow to Diff'rent Strokes to Saved By The Bell. But I found this to be uninteresting and unwatchable.Jeff Altman's impression-based comedy is stale and uninspired, which I suppose is the point, but that only makes it sadder because he as a comic, unlike Donny and Marie, or the Brady Bunch actors, should've known better.If you love bad TV and 70's Variety Shows, pick up The Brady Bunch Variety Hour or the Kroft Supershow box set, and don't waste your money on this.

In true form, the band just \\"feels\\" each other as they move along effortlessly from song to song. Nowhere is this more evident than on side 2,when, after a beautiful 14 minute Jerry-fest on Eyes of the World, the song softly leads you into the opening chill-inducing chords of Wharf Rat, where Garcia takes it up another notch. And just when you thought they couldn't keep going, the music never stops. And you're then taken to Terrapin Station. Just an amazing 3-song medley as good as any in rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Live Dead","review":"This is truly some of the best Live Dead I've ever encountered, and seeing how the only volume I've heard better is my favorite volume of Dick's Picks- vol. 6(the best disc of which is 2), and vol. 4 being ranked the best overall, I'm also going out on a limb and saying that for the most part the Dick's picks went downhill after the erlier volumes. 've heard later ones that weren't worth buying, yet these earlier volumes have proved excellent time after time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Dead CD I own, and I own a lot!","review":"This is hands down the best Dead CD I own (I own a lot, albeit not all!). It showcases improvisational / creative force, juxtaposed with professional rigor. Although I always liked seeing a show, the band wasn't always in professionally rigorous form. When they were, when they were hitting on all pins, it really was magical. The problem with live recordings is that they sometimes aren't professional quality, and the problem with studio recordings is that they aren't nearly as improvisational. This albumn has both, which is why I feel it is the best Dead CD I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dicks Picks Volume 3","review":"I bought the cd used from Starlight Records. The disc is in good shape. It was shipped promptly even during the busy X-Mas season. I love those shows from 1977.

I bought it when it was released however many yrs ago b/c the setlist looked pretty tight. However, there is just something about late-70's era Dead that doesn't measure up on the whole to previous phases in my mind. The music seems flaccid and lifeless during this show. I was hoping to get good versions of Estimated Prophet and the Terrapin suite to replace my old hissy concert tapes, but both cuts on this CD are pretty weak. I listened to it a couple of times and then put it back on my shelf, opting instead to return to my tapes. Bottom line: this is a good show to hold onto for posterity if you tend to be a completist like myself, however it can't touch some of the better Dick's Picks releases (i.e. VIII)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not receive the program","review":"The product might have been good if I would have received the product to try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!!","review":"It was one of the best live INXS concerts ever and one of their last ones with Michael Hutchence as the lead singer.

To watch such a superstar as Michael, literaly on the road to ruin was sad. His voice was shakey, his antics on stage were awful...it was like he didnt care or didnt know where he was. Sure, in the past he got crazy, but this was just very uncomfortable to watch..the audio was terrible and sometimes it sounded like a jumbled mess. Michael was a beautiful and very talented man being chased by too many deamons, including that witch Paula. I dont think i can re-watch this concert like i do Live Baby Live, its to painful.

This is just terrible. these guys were sort of innovators in the beginning, but the problem is that music caught up and surpassed them by a long way.

Take some 5th grade guitar player rock riffs mix it with cheesy monophonic keyboard lines and you pretty much have trans am. At the end of their \\"rock\\" songs, they always pick one chord and just play it until you want to shoot yourself. The vocals are god awful, and the production is weak. I have no idea why the other people gave such good reviews of this record, they must be their friends or something.Trans Am are a one trick pony that got lucky.No sir, I don't like it.

No, she's not that weird, but at times her type of Jazz can be rather abstract, repetitive, or strong on the keys. One musical reviewer terms her as a Post-Bop, which I disagree. What really makes her music interesting & especially this CD is her multi styles that fade in & out of mainstream melodies.

The problem with this book is, it is very hard to understand the majority of the time. It is as though the only thing the author wanted to demystify was the title. I am an intelligent person who has read many a book on BPD, and there were many times I was confused and didnt feel at all like someone was helping me to understand something. Whatever good you get out of it is overshadowed by how hard it is trying to understand his medical jargon. Extremely complicated prose makes me wish I would have spent my money on something that would have been more helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"BPD Truly \\"Demystified\\"","review":"Thank God for Dr. Friedel's compassionate, informational, and helpful book. Finally a book to replace \\"I Hate You...\\" which is outdated. I suffer from BPD and am just now coming to terms with the illness. I am a mental health professional who has been used to all the \\"inside\\" jokes about BPD. I have been terrified of the diagnosis but can no longer reject it. This book has taught me that I am not alone, and that I am not a big freak. Everything I experience (and that those in my life experience with me) is real. It is full of information about treatment and is also full of acceptance and hope. Of any book that I would recommend for both professionals and persons with BPD, THIS would be the one!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable, helpful, hopeful!","review":"As a person living with BPD, I cannot express adequately my relief, gratitude and newfound hope upon reading this remarkable book.

I think it's really terrific that there are finally some new meds to help! Very accessible language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authoritative Book On BPD","review":"This is an excellent book on BPD written by a genuine expert on the subject - not some self-appointed guru.The book begins by defining what BPD is and how it is diagnosed. A table of diagnostic criteria is provided. The book then ventures into the history and causes of BPD. It then gets a little \\"academic\\" with chapters on the mechanism of the disease. This part will prove very intersting to curious readers who want all the details. For the easy readers, it may seem a bit wordy and technical. The best thing about this book is that it only gives the readers the facts.The final chapters deal with the key elements of treatment, medications and therapy. The book ends on a positive note with plenty of advice on how to cope if a loved one suffers from BPD. Not too much specifics on coping with BPD, but definitely good recommendations for positive paths and directions to take."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Buddy Rich!

Super tight playing by the ensemble, great charts, and of course...an outstanding performance by the greatest drummer of all time. A couple of highlights...1). The opener, \\"Norweign Wood\\" is a very hip take on the Beatles classic. This tune was an oft requested number for all of Buddy's subsequent bands when performing live. A great version is captured here. 2). Buddy's then 12 year daughter provides vocals for the then popular Sonny and Cher hit, \\"The Beat Goes On\\". She does great, supported by a very hip arrangement.Great solo action on all charts from across the band.This CD is a must for all Buddy fans, or Lovers of non-dance big band music in general. Check out all the other titles available from Pacific Jazz capturing different iterations of this same band thru the late 60's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well rounded book","review":"The only reason this book did not recieve 5 stars is because it has some dated meaterial in the text.

I am sure colored photos was not practical for such a large book...."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely Bi-Continental Historical Romance.....","review":"Heartwarming romance with a hero and heroine who are good people-no courtesans or rakes here-just two decent people who've been hurt in the past and must learn to love and trust.The story starts in England, travels to America, spends a great deal onboard a ship, to finally end back in England. Mild bedroom scenes, a formulaic but interesting mystery, and lot's of familiar relationships abound.If you are a fan of \\"nicer\\" or Christian romances, but without the religious aspect, then you'll enjoy this book.4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rugbuddy","review":"I bought this rug heater to help with keeping a more constant heat in my poorly insulated living room. The first week I had it the temperature outside was in the 30's, which meant that without heat, my house was getting down into the 30's and 40's. The rugbuddy alone didn't seem to make a dent on the low temperatures inside, but used with a small space heater (oil radiator), the room heats up noticeably faster and stays warm with the space heater on a lower setting. Now the temperatures outside are in the 40's and 50's and the rugbuddy alone does a great job in maintaining a comfortable temperature inside.As other reviewers have noted, the rugbuddy is a favorite of my cats and my 3 year old daughter.

It seems to work just fine.Before taking a trip, we unplug it. I called the company and they said that is a good idea.It's truly a nice luxury!3/20/11 : Just replaced the batteries in the remote and couldn't get it to work.

It depicts life in Chicago during prohibition and the violent times in which Capone lived in very accurately. It has a lot of violence, as you might expect from this type of story. Some strong language and nudity. It is definitely an R Rated movie.The movie has a long list of established actors and a very young Sylvester Stallone in one of his first roles. He portrays Capone's right hand man, Frank Nitti.I was fortunate enough to get a DVD copy made in Portugal since the studio has not yet made this film available in DVD format in the U.S. The Portuguese version is flawless and is Region 0 which plays on all DVD players. I recommend it. It is in English. Only the cover is in Portuguese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capone","review":"This is one of Sylvester Stallone's early movies and a very good film about Al Capone. The one I bought is written in portugese on the cover, but the spoken language is in english/spanish or portugese, your choice. So, it's not a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Frank","review":"This is when Frank was at the top of his game, and he sings with a hot jazz quartet. He doesn't need to add little twists as he did when older and his voice was fading. He just shows his true power as a singer. It makes your heart beat faster. It's the best Sinatra album I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Almost,and a real Sinatra experience.","review":"This is an excellent concert.One reviewer wrote that the sound was unacceptable but I found it very OK. Frank was in excellent voice and very relaxed and delivered with each song. This was Melbourne and we had no world class venues at that time. So considering this history and having just listened to it I want to recommend it for being so relaxed and with Frank sounding fresh and on form. Not one bad song and the audience love him. I now live here in the US and I really appreciate that this CD has been released. Hmmmmmmm! I purchased 'used'. Very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinatra and Norvo","review":"This CD contains a lot of great singing (and ring-a-ding-a-dinging) by Sinatra at the peak of his powers, the only problem is that, in spite of all his qualities, he simply did not posess the true sense of \\"swing\\". Sinatra's rhythmical qualities did not extend to the area of jazz rhythms. His efforts to interact with Norvo therefore fail where Norvo's band doesn't conform to Sinatra's style.Nevertheless, all Sinatra fans are advised to buy this; even I who prefer jazz to Sinatra get a kick from this vibrant CD (check out \\"On the road to Mandalay\\" with an Australian big band - it's my favorite number from this album)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Francis in a sand storm","review":"If you ever wanted to hear Frank sing in a sand storm, this is your opportunity.

I was shopping one day, after her murder, when I was shocked to see this book covering the checkout shelves. I decided to read it to see what they had to say about the generous, intelligent, sweet girl that I had known. Well, sad to say, I was disappointed. Mrs. Weinstein, and Mrs. Wilson advertise themselves as being truthful, but I was horrified by some of the things that they had to say about Tina. Tina was a good girl that made a terrible mistake, and I understand that. Unfortunatly, Mrs. Weinstein and Mrs. Wilson never knew Tina, and instead of writing the truth, they took what they knew and twisted it into a book that would sell. I think they forget that there are people out there that knew Tina, and loved her.

Selznick was - the genius behind \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and many other immortal films. Both as a senior honcho at MGM (he was married for many years to Louis B. Mayer's daughter before moving on to actress Jennifer Jones) and as an independent producer, he was truly one of the towering figures of Hollywood's \\"Golden Age\\". Ronald Haver has done a superb job of not only writing a biography of Selznick (not only in words, but in images as well), but in assembling a breathtaking collection of photographs and images of the master's works. As other reviewers have suggested, the first edition of this book (which I'm fortunate enough to own) is the one for collectors to get because of its superior production values, but _any_ edition of this book is well worth getting. A key reference work on the height of the \\"studio era\\" and a first-rate coffee-table book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selznicks Hollywood","review":"This book arrived early and in great condition.

This was a BORING book. I could barely get through the first half of the book, it picked up a little bit after that, but not much. One of the main characters, Elise, seemed stupid to me. Trying to escape with a screaming child? Excuse me, but it seems like common sense to shut the child up and then run. I was surprised that the author, Judith Pella, was a bestselling athor. Because this is definitly not one of my favorites. Then I thought maybe this was one of her not so great books, I mean all authors have those. But after reading all of these reviews, I'm not quite sure. The author ended the book too quickly.

Benjamin Sinclair, a self-righteous and condeming preacher who feels called to ministry in Texas immediately deems her lower than the low.

There is no fancy equipment that you need nor do you have to go to a gym and find a particular machine to use. Dr. Seabourne also demonstrates a wide array of exercises. I cannot stress the diversity of exercises he offers in this book. The tips that Dr. Seabourne provides are invaluable. He offers imagery tips, relaxation methods, plyometric drills, weight training drills, the whole 9 yards. I am indebted to Dr. Seabourne for the information he has provided through this book. If I had one complaint it would be in the ordering of the photographs, they can be hard to follow from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on ARGs","review":"This is Not a Game is an interesting take on the ARG/Transmedia genre's early years (1999-2005ish) from the perspective of a player turned independent ARG designer.

The author provides so much info, it becomes almost impossible to remember all of it without reading the book several times. ( I read it at least 4 times ). Also, some of the information is quite outdated and might not be useful at this time. Overall this is a very good book , but needs to be revised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thorobred horse racing reference.","review":"I, like another reviewer, bought the original 1966 edition of this book. I recently checked out the 1988 edition in the library and reread it. It is still a valuable book particularly when many horseplayers are getting away from a comprehensive method of handicapping and relying too much on Beyer figures. Ainslie, as in earlier editions, is still biased towards New York and East Coast tracks. But, if you want to get serious about playing the horses, consider using this book as a starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go wrong with L.C. and the Nightcats","review":"To the reviewer who knocked this release for only having two worthwhile tracks: SHUT UP! You don't have a clue, pal! This is an excellent CD. All of Little Charlie's releases are great, and this is no exception. My personal favorite on \\"Captured Live\\" is \\"Smart Like Einstein\\". For me, there are a couple of tunes that aren't all that great, but overall it is just fine. Don't pay any attention to the editorial review, that guy is a bonehead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES! YES! YES! A MUST FOR PERCUSSIONISTS!!","review":"This is a must for any aspiring percussionist. Alex Acuna has traveled all over the world and demonstrates so many rhythms that make the world what it is today. If you're looking into doing Afro-Cuban, African, etc. THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!! This is also great for other musicians. Acuna really dives into the group aspect of it and the feeling of the music, but his direction is definitely geared towards percussionists!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a great album that shows many improvements upon a solid foundation found in previous album Epic Defiance.

But then it left a bad taste in my mouth. This character is supposed to be a practicing Roman Catholic, but she's spent 20 years in an adulterous affair, hoping that the marriage (admittedly a bad one) breaks up. Of course, that wouldn't leave him free to marry in the Church. And lest you think the author only thinks Catholics don't care about marriage vows, her staunchly Presbyterian, liquor only for the sick, employee, several criticizes her for giving up on the married for someone who is at least divorced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse video seen","review":"after watching the fist three video i had to stop the audio and video quality are horrible poorly made as a salsa loverand purchaser this is by far the worst video i seen.RLD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible changes to a good storyline","review":"The storyline of this movie is not anything close to the story of the Illiad.

Most performances were over the top - it's a wonder any scenery was left after this bunch got through chewing it. With the exception of Mr. O'Toole and Ms. Christie (both alumni of David Lean directed epic films and both of whom had very brief moments of dialogue/monologue), the other actors could have used a circus ringmaster to keep them in line.To use the most improper English I can - \\"Troy\\" ain't no \\"Lawrence Of Arabia\\" and Wolfgang Petersen t'ain't no David Lean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Forgettable Epic","review":"This is not a great film, it is far too long, and it is just about void of any great acting. If I had to choose \\"Best Actor\\" for this film, it would be Eric Bana. Really an excellent job considering the script he had to work with. Apart from that, the other actors would have been just as convincing if they were on a Greek stage holding dramatic masks to their faces. It seemed Brad Pitt was always trying to act but just couldn't jive with the character. I actually wanted to laugh at some parts, such as when he was \\"acting\\" angry while calling Hector out to fight. Terrible. Peter O'Toole, though once a great actor, is just too old, and I hate to say that. I sincerely believe that Brad Pitt and Peter O'Toole were recruited because the producers wanted some \\"big name\\" appeal. Shame. To set the record straight, I do not dislike Brad Pitt. I thought he was great in \\"Fight Club\\" and other films. But perhaps he should avoid the epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"ripped off","review":"this was a total rip off. all of the extra merchandise was present in this collector's edition box set, but the product itself was missing!!! in other words, the two dvd's were not anywhere to be found!!! i found out that it would cost about as much to send the set back as what i had paid in the first place, so i decided to just keep it for the movie memorabilia. i blame the seller, Big Apple distributors of New York inc., though, and not amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the ticket price but not the Oscar","review":"Well let's put it this way, the initial battle scenes were excellent..especially achilles landing on the trojan beach plus the first battle introducing his character. But like one reviewer said, he's too american...good looking, womanizing, brooding half the time etc. The star of the show according to me was Hector, loving husband, brother, filial son, great warrior etc. The only criticism i had was that the audience would have failed to see the attraction between Paris and Helen, not enough development there. But then again who cares? What the people pay to see was Brad's charisma onscreen(and hot bod) and Eric Bana salsaing with their weapons outside the gates of Troy. Bonus points to Brian Cox playing the \\"king of kings\\", nasty specimen...cruel, ambitious, scheming, back-stabbing. In every movie, a great hero must always be matched by a devious villain. Agamemnon was good enough for me. In all a great summer movie but it won't win u any prizes, Cheerz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Troy was not what it was craked up 2 be!!!!!!","review":"Were did it all go wrong? Well it started with the trailors, the distributors made the movie out to be an action packed EPIC.However when I saw TROY on the 15 i was highly dissapointed. The story line was badly developed, the action scenes were few and laked the most important ingrediante ACTION.For me all TROY seemed to be about was Brad getting naked every 10 seconds.wolfgang needs to be ashamed of blowing his own trumpet. He had made such a big deal that Troy was going to have better action and gaphics then LOTR!That was a big mistake it didn't even come close!!!!Though i do dislike this movie im sure that others do, but if you got bord with Gladiator Do Not give Troy a single glance.Angry LOTR Fan SB Sim"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Overdone","review":"I enjoy historical features of any kind and am not really particular about abosolute details, after all, a movie is entertainment. THIS movie, however, had nothing that appealed to me. I definitely agree with the other reviewers that the movie lacks chemistry and the characters are flat. I'll add that the dialogue is predictable, full of cliche and lacks believability, so much so that I have currently paused the movie to read reviews to determine whether to waste the next hour watching the rest of it and return it to my rental store. I enjoy Brad Pitt in most movies, this was an insult to his ability as an actor. He looks good, though. \\"Helen\\" is a disgrace of bad acting. The battles were okay, but overdone, the diagolue overdone, the sappy-ness overdone \\"please don't fight...please...\\". By the way, I'll second the question, why does Brad Pitt have a British accent?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Lame and Slow Movie!!!!!!!","review":"Painful to watch, poorly done, you'll keep looking at your watch - could have been awesome.

Now Peter 'O Toole is the real looks in the movie. I know he's a bit older than me, it could still work out. If anyone else is a Peter fan, you know what i mean. What a sexy beast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"Achilles\\" ...or The Brad Pitt epic","review":"I was so sick of Brad Pitt's puffy face by the end of this movie. He was in practically every scene and it really ruined the movie for me. The story wasn't developed enough, Branna's part as Hector was fabulous and his portrayal was fabulous. Orlando Bloom's character Paris was downright cowardly, foppish and almost dislikable.I really felt the part of Achilles was badly played, and it was very hard to believe Brad Pitt was this great warrior. He's just not the type. He was too small and not believable at all that he could be beating all those men.See another epic, see Gladiator or even Braveheart, over this. I hope it does not kill Branna's career."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame","review":"I can understand film makers cared nothing about Homer's Illiad and changed everything, even the unbearable gay relationship between Aquiles and Patroclus, which was ok 4,000 years ago but they had to hide it now a days, who knows why.What I cannot understand, even trying hard to, is the appearence of those llamas walking along over the soil of ancient Thesalia.Wasnt America be found on 1492 and so llamas and other american animals?Make a joke of Homer, who maybe created all these Troy stuff, but guys, not of history and geography!!If Homer Illiad is too hard for you to read, at least watch some on the discovery channel, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"total joto","review":"good movie except for brad pitt, he is a total joto he couldnt even kill a fly nevermind another human being his character was not believeable at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I realize its not historically accurate--but the fight scenes are great and the glory and the struggles of the characters comes through.

I have watched it at least 25 times already and I could watch it another 25 times. Eric Bana should have received an academy award for his performance.

Brad was OK but Eric was the Best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"open your mind","review":"I don't get why people nowadays say they hate a movie just because it was popular and a big blockbuster. Of course its not one of the top 10 movies of all time but its The Iliad. Some people try to justify how they dont like the movie because it is 'farfetched' or 'unrealistic'. Well I'm pretty sure the Iliad was an 'epic' and achilles is an 'epic hero'. So of course when everyone thinks achilles, the strongest soldier from both armies, gets cut down by hector of course the entire battle is going to stop. My point is if you go into this movie with an open mind and in a good mood you will enjoy this movie. Its very entertaining with lots of action and I personally enjoy seeing how they portray certain famous characters. Also Brad Pitt is just a thug in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing this moving, and as always when there is to much buildup for a movie it never lives up to it. This movie was so far from the actual story, I almost got up and left. If you know anything about the history of the story of Troy, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE. Very disappointing and I would never recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The #@%* Was That?!","review":"Alright...this movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen(even worse than Rocky Horror Picture Show). The story of the movie was not true with the real Trojan War. You would think when these Big Name actors would come together, they would make one of the best movies of the summer. This was not the case...The acting was horrible. Brad Pitt's acting wasen't even fit for a children show. All The actor should appologize to every one who paid $9.00 to see this film...If you really want to see it Go. But be warned...you can trust my movie reviews. But this is just my personal thought. Go if you really want to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Brad Pitt's worst outings","review":"Terrible piece of throwaway Hollywood big epic crowd-pleaser. Drags on and on (and I just finished/enjoyed watching Lord of the Rings: Return of the King Extended Edition, so yes I have an attention span). Brad Pitt can't figure out what he is supposed to do in this movie except grease his torso or bash people. Brad Pitt CAN act -for better examples of Pitt's acting, see 12 Monkeys, Fight Club or even Legends of the Fall. An finally, this version of Troy is very, VERY loosely based on the book. \\"Based on\\" is a generous term. Hopefully, this movie will be forgotten in a few years and no one will be reading this anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mule in Horse Harness...","review":"A last-ditch attempt by Warner Bros. to squeeze a few more pennies out of an epic disappointment...and just when I had forgotten the butchery Wolftgang Peterson and his gang of Hollywood henchmen did to the Iliad. Even dressed over again, this film is a study in how to destroy a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Blu-ray is about!","review":"This format is awesome!! Take it from someone who currently own\\"s over 860 DVDs. Now of course only 40 of them are Blu-ray, but I like to think it gives me a very nice point of view. Anyway in this format the picture is much crisper! The fighting scene come to life! You can hear every sword clashing and see much more gory during the beach scene. If your a action junkie like myself, in this format you almost want to be there with a sword and shield. The director cut gives more in site to the small stuff. Lets you know why the GODS were reference so much. I love this movie in the original format...........but with the director cut BLU-RAY I'm in love!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Historical","review":"Although the movie contains some of the most popular actors, the story lacks truth. For example: Achilles never goes into Troy and dies before. Patroclus is sent to fight by Achilles. Menelaus does not die. Etc etc. Incredibly unaccurate and disappointingly so. The lines are sometimes cliched although delivered alright. Helen and Paris play minor roles. Hector is portrayed well and Bana gives a good performance. The movie doesn't compare to LOTR and is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surf's Up!","review":"Hey, Brad Pitt, the surf's up! Where's your surf board? This is what played in my mind the whole time I watched this extravaganza of mindless boredom. Pitt's pretty, with sharply defined abs and hair extensions and bronzer. But Hollywood's obsession with pretty boys, instead of real he-men, is fatally on display here. To me, Troy was a ferociously charismatic warrior--like Steve Reeves. In fact, if a theater should double-bill \\"Troy\\" along with a typical Reeves flesh-and-fur spectacle from the late fifties, the Reeves potboiler would probably be a lot more enjoyable. \\"Gladiator\\" got it right in many ways. It had Russell Crowe as the stern looking, beefy hero who looked like he had been around the block a few times. Watching Pitt, I wondered how much plastic surgery he's undergone so far?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blonde Greeks?","review":"Iknow. Everyone is tired of hearing this, but the film is not even remotely related to \\"The Illead\\". I won't go into all of the details. Read the book if you want a good story. The acting (with the exception of *sacrilage!* Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom) was decent, the battle scenes were fairly well done. The costumes were OK (that is if you like a lot of tye-dyed tunics)and the scenery (llamas in ancient Greece?) wasn't too bad. I would, however, love an explaination of why there were ancient Greek ruins in ancient Greece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone read Homer?","review":"To modern audience where the name Homer brings images of \\"d'oh\\"! destroying this centuries-old story may not matter, but to thoise of use that accually care aobut hisotroy and preserving it, and have read the story of the Trojoin war, will not be able to sit still in our seats. Now I dont want to go into detail for those of you that may not have seen it, but the movie is missing key plot points and even dares to change the end for some on the charicters!!!Now I can see the art that goes in the movie, but destroying Homer brings this movie to 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is well acted but think LOTR without the care to detail","review":"First I must say I am huge LOTR fan & mother of a 10 yr old Orlando Bloom fan, so I saw it to preview it for her. It is, sadly, not for any Orlando fan [i.e. underage}, due mostly to unnecessary naked scenes. This, to me is a huge disservice as it was, IMHO, very well acted. Eric Bana was very good, as was Pitt [who I personally don't care for & others, notably O'Toole]. I truly believe Peterson shot himself in the foot with these scenes & R rating as they were unnecessary to plot- a meaningful glance would have sufficed. The continuity was non-existant. The soundtack- obnoxious. A poor reflection of the story & a disservice to the actors who did well with what they had, although why did they all have a british accent? Aren't they Greek?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a life you lovers of Homer!!!!","review":"Rating this movie down because it does not follow Homer's classic poems about the Trojan war makes as much sense as rating down The Lord of The Rings movies because they do not follow the books. This is HOLLYWOOD people not a Greek Mythology class, and for those who love Greek Mythology and come away from this movie all teary eyed because it does not follow Homer, I say get a life. This is someone elses vision of the Trojan War not Homers. Is there some rule that says every movie has to be based strictly on the source material without deviation? I don't think so. This movie is epic in scale and works very well most of the time. Sure, they may not have all the historical facts right in regards to armor etc. but who cares really? I'm sure the producers made the changes they thought were necessary to make this picture look good on the screen. Troy may not be a classic in the terms of Gladiator or Spartacus, but it is entertaining and worth a look.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This movie was a brilliantly directed. Something I hate with Greek Mythology transformed from paper to on - screen is the horrible acting and false reperesentation/translation. There was none of that in TROY!! Brad Pitt (not my favorite) did a good job portraying the tyrant warrior ACHILLES. Eric Bana(one of my favorites) portrayed the heart of gold prince of Troy, HECTOR, just as beautifully. This movie has everything in it action, romance, tension, and suspense. If you love mythology or find it interesting and care for the DRAMATIC GENRE, THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this the movie Troy?","review":"Hard to believe but it is Troy. For me it is like watching a new movie. It seems even the picture quality has become better. Stunning sharpness and detail in every scene. I have really enjoyed this version and can only agree to the other reviews. I own the HD theatrical version, but this one is worth buying again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone want my ticket to \\"Troy?\\" Take it, it's yours!","review":"The only thing worse than the dialogue in this film is the musical score. There were a few cool action scenes, and the balls of fire was a nice visual effect, but this movie just falls flat of being the epic it should have been. The fighting and battle scenes were very poorly done and there just wasn't enough action. The trailer shows those thousands of ships sailing to Troy and you think all Hell will break lose in the film, but it's more like all heck breaks lose, and then we go back to some more bad dialogue.I didn't really see any bad acting (although Pitt hammed it up a bit too much with the delivery of some of his lines), buit it just didn't seem like the characters melded together very well. And as I said when you add in James Horner's HORRIBLE soundtrack, which felt out of place during many parts of the film, it just made for a very bad movie experience for me, and WAY too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the name of this movie???","review":"I don't think it was Troy! Why? Because it had nothing to do with the written story by Homer. Menelaus dies only because he has to be the bad guy in this movie... and there wasn't enough time to show the real death of Agamemnon, (he was killed in his bath by his own wife after returning to Greece) , so they killed him in a way they liked best. Also, Achilles (Brad Pitt) and Hector are the only ones who fight quite well. The rest just get slaughtered. But as we know from the Iliad there were also other great fighters which in this film were left at home! The only strong thing in this movie is Brad Pitts performance but he alone can't save this fiasko! The t.v. movie HELEN OF TROY is closer to the true story although its low budget and this unbelievable and unexeptable bald Achilles... Just read the book! You will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in translation.","review":"But it is supposed to be entertaining whereas The Iliad was homework. A big, flaccid, on location, away from Hollywood flop. Thanks to dvd no Brad Pitt movie ever loses money. Troy just isn't very good. Lots of 21st century guys in ancient costumes talking like 21st century guys. Brad Pitt worked out for this. He is buff & everything. He is a good actor, which is not to be confused with a very good or great actor. His legions will love it (Brad Pitt without his pants). The action & fight scenes are excellent. Production is excellent.

I thought the story and acting were very good. Even though Brad Pitt is considered the \\"star\\" of this, the other actors roles were great.If you enjoy a good mix of action, romance, and drama, then you should like Troy. I was wondering when they would release this and will definitely pick up a copy when it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Troy Directors Cut","review":"I recieved my copy of Troy and watched it last night. This version takes an already good movie and turns it into a great movie. I applaud Warner Bros for bring out their Blue Ray renditions in the originally intended directors cut. They have done this with other movies such as The Patriot, and what a difference it makes, almost like watching a whole different movie. I understand why the studios trim a movie down to allow more viewings within time constraints. The motive is ofcourse to make money which is why they're in business. But it sad when a Blue Ray DVD is actually a better movie than the theatrical release. These directors cuts ae how the director intended his movie to be seen. Troy was so much betterin Blue Ray, when you see it you'll be happy you bought it. Then you have to decide who to give your old version DVD to."},{"rating":"2","title":"alter-dimensional TROY","review":"What the world REALLY needs is a blu-ray of TROY with the Gabriel Yared score.

Inspired is a word that could not possibly be used with this complete \\"mess\\" of a movie. If there were to be an award for \\"Worst Screenplay Ever Written\\" then David Benioff should win that award - absolutely no competition need apply. The other interesting note is how the director of Das Boot has sunk this low - but not surprising since his last outing was almost as bad (The Perfect Storm). Now he has given us \\"The Perfect Mess\\" - what a waste of time, talent, energy, and money. Even Brad cannot save this movie (even though he does give it a courageous try). Ironic at best (and not even a guilty pleasure). A total loss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic.","review":"This film was given one star only because it is the lowest available. Normally I'm a big fan of Brad Pitt (as an actor), but his pathetic attempts to channel Russell Crowe in Gladiator are painful to watch. Yes, there's a lot of action, but that certainly doesn't make up for the wooden acting, not to mention the desperate grasping for that one memorable catch-phrase (\\"Is there no one else?!\\" comes to mind, among others). Bleh. Not to mention the fact that you should never try to outdo perfection; although this is an adaptation, it seems like a bad high school production. The Iliad is a masterpiece, and Pitt has only managed to mangle it with his hopes of being remembered as an \\"action hero\\". The only redeeming quality this movie has is Eric Bana's portrayal of Hector.
