I really enjoyed this play and highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't overlook this one","review":"For those fans of Soundgarden and of Grunge, particularly early Grunge -- It's tempting to believe that Soundgarden's commercial success started with Badmotorfinger, so previous CD's are only for wild acid rock aficionados. But this CD is an exception. It preceded Badmotorfinger but has sufficient great cuts to make it worth pursuing. See #1, #2, #5, #7, #10, #11."},{"rating":"2","title":"the start of something wonderful","review":"despite the raw murky production, this album still stands as one of my favorite albums ever. the rawness adds to soundgarden's sludge sound. i realize later albums had better prodcution and may seem better but this is still one killer album. the grooves and riffs the band lays down are magnificent. a mix of sabbath and local comrades the melvins make this one great trip of an album.the grittiness of grunge combined with good melody made this an amazing album. chris cornell was just begginning to spread his vocal wings and soar. the bass player back in the good ole days was hiro yamamato who along with monster drummer matt cameron laid down the tighest best grooves that ever stomped through my psyche. i was never a huge fan of kim thayil's guitar work but he does lay down some great grooves throughout their career and this album in particular is some good work. worth your time if your a fan of soundgarden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lazy for an account.... Great album","review":"This CD proves that it's louder than love and rap, I have been reading reviews about how it started the demise of 80s music, I wish I was older so I could've lived the great era of early 90s music. Playing this album in my car is fun because IMO its fun to get those rap fans looking around wondering why there is music louder than theirs.Some good songs on this album are Gun, Hands All Over, Loud Love, Get on the Sanke, and Big Dumb Sex (a song that makes fun of the 80s hair metal innuendos, I wish Chris would do the same for today's music.) Of my favorite songs Gun is great because it starts out slow, and it gets faster each second, then it goes crazy, and slows down. Buy this album, along with Badmotorfinger and Superunknown, they are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"garden of mediocraty","review":"ok so I know that sounds harsh for a review title, but it was their first album and heavily influenced by their Seattle band mates Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains. They really evolved over the course of their career. if you are accustomed to the sound of Super Unknown then buy Bad Motor Finger and Down on the Upside. However if you like this album buy Ultramega ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Excellent Sophmore Effort","review":"This album is amazing because it was the Seattle scene before there was a scene. Before bands like Soundgarden were called Grunge, a zine dubbed them Seattles sludge-rock stormtroopers; a description that is very apropros.Listening to them, I'm occasionally reminded of the slow plodding sound of the Melvins. Of course, the Melvins lack Chris Cornells brilliant voice. When he hits those high notes, it still inspires me.Compared to their later efforts, this one is obviously less polished. But its damn fine. If you want to see where Soundgarden came from, check out this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great but promising","review":"In my humble opinion, this cd is good but not great. If you like new rock, you should like it. I stick with older stuff like Led Zep or Deep Purple, they have stood the test of time.

Soundgarden being my favorite band, that makes 'Louder Than Love' one of the best albums of all time in my opinion. Songs like \\"Ugly Truth\\", \\"Loud Love\\", \\"Hands All Over\\" are classics, and even if the rest of the CD was ... (which it definetly is NOT), those tracks alone would make the album worth the money. If you're a Soundgarden fan like me and do not own this album, then there is something severely wrong with you. Buy it NOW!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Loud Ugly Power Trip.","review":"Looking back on the whole era, there were about 30 grunge albums that were more popular than this one was. Most likely because this was released before the scene exploded. But when I think of my personal favorite, it's \\"Louder Than Love\\". More than \\"Dirt\\", \\"Nevermind\\", and \\"Ten\\", to me, this is the epitome of grunge. It's a little metal, a little punk, and big, loud, and meaty. Songs like \\"Ugly Truth\\" and \\"Loud Love\\" are just mindblowing, and \\"Hands All Over\\" doesn't just rock, but preaches environmental awareness. Not every track on here is a winner, but front to back it's awesome. At least 3 of these songs are on \\"A-Sides\\", their best of album."},{"rating":"2","title":"great hard rock album","review":"Soundgarden is defenitely one of the best hard rock albums of all time. Louder than love shows how the band in its early days before the sucess of badmotordinger and superunknown.

Definetely worth listening to for any soundgarden fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baritone Buyer","review":"It was delivered less than 2weeks for the baritone to come to my house.

Besides the difficult installation on Vista (no instructions, figure it out yourself), once they are installed they randomly lose the connection, and even when they are working, the sound is staccatto and jumpy. When I'm playing my FP shooter game online, the connection will just terminate randomly. Worse, on Vista, this freezes the display and I can only get it back by <CTL><ALT><DEL> for the logoff menu.

When it is just 2 of us biking the rack works great, easy to get the bikes on and off, easy to secure the bikes, but when trying to fit 5 bikes on the rack it is difficult to make them all fit. Either the petals are hitting or the handlebars are hitting, we only managed to get 4 bikes on the rack and hauled the other one on top of our truck. Thankfully we usually go with 4 or 2 bikes when we go and it works great for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid piece of equipment","review":"This is a great product. Easy to use, sturdy and well built. Opening the truck with 5 bikes on board requires two people ... no surprise there ... five bikes are heavy!!!

Literate, humorous, and bitingly satirical, the film also gives us Helena Bonham Carter and Richard E. Grant as two rich, fascinating characters who are worth spending time with. The film is based on a story by George Orwell and like \\"1984,\\" the story covers conformity and the need for the human spirit to triumph over mindless commercialism and statism."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful song","review":"A beautiful and moving song for a worthy cause.

If so, I missed it. I only saw an attempt at a counterpart to \\"Stones\\" that didn't come off.Instead I feel battered by the message of, \\"Gosh, it's hard being German,\\" which worked in the earlier book and fell flat in this one. Hard being German in this country in WWII? Maybe. But not as hard as it was, say in WWI. Not as hard as it was being German in Germany in WWII. Or as hard as being Jewish in either country. Or black.It's not just an annoying message; it's unbearably trite, and I finished the book because I couldn't believe it wouldn't get better, while promising myself I never had to read another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"First book I read of the Author's.......","review":"This is the first book that I have read from this author and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I loved how she wrote the characters and their feelings toward every day life things that would happen to them.I was disappointed with the ending, I felt the book was very well narrated that the end left me with questions and a feeling of unfulfillment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"Having thoroughly enjoyed Stones from the River, I really looked froward to reading The Vision of Emma Blau. As I read, I kept waiting for the story to begin. It seemed that characters were always being introduced, sketched in and then relegated to the backround as yet another character stepped into the limelight. A most unsatisfying book , leaving me with the feeling that the whole thing was just an outline, and the real book has yet to be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as good as Stones From the River","review":"Ursula Hegi is a great writer and really knows how to tell a story. However, the problem with this book is that the characters, including the title character, are boring and I wasn't interested in any of them. The most intriguing character was Trudi (from Stones From the River) who was briefly mentioned somewhere in the middle. I found this a bit annoying since I felt I had already heard her story and had closure on it. I didn't want to hear it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and too dry.","review":"It took me a long time to get through this book. I bought it because it really sounded like it had promise, but the story just goes on and on and there is too little drama, too little of everything. Stefan Blau is a German immigrant to America at the age of 13. With savings from various waiter jobs and such, he manages to build a hotel (The Wasserburg) and turn it into an elaborate apartment building. He has a vision of a young girl that eventually turns out to be his granddaughter Emma, who will come to love and care for the Wasserburg and preserve it's heritage forever. But it doesn't work because that's all there is. The characters are lively enough and the story is well-written, but it's arid, with little substance. It felt very long to me and I picked it up to read off and on at random only when I was very bored. It started out as a nice idea, but I think Ursula Hegi should have added some excitement or mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Vision Of Emma Blau - audio CD version","review":"Alas, if you want to hear a book in audio - and if it is because you have limited vision then beware!. You may not be able to read the word ABRIDGED on the packet. When I finished this whirl wind account of an immigrant family covering several generations I was winded. I was confused about names and how they were related. It occurred to me when I finished why I felt so cheated. It lies in abridgment. A dirty trick to cut down on verbiage and package easier but shortchanging the listening audience greatly. It says abridged with author's agreement but...do they realize how much is lost - the seemingly unimportant parts that are cut ARE important or the author would not have written them. A good book can change not only to a mediocre one but one that is maddeningly inept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to go with Clay Textbook","review":"This book is a good book to go along with the Clay Textbook and for assessing students knowledge of print concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are great!!!","review":"The first time I really listened to this band was at one of their concerts.

The drive inside the unit is a Ricoh and the firmware on it unique to RCA, this means that any other drive that you may want to use to replace the Ricoh one with will not work. When the drive went bad the price to replace it was over three hundred dollars. The drive would no longer track on any dvd placed in the unit.

When one TV or the other is unplugged, the signal is acceptable on either TV - just a few flickering pixels. With the splitter removed, the flickering pixels disappear completely, so I suspect the splitter causes enough signal loss to cause the problems..If you need both TVs/devices working at the same time, a powered HDMI splitter is the answer, not a passive splitter like this..I can think of only one application where this splitter might actually work - where all the cables involved are very short and equal in length.

Terrible DVD","review":"Once again, a DVD producer has chosen to release a substandard product. Add \\"Pioneer\\" to the list of DVDs I will not buy. This is a VERY POOR reproduction. Some of the artifacts detract from the movie in a very strong manner. For example, the entire DVD is full of moire patterns and bad compression artifacts. Some of the aliasing and moire is so distracting that it causes ones eyes to be drawn inescapably to them. I will never buy another DVD until I have had an opportunity to view the production quality first. This is a very shoddy way for the DVD producers to treat their audience. To pay more for a DVD and then have it contain less quality than a VHS tape is, in my mind, criminal.The actual movie (story, acting, directing) is pretty good and I would give this 4 stars, but the media quality is so bad I just don't know what to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is probably the crowning achievement of Luc Besson's work.

Unlike most action movies which depend on high body counts and explosives, this movie moves carefully forward as Nikita is transformed from a drug using criminial to a controlled killer. Besides the story, I especially enjoyed the view of french culture. Parisian restaurants, apartments, and gritty streets are beautifully filmed by Besson. Most importantly, the movie contains a female lead character which contrasts Hollywood's obsession with testosterone filled actors who can never enunciate their words. Nikita is played brilliantly. In fact, Nikita hardly speaks throughout the film, yet the viewer can still observe her true character. In my opinion that is an example of brilliant film making. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original is still Best","review":"La Femme Nikita has spawned an american film version (Point of no Return-starring Bridget Fonda) and several TV series' and media, which shows the popularity of this film's character and story about a former drug addict who kills a cop during a botched robbery and gets sentenced to the death penalty. In which a secret government agency agrees to spare her life if she agrees to undergo training to become a highly skilled black ops agent. The story line might be a bit cliched in this day and age but when it first released it was an awesome movie...and still is.

The movie \\"The Killer\\" with Brigit Fonda is actually the remake of Nikita. Although B.

The soundtrack is from Eric Serra, who always can capture the essence of the movies he makes the soundtrack.

Obviously the book focuses on her time with the various Hemingways; initially mostly on Papa Hemingways last two years, especially the last full summer he spent in Spain following the top matadors, and later on about her life married to Greg Hemingway and her continued association with Mary Hemingway after Papa Hemingway's death. I enjoyed hearing her take on the many different adventures in Spain, Cuba, NYC, and Idaho and also hearing more about what happened in the years after Hemingway's death. For a semi-orphaned, young irish girl from no-where, she had a hell of an adventure and met some amazing people. The prevalence of mental illness and denial of it throughout the book is amazing.

Unlike many american products, the word 'light' in reference to soy sauce does not mean 'light' in undesirable ingredients like fat or salt.Light soy sauce actually has more salt in it that dark soy sauce.

But what I didn't realize just how good this CD is. The Gufs have grown. If you like this CD, pick up The Gufs first indy release \\"Staring into the Sun\\", listen to that, then listen to this. They are so alike, yet so different. You can definetely tell they have been touring with Matchbox 20, Jars of Clay and the Goo Goo Dolls. You can hear many influences of all of those bands in this disc.

The lyrics on this CD are more mature in content and quality than previous work. This band has been compared to early REM and others. However, the Gufs have an unmistakeable energy and a distinctive sound in a music arena that is increasingly the same. This album is likely to be the last Atlantic record if it does not produce a hit and the \\"Last Goodbye\\" has hit potential. I wish the band the utmost luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pinicle album for the group, just not promoted, very overlooked","review":"To me, this album was the culmonating achievement of The gufs. This was their second album on atlantic records, and featured (now inactive sites) hyperlink enhanced features for bonus materials, early in the days of enhanced CDs. Also, Rob Thomas of MAtchbox 20 (also an atlantic records group) helped with backing vocal on \\"give back yourself\\". Unfortunately, Atlantic dropped the ball on promoting these guys, and the just faded away. This was their last album, and Goran released a few solo songs and one album since. Then, this year they released their first album in 7 years \\"A different Sea\\", and re-recorded this album. the song names stayed the same, but lyrically some changes were made, especially in the first track \\"last goodbye\\", one of my favorites. In all, this album should have been national millions, but it was lost along the way.

To me the book is nonstop fom the moment that Sam finds herself on an alein ship to the time that you start to realize that the planet is an living entity. This is one of the first times that one of the companions (Sam) thinks that she is alone when she thinks that the Doctor has been killed. It is a very good book and one that I think every Dr. Who fan should read. It was the first time that I have seen these types of novels have a sequence.

But it is all for love.The interactions with Ed Begley and Illeana Douglas, along with Moby, are also funny.I don't know how much of this is real v. make-believe, but it is funny.

Since it took about 40 seconds for my cat to start getting into it, his actual play time was 5 seconds at a clip. Now he thinks I'm a tease.

Perhaps I got a dud, but it only runs on the hardwood floor, backs up straight, but moving forward veers to the left and runs out of steam after about 30 seconds... it takes 45 to charge it! Putting the mouse back onto the main unit to charge it is quite difficult. If it isn't aligned just exactly so, the charge light doesn't light and it won't charge.The cats LOVE it... when it works. I only gave it 2 stars because they do love it and it provides great exercise for my indoor kitties.I will definintely be looking for an alternative remote control mouse since they love it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda fun for the owner too!","review":"Wish it held a charge a little longer, but still a great little toy.

However, the charge only holds for like 2 mintues and the mouse is NOT fast as you would expect it to be. Literally just about at 2 mintues the thing starts to slow down and die. Not worth the time to re-charge and I wouldn't purchase again unless the charge lasted for much, much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micro Mouse is cute but a waste of money","review":"This product is a good idea, but poorly engineered. I purchased mine about a week ago. Mostly cons on this item. 1. Very difficult to attach the mouse to the docking unit to charge. 2. Directly out of the box, the mouse was impossible to steer. It wants to go in circles. I found the adjustment on the bottom of the mouse, but even after multiple adjustments the mouse had a mind of it's own. It will not go straight. The steering works somewhat but the mouse movements are jerky and unpredictable. 3. After a few uses, the mouse has slowed down considerably to the point where it almost will not run after a full charge. Pro...cat loves the mouse.

It concerns his childhood prior to the Great War.For the first time in the novel we meet his parents. There is sadness and humour in this section, as there has been throughout.When the scene returns to a contemporary setting the world has now realized that war is again inevitable and it is only when this will occur.More early characters die off with new and interesting ones being introduced. The core still remain however and we are treated to the arch bore, Widmerpool, dressed up in a farcical looking uniform.There is a touch of the mystical about this volume with several discussions on the spirit world, after life.This volume is comparable to volume three as the two best in my view thus far.The book ends with the world at war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this brush!","review":"This brush does not pull hair at all...it glides through easily and gently.

Grubby manipulations that are typical of most governments. Some of the historians in this book write approvingly of Napoleon 3. Especially in how he sought rappochement with Britain. But others show the shallowness of his rule. Combined with a general ineptitude in governing. With no great military victories. There was the Crimean War.

(Just as the implement you cut your roast beef with is a knife, not a knive, just as your spouse--if you're male--is your wife, not your wive, just as what falls from a tree in autumn is a leaf, not a leave, the singular form of \\"staves\\", in the musical sense of the word, is \\"staff\\", not \\"stave\\".)2) Its presentation of rhythm is muddled, inaccurate, and often just plain wrong.3) It talks down to you, insults your intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"Before I proceed with (I hope) a balanced appraisal I am compelled to quibble (I can't help it): The set of five lines we put the dots we call notes on is a STAFF; it is NOT a \\"STAVE\\"--just as the implement you cut your roast beef with is a knife, not a \\"knive\\", just as the woman to whom you are married is your wife, not your \\"wive\\". The singular form of \\"staves\\" in the musical sense is \\"staff\\", NEVER \\"stave\\".Okay, got that off my chest. Now, there are three basic problems with this book: 1) It is very often wrong--or at least inaccurate--particularly about rhythm. 2) It talks down to its readers. There's no reason to assume that because you don't know how to read music you are an idiot. It is possible to put things simply, clearly, and in a straightforward manner without insulting us. 3) As someone else points out, the book is superfluous."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE COMPOSER'S TEACHER","review":"The composer's teacher, yes that is true when I first read this book I was attached to it, would not put the book down, it was very interesting.

Huh? What kind of lesson is that? The poetry is not clever, fun or catchy like most of his other works. The illustrations are not done by Dr. Seuss and they are not very interesting or coloful. Very, very ho-hum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre Sudden Ending","review":"I just borrowed this book from the library to read to my daughter and I must say it really has a perplexing DUD of an ending. The story is actually cute up until the last page where it just ends suddenly. Even my two-year-old daughter looked up at me wondering if there was any more to the story when we got to the last page. She is intelligent enough to expect something to happen but nothing does. Since it was a library book and therefore not new, I actually examined the book closer to see if perhaps some pages had fallen out at the end but no, it just has a terribly lazy ending to an otherwise cute lead-up.I would definitely NOT recommend this book for the young readers like it was designed for (ages 5-8) because it doesn't teach readers about the basics of a story (beginning, middle and END) Instead, it might confuse young readers because of it's lack of an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Seuss hits rock bottom","review":"My wife and I finally stored this book away, because there is nothing redeeming about the message, and it's not particularly creative in any respect either.

The kid refuses entreaties from his mother and even the police to get out of bed and go to school, and in the end, they just let the kid stay in bed and sleep. So...the message for my 2 year old is: defy your parents long enough, engage in anti-social behavior, and they will give in and let you have your way. I still have to wonder whether Dr. Seuss actually wrote this one. It's just horrid, and the rhymes are like a 6th grader's first attempt at poetry.

As an Australian, I found this movie to be very authentic and a good example of what rural life would have been like in 1920's Australia. Australia has moved on since the 1920's and now in the 21st Century most Australians live in cities or towns and the Australian economy is much less dependant on farming.

Paddy loves the life, while his wife longs to settle down in a home of her own.Mitchum and Kerr give outstanding performances.

Kerr is an accomplished actress, with many excellent movies to her credit. This is perhaps her best, a role of great depth and feeling. She and her husband (Mitchum) are itinerants in Australia traveling around from job to job with their 14-year old son in tow. Their struggles to make a life for themselves, while still remaining true to their nature, is a great study of human nature. Kerr's short speech to her son, whom she loves dearly, and shares a desire to live a more settle life with is memorable. The movie's straihgtforward approach and clear depiction of life in Australia is compelling. Outstanding movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sundowners","review":"Wonderful scenery of Australia (where it was filmed) and a delightful story of a family moving sheep across the country. Ida, the wife, and her son want to settle down and buy a house. Paddy, the husband, likes the freedom of living off the land, sleeping in a tent and spending what money they have on beer and gambling. Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr are the stars and they are absolutely perfect in the roles. Their great working relationship reflects the fact that - in reality - they were very good friends. Peter Ustinov and Glynis Johns are superb in their supporting roles. This movie resulted in Deborah Kerr's 6th Academy Award nomination.

Switching the balls is easy, and the unit is very tough and strong. One suggestion, when not in use it's a good idea to stow it inside your truck and/or keep it well lubricated. We live in Oregon (can you say RAIN....), and I left it on mounted on our truck last winter while we were down in Mexico.

VHS does not offer those amenities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Knight Finale","review":"I loved the series...except for the ending.

But the third season definitely has a few of the best FK episodes.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting!","review":"I remember when this was a TV series. I never paid that much attention to them when they were showing. My housemate's really into the vampire scene and she recommended I watch them. Lo and behold, I got hooked. It's a shame they didn't continue the series, but I'm sure they'll be others in the near future. I would recommend it to those who really enjoy vampirism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 3","review":"Glad to see that the final season was released on DVD.

It was not bad, all the showed more into nicholas past then thought by the other two parts. The final three shows are the most interesting. The only reason the part recaived a four and not a five was because the last 30 seconds should have been done diffrent or atleast i would have like them to be diffrent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this show but can't stand this season","review":"I love Forever Knight but I can't fathom anyone liking this season. Almost every episode was a poorly contrived rip off... sorry, 'homage' to a recent movie. The characters were inconsistent and the writing was weak and sloppy. And don't get me started on that dreary, depressing and unsatisfactory ending.It is irresponsible and wrong to have ended the show the way they did, especially when in this series vampirism was used as a metaphor for addiction. What does that say exactly? If you're an addict just give up now because it's hopeless and your struggles are for nothing? Nick deserved better than that. We, the audience, deserved better than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like this cheesy show","review":"I know it's a cheesy show, but I still love it.

So sad to see it leave. I do have a burning question to anyone who might help. In the episode \\"Black Buddha\\", a hauntingly beautiful song was sung during the opening scenes. It was \\"Voodoo Black Magic\\". I desperately want a copy of the full song. I have written to a Canadian radio personality who then forwarded (my email) to the agent of Molly Johnson, whom I believe sang that song, but she doesn't remember it. (I'm still sure it was her voice).Can anyone help?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing end of a great show.","review":"I have loved the first and second season of this season but was very disappointed with this one. The characters lack the spunk that the other two season have and the ending is wreched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible ending","review":"This is the worst season ever! Nick, Natalie and the entire original cast have seen much better days in seasons 1 & 2. SPOILERS............First, Schanke gets killed off in the first episode. Then, Janette is absent for the entire season, except for one episode and when she does return, she's not the Janette we know and love! Thirdly, Vachon---what a sorry excuse for a vampire. Fourth, the new captain is a JOKE. Fifth they didn't know what they wanted to do with Lacroix and lastly Tracy Vetter...yuk!!

Well, this book is a marvelous example of actually visiting the small village of Conques in south France. We get to meet people and places, hear tales and myths, and share a little bit in the author's own feelings and spiritual experiences at a saint's shrine. This is a good read, but not very exciting. Very true to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"No narrative momentum.","review":"If you already have an intense interest in St. Foy, or in the Aveyron region of France, you will enjoy this book. It contains some beautifully written passages and warm, honest sentiment.It also contains a lot of minutely detailed descriptions of places, people, encounters, artistic impressions, religious experiences, scholarly and historical research, cultural observations... What it does not contain is any narrative momentum. All the lovely writing is strung together without any context. Who is this woman who went to all the trouble to document her experiences in Conques over the years? The reader is left with very little idea. After a while, you'll just want it to stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"great remixes!","review":"i just noticed that this single had no reviews, so if you're wondering whether or not to pick it up maybe i can be of service to you.The Blood Is Love (Contradicktator Mix) FLAT OUT GREAT. Starts of with eerie atmospheric piano and a lonely cold rendering of Josh Homme's voice. Then it explodes into a drum 'n bass MARCH! It's hard to describe, but it's really really fun to listen to. One of the coolest remixes i've heard in a long long time.Little Sister (Contradicktator Mix) Almost like a techno lounge version of the song. Not quite as stellar as the Blood Is Love remix, but also very very enjoyable.All in all, it's totally worth the money. The remixes sound really fresh, they're anything but cookie cutter techno stamped versions of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute light!!","review":"They are so cute! Love them!

I have enjoyed the layout which offers biblical examples, as well as everyday life examples and questions for personal contemplation. Dr. Katie Brazelton writes in a way that relates to women in all seasons of life. This devotional can help you press through the distractions and clear out the clutter to see where you've been and where you are at.

Full of penetrating questions that demand an answer. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowing to Purpose Through Submission","review":"This book was a disappointment. I expected guidance through a relationship with God, encouragement in life and relationships. What I got was a step by step method to recognize all my possible shortcomings, my incredibly sinful perceived ways, and lack of submission to the man in my life. There are questions to respond to and most of them left me less than guided and more than a bit angry at the author.Perhaps this would be a positive purchase for a woman who sees her role as the support of her powerful, God-filled husband. This is not where I am in my relationship with the Lord. My prayer filled life is rich, with submissiveness to God's leadership, not the path outlined in this book. It was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanish book instead of English","review":"Praying for Purpose for Women: A Prayer Experience That Will Change Your Life Forever (Pathway to Purpose)I ordered the English version of this book as well as a companion book by the same author.

First off they're a little large for that, but I'm not deducting stars for that because I should have taken a tape measure out so it's my fault. Why I don't like these lamps is within weeks:- One of the lamp shades unglued itself. Now it hangs down on three of the four sides, barely attached. I tried re-gluing but I'm terrible at that stuff, and frankly I don't buy things so I can practice my arts and crafts. I get around this by propping the shade against the wall- The same lamp is a pain to turn on and off. You twist the knob and instead of clicking it feels like the housing inside is turning with the knob. Eventually you can get it, but again, this happened within weeks of purchaseThe second lamp is fine, but I'm disappointed in this purchase. Without these problems I'd say 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, sad and witty","review":"As the Amazon review states, we all know who the Bobos are. If we don't see them buying or wearing outrageously expensive items, we must listen to them as they blab about buying them. But then, the more I read, I suddenly realize, \\"Oh my GOd, I am one of them!\\"Yes, I get my morning latte and have spent hundreds of dollars on kitchen utensils (most recent purchase: deluxe measuring bar that adjusts for any of 15 different quantities). Brooks looks into every aspect of life - religion, politics, sex, pleasure (especially pleasure), work, children, clothes...there is hardly any subject left untouched. Yet, the text was slightly unorganized, seeming to blend the worst aspects of a self-help manual with the shortness of newspaper articles. One must also remember that this was written during the Clinton era of abject greed/prosperity (take your pick depending on political persuasion) that seemed to have no end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read, but not completely convincing.","review":"This book gets 5 stars because it succeeds magnificently in what one ultimately reads any book for -- to delight or entertain oneself. It manages this despite a weak main argument. The author hyperbolizes by imputing the standards and tastes of a small liberal, fashionable, and self-righteous subset of elites to the group of high-achieving Americans as a whole. He did NOT do a good job convincing me that the bobos have really \\"taken over\\" the establishment rather than simply compete for attention with those of other sensibilities. What Brooks does provide is ample evidence that business and the media have in the past decade catered extensively to the bobos' interests -- but merely, in my opinion, because they will always chase after where there is money. He also does a good job of comically and accurately describing the bobos and their habits using his acute powers of observation, but this by itself does nothing for his thesis that the bobos now \\"rule.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Get you SUV out of my reading space","review":"Just what we need, a \\"scholarly\\" look at the bourgeois bohemians, or Bobo for short. It is hard to read this book without becoming increasingly irritated by the self congratulatory tone of the book. It contains a brief and interesting history of the bourgeois and bohemian beginnings in the United States. As it approaches present time, it becomes tedious and tiresome. Do we really care how conflicting it can be to choose the best of food, clothing, or even jobs? I don't. What's the point of the extended foray into the elite indulging in S&M and leather, no matter how earnest and sincere? I agree with another reader that the best parts are when Brooks touches on the drive to have the best or the professional model of something and his references to latte towns. All in all it is a tedious and irritating self congratulatory read that this OWUC (Overworked Underclass) female can do without! I donated my copy to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"I bought the book because the reviews at the time were better. I've decided that I don't care about finishing the book at this point; I've been bored with the so-called 'humorous' analogies that I have heard many times before. The author isn't making any new, incredible observations, he's merely telling us what a short newspaper article has already told us.To sum it up, the book is great if you've never watched prime time television, have never seen a Starbucks, or don't understand what dot-coms are. Otherwise, pass it by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankenstein monster of a book","review":"Brooks is a somewhat funny writer, but his idea of accurate social analysis is to report on the NY Times wedding section. Nearly everything else in this book is anecdotal with only a few suspicious and contrived statistics thrown in gratuitously. He portrays an emerging social type called a \\"Bobo.\\" The Bobo is characterized in numberous ways in too many chapters. Bobos are like this and Bobos are like that, etc.,etc..In my opinion, he fails to establish that anyone is an actual Bobo according to his definition. His mythical Bobo is a lot like the Frankenstein monster--parts of a lot of people, but nobody in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Time","review":"The book came in no time and was not damaged. I have yet to read it, but im sure it will be great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"smart, easy sociology","review":"Brooks has a keen ability to articulate trends that seem obvious once you've read them. Despite his self-proclaimed status as a member of Bobo class, he pokes fun of them at every opportunity, while at the same time generally praising them. Brooks is most skeptical of the Bobos' shallowness, especially in the area of religion, but believes they are superior overall to the old establishment.As a 22 year-old student at a liberal arts university, it was revealing to see how many of my own values fall perfectly in line with the Bobo class. \\"Bobos in Paradise\\" is insightful, funny, and easy to read. Near the end it gets a bit repetitive, but the sharp observations make it well worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Andy Rooney in disguise","review":"This review of today's culture seems like a regurgitation of thoughts from two of my least favorite television personalities - Andy Rooney and P.J. O'Rourke. I could only get through about 250 pages of the author's commentary on today's retail demographics. While the author has certainly done his fair share of research, it doesn't help this dry and un-funny view of today's society. I would much rather be subjected to Andy Rooney's 2 minute diatribes on 60 Minutes for a lifetime than to have to read this book again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brooks' brush strokes are too broad","review":"Thoughtful and deep but make a few too many generalizations. I don't know too many of these upper class twits as it turns out. Still, there are some observations about Bobo consumptive patterns that utterly ring true, in my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being Bobo is my Mojo","review":"What a great and decent book about myself. Well Done Brookie. However, being cool Bobo is not nerdy, as percieved by a previous reviewer. Bobe's can be of pre-wealthy families, but these days (Yuppies? Lol-Where you been that last two decades, sonny) the majority are RICH due to hard strong study,torturous hours and 'blooming' hard work. The lesson is to enjoy this book, it's fun and fluency will pull you right in; understand we all have different lives: It IS true about the buying 'rubbish' for the hell of it - showing off etc - then never using it, and dropping to a low after....but just imagine what life would be like for YOU if you were sooo rich, that one just didnt enjoy shopping anymore....see, THEN how would you feel! BTW-'Nerdy' is an 'envy' term...........go on, save your money, give it a go, I promise you, you'll enjoy it (but in my case, et al, you'll enjoy studying and working for it much much more. Case Closed)."},{"rating":"1","title":"All spin, almost no substance","review":"I was hoping for some witty, thought-provoking social commentary, and while there are witty patches in this book, ultimately it seems that Mr. Brooks doesn't really want to be a wry or thought-provoking. In fact, he doesn't really want to be an observer. He wants the upscale car, the Viking range, the prime parking spot. He wants to go native, he's a bit too enchanted with and simulatanously envious of this \\"new\\" upper class society. He lacks a Tom Wolfe's breadth and ironic detachment or a P.J. O'Rourke's ability not to take himself too seriously. His prescription at the end sounds off-key and trite. This book has the feel of a Starbucks Latte, something you've paid a bit too much for that's a lot of froth and doesn't last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middlebrow Man","review":"A hodgepodge of middlebrow cliches that doesn't know whether it is social commentary or humor; mainly, his thesis is just plain wrong as one could discover by going to Franklin country which Brooks says lacks over $20 meals. I traveled there this past winter to visit some relatives. There one would discover that there are plenty of places to order meals that cost over $20. Strange that his books is filed under \\"sociology.\\" It is more like humor but one of a condescending kind like Joe Queenan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent summer read","review":"Highly entertaining and intelligent. It will make you laugh and think at the same time. A social commentary page turner. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bobos all over the world as well as in Paradise","review":"Mr. Brooks has produced a wonderful and deep social and psycological analysis of an elite class whose way of living and upscale culture is sorrounding us all over the world, not only in America. He shows, without mercy, the tasty trends of the upper classes during the 90s and how these trends influence us all in terms of consumption, marketing and even politics.A fun to read book where Mr. Brooks developed an accute and smart critic over our generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious analysis of who we are ...","review":"How could 60's culture meet 80's culture without disaster? David Brooks is hilarious in his analysis of a generation that has fused the conflicting cultures. Consumerism with a conscience.The book is lacking in statistics so it serves as entertainment more than a study. I felt that he was dead-on in describing my peers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written like a conversation with a friend","review":"Bobos was a delight to read. It was written as though a friend was talking to you over a cup of coffee; it wasn't bogged down with statistics and graphs, etc. Brooks' ideas were fascinating and his writing style was a pleasure -- I laughed out loud several times. A quick, fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trenchant and Fun","review":"Having enjoyed Fussel's Class immensely, and as an armchair pop sociologist, I looked forward to reading Brook's work. While it is true that the book's insights are shallow in places, and the writing weak in others, Bobos is on to something.Being a \\"gen x'er\\" in pop sociological terms, I am no fan of boomer apologia, however I think that Brook's insights are accurate and quite penetrating. Certainly, I think he captures the zeitgeist of the times. I found myself nodding along with much of what he wrote and laughing out loud in a knowing way. Indeed, I recognized myself throughout.Bobos in Paradise delves into our collective unconscious in a fun and interesting way. It's not de Tocqueville, but so what? It's still good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffy, with No Edge","review":"This is a fluffy look at the behavior of an influential segment of wealthy people today. Very funny in parts, tedious in others. But social comment is best done at a distance, and Brooks seems too worried about what his Bobo friends and neighbors might think to finish what he started. The book trails off, as he descends into explaining why the Bobos are different (and better) than the generations of wealthy people that have preceeded them.I'd take Paul Fussell's \\"Class\\" any day over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"overly-smug and precious","review":"This book is half over-generalized sociology and half product placement advertising. Throughout the book Brooks tries to be both self-congradulatory and ironically/sarcastically distant. Burn your SUV. Vote for Nader."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Meritocracy Won??","review":"If David Brooks, now resident Bush Apologist for the New York Times, is right that the Meritocracy defeated the Aristocracy, why is the ultimate \\"legacy\\" George W. Bush now President?The Neocons would like for you to believe that it's all now merit based, but the ultra rich keep getting richer, the inheritance tax is now gone, and House and Senate seats are passed down across generations. Yuppies may have more stuff these days, but real power these days is increasingly in the hands of the few.Interesting thesis, wrong conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good audio book","review":"I really enjoyed listening to this in my car during long commutes. It reads well out loud - rather like an exceptional talk show or interview. Whether you find the author's viewpoint entertaining or maddening, it makes the drive time pass more quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comic Social Psychology","review":"This book is a comic look at sociology. David Brooks is one of my favorite conservative thinkers -- he appears during the News Hour on Public TV every Friday night at 6:00 pm. Actually this book is more about Social Psychology than it is about \\"Comic Sociology\\".Sociology investigates how people act in groups.Social Psychology investigates how people develop as a result of the social influences around them.This is a funny book about how members of the \\"Upper Crust\\" in America are brought up, get married and develop throughout their lives. It's a light funny but scholarly work. The part I like best was a comparison of wedding announcements from 50 years ago and today.If you like to think about how the Yuppies got this way, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the dust cover and save time.","review":"After seeing the author, David Brooks, on PBS's The News Hour, and Life and Times, I got the impression that Bobo's would be more comedy than social commentary. Wrong. The minimal humor in this book can be gleaned by reading the dust cover. Sociologists may like it, but don't buy it for the humor alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it.","review":"Parts of this book made me so mad that I shamelessly flung it at my walls. It seems to me that the author thinks that Bobos are adorable with their ability to spend small fortunes on absolutely nothing while pretending they have an ethos because they aren't like the marriage page of the NY Times in the 50s. If you are a baby boomer, please don't read this book, realize that you are in tune with the world, and then quietly lull yourself with an organic parka or whatever nonsense it is ok to spend thousands of dollars on in the Bobo world. Read Daniel Quinn. Read Paul Hawken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Through the Looking Glass... or rather, In the Looking Glass","review":"An excellent book, a great idea, and pleasantly lighter in its cultural theory leanings than, say, Jean Baudrillard. I haven't ever laughed at myself as much as I did when I read the following: \\"Do you work for one of those hip, visionary software companies where everybody comes to work in hiking boots and glacier glasses, as if a 400-foot wall of ice were about to come sliding through the parking lot?\\" I have and do, in fact, and one of the members of our design team dons the aforesaid goggles daily. Really. I, too, am guilty in my own right however, fond of organic coffee and organic milk to go with it, as well as clunky running shoes in neutral colors (with which I don't do much running, particularly when playing with Photoshop). I just didn't know how amusing my behavior was until now. My lord, I've been successfully categorized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided","review":"One hates to be a snob, but the author seems to know very little about the true upper class. The people about whom he writes are largely middle class--upper middle class, perhaps, but \\"middle\\" nonetheless. For better or worse, I would argue that the \\"bobos\\" are not, in fact, running the country, either. He gives them far too much credit in terms of their supposed \\"power.\\" And George W. a bobo? Hardly. He's as elite and old money as they come; it's just that he has a Texas twang! I also would argue that the group about which he writes is nothing new. The nouveau riche will always be with us, and they will always be a group of show-off super-consumers who are slightly ill at ease as they try to reconcile newfound wealth vs. humbler, occasionally bohemian roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"A self-portrait that bites","review":"This witty book-- challenging in its compilation of observations about our daily lives, shallow in that it ignores so much of modern America -- frequently made me cringe. I easily recognized myself (late forties, African American, PhD, Oberlin... you get the idea) in every chapter and loved the way the author crafted the language to present a portrait at once incisive, critical, but affectionate. We Baby Boomers have much to be grateful for, much to be held accountable for, but nothing to apologize for. In every latte-laced chapter, Brooks probes more deftly into turn-of-the-century U.S. culture and mores and does not take a wrong turn. This is an easy read, an adventurous excercise, and a sparklingly clear mirror held up to our generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangers in Paradise","review":"I saw this book in my library and thought it would be a fun read for a rainy afternoon. I was very disappointed. The author is trying too hard to be clever and funny and he isn't.I didn't find it very amusing as I'm surrounded by these vapid creatures. In the past few years the area where I live has become \\"in\\" and they have arrived in their SUVs and with bad manners to clutter up our quiet spot with their McMansions. They are shallow and boring, but a source of amusement to watch playing country. They'll never get it and we won't tell them.Years ago I laughed out loud while reading the Preppy Handbook and expected this book would be like that. It isn't. Don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The age old human race","review":"David Brooks penetrating mind and humor combine for a delightful reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good skewering.....","review":"....of those ridiculous latte-sipping, SUV-driving types crowding the aisles for wheat grass muffins at Fresh Fields. Brooks' concept of the \\"adventure gap' - i.e. the gap between what your high performance hiking shoes or raincoat was designed to do vs. what it is actually used for, is hilarious. Question: if these simpering, self-righteous Al Gore types are now our new elite, what is the new counterculture? Rednecks, perhaps? I believe that a new oppositional culture will arise, based on the tastes of those the Bobos disdain. Characteristics: pick up trucks, pit bulls, shotguns, plenty of red meat, beer, cigarettes. Latte towns will be overrun with rebellious kids dressed like they are going hunting. Sears, NRA memberships, and fistfighting will be in vogue. And I, for one, cannot wait for that day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading","review":"At last the real reason we went from Bauhaus to barnyard virtually overnight.

During the last 24 hours I've been trying to get past the tutorial. It is impossible. There is no way to change the difficulty setting. The mission objectives make no sense at all (If they are commandos, why do they have to kill every single German they encounter) and the computer will throw hordes of enemies that seem to have just teleported from the Enterprise as more than 400 have already come out of a small wagon and they keep coming every extact 8 seconds.Altough the graphics are nice (I wish I could zoom more, tough) I did not pay this amount of money for 1 mission.I strongly advice you to download the demo and see for yourself if this game is for you before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commandos 3: Destination Berlin","review":"I have always been a fan of the Commandos series. They take patience and planning. Destination Berlin continues in much of the same way its predecessor did but with better graphics and new controls. I must admit that I am not all too happy with the hotkey changes but you get used to the new controls all the same. Graphics are nice and so is the sound, although they are nothing to write home about. The cutscenes are great in that they really provide you with a feeling of impending doom. Number one thing to all that are interested is that you must be a patient individual. If you like to fast forward through games, this will not be a game you will enjoy. All and all a decent game with very few draw backs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I read all the reviews, and after playing this game I can't be more agreed. This game is absolutely not recommended and a big turn down to all commandos fans everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment Plus","review":"After thoroughly enjoying Commandos 2, I looked forward with great anticipation to Commandos 3 only to be greatly disappointed. The characters and graphics are basically the same but the actual play is quite different.There are no varying levels of play so it seems everyone is playing at expert level which can make the game for average gamers very difficult and frustrating. The actual keyboard selections for actions seem more complicated and the loss of time in selecting the proper action often results in the gamer getting killed off and the game having to be re-loaded adding to one's frustration. The only positive I see in this game is any satisfaction the gamer might get in completing a mission. They all seem too difficult for the average gamer of which I am. The cost of the game is higher than the satisfaction received. I could not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I love commando 1 and 2 alot.

Otherwise, I won't play it and their rate from me will be less than a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard for younger kids to understand","review":"I hate to say anything negative about a classic author like Rudyard Kipling. The stories in and of themselves are entertaining enough. It is like folklore stories of how different animals developed different characteristics. The stories were a bit too different in wording for my 9 and 3 year old to understand very well. I was constantly having to stop and explain the story. So it came to the point I was basically paraphrasing everything I read to them. Not saying I wouldn't still buy it, it is probably good for expanding literature understanding and vocabulary. It isn't a book they ever ask me to read though.Beautiful illustrations and well bound book."},{"rating":"2","title":"so good","review":"tito is always great. does not matter the genre he is singing, he is always at his best. my favorite songs le gusta que la vean; y nos amamos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superstar Shortstops","review":"Professionally produced, high-energy video for the baseball fan and player.

To begin with, it is eminently more readable. When I tried to power my way through Gibbon's Spartacus I couldn't but help daydream and fall asleep because the writing style was so archaic and required close attention. Howard Fast's book is filled with drama and character development that greatly enhances the story with which most people are familiar. While other books tend to die out near the end, I found Spartacus to actually become most entertaining in the final 65 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"charge too much","review":"i went into a chinese grocery store, they charge the same product for $15 a bottle, while this vendor charged me $50 a bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"General Advices About Public Speech","review":"The book is about how you should prepare to public speech. It talks about how to setup a stage, how to work with a michrophone, how to walk in a stage and the known advices as 'know your audience' and 'rehearse'.I think this might be good reading if you lack any clue about the process but for people that need to improve their presentation skills it's not worth.

I just recently picked it up the library and it is the best pregnancy book I've read. The author spent nine months getting to know the staff of an obgyn office and the patients. You follow one couple from them flirting with each other to a dance all the way up to the birth of their first child. Then you also get various stories on the way along with various facts about the obgyn field.Two warnings though:First..there are a couple of very sad stories that are not too fun to read while you are pregnant. But if you're the type of person who can face reality, you'll be okay.Second...The hospital where the babies are born is a little on the old fashioned side (ie: babies swept away to nursery, no rooming in).But still, I loved this book and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book to prepare you for Pregnancy","review":"I recently borrowed this book from the library and it's really great.

The characters are two-dimensional and the dialogue lacks the snap and fizz of later works.There are nuggets of humor and irony to be mined here and there, showing promise of what will come in subsequent books, but on the whole the story is tedious and unconvincing.The plot device of heading each chapter with excerpts from imitations of lurid gothic novels as a way to preface to the melodrama contained in the the next chapter is the one fun aspect of the book.Save your money for her later works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovered this find from Janet Mullany","review":"I have been following Janet Mullany for her Jane Austen fan fiction titles.

It has a heavy aluminum disk bottom that provides steady heat to make hollandaise or custard without requiring a double-boiler.The only drawback I have found is that my pitiful GE gas stove does not produce flame under the pan's disk bottom.

While this may be an excellent book, I certainly couldn't tell after the first 45 pages. Major portions of the text consists of illegible footnotes. In spite of its folksy style, the author is obscure and impenetrable. It makes me wonder why, if he really has something to say, he can't explain it in a sensible fashion. While there might be people who get something from this book, a casual reader should expect some very tough going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Dissapointing is the best word I found to rate this book. I think the topic is of great interest and the credentials of the author are quite good but (and is a big but) it doesn't matter at all since the writting style, and overall skills to transmit the main ideas and conclusions are poor, very complex and in my opinion stock between a book aimed for people with strong technical background and normal readers with special interest in these topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't take a chance with your time on this book","review":"The title is aptly chosen.

For example he assumes that all arrangement of atoms in a gas have equal probabliity. It should be obvious that probability of an atom being in a small section of its path is inversely proportional to its velocity in that portion of the path. He describes the Maxwell demon and he is correct there but there is a second deamon analogous to the Maxwell demon. For example thee is a definite probability that all molecules of a gas in a specific volume can spontaneously be within a smaller volume. However, because the velocity of the molecules is so high the duration of the molecules is so small that it is not evident in the pressure on the walls.

'Nuff said.The only thing I would consider a factual error is his disdain of internal organs such as heart, liver, etc.- I believe that he over-emphasizes the risk of disease.

The case itself is nice, has a tight fit and does not make the phone much bulkier (unless you have the belt clip attached), but it has plastic covering all the keypad buttons except 4 or 5 of the big ones, which is the main problem because it makes typing on it harder than it already is, which is quite a problem for owners of this phone because its already semi-difficult to use the tiny little keyboard.

Cameras belomging to the expedition were recovered, however, and developed film revealed a gruesome-looking seven- foot man-fish walking erect.How long it took the film to reach the U.S. is unclear, but after viewing it producer William Alland, with encouragement from Orson Welles, went to work on a film project that eventually became Universal's horror classic, \\"Creature from the Black Lagoon.\\"Hard to believe? The Amazon is home to 30-foot snakes, rats as big as sheep, ant-eaters as big as bears. A stone-age Indian tribe lives there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still fun in 2-D but Why Not 3-D?","review":"The Creature from the Black Lagoon is one of those classic 50s drive in horror flicks that abounded during that time.

I saw that at the movie theatre about 3 years ago and that was fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 50's horror","review":"Monday, January 24, 2005 / 5 of 5 / Classic 50's horror.One of the seminal horror classics out of the fifties, the Creature still impresses. The underwater photography is murkily beautiful, and the shots of the creature mirroring the female scientist/swimmer underwater as she swam tap into deep fears the way Jaws did, something just below the surface. Scientists travel up the Amazon to a \`black lagoon' in an effort to find more to the mystery of a fossilized webbed and clawed hand recently excavated. What they didn't figure on was a relative of the owner of that hand still traipsing around. The blaring score that accompanies the creatures appearances is sufficient warning, but he manages to surprise and kill the majority of the party while carting off the beauty. A lot of fun, recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Region 2? Now I Know!","review":"PLEASE PLACE THE EXPLANATION THAT YOU ARE SELLING A VIDEO THAT I CANNOT VIEW HIGHER IN THE AD!!!!!

The Creature ranks with the Wolf Man, Dracula, and Frankenstein. The plot is well done and suspensful. An expedition travels to the forbidden Black Lagoon of the Amazon in search of the remnants of a fossil, which may prove to be the missing link! Little do they know that one such creature still exsists, and it's determined to destroy all trespassers in its domain.

You will hear lots of 'noises' including mothers breathing, external noises amplified and everything else except baby's heartbeats. On top of the price you pay for the product, you will spend another $10 for batteries (since it does not come with one and it needs expensive 9v batteries) and lots of frustration.

Narrated primarily by the magician Prospero, the events of Shakespeare's last play are dramatized as masques with beautiful Renaissance costuming and musical scores. As the master of the word, Prospero with his library creates and orchestrates the magic and poetry that is The Tempest. Viewers with preconceived expections about the play or narrow, Hollywood-dulled film tastes will not appreciate Greenaway's work. Prospero's Books is best suited to people with broader tastes, especially in European film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete rip off","review":"First, I love this movie. It's five stars in my book.The $50 version being offered here by 'classics_vhs_dvd' is a complete rip off.

A few minutes of research will tell you haow to play it just fine in the US"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sensual Feast!","review":"If you like John Gielgud's or Peter Greenaway's work, then you should see this film.It is typical of both, in that Gielgud gives a performance one could not fathom anyone else giving, and Greenaway fills the screen with visual and sensual stimulation such as no other director has attempted.On the surface, this is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Tempest, with all roles played in voice-over by Gielgud while the other actors portray them physically--Caliban is particularly a delight--but it is also so much more that words fail me.This is like nothing you have ever seen. However, if you are shocked or offended by human nudity, then you should stay away, because it might detract from your pleasure in viewing and that would be a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total ripoff of Shakepeare's \\"The Tempest\\"!","review":"Seriously, though, this movie is uneven. The daring and unconventional visuals of the first half -- incredibly -- give way to a stilted, boring second half. Greenaway might have been able to pull this off for 15 minutes, but it groans at 120 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't call this Shakespeare","review":"This movie should be called \\"Gielgud in Love...\\" with his own voice. It's an interesting experiment, and an interesting idea, but it is so narcissistic and indulgent. Prospero's Books lacks all of the passion of the Tempest, sells it short by falling in love with an admittedly great Shakespearean actor saying all of the lines in a beauitful if somewhat detached way.

I do believe that Gielgud is one of the greatest actors of all time. The criticism that one could start at any point in this movie is valid. I had no sense of thrust or purpose in this film.

Then I realized that the emperor, like everyone else in this picture, wasn't wearing any cloths. The movie is great to look at, but it all looks the same. You can look at any ten minutes of the movie and it will look like any other ten minutes.

When a DVD comes out, just wait and there will be a special edition for you to buy around the corner (Lord of the Rings, Hellboy, Daredevil etc . . . ). This tactic is now evident with the Stooges properties. I love The Three Stooges (all six of them) but this is just insulting. Will I purchase this new disc?

Near the end of the book, he covers topics that would have been helpful in the beginning. It's poorly indexed, leading you to pages that don't cover the topis you're looking for.

Some of the stuff on the CD is critical, so you have to look at both, a nuisance. Also, topics are really only itemized (like a dictionary (not organized logically).

Instead of unremitting praise, the author now even admits some of the limitations of Frontpage. There is a lot of detail here, but the book is still a jigsaw puzzle if you want to answer a question or put something together. To add to this difficulty, about 270 pages of the book are on the CD. A lot of this CD material is basic, so you now not only have to flip pages, but spin the CD to explore a topic.Not a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I rate myself as an extremely competent user of FrontPage 2002, and yet I battled so much with this book that I sent it back.

The first chapter will explain how the cells work, immune system, and what goes wrong with ppl with Autoimmune. The book continues with chapters with many specific Autoimmune Diseases. This book is so very different than any other, which is many medical books, since it's written with easy to understand terms, and lots humor and stories of actual cases that we can relate to.

The death of the trooper was very sad, and the other troopers emotions show just how closeknit the FHP family is.

She has got the most incredible voice! Her album is beautiful and fun and I listen to it all of the time! This CD deserves no less than FIVE STARS - it's a refreshing change to the typical so-so voices in country music today. Julie is an amazing singer and she sings each song like she's really lived it. To say she sings without emotion is crap - she has so much emotion behind her voice and you'll love this CD if you buy it. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Bad Start","review":"Julie Reeves' debut CD is like a great roller coaster ride---You remember the ups and the downs. The CD does attempt to mix fast and slow, but comes off as somewhat schizophrenic because the slow songs (including What I Need and You Were A Mountain) are so much better than the fast ones (including Party Down). The only exception is the delightful Trouble Is A Woman. Ms. Reeves hails from the same region as some other, more traditional, female country artists and \\"what she needs\\" is to focus primariy on her traditional roots and not try so hard to mix old and new. Also, she's a beautiful girl already. She doesn't need to show as much of herself as she does on the back cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"It May not Be Her Time","review":"There are many country albums that fall through the cracks each year. This is because many of them are so formulaic, so predictable and so safe. Unfortunately Reeves' debut album on Virgin Nashville falls under this category. Sure this album has its shares of ballads and uptempoes but none of them seem to standout. They are all pretty ordinary. Interestingly the most interesting song on this set is Reeves' cover of Tina Turner's hit \\"What You See Is What You Get.\\" However Reeves being a less experienced singer doesn't have the calibre of Turner's way of making this song sounds exciting. Dave Loggins' \\"He Keeps me in One Piece\\" is beautiful but somehow Reeves fails to ignite the passion of this love ballad. The single and title track has a quasi-rap section but other than that, it's one of those Nashpop numbers. At the end of the day Reeves, like many other artists, is just another new artist that comes and go without much of a splash. Sorry this album may not be her time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title said 6ft recieved 3ft cable","review":"The product was satisfactory, average quality and was dilevered in a timely manner.

It appeared that the end attaching to the pacifier was probably velcro. This would have facilitated attachment to many pacifiers.

This clip is being used only when we go on car rides, so baby doesn't lose her pacifier. Well after about 4 months of occasional use the clip itself won't close all the way, so it doesn't secure to anything. Pacifier constantly falls onto the floor.

The pastry board has a tendency to slide around as you work the dough which was a big disadvantage to me. The dough also tended to stick to the board.So I bought this large silicone mat & have been very, very happy with it. The dough doesn't stick to the silicone & the mat stays in place on my countertop like it was glued there, yet comes up easily when you're finished. It cleans with no effort & can be rolled up for storage.

Dough still sticks to it, but the worst part is clean up. It's impossible to clean in the sink and impossible to dry.

The 2 patches on the front I can handle; 5+ more, NO. If I had known they were there I would not have purchased the jacket.

Which is nice, except that it is literally frankensteined together. It is made of about 400 different buffalo hide scraps, and they are not symmetrical.It also came with a secret. The back of this coat had 5 patches sewed on, including a huge decal that read \\"Live to Ride,\\" and had a picture of an eagle and an american flag. I did manage to get them off, at the cost of ripping the jacket in a small area.Saying that, this is a warm, heavy coat that fits good enough (tight sleeves and a loose back for a huge beer gut to fill).

As the author discusses beautifully, pearls are a glowing metaphor for life, struggle and hope. The book is very well written, the self-questions provide a helpful tool, and it's packed with all kinds of interesting facts/information about pearls of all kinds. The only reason I'm not giving five stars to this book is because there are a few places where a mystical or new-agey emphasis seemed to snag the otherwise smooth flow. They're in the form of poetry or fairy tales within the text, and at least once I wasn't sure how the section fit in to the rest of the chapter. Nevertheless, it's an excellent book worthy of gift-giving. I bought another copy, in fact, to give as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revised Opinion - AVOID","review":"This is an update of a prior review I wrote of this book, I changed my mind. I hadn't read the entire book but had been impressed with what I had read. The book does cover many aspects of commercial banking including regulations, capital and liquidity management, things of most interst to me as an analyst. However, a significant problem is that many of the examples used appear to be incorrect. For instance, the text often does not match the accompanying exhibits or tables. Perhaps the book was not edited well during an update to a new edition, and either the text or the exhibit/table was updated but not both (ie, in numerous cases they disagree). Whatever the reason, the numerous typographical errors made the book difficult to read, especially in a \\"self-study\\" situation.

Out of all the finance and economics (I'm a double major) textbooks I have used this is the absolute worst bar none.

The book starts off ok (if a bit dry), but the errors and poor editing become worse as the book progresses. This edition contains many typos, and several of the end of chapter questions seem to refer to topics covered in later chapters. Maybe the topics were in a different order in earlier additions and the questions were not revised.

There are numerous errors in the book and the teacher's guide with regard to referencing the Exhibits in the text, which is really unacceptable for a 6th edition. The examples are overly complicated and I find myself constantly searching for outside articles and examples that are more interesting and straightforward.The text font is very small and the detail and complexity can be overwhelming for an introductory banking course.Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of bank management texts out there, but I will continue to look for a better alternative.Update: I switched texts this past semester to Principles of Banking (published by the American Bankers Association). It is definitely for a beginning banking class.

The surface of each tart is decorated with three or four wavy lines of red frosting down the center, and white, sprinkled frosting at the sides. Half of the interior is filled, lengthwise, with strawberry flavored jelly; the other half is filled with blueberry flavored jelly. Combining two of the most delicious Pop-Tart choices seems like a clever idea, but neither side tastes quite right to me. The blueberry side tastes a little like grape, and both sides seem sweeter than the versions sold separately.

We know JFK was struck in the neck and temple. Therefore, we know Mr. Oswald was framed. The film does an excellent job portraying the framing of Lee Oswald. We also know it is being covered up to this day. Therefore, we know it had to an \\"inside job\\" since the Secret Service was ordered not protect the President that day. It was a classic Coup where the \\"Kings Men\\" or palace guard abandon their post so to speak. From the Zapruder film we can see the driver slow down and he and the other agent in the front seat just turn and watch for six seconds until Kennedy is good and dead. Excellent scene in Executive Action about the route change and the communication blackout immediately after the slaying.

While there is lkely no way to conclude who was behind the JFK murder, it was interesting to me to see that an audio taped interview of Jackie Kennedy Onassis surfaced, however briefly, about a year ago. This was covered by the mainstream media, but then the tape was given to the Kennedy clan, out of \\"respect\\" (because the media is so keen on \\"respect\\", right?). Of course, the news story simply disappeared. Anyway, in that taped interview from the '70's, Jackie stated clearly that she KNEW that LBJ was the one who orchestrated JFK's assassination.

If your looking for some insite into what people were thinking at the time you'll like it, and at only 91 minutes running time it is short and to the point.

It lends itself to mathematics, geometry, and art, without being stuffy, but lots of fun. I will probably order another larger set very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal","review":"This hurts.

Don't buy this book unless you want to read about how all biological problems are a direct result of human actions. This book is an example of how our school systems are infected with socialist, closed minded, left wing educators.

The rack was very easy to assemble & is very sturdy. The rack will hold securely 4 different style of bikes if you alternate handlebars. It locks and unlocks easily with the push of a lever & twist of a heavy duty, rubber coated wingnut. It does swing & lock out allowing access to a tailgate or lift gate. I can also access my liftgate glass while the rack is not swung out. The bike mounting arm (which I have used as a surfboard platform at the beach while changing)can be collapsed when not in use.Now the downside. The rack fits a standard 2\\" receiver but I had to enlarge the hole on the rack hitchpost to accept my locking bolt for my hitch. The rack is very heavy. When not mounted, the rack has to be laid down, it will not stand up by itself. I would buy this item again but I would do a more thorough search for a swing out rack that allows you to place the wheels of the bikes on a mounting platform in wheel racks."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy with purchase - Allen bike rack","review":"Once the bikes were on the rack, it didn't close easily.

But as a 5' 1\\" 140lb female I can take it on and off of my truck as needed.

When propery secured it does not wiggle at all and the straps are great. I have a little trouble with the swing action bit but I think with practice I will be able to do it on my own.

THE OZZMAN COMETH is a collection of Beezle-Boob's so-called career highs (I'll skip the easy joke), mostly focusing on his post-Sabbath output, save a couple of throwaway \\"new versions\\" of BS classics. The Randy Rhoads-propelled early hits CRAZY TRAIN and I DON'T KNOW represent Ozzy's best solo work, that era's power sorely diminished by later synth-intrusive power ballad dreck like MAMA I'M COMING HOME and IF I CLOSE MY EYES FOREVER. There's nothing here that Alice Cooper and Roky Erickson haven't done better, with at least a fundamental grasp on harmony.

Only get it for the bonus CD. You can play videos, go online, Screen Killer, and break Ozzy's bones. The only other reason is the crap recordings of Sabbath Songs. WARPIGS HAS DIFFERENT LYRICS. The only other time these lyrics appear is on the BLACK SABBATH STORY VOl.1 VIDEO. GET IT, IT'S BETTER. OZZY HAS MANY GREAT ALBUMS, BUT THIS ONE IS DISAPOINTING.

Mainly for two reasons. Ozzy has too many unforgettable hits to squeeze into one CD. He should have either done a double CD or else made a 1980-1990 and a 1990-2000 greatest hits album like U2 or whatever. Secondly for putting useless tracks such as the Black Sabbath basement tapes and also for putting live tracks were he could have put the original recording. Otherwise this CD is a rollercoaster ride from track 3 onwards, even though I wouldn't have started the Ozzy hits with a ballad. Maybe the two weak points in his hits, but nonetheless good tracks, are Crazy Babies and Over The Mountain. Could have easily been substituted by tracks such as Flying High Again and Miracle Man. But the classics like Mr. Crowley, Mama I'm Coming Home, No More Tears, Crazy Train and Shot In The Dark are there."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Need For A \\"Best Of \\" cd","review":"The reason that I rated this cd 2 stars is that you can hear all of the songs basically on his solo cd's.

I feel the same way about both albums. He is competent and pleasant, but none of the tracks, at first or second hearing, jump out at me and say \\"You've got to hear this again right now\\" or even \\"soon.\\" I felt entranced by Christine Lavin when I first heard her, and Bill Morrisey when I first heard him, and Gordon Lightfoot and James Taylor, same thing, but not David, and frankly, not many of the writer/singer flock that emerged from say 1980 through now. I'll bet I'd like him in person, but based on my limited acquaintance with his work, he is an artist I'll buy from the bargain bin but not at full retail."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Lives In My Head","review":"If I were picking my top 10 of all-time, this would definitely be on the list. David Wilcox's lyrics make me think he's been living in my head and his voice sounds like it echoes my soul. If you listen to \\"Saturday They'll All Be Back Again\\" and aren't reminded of your awkward teenage years, then I feel sorry for you. And what person can't identify with \\"The Vehicle\\" and its analogy to a broken heart afraid to jump back into a relationship? And even if it's become a little trite amongst some of his fans, \\"Eye of the Hurricane\\" still aptly communicates the desperation and willingness to escape it.If you listen to David Wilcox and don't get these messages, my guess is you never will. But if you do, then he will grip you with the rest of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"I have never found a CD as thoughtful and deep as this one.

Suberb lyricism combined with a refined guitar sensibility akin to Nick Drake.Wonderfully focused song-writing steeped in spirituality with a keen folk sensibility. As a vocalist Wilcox is often compared to the great James Taylor; listen to this CD and you will find that \\"Great\\" is an accolade that should be applied to both David Wilcox and this magical album. Of the many wonderful songs on the album, \\"Language of the Heart\\" is probably my favourite. I have recorded it myself and sung it many times in concert and to loved ones. Very special stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic folk never sounded so charming","review":"Quite simply a beautiful CD from start to finish. David Wilcox is known for his fun sense of humor in concert. But, mostly throughout this album David sings moving lyrics with lovely melodies that chill the bones and warm the soul.

The final result did not stick at all, although the bottom of the bread is not crispy as might be expected from cooking on a standard pan.

THEN, he reveals himself to be lazy, selfish, hypocritical, arrogant, small-minded and completely lacking in honor. This is the guy we're supposed to root for?

It was better than he deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"shopworn cliche","review":"This book was utter nonsense! First off the hero is a stuck up regency style A-Hole. He was so in lust with the heroine's cousin that he planed to trick her into marriage so he doesn't have to contend with all her other more wealthy and titled suitors. So when his plans go wrong and he ends up compromising the wrong woman suddenly she is the one that tricked him into marriage? And he is really bitter about it, what a hypocrite. He has a chip on his shoulder about being the second son (Surprised? I'm not). The heroine is so in love with this guy most of the book and is for lack of a better term a doormat. This book offered nothing to the genre that hasn't been done a million times and to top it off the author's sentence structure was hard to follow at times. The hero really killed this book for me, I almost stopped reading after the rape scene.

Of course Jane and Quentin's wedding night was awful I think he truly felt remorse for his behavior. His character did start out selfish, arrogant and downright unlikeable.

Sure, their lyrics are sickening and funny but seeing that they have been around for a decade-and-a-half, all of their albums depict the same gory theme all over and over again. I will admit that George Fisher is actually a better vocalist than Chris Barnes. The only thing that the band impresses me is that they still play Metal. But gory themes and violence can get cliched real quick and Cannibal Corpse epitomizes that fact.I might as well stick to better DM bands like Suffocation, Death, Nile, and Malevolent Creation.

Other than that what could possibly be special about this album? The singing is just a broadband set of frequencies that lacks dynamic, melodic and rythmic (the singing only emphasizes the basic pulse) sophistication. The lyrics are corny (BTW just look...look at the names of the tracks, Frantic Disembowelment for example). The guitar plays almost-as-uninteresting things (playing in phrygian all the time gets old). The tracks lack variety.I can see the general desire for angry music, but it should be seductive (I don't mean sexually), thus drawing people into it. The artists demonstrate a lack of understanding of music in general, theoretically and conceptually. Don't support filth like this. In three words - uninteresting, masturbatory hatred. Listening to this music will only make you a lesser person.

All of cc's songs sound the same over & over and both Fisher and Chris barnes are two of the most horrible vocalist in deathmetal todate without a doubt in my mind. The production terrible, lyrics cheesy,sound boring & repetetive and album cover childish & pretty damn gay.For good deathmetal stick with , vomitory,immolation,skinless,hateeternal,mortician,fleshcraw,deeds of flesh,krisiun,morbid angel, just to name a few who are much better and i enjoy listining to it insted of this trash we called crap corpse!Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemy...","review":"Its sad some people actullie except this as deathmetal but if you ask me? cannibal corpse along with the whole stupid gore scene are nothing but talentless losers that cant get laid...the only kinda of people that write about gore and violence are the same the cant get laid that's why they are to angry.Anyways, its like this, you either enjoy great and talent music that are played by real musicians or you settle for this brainless and ignorent type of poser and low deathmetal which to me is a disgrace. True deathmetal are these bands ( i wont name them all) death, celtic frost,morbid angel,malevont creation,vader,cryptopsy,possesed, exodus( thrash metal but hey their amazing) , venom( thrash as well), well those are some bands that got talent unlike your mortician, cannibal corpse,and all the other crappy gory crap that exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"KarlMarx","review":"If anyone can do this music, how about YOU trying PLAYING IT YOURSELF????

This doesn't take true talent. They solo the same freakin scale again and again, and play mostly power cords and harmonics. Any one who thinks this takes true skill is either A) not a musician B) some one who has never studied anything other than death metal and Black sabbath tunes.They just need to give up or come up with something new.

However, I can't see how someone would want to spend upwards of $200 getting 11 full length CDs of this silliness.As I've seen, there are 2 types of Cannibal Corpse fans: people who get the joke, and people who don't.

So what's different to this new one as opposed to the last four with Corpsegrinder? Honestly..not much. In fact,this picks up right where Gore Obsessed left us.Lyrically, I think Cannibal could write much better ,but I think they're concentrating on phrasing simple words to make catchier songs.

The villain just about twirled his mustache. Everyone close to the hero and heroine was deliriously (unrealistically) happy in their marriages, but the central characters insisted that they could not possibly find happiness in a partner. I could not begin to believe the spy-story subplot. I managed to read almost half of the book before giving up and skipping to the end to see if it ever got better.

In addition, the director attempts to convince us that Iranian husbands roam the streets of Tehran and legally beating up their wives. Hence, the viewer is expected to believe that 2500 years of Iranian history becomes generalized in a two hour account.

Racism aside, this film is seriously lacking in minimum intelligence requirements (room temperature level I.Q., in centigrades if you will). My advice for you is to choose from Amazons other 2.5 million tiltles. Infact, make a random selection, anything you get is better than this nonsense. Not even worth renting at 99 cents a decade.

On the plus side, it came with a decent zippered case."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Work","review":"Used these for the first time today on a friends car.

Over all great cables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumper cables","review":"I purchased these to keep in the trunk and it came with a nice carry bag.I connections to the clips are a bit thin but I did use it once so far for jumping and it worked without exploding.I has instructions on the use right there on the carrying bag which are clear and easy to understand.I would purchase it again.Kevin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leon Uris; One of the Great Historical Novelists","review":"THE HAJ provides possibly the only way for a layman to understand what is currently going on in the Middle East and why it all came to the attack on the WTC and the Pentagon. Uris is the ultimate research persona on the problems of Israel, the Jewish people, the Arabs and the Islams, as well as Ireland. His research is meticulous. Part of his genius is the ability to weave the facts of history into a page turning novel. THE HAJ a must read book if one is to understand this time in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haj is good","review":"This book was great from cover to cover. I'll admit I was interested in the subject matter before reading, but it was unexpectedly great. The colorful characters are diverse and inspiring. The historical aspects made sense and really gave me a fuller understanding of Israeli-Arab relations before during and after Israel's independence. Leon Uris really detailed a richness of the arab/palestinian culture in a very respectful and understanding way and added to my understanding of the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the seeds were planted many years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit by Uris!","review":"This book was a good book by being descriptive and showing truth. The fictional characters are able to connect with you as you flip non stop through the pages. It is truly a book by the great Leon Uris."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this book be any better?","review":"Add factual/historic accuracy, real drama, realistic characters, lots of editing/trimming, a non-racist perspective, and this book could have been something."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Haj","review":"I ordered 3 copies and specified that they be new copies since they were to be Christmas gifts. 1 copy was new; 1 copy had the dust cover torn and was not new but we were given a $10 discount after the vendor shipped; the third copy did not have a dust cover and I doubt that it was new. This was an unsatifactory experience which I will not repeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided writing","review":"\\"Racist\\" is the only word that leaps out of the pages of this novel.

But even so, my instinct told me that there was no way that the Palestinian Arabs are as violent and stupid as Uris portrayed them.Furthermore, if by chance the Arabs are actually as violent and stupid as claimed, then the Jews have shown themselves incredibly stupid for having settled amongst them and let themselves be surrounded by them.So, ironically, the book made the Jews look worse than what Uris probably intended when he wrote it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENLIGHTENING.

Leon Uris is one of my favorites, he writes a good novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth Is Subjective: The Haj Bears Proof","review":"Is Leon Uris trying to deliver a biased message which slanders the Arab people--or is he presenting a people as they truly were, which is interpreted by Western viewpoints as libelous? I choose the former option, and give The Haj five stars. Let me point out that two of the three protagonists, Haj Ibrahim and his son Ishmael (the other being Gideon Asch), are depicted throughout the book as deviants from the apathetic cycle of village Arab life. The Haj must seek peace with Jewish settlers while maintaining a delicate facade with his villagers. Ishmael reaches up and above his pre-ordained station by making himself invaluable to the Haj by way of education. These are forward-looking characters, at least in their hearts if not always in their deeds. That is what makes The Haj such a success as a novel--it is about the battle to overcome adversity and tradition, even in the most rigid of circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"enlightening","review":"I haven't yet finished this book. It does verify what I experienced living in an Arab country for two years. Some Arabs are taught to hate other cultures since an early age. I had a member of a royal family in a class I taught. She hated Hindi's. I asked why, she only said, \\"Because.\\" I know she heard it from her family and friends that Indians and Hindis are the servants and do work unfit for an Arab.This book won't solve problems, but will help to gain some insight into the mind of an Arab (since when would God send a prostitute for use to a believer to show him something???)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant bias leads to disappointment","review":"I enjoy fiction based in a historical setting because it is entertaining but also educational. The Haj was entertaining, the story moved well, the charactors were interesting and it gave a acute perspective on the life of a Palestinian refugee and the struggle for survival. As a book of fiction it was a interesting read. However, Uris' description of the Arab's way of living, from the very negative description of Islam and of Arab family values left me disappointed. His descriptions were so negative that there accuracy clearly came into question. As a result I began to question the whole integrity of the book from a historical perspective which diminished my enjoyment significantly. I am now hesitating reading another Uris book because I don't want to have a similar experience, particularly when there are many other authors to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly","review":"badly written.

Dreadful throughout, and I persevered only because a friend forced the book upon me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"I ordered a used book which was described as \\"good\\". In fact the book is very used And yellowed. It would be stretching it to describe it as \\"fair\\" I am disappointed with this transaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book written with a poison pen ...","review":"Unecessarily & unrealistically divides people into good-guys and bad guys. I read this book after having spent a year on an Israeli kibbutz. A Finnish friend said of Uris's style: \\".. if [Uris] wasn't biased, his story wouldn't be exciting\\". I wonder if that's what Uris had in mind while hammering out \\"Exodus\\" and \\"The Haj\\". **PS: Any of my Kibbutz buddies out there? It's \\"Harry\\" aka \\"Ren\\" and \\"Harendra\\" from Zimbabwe. I live in Australian now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leon Uris doesn't know anything about arabs","review":"This novel is not only very poor since the historical point of view, but is full of falsehood in everything related to the arabs way of life, traditions, culture, moral, etc. If Mr. Uris wrote a novel like this on the israelis, he was called anti-Semitic or something worse. This book is disrespectful toward serious readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly biased and offensive to the arab culture","review":"It is sad to see so much bias and propaganda against the arab culture. Not only this book degrades the arab culture and religion, it also potrays the jewish culture as so advanced and open-minded... when both are so untrue.I cannot judge for the historical facts mentioned in the story, but I can say that although the fiction part of the story is good, it is very poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For An Understanding Of The Middle East Conflict","review":"Leon Uris has given us a great gift in writing The Haj. It is an honest and beautifully written background of the conflict that has raged for so many generations. This is, I feel, the best work of Leon Uris. It is fascinating and exciting from beginning to end, poignant, and heartbreaking. This should be required reading in today's increasingly troubled times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Haj","review":"This is the third time I have read this book and it never fails to fascinate me. I purchased a copy for my daughter and told her that if she wants to understand the Israeli/Middle East crisis in today's terms, she must read this to have an understanding of what is going on today. It is as historical as history, although fiction. Attitudes have not changed and are still prevelant throughout the area. Change is said to be constant, but not in the Middle East. This book is reality in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and Entertaining","review":"Just skews a rating of 5/5. One of Uris's bests books and certainingly a very timely and relevent topic for today's uncertain times. Breathes life into the fascinating Arab culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author can't decide on a style","review":"The characters in the book couldn't seem to decide whether they were highly stylized larger (or smaller) than life characters and that resulted in poor understanding of what the author was trying to say. I didn't get it. I enjoyed the book until what seemed like the author just lost interest, and found an ending with no meaning. I am going to read another Uris novel and see if there is a thread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uris' The Haj","review":"Excellent insight into the Arab mind from a Jew. Very relevant for all the issues in the news and the fact that he wrote the book in the 80s. A lot of hate and anger in the book and still today, Arab-Moslem hate and anger in the news every night...Jews and Hamas going at it tonight! Peace in the middle east...what a joke! Like all of Uris' books a great story written around historical facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Haj","review":"I always enjoy Leon Uris' books, and this was a real treat as always. The whole story reveals the reasons for the Muslim animosity for the Jewish people, and why the hate continues today. That is all they have ever wanted to learn or teach their children. A real Palestinian state never existed as they like to claim today. It was always just a country called Palestine with nothing but a collection of independent tribes that only hate for Jews made them have any cohesion of any sort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Haj","review":"THis is a fascinating book looking at the middle east from an arab point of view.

I will keep this book for as long as I rent property."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview, but know your state and local laws","review":"This book provides a great overview of landlord tenant (LT) law, including general principles and issues that you might run into. The Amazon review lists the different chapters in the book, so check that out to see if a topic of interest to you is covered.If I had to highlight one \\"negative,\\" it's that you MUST educate yourself on the local vagaries of LT law in your state, county, and city. A book like this really cannot cover the law of the tens of thousands of counties all across the US, so please don't fool yourself into thinking that this book is all you need, albeit it provides a great foundation on LT issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for buying and maintaining your property","review":"This book is an excellent resource for buying and maintaining investment property. Its step by step approach is easy to follow and read. Excellent sections on insurance including property coverage and personal liability. It might be too basic for someone that already knows about rental property but for someone starting out, the level of detail is great. Hopefully I wont need to call on the sections for problem renters, but having this book handy as a reference manual is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unuseable PDF forms","review":"This book seems to have a wealth of information and includes a CD with numerous forms, the Word documents are very useful. The PDF forms are not. The problem is none of them are editable. Why even include them? Why not creat them in Word format? This is unsatisfactory and a complete waste of time. Why even provide the forms electronically if you can't customize them, you might as well buy a book with the paper forms and photo copy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for landlords and tenants!","review":"As a long-time tenant, I've dealt with a broad range of property issues. Broken windows, poor heating, broken appliances...the list runs the gamut. While I opt to fix as much as I can, I turned to this book when I wanted more information regarding my rights and responsibilities as a tenant. It wisely guides the reader through legalese and presents important legal information in an easy-to-read style that non-lawyers can truly appreciate. It is, of course, an excellent guide for landlords as well, from buying the property to managing, evicting and dealing with problem tenants. Great for either side, it's more than just a handy reference-it's an essential tool no landord (or tenant!) should be without."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"i realy enjoy reading this book it helps me understand without confusing me with law terms that would intimidate the average person who is not a lawyer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain and simple...","review":"the definitive legal guide.

The tunes have a \\"in the pocket\\" feel that is an obvious reflection of a band that is a finely honed machine having playing hundreds of gigs in it's lifetime. Unfortunately, what was happening within the bands circle, is a total contradiction to what plays on this excellent effort. This BGO release does an excellent job with the sound - however - the liner notes doesn't even acknowledge nor address this album choosing instead to give us a brief account of the band's history. Oh, well, summer's here and this record (cd) belongs in your car especially if you plan to just cruise on down the highway.

As a fan, you are disappointed with the lack of rock-steady beats but you have to admire their attempt to strike out in a new style. Unfortunately, they miss more than they hit but memorable tunes like \\"Victoria Gardens\\", \\"Michael Caine\\" and \\"Wings of A Dove\\" make it a worth while listen. If you love Madness' quirky style and can live without the ska , pick up this CD. Hey, you can't beat it for $6.97!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The end is nigh...or is it?","review":"Rise & Fall was unbeatable, but Madness followed it up with this moody & original work. Brand New Beat, Prospects & Give Me a Reason are simply superb & the sadly never to be released as a single, Victoria Gardens is probably one of thier best works. The title track, ranks as one of my all time favourites, none your usual verse, chorus, verse, chorus rubbish here.

They state, \\"if it seems the blanket isn't heating, gently fold it into fours and slip your hand beneath the folds. You'll feel the warmth of the working blanket.\\" It's a bit like being told to stick your hand in a toaster after it fails to toast your bread. Apparently any bit of heat this blanket produces qualifies it as a \\"working blanket\\".The problem is that I can't sleep between the folds where the \\"warmth\\" is, only beneath it where the heat doesn't generate towards the bed.

Robust natural flavors really come out when cooking this way. The pan itself is remarkably light because there's a hollow core between the two walls of the sides (which insulates & keeps food hot after you take it off the stove).

However, the book soon devolved into the book on the \\"equipment\\" not bad if you keep it reasonably brief but it occupies to much of the book. Secondly I was hoping for more updated information and use of other human senses, hearing, smell etc. its not there but the current tactics seem to be to paint daylight over the night, not always a good idea. Thirdly It seems that when honing the other human senses in the dark was once basic to training,technology not being as advanced as now, those who learn the art of moving unaided through the darkness will make it even if the batteries go flat. For equipment buffs a good read for those looking for the edge in the dark with no gear wait for the next edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book is a waste of money. Anything found in this book can be located on the internet, or from anyone who is reasonably knowledgable about the use of tactical firearms.

Having found R&H musicals to be excellent family fare, suitable for our 8 year old with plenty of re-watchability, we found this title to be disappointing.While I suppose the gloomy storyline and adult oriented themes may be pleasing to some, our entire family found this picture to be unpleasant. The few good production numbers (i.e. \\"June is Busting Out All Over\\") aren't enough to overcome the negative feel.

However, that is not where the issues end. The layer change is one of the most abrupt I have ever encountered, pausing long enough to make one think the disc is locking up. The image itself also is full of defects. In Chapter 13 (the soliloquy) Gordon McCray's trousers, as well as some of the background, begin to shimmer, and blend in together. In at least two places, the image jumps. Most noticeable is the scene on the dock where Julie hugs Nettie. If you step through the images using slow motion, it is easy to see the jump was a transfer \\"hiccup\\".This is a great movie....rather dark for a musical.

The love story between the two is not developed and you wonder why she would ever want to marry such a man in the first place. You never see any redeeming qualities, not even when he is in heaven.

I have long been a Rodgers and Hammerstein fan, and was very pleased to find a set that includes so many of the movies.But there is one thing missing: Rodgers and Hammerstein made seven movie musicals, but the boxed set only includes six.

Their love song, 'If I Loved You,' is brilliant, and Gordon's tremendous rendition of the \`Soliloquy' by the sea is what I would call an Aria (used many times in operas).

There are many good anthologies of literature on the Asian American experience. This is not one of them.Some of the contributors give good sincere accounts of what it is like to grow up as an Asian American female in the United States. Unfortunately, many others are infected with the politically correct racism against whites and males that they learned in the expensive universities their parents paid for them to attend.I especially love the account by a half black, half Asian American who feels understandibly upset at rejection by both groups. It's an easy call to figure out that the ethnic separatist attitudes promoted by books like this just might lead to rejection of others. Unfortunately, she \\"learns\\" in Feminimism for Boneheads at her university that somehow racist white America is responsible. OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish this book was around when I was a teenager","review":"I agree with the reader below, this is a sweet collection of stories.

The Sportster 4 has all the features I wanted and the antennas I had for the previous Starmate are copmpatible for the newer unit. It has a good display and features.

I did receive a free month for my trouble; I just wish I could hear the free service.Another fun Sirius experience to share: I called technical support (Tues Oct 16) and their customer service person got agitated and hung up on me.

Howard Stern comes in nice and clear now! :-)I agree that the FM transmitter is a bit weak. Of course, using the FM transmitter has other problems as well since you need to keep finding channels that don't get any interference as you drive around. Solution? Do yourself a favor... if your car does not have an AUX IN port (obviously it does not if you are using the FM transmitter feature)... USE AN FM MODULATOR. I purchased a wired FM modulator, a GLI (ground loop interrupt) and the required cables (including some special antenna adaptor cables for a Subaru) for about $75. I spent about 3 hours installing it... an now I have a mini-jack connection to my radio... no more interference from any radio station... crystal clear connection... and the bonus is that I can plug my iPod into it as well!Google up \\"scoshe FM modulator\\" and you will get the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product until Sirius fixes major problems","review":"Most people that have the older units can use the Fm transmitter so that you can listen to Sirius through any radio. The new ones have turned down the transmitting power so low that it will not even work in a car unless you buy an FM signal booster of some kind. I bought a new one and just thought it was faulty. I got it replaced only to find out Sirius has turned the fm signal down so low it won't even work in the car and does not even come with the fm out wire like my old one did.

The acting is believable, and the location is fresh and the changes in setting keep the action vivid. There is an interesting medely of ages and personalities in the roles portrayed-making the apocalypse type situation more real.There are thrills on all different levels in this movie; There is an ever-evolving crisis full of action and suspense, but there are some cerebral components and plot twists that kept me in-the-movie for a while after it ended. The screenplay offers some questions to the viewer.If you like to worry about zombie-like freaks like I do, then this will be right up your alley. Fugue State will also hopefully motivate you to get off your bahookie and get prepared, because the zombie apocalypse is COMING.

This is one that I wish I hadn't found. I think all the other reviewers must have watched a different movie than I did or maybe found some great peyote out in the desert while wandering west to east and east to west while pretending to time travel. The acting wasn't all that great, and neither was the script. The story and the beginning had promise, but it got lost and took a wrong turn on the way to the end. Speaking of the end, it wasn't a big surprise. It was broadcast all throughout the movie in not-so-subtle clues, regardless of what direction people were wandering out in the desert. I much preferred Exit Humanity, a well-made low budget zombie movie.

The internal tray is handy for auxiliary percussion storage.However, I've used it for a few weeks, about 5 gigs, and already the rubber bumpers on the bottom of the case have broken off. Not a huge deal, but for this kind of cash I'd expect them to last longer. Also, I've had to make a repair/replacement of one of the inside straps.

Although I don't doubt Ms. Altea's ability to summon the spirits, I felt that the pages of this book were fraught with egotism--how many times does she mention her \\"healing\\" organization, and talk about her special gifts? Nevertheless, the healings she writes about aren't really healings at all, since no one really gets healed, and most of the people to whom she \\"gave healing\\" ended up dying. I also found some of the intimate personal details rather offensive, including the rambling account of her relationship with an alcoholic. I fail to see how anyone could be inspired by, or learn anything from such an account. Worst of all was her even more rambling search for the meaning of the Ten Commandments. In spite of having a couple of interesting insights here and there, I really felt the book was self-indulgent and a bloody waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Graphic : (","review":"Although highly interested in RoseMary and her work, I was shocked at the graphic descriptions of her abuse.

This book does answer a lot about spirit guides and what their purpose is which I personally find to be important.

It appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the director, Tati. Unfortunately, the video transfer on this edition is so terribly soft, as though the telecine was not in focus.

Not-So-Great Solo Artist","review":"Tony Banks is the most important member of Genesis - but not the only member. It's almost as if he needs Collins and Rutherford to keep his ideas in line. Banks lacks good musical judgement: the melodies and song construction are there - but the arrangements, cheesey keyboard sounds, and poor musical choices make this album close to unlistenable. That being said, it's still nice that Banks did the lead vocals on this CD - he should have sung all his own material... Great team player, not-so-great solo artist.

What we have here is an album with almost no direction, the music is flat(his Genesis work soars in comparison), and the lyrics read like a valentine from a shy 14 year-old. What we have here are basically what was left on the cutting floor when Abacab and Duke were conceived. Those are both spectacular Genesis albums, and I am glad this material was excluded from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes, who let Tony out of the cage?","review":"I love Phil's solo work. I love Peter's solo work. I even like Mike Rutherford's work with Mike & the Mechanics, but Tony Banks should never ever make a solo album again, and I bet he would be the first to admit it. This is one bad album by a great keyboard player, however \\"Man of Spells\\" is one of the great dumb titles of rock an roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressed!","review":"This is my second Tony Banks' album. The first was 'Still', which features Nik Kershaw and Fish as vocalists with one song sung by Banks. After listening to 'Fugitive' and hearing Tony Banks sing, I was really impressed. I didn't know he could sing! He could pass for a lead singer and I wonder why he hasn't continued to develop as a singer and composer. Banks has a 'haunting' quality to his voice and the first song, 'This is Love' is a hit with my sister, who isn't even a Genesis fan. I am amazed that Tony Banks has not become more well known as a solo artist. Give this album a listen - it will surprise you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony on Vocals -- Better than he thinks he is .....","review":"From the early 80's comes another Tony Banks album recorded during a Genesis hiatus. Tony handles all the singing on this second solo effort. Despite his self-deprecating comments in interviews, I think he handles the task nicely. The songs are not as mellow as on the album \\"A Curious Feeling\\" and there is a nice blend of instrumental and vocal tracks.

Ransom tells the story of a young American ex-pat living in Japan, who tries to lose himself in an ascetic existence, and the study of Karate. There's a certain inevitability to the story, but the end is no less forceful for being predictable. Like its protagonist, the book has a quiet, calm charm. The writing is simple and lucid, and carries you along easily. As always in McInerney novels, the sadder whole is leavened with plenty of humour. The ways in which East and West romanticize each others' cultures provide for some side-splitting moments. The Japanese in the novel are all trying for American cool, and the Americans are all trying to reach Nirvana. A quiet, compelling, entertaining read. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"In modern Japan, Ransom learns about karate, life, and death","review":"Jay McInerney does for karate what Robert Pirsig did for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. The book centers around the experiences of an American expatriate recovering from a tragic experience in the Himalayas.

People move about meaningless lives without purpose. The \\"protagonist\\" merely drifts through a life which offers him a potential to engage at every turn, which he either doesn't recognize, actively avoids. When he IS finally forced to take action, the plot is cliche, but you figure, you hope, you PRAY that it will be redeemed by something in the end. Meanwhile you've got an antagonist that was lifted almost directly from The Karate Kid. The \\"twist\\" ending never validates a single one of the pages you've wasted your life reading, and ultimately adds up to a useless stack of paper with no soul or meaning.True Story: The moment I finished reading this book, I stood up, strolled across the lunchroom, and threw it into the garbage can, so no one would ever need waste brain cells on its pages again.I hate Ransom like I hate Illinois Nazis.

Blended into the daily life of Ransom is a humor that is more unusual than any I have ever read.

The author mostly states the obvious, over and over again. Also, the content is not well organized and very repetitive (oops, did I say that already?). I did not gather any new coping strategies from this book. In addition, the author recommends several times that parents should let a babysitter handle their child if the child is resisting certain rituals like eating, bathing, dressing, etc... That is not helpful advice for parents who actually want to learn to deal with their children's changing behavior.

But for those of us in the world of limited discretionary income, it looks more like advice that makes me want to join the 3 year old in having a tantrum and meltdown, throwing the book.The best I can say about this book is that it is somewhat reassuring to learn that it isn't just your 3 year old who acts psychotic, and yours probably isn't a very short sociopath, but a normal 3 year old.Good luck finding a sitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is over 20 years old, advice is totally out of date!","review":"This was a wasted purchase, advice is so out of date it is laughable!I had planned to give it to my daughter for my 3 year old granddaughter, but there's no way she would have been interested in it, I ended up reading some of it and gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Worthless.

In Healing Trauma, he has written a slim companion book to the first book, describing his 12-phase trauma-recovery program and providing an audio CD of his somatic experiencing exercises.This book may be useful for those who have experienced a minor trauma and who would like to try using Levine's techniques. However, for those with a more complex trauma history (multiple losses or an abuse history), I recommend this book and CD be used in conjunction with therapy, as the techniques are oversimplified in the book.Rahasya Poe, Lotus Guide Magazine and Author of \\"To Believe Or Not To Believe: The Social & Neurological Consequences of Belief Systems\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"shouldn't be sold on kindle","review":"The content of this book is excellent.

He addresses heavy duty physical trauma as well as everyday stress. It incorporates past and present experience. This audio cassette draws on meditations that I have become used to from psychology, but the wonderful difference is the author's explanation of trauma in biological terms. Animals have natural responses to stress and attack. (I particularly was interested in his explanation of immobilization as a biological defense.) Animals also have natural ways of coming out of trauma. I now have a biological context for what I once only knew as abstract psychological truths. I understand my own personal immobilization as a healthy biological defense rather than as some sort of psychic deficiency. Understanding this helps me come out of immobilization at a physical level. I am grateful to these cassettes for this insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Levine does it again","review":"I was introduced to the work of Peter Levine several years ago with his book \\"Waking the Tiger\\" so was very interested to see his most recent work.

In particular, I am gently touched by her imagery of Christ as Mother.

I have never read such a raunchy, tasteless, and offensive piece of literary filth such as this. Littledog's language and style is extremely vulgar. In no way does this novel discuss women's work, but is instead a chronicle of the author's own lewd and sordid experiences, with only a sprinkling of details about her unsuccessful business attempts.

I wanted it to add heat or bite to food in a way that regular hot sauce didn't. This product does not do that.In fact, with the quality of the product in mind, this product appears to have no purpose. I can find any hot sauce for the same price or less than the cost of this bottle that provides more cayenne per drop than the contents of this. The alcohol does not stop the cayenne from being hot, the alcohol mixes with the cayenne oils and makes direct ingestion of this disgusting. The cayenne content in the liquid is so small as to be able to take a single cayenne pill and get more out of it. Putting it on food to create bite alters the taste of the food significantly and not in a good way, and doesn't even give bite.Taking into account all aspects of this product, I don't understand what it is for.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writer to be treasured!","review":"Taylor is an exceedingly fine writer..one that will give you pause when taking up your next books!

I contacted Lawlor, and subsequently took him to the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia to meet with eminent Ngarinyin Lawman the late David Mowaljarlai and his countrymen. Robert Lawlor has written the most comprehensive, authoritative book on Aboriginal spirituality in life. It is masterful. He encouraged me to write a book on my own knowledge and experience with the Ngarinyin people. This I did. Men's Business Women's Business: The Spiritual Role of Gender in the World's Oldest Culture published by Inner Traditions International (US)was inspired by Voices of the First Day. Unlike many who write about Aboriginal culture and philosophy Robert's diligent attention to authenticity is unsurpassed. This book has my unequivocal recommendation. A modern masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"The Aboriginal culture depicted in this book bears little resemblance to that of the people I've spent most of my life working with. Alongside his often bizarre, and unfounded, specultations on Aboriginal beliefs, origins and abilities, Lawlor almost exclusively draws on the past (and very old ethnological sources) to describe Aboriginal life and culture - apparently deciding that living, contemporary Aboriginal culture is of little interest. Aboriginal people are not stuck in the past, nor are they representatives of a past way of life that Westerners can identify with and make themselves feel better. They have (and have always had) a living changing culture, but you wouldn't know it from this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure","review":"Robert Lawlor has an incredible ability to bridge between cultures. His descriptions of Aboriginal perceptual reality made exquisitely good sense to my rational mind and at the same time relaxed its rigidity and stretched it.

He is an armchair anthropologist who has never lived among indigenous Australians and spins a tale that has little bearing on the real world of indigenous culture. \\"Bulldust\\" is the Australian epithet for such radical departures from the truth. If you want to really grapple with indigenous Australian spirituality there are better texts by scholars who have actually lived with aborigines. Amazon readers should try Zohl De Istar's \\"Holding Yawalwu\\" as a case in point.

However the opening mechanism is EXTREMELY unuserfriendly! You have to push a button (which is only on 1 side), pull up the handle, then pull up and hold the middle of the gate door and swing open. I can only assume the pulling up part is a sort of secondary safety to keep the gate closed even though the handle is not engaged. Guests and babysitter have a HECK of a time figuring out how to open the gate. One of my late arriving family members \\"forced\\" it open (didn't do the pull up and hold) and it came crashing down in my hardwood hallwall at 4am .... it was NOT appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functionable but not convenient","review":"This gate serves its purpose and stands firm and wont come down but it really isn't made for a busy mom or family. The gate isn't difficult to assemble if you aren't at the maximium width but our entrance way was 48 inched which requires 2 extention kits (142.00 later) the maximum width is 48.5 so tightening the screws is a tricky task you will need separte tools even though it doesn't say so the wrench they give you couldn't tighten anything. This gate was really our only option since we don't want to drill holes and the first steps gate can't be extended this long.

Unfortunately, it put a hole in our wall from the tension. Would recommend placing this gate only on reinforced walls or doors.

Difficult to adjust the tension, especially the lower nuts with carpeted floors. We replaced this gate with the \\"Soft and Wide\\" by Evenflo (much gentler on our walls, doesn't leave marks and adjusts to fit various size openings).Would not buy this Kidco gate again, but we would definitely buy the \\"Hands-Free Gate\\" by First Years.

Latching mechanism.","review":"I bought this gate (and the KidCo Safeway Gate) after reading good reviews. Both had major design flaws in my view. I would not recommend either to anyone.This gate's latching mechanism is too complicated and made of cheap plastic. There is a small button that you need to press every time you open the gate. If you don't, the latch breaks. Without fail, everyone who tries to open the gate for the first time doesn't press the button. Just a matter of time before it breaks. It's also difficult to open with one hand.The Safeway gate claims that it only opens in one direction to prevent it from opening over the stairs. The mechanism used to do this is two little plastic nubs that are insufficient for the job. It was very easy to push the gate over the stairs, with only minor resistance.I am an engineer and installed both gates absolutely correctly.Do not buy these gates.

I tried to put it up and felt that it was absolutely a safety hazard for our child. There is no doubt that he could topple this and fall down the stairs. After days of waiting for a response, the first response was \\"tell us more\\". The second response was \\"you will have to pay for return shipping AND a restocking fee\\".Not to mention, the photo shows 3 extensions and they only ship 2.

The gate does not work at the maximum advertised width, like 37 1/2 inches without extensions, etc. The gate is absolutely dangerous. If you set the tension per instructions with the gauge included, your 11-month old WILL open it. With the handle locked in place, all you have to do is pull up on the door and it is unlatched. My son can't even walk yet and he opened it. He pulls himself up to his feet against the gate. Then he lifts up on the bars, which frees it, and since he is leaning against it... kaboom!

I managed to get one knee out but had to put vegtable oil on the other one to free it. She of course was screaming the whole time and her knees were bruised. Very nice design but I bought it for safety and that's not what I got. The company said they just shortened the space between the rails, but I think it's too close now seeing how her knees got stuck.

A woman that we've met before...Cassie Neill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting read of serial murder, old & young love","review":"Kay Hooper has a the ability to to make you question & make you believe. Out of the Shadows is a book that lets us look into ourselves & still delivers a true terror taunt. Ms. Hooper is one of the few authors today who remind us that while the search for a killer goes on so does the rest of our lives. The mundane must be dealt with & faced even has horror distracts us. A great read that has me searching for more of her works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci Fi Hard to swallow","review":"This is enough for me, I can't take any more of these preposterous stories. FBI doesn't use Kevlar vests? No they would rather depend on a handy healer! Surrre.Don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I had a hard time finishing OUT OF THE SHADOWS. Although it is evident that KAY HOOPER is a skilled writer, her characters in this book felt like paper - no depth. I think the main reason for this is Ms. Hooper's success in keeping the characters to themselves and not reveal too much about who they really were inside. Unfortunately, this left me, as the reader, cold and unconnected to the characters and what was unfolding in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense - Creepy","review":"With this book Kay Hooper managed to have me looking in every closet, double checking my doors... It was a great supernatural thriller that I recommend to all that can stomach it. I wasn't too keen on the Weje Board but Kay managed to tie it all together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Author Coming Out of the Shadows","review":"Usually, if someone is not dead in the first ten pages, I'm not interested. I am a reader who is very difficult to please, but I must say all of Kay Hooper's Shadows series novels have enthralled me - this last Out of the Shadows being the best yet. There is something in this novel to satisfy a wide range of tastes. You have your murders, suspense, romantic tension and just a touch of the supernatural thrown in for good measure. This is a definite must read - I have shared them with everyone in my office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read! Very entertaining and enjoyable!","review":"For those who like paranormal mysteries with a touch of romance, this book works great!!! It is a very enjoyable read that will keep you entertained right to the very end!!! I definitely will read more Kay Hooper books!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I haven't read anything by Kay Hooper since reading her contribution to the Delaney saga many years ago. I was extremely happy I picked up this book! It was impossible to put down. I am fascinated with FBI profiling, forensics, and crime, and this book was right up my alley. The characters of John and Miranda flow together in perfect symmetry, and she makes sure to leave the door open for other books to follow with the recurring characters without seeming too hokey, sort of like Nora Roberts does. The book sends chills up your spine and makes you feel like you are inside the silence of the lambs. My only complaint was the lack of steam in the book, but even that was surpassed by superior storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice thriller!","review":"I picked this up at an aiport store and it is the first Kay Hooper I have ever read. I guess I started at the end of the trilogy but found the story very exciting. Teenagers were turning up missing in this little town and Sheriff Miranda Knight calls in the FBI profilers to help her with the case. FBI's premier profiler, Noah Bishop, is an old 'friend' of the Sheriff's and the story goes from there. Pretty interesting. It got me thru a plane trip and I hope I didnt ruin it for myself by starting at the end of the trilogy. Has some Xfiles features and if you like that sort of this, this may be your cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds your attention","review":"I thought this was a very good story but a little tedious in working up to what Bishop actually did, and then you find out that he didn't actually do anything that terrible except withdraw when she needed him. The build up to it almost leads you to believe that he personally destroyed her family. I also didn't care much for the ending and the person who turned out to be the killer. It was almost like an afterthought thrown in. The story seemed to point more towards Alex. There was also no real motive given for the torture (such as strangling and reviving) if he was only interested in scientific experiments. He sounded a little too insane to have maintained such a normal appearance for so many years and even become a well respected figure in the town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Love all of the shadows books they keep you reading long in the nite Bishop has a great team of experts working for him"},{"rating":"2","title":"out of the shadows","review":"I have read the 3 trilogy's and loved all.

During Mother's Day card making time and after school, when his mom's partner picks him up, Antonio doesn't know how to deal with peer pressure. He is teased often and this confuses him because he loves his moms and his family. This book nicely portrays one boys struggle to fit in without hurting anyone's feelings. The book is written in english and spanish on each page. The love in the story overpowers the basic illustrations. A feel good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"This book is really awesome and teaches more than one identity (race, language, and sexual orientation). Some may view it as controversial, but I believe it really teaches many lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Research The Material","review":"This book was written after the Cadillac LaSalle Clubs Grand National in 1997. Many of the pictures were taken at that event. Unfortunatly, it appears that the author spent a couple of days taking photos and doing mediocre research at best. Many photos are inaccurately described. It would seem that this book was published to make a quick dollar as opposed to providing an accurate history of the Cadillac automobile. As a member of the Cadillac-LaSalle Club, I consider it a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Of Errors","review":"This book was obviously written and edited by people who know absolutely nothing about Cadillacs. There are glaring inaccuracies on almost every page-misidentified cars, production dates, features, etc., etc. It almost defies belief. The book does contain many beautiful photos but the rest of the book is utter garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice little stickers","review":"Kids love to use these stickers for their crafts.

On the down side, the writer doesn't fully address some of the later models that were included as Full Classics by the CCCA after it's publication, ie the 160's and Clippers of the 40's. Also, he includes his political opinion in several places which is unappealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Design and Contorl oc Concrete Mixtures","review":"One of the best sources of information on concrete I have found.

I first hesitated because Angelina was a mouse who does not look like Mickey Mouse, instead looks rather like a real mouse, but all the pictures are so wonderfully detailed and cute. Not only my nieces love the story, but they are also interested in other things in the pictures (e.g. posters and toys in Angelina's bedroom etc). They have been reading it over and over, and each time they report me the things they noticed in the pictures. I am not sure if it is recommandable for little boys for the girly storyline, yet I am sure it is a great book for girls, especially who loves ballet."},{"rating":"2","title":"a mom's review....","review":"beautifully illustated, heartwarming childrens stories. Even though the Angelina stories are geared towards girls, my little boy, at 8, enjoyed these as well, especially when mom read to him. These are good stories to read to your child at bedtime.The artwork is detailed and delightful to look at-you'll see new things each time you look, and children love that that every scene is filled with many little mice.This Angelina story deals with doing your best-even if you're not picked to lead. Each book is filled with wonderful life lessons told in a gentle, non preachy way.I highly recommend this series for any child.5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Children's Book for Ballerina Lover","review":"I love this book from my own childhood and have very much enjoyed sharing it with my little princess.

Why \\"Prissy\\" of course, the most annoying of teenagers. Now I'm not saying Tanya Allen is bad in the role, I'm saying the role is bad, she's just good at being annoying. The series is watchable but it's about what one might expect from a fancast rather than a studio backed tv-series.

I bought it as I have many other series relying on this claim. So I'm not viewing this series which makes it as worthless as possible and I rate it accordingly.

I throughly enjoyed it and i liked how they focused on the infamous Frog Brothers that we were introduced to in the first one. I enjoyed especially the performance of the cutesy chick in the comic store who so clearly was crushin' on Corey Feldman.

I would classify it as a hilarious comedy now. Young kids will love it for what it is and people my age will get a good laugh and relish on our youth. The songs are classic, Pippi is classic, and the movie in general is classic. Simply put, it's classic! Buy it, rent it, do whatever you must to watch this movie, because what is it kids? That's right, it is classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children's Favorite","review":"I could not believe this was in Amazon's collection of movies. Pippi Longstocking lived with our family for years.

So when I came across this movie I had to invite her back to visit my grandchildren."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs with a female heroine","review":"Bought this for my adult nephew and his little girl.

If more movies were based on these values, a child would have many more choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pippi Longstocking DVD","review":"Great to find this dvd of daughter's favorite childhood movie; our old one had somehow 'magically' disappeared.

The very first day we had it they watched it 3 times!!! They still watch it at least 5 times a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Leap!","review":"This movie takes me back to a time when life was carefree and simple. I really enjoyed the imagination and wonder this film brought. The simple humor was a real stretch, especially with the donkey. It was about forgetting the everyday reality and leaping to a world of fun and play. Pippi has a big heart, despite the personalities of the characters. She even helped the orphans to treats and games. I can't think of another character who's so loving and adventurous at the same time. It's great for kids and adults!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Psychotic Pippi","review":"I saw the Swedish Pippi Longstocking movies and I liked them but this American remake is a real stinker!Pippi Longstocking is susposed to be about 9 or 10 years old and Tami Erin the actress who played Pippi in this reamke looked like she was at least 14 years old and instead of coming across as spunky and fun-loving like in the books and Swedish movies this Pippi came across as a psycho!"},{"rating":"1","title":"movie","review":"cant be played in australia and didnt say so in the write up not happy I now hav a movie I can never watch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pippi","review":"This was DEFINITELY worth the money!

I don't recommend it if you already knew original one. So story do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Movie","review":"I have to admit, this movie is creative with its portrayal of the characters. However, I get the feeling that the film is painfully low-budget. While the main trio of kids capture their characters, the writing makes them very bland, uninteresting characters. Pippi still has the carefree attitude and friendliness that Lindgren's writing conveyed, but Tommy and Annika both seem to have lost any personality they had originally, and they originally only really existed to be shown as ordinary middle-class children. The storyline is very good, and the movie is appealing to younger viewers. However, the sub-plot of the men hoping to tear down Villa Villikulla feels like they're trying to pad the film out, and it would have been better to leave that out.Overall, the movie is worth a watch once, but you'd be better off reading the books about Pippi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pippi makes the kids say yippie","review":"My kids love this movie. They didn't want to watch it because \\"Dad that movie is old.\\" Yes it is old as far as they (9 yr old boy and 7 yr old girl) are concerned but I bribed them into watching it and they loved it. My daughter watches this several times a week. I think my son has a thing for Pippi. This is a good family movie and unlike the \\"family\\" movies they put out today you don't have to hit the FF button because there are no family un-friendly parts. Buy this movie and spend an evening with the kids. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"If you've ever read Pippi Longstocking you will be disappointed from the first sighting of Pippi in this film. Just wrong!

It was one of the worst films I have had to sit through with them and that is saying something seeing as how they have gone through an ELMO phase, a Telletubbie phase, a Wiggles period, a Lazy Town year and a half, etc. Needless to say I have been exposed to some VERY cheese-ball media thanks to my children....but none of those can compare to this film. Maybe if I had indulged in some psychedelic pharmaceuticals prior to watching I may have felt less like slitting my throat but I don't think so. I would rather stick hot pokers in various orifices than watch this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid's-Lit Classic Denigrated!","review":"The makers of this film did not understand \\"Pippi Longstocking\\" at all.

So I thought the movie would be an easy way to let her know about Pippi. I think the movie has a lot of bad behavior and disrespect for adults in it. The beginning was pretty scary with the storm too. So I won't let my daughter watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"I thought this movie was so dumb when I saw it. They made up so much stuff in it that didn't happen in the Pippi Longstocking books.I hated how Pippi was so fresh when she was in the orphange. Don't see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost puked after 10 minutes of watching","review":"This is a stupid nonsense movie,where the writer was most likely doing a hard drug.

Works well, perfect size. Only complaint is that it doesn't make noise so I kinda have to keep an eye on it to see how much pressure is on compared to the old weighted variety. I'd give it 5 stars, but it was kinda pricy and is too quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really squirrel proof","review":"All the squirrel has to do is push its head through the cage and it has easy access to the suet, and the spaces are wide enough that the squirrel's head slips in and out easily. It took a while for the critters to figure it out, but once they did they were very happy! It does a great job, however, of keeping larger birds like Jays and Starlings away from the suet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the past","review":"Great examples of historical quilts with patterns you can make yourself. Love the section on Log Cabin quilt variations and the scalability chart so you can see what size blocks you could make with different size strips.It is important to keep our history alive and to show new generations what was done in the past and can be done again, many times more easily than in the past.Just love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HearthGate is kidsafe!","review":"Hearthgate shipped on time without problems. Installation went reasonably smooth, after drilling the masonry to attach the wall mounts.

Our new woodstove insert can blast away and we have no worries that our 17 month boy will be in harms way with this gate system."},{"rating":"1","title":"not fulfilled","review":"They put teaser price and then sent an email informing the product is out of stock ie it was advertised at a higher price..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quality gate - just as pictured","review":"Every other baby gate we found was hideously ugly, unless you pay someone to install a custom gate. I used this gate to separate my son's play area from the rest of the house, so I didn't quite use it for the purpose intended, but it worked very well. Only problem for that purpose is that the major part of the gate's stability comes from bending each individual gate - if you run it straight across the room, it will fall over very easily. So I've got zig zagging a bit, but it looks fine.I like it so much I'm buying another one to run along the exterior wall to keep him away from the power outlets and our low windows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic hinges broke immediately","review":"I really liked this gate, BUT, as soon as we opened it, 3 or 4 of the plastic hinges cracked. I was very surprised. Then, I was sad to see that others had the same trouble. So, I had to return. : ( We exchanged for the Metal Superyard and have been very happy (and that one was surprisingly less expensive, which was a perk)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Nice.","review":"We got this a couple of days after we ordered it. Very nice service. It is very attractive and sturdy. We placed it around a wood stove and it works great. I had read the reviews about the plastic pieces breaking just out of the box, so I took a real good look at how it was folded and read the directions about how to unfold it. Turns out if u just yank it open it will probably break. Which I might have done if I had not read reviews After reading directions.. I pulled up on the plastic hinges and pushed down on the gate to slightly separate them and all sections opened with no problem and no breaking. It's a great investment to keep the kiddos safe. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but expensive","review":"This is a great gate very duable we use it around our heater so my one year old will nor burn herself. I love the fact it is very strong and works well around oddly shaped items. This gate is however very expensive and I would have gone with something not so expensive but this gate is the only one like it in metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"KidCo Hearth Gate","review":"This is a really good gate. We have it up around our woodstove to keep our toddler and dogs away. It is taller than I expected, which is good, and it's very sturdy. I thought we were going to have to mount it to the wall, but it stands on it's own very well. I do wish it came in a few other section lengths to make it more customizable, but it's really quite good as it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Good product. It looks good and is flexible/versatile. The plastic connectors seem a bit cheap--3 of ours arrived broken (in shipping). That's our only concern."},{"rating":"1","title":"KidCo Hearth Gate","review":"We are on our second Hearth Gate this year. The plastic pieces that are supposed to swivel when you open the gate don't swivel like they are supposed to and it snaps! It is a great gate, it keeps the kids away from our wood burning stove and it looks attractive given the purpose but for the price, I would have expected better quality. I am going to call the company to see if this part can be replaced or else I will have to make another return. I would give up at this point but I don't know of another hearth gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for SMALL children","review":"I installed this around our living room wood stove shortly after my daughter was born. It has worked very well. I did of course add some custom spacers where it's meant to attach to the wall and also sunk screws through the bottom rail to stiffen it up some. We've also noticed with the appropriate 20 some inches of gap between it and our stove face it barely feels warm to the touch, even when the fires BLAZING!My only suggestions to improve it are: Lower the price!, and add some small support brace across the top edge of the pieces that make up the corners. The plastic adjusting hinges can only standup to so much leverage against them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for homes with fireplaces!","review":"We moved into a new home a year ago, and this is the first thing I purchased for it - and couldn't be happier with it! We have a wood burning stove in the kitchen, and although it has a brick hearth to it, I really wanted something to protect our little ones from falling onto it.Very easy to assemble & mount to the wall. Highly Recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"We put off buying this gate because of it's price, but finally ordered it - it's worth every penny! Strong and sturdy for our active 18 month old, mounts to the wall easily - the gate has a small bit of flex, so the mounting brackets didn't have to be exact. We added an 8\\" extension and it was really easy also. The door works nice. It looks really good also - fits our small living room well. Our only regret is that we didn't buy it 6 months ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearth Gate","review":"Great gate, perfect for protecting the children from the fireplace.

We would highly recommend this product:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product but save Money and Time","review":"Hearth GateJust purchased this gate which was highly recommended by a home safety consultant as being of good quality and durable. Only complaint was that when I went to install the gate sections, (The set fits hearths 6 feet wide by 2 feet deep, and it has five 24-inch sections), it became very apparent that I needed smaller sections in order to make the necessary angles to fit around our fireplace. Upon inspection I discovered that the gates plastic locking fasteners are attached with rivets and don't easily allow you to remove and then cut the gates to size so here's what I did. I drilled out the rivets and removed the (2)plastic locking fasteners,(very easy), cut the gates to size,(5 minutes with cheap hack saw), and reattached the plastic fasteners, by drilling (2) small pilots holes and then installed two small black screws. End result was very safe, very easy, and looks OEM.

This is 254 pages of nothing. Dr. Rawlings attempts to make the case that not all Near-Death Experiences are beautiful, forgiving and life-changing and in my opinion he does a pitiful job of backing it up. The testimonials given are extremely short, and his research of the lives of those testifying of bad experiences are almost nonexistent. He fills the book with so much junk that has nothing to do with life after death, that I cannot possibly recommend this book to anyone currently incarnated. The only possible reason that this book sold as many copies as it did was beacuse he appeared on the Phil Donahue Show years ago. If you are seeking any kind of insight into matters regarding life after death, then you will NOT find it here. A colossal waste of time and I don't say that about too many books good or bad!

A flat brain wave proves death, that is a electroencephalogram. A stopped heart may give the appearance of death, but it's just an appearance.People who think they've died may very well have mental experiences, dreams, nightmares, etc. that they can speak of when they regain consciousness.It's amazing how many people want to believe that people actually have come back from being dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Anyone who is interested in near death experiences, or who doesn't believe in the viability of hell should definately read this book.

Each song is exquisitely arranged and recorded, and I really appreciate the attention to detail paid to recreating the sounds of decades past.This is a wonderful CD, and I give it 5 stars. One last unexpected surprise; Song number 11 is a cover of a Harry Warren song titled 'I'll String Along with You'.

The photos are disconnected from the text, on purpose, and too small.Not sure about the rationale for why the editors announce this book as part in a series.

He has his usual basket of ballads about loving and missing his wife, and a cover version of the rocker \\"Not Dead Yet\\" that sounds forced, like he \\"had\\" to do it. DeYoung's control over the record also results in a very lifeless, clinical feel that even JY couldn't overcome with an otherwise great song called \\"Homewrecker\\". Glen Burtnik and JY steal the show, of course, and it's no surprise that Tommy and JY asked Glen back for the \\"new\\" Styx. Tommy isn't on \\"Edge\\" and it the record suffers for it. It's a good album if you want the entire Styx library, and for the JY and Glen songs, but it's also a key piece in the Styx conflict and shows why Dennis has to go.

Even with all the various musical instruments involved, besides Getz' saxophone - synthesizers, piano, bass, percussion, electric guitar, drums, trombone, and a tuba, the results are music that is pure magic. Listen to the amazing music created by artists who seemed to know when to join in and when to back off, how to complement each other without being over-bearing.

Unlike previously said, this is not a smotoh flowing eclective mix. Cd1 is Oakenfold's attempt at being Sasha. OK, but he's not spinning this sound in clubs. CD2 is seriously a trainwreck. Going from breakbeat to funk to trance never works, no matter if you are the God of dance music.Oakenfold can do so much better.

But as in culinary works of art, inspiring trance starts with the best ingredients, and I'm afraid Ibiza is comprised of some of the least inspiring material I have ever heard in an Oakenfold production. Much of his earlier material is so fantastic because it reaches back into music history to borrow specific pieces that even in their day were inspiring (like the \\"song of the siren\\" in Another World), and blends it beautifully into an epic mosaic of pulsing sweeping sounds. The choice of treasured ingredients like this and a marvellous sense of hi-kinetic aural beauty are what set Oakenfold apart. Ibiza unfortunately picked some contemporary ingredients which lack melodic structure, inspiration and development, so no matter how good the chef, the entree is mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY BUY THIS CD IF YOU LIKE ARTISTS SUCH AS...","review":"Radiohead, Arena, Prodigy, etc. Believe me, there are plenty of people that will love this album, I did not. Similar to the previous reviewer, I have most other Oakenfeld albums and LOVE them, I've seen him live and it was one of the best shows I've been to, but this album stinks. Simply: It is not the same mind-altering, mood-altering, *trance-like* work of art that fans of the genre like myself look for. It is a more post-modern eclectic grouping of random tracks that you might see a crowd of tweaked-out punk rockers mosh-pitting to. The funny thing is that this album is called \\"ibiza\\"!

He doesn't seem to be the only person who feels this way. Recently, a wave of Oakenfold hatism has spread across many of the trance and house faithful. This CD, Oakenfold's most recent \\"real\\" album shows why this is so. This CD is quite disappointing, with repititive and unoriginal songs trying to blend with a level of \\"originality\\" that seems forced. Oakenfold's been one of the more adventurous DJ's in the past (Oslo CD 1 and Essential Selection Disc 2) but this album is just tired rather than inspired. That's why it maddens so many people that Oakenfold's so big. Excellent DJ's with original styles and brilliant mixing always get the undercard when Oakenfold's involved.

I have tried to understand the tone and direction of this cd and still don't have an answer. It seems that Paul slopped this together and slapped an \\"Ibiza\\" title on it to entice you to buy. CD 1 is just a plain snoozer. CD 2 is a bit more driving and pertinent, but has the occasional lull that aggravates you to no end. Please give me some melody, some emotion, something that socks me in the stomach. This cd just doesn't give me that down and dirty dark trance sound (Sasha, Fontaine, Digweed) or that emotional hands-in-the-air feeling either (Acosta, Tiesto, Taucher).

The mixing is unspectacular, song selection is quite dull, and once it gets an elevated level it stops abruptly. A style Oakenfold has adopted which flat out BOTHERS me! But different strokes for... I can say too that after seeing many great DJ's play(Tiesto,Van Dyk,BT,George Acosta...)in some great clubs, Oakenfold is very overated.

It takes a while for you to get used to the odd style.

I did not like the ending at all, it leaves the reader asking \\"What actually happened?\\", although this is not uncommon in this book. I would recommend this book for people who want to be challenged and want a good read about South Africa and their people."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY BORING","review":"The novel was overwhelming.

Many believe that this adds to the quality of the story as the confused style reflects the confused state of mind felt by the characters at the time. I felt that this deterred many a reader and because of that the message of her novel was missed by many. She does express many eye opening views on the troubled lives of people in a country in turmoil, South Africa, but this is shadowed by a wriing style that few manage to pick up on.One wonders how this book came to be published, if it were not for a topic so that desperately needed to be showed to the rest of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy writing, confusing and no sense of direction","review":"While the subject matter was interesting, the style of writing was confusing and irritating.

Definitely not worth your time and effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Many Dashes","review":"It's too bad so few people understand Gordimer's use of the dash. Not only did she put them in there for quatotions, but they added to the theme of the novel.Isn't the story about a woman, Maureen, who is confused duing her treansition from the city to the country? The entire book is about confusion and misunderstanding. By using this new form of punctuation we are not normally familiar with, she makes the setting of the book even more confusing, thus strengthening the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written, not believable or entertaining","review":"July's People is a worthless novel disguised by a jumble or incomprhensible words.

I am an English major at a respected university and read it in a class. The book left me wondering \\"What is going on here?\\" Gordimer's favorite punctuation is the dash which makes the story hard to follow. Does the dash indicate a different speaker or different thought or something completely different? Gordimer also tries to make this book inaccessable to all but the most enlightened by substituting pronouns rather than use proper names and giving very little background to the characters and story. It's hard to care for people that you don't know. I lost interest in the book after the first few \\"chapters\\" (more like breaks in the story) but was forced to finish because it was for a class. This book goes into the \\"don't bother\\" pile.

I wouldn't have believed it possible, but here it is. It starts out pretty confusing. Eventually, I managed to piece out what was going on and realized that there are no quotation marks, just \\"--\\". That would be tolerable in a better book, but here it just added to the annoyance caused by the book's existing at all. Aside from that Nadine Gordimer doesn't seem to understand the concept of a complete sentence. This gets tedious. As for the story itself, it was disgusting! I mean...EEW!! And besides that, did anything ever happen? They hung around a lot and maybe some people did some stuff. Really, it lulled me into a kind of stupor.

There are the hits we all know about such as Baby Baby, Every Heartbeat, Good For Me, That's What Love Is For, and I Will Remember You. But she also does well with the fun songs Galileo and Hats. Ask Me is an incredibley poignant song about sexual abuse. And You're Not Alone and How Can We See That Far are relationship ballads.Is this album \\"Christian\\" or \\"Pop\\"? The answer is it is a pop album that clearly has a Christian base - many references, some obvious (Hope Set High) and some not so obvious (Every Heartbeat) point to her faith in God.Top to bottom, one of the best all around pop albums if the early 1990s."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for any music lover....","review":"I love (almost) every song on this album...and the ones I don't care for (Hats, Galileo and You Are Not Alone) are not so bad...they are just overpowered by the rest!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Grant steps in to pop songs with a \\"Heart in motion\\"","review":"One of the top albums of 1991 Heart in Motion is Amy Grant's best album in the world of Amy Grant. From the rocking Good for me to the dance pop hit Baby Baby which is written about her new baby Millie and where the album gets it's title to the wonderful Gailileo. Then there is the power rocker You're not alone which could have been a single. If you liked the Eurythimics hit Here comes the rain again you will love You're not alone. There is also the fun Hats which is about a very busy girl and also the touching I will remember you that sounds like it could've been used in a movie.

If only I could forget every part of this movie, my life would be slightly improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Unrelentingly loud, roll-your-eyes predictable and never less than obnoxious: the movie equivalent of New Jersey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates of the state of Oregon","review":"Boy, THIS sure brings back a whole lot of memories. Flight of the Navigator, Milo & Otis, Casper, and now The Goonies are just some of the family films that I remember watching when I was a little kid. I sure had a good time watching them either alone or with the entire family. The Goonies I particularly remember very well for the underground adventures, and the characters Chunk & Sloth. They make a great duo, don't they? The booby traps and the \\"keys\\" to the hidden treasure were a bit frightening back then, but now they're pretty imaginative. This, along with the other family films that I've mentioned above never gets tedious. Of course, they don't! We loved them when we were kids, and it's not such a bad thing when you're looking for some childhood nostalgia. Although I slightly prefer Milo & Otis and others, The Goonies is still a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarity","review":"Goonies has been one of my favorite movies since childhood which is probably one of the reasons I love it so much and can find no fault with it at all. Basically, Goonies is an Indiana Jones for kids but the adventure isn't halfway around the world it's in your own backyard. The movie always gave me hope that maybe there is more to my boring neighborhood than meets the eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"great film for kids and adults","review":"I first saw the Goonies at a slumber party when I was about 9. While I did find it exciting, I also was scared stiff when I saw the severely deformed man/monster thing that was part of the Fratelli family. I can't think of his name right now. I develped a crush on both \\"Mikey\\" and \\"Mouth\\", the cute 11 year olds. I think this film appeals to any kid who likes a good adventure story. The kids try to locate an old pirate treasure in order to come up with the money to save their homes, so that they don't have to leave the goon docks. I don't think parents should let their young kids (those under 9) watch this film. It may scare them a bit, and also there is a lot of foul language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blue Ray Version","review":"As usual, this is a great blue ray version of a classic movie. Brings back memories of childhood adventures. Overall, the movie itself is awesome and is a must for any child or family movie night.My only small complaint is the special features are not put together well and are almost worthless to watch. Can't really say to much as this was done during the time \\"making of\\" and \\"special features\\" really weren't a big thing yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"much more detailed version.","review":"The blu-ray version of this movie is so much more detailed than the DVD version.

The cast is extremely talented and fun. The action will keep you on the edge of your seat as the Goonies try and escape the silly evil criminals, the Fatelli's. This great dvd also includes the music video with Cyndi Lauper, which is an adventure in itself because all the Goonies appear in this great little video too. Also if you are the fan of the robotice octopus, well you will be watching it over and over 'cause it is just one of the three missing edited scenes that you will get. The only downside is that you can't watch the whole movie with the edited scenes, but other than that, this movie should be a part of your collection! :0)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gloomiest","review":"Has tons of replay value!

A rainy Friday afternoon transforms into an almost-believable underground romp with a group of kids that you could imagine yourself hanging out with back in middle school. Imagine that, a movie with an all-child cast that's actually likeable and who actually talk/behave like children!

The plot merely gives a vehicle for the antics of these talented and often hilarious children. This version provides outtakes (which to me seemed wisely cut) the awful Cindy Lauper video, (which goes on and on), and a making of short. I'd loved it when I was younger, and now I get to see my own children giggling uncontrollably over it. Good fun and nothing but."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing film...the best of all adventures movies ever maid!","review":"Steven Spielberg is the great. He made a beautifull film about child's dreams and made all generation of young people ( 80's ) believe in dreams. A very good story of Pirates and adventure whith the most incredible act of young stars like Corey Feldman , Jeff Cohen , Sean Astin , Josh Brolin , etc... My generation is expecting the release of the DVD edition for a long time...so...our dreams come true.Thanks Steven and all the Goonies Team !!! Pedro Leito Viva Portugal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Generational touchstone","review":"Okay, I'm 19 and most every other 19 y/o I know has seen this film, I mean it's like everyone around my age range has viewed this film and loved it.

I've been watching this film on television for years and the nostalgia just kills me! I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, FUN, ACTION-ADVENTURE!","review":"Indiana Jones type adventure, directed by ever capable Steven Speilberg.A group of kids discover a pirate map which leads them on a fantasy treasure hunt. Lots of fun to be had here where the gang encounter boobie traps along the way, as well as watershoots and also have to avoid some evil crooks hot on their trail which features an exceptionally funny performance from Anne Ramsey (THROW MAMA FROM THE TRAIN). The ending has a pleasant, sentimental twist to it even though a little on the predictable side. The cast includes a very young looking Sean Astin as well as Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton and Ke Huy Kwan.Excellent fun, games and adventures which kids will lap up. A classic. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still love this movie","review":"I was a teenager when this movie came out. I'm now in my early 30's, and still love this movie.

It's a great, lighthearted, family movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great even after...","review":"so many years. I loved this movie as a child and I am still in love with it now. It has all the adventure a person could want as well as plenty of comical characters to lighten the mood. This movie will definitely reach classical level in the coming years because the story of children hunting for treasure is a timeless adventure that everyone can relate to. If you are an adult and you watch this film it will sweetly remind you of those times when you once believed that finding the lost treasure of a notorious pirate was still within the realm of reality. It's a great movie all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I love this movie which is why I ordered it. Unfortunately the movie would not play all the way through. It kept fast forwarding itself, and jumping scenes as if it were scratched. I took the movie out, it had no visible scratches on it at all. I put it back in and it did the same thing at the same scenes through out the movie. I purchased a bunch of movies from Amazon for Xmas, I hope this is an isolated incident.

When I found the this version of The Goonies, I was stoked! I couldn't wait to get it into my hands. I put the DVD in the Blu-Ray player and fell in love with the movie all over again. I've watched the butchered TV version so many times, I forgot some of of the best parts!Since it is a Blu-Ray disc the quality of the picture is amazing. The bonus features are good too.

Heck, I continue to love it even to this day. It's about a group of kids that find a treasure map in an attic full of old pirate antiques. A pretty seamless transition then takes place, considering the unusual circumstances, where the kids follow the map to an old abandoned restaurant that serves as a hideout for a family of escaped convicts. The rest of the movie is a wild chase for the kids, as they make their way through a booby-trap infested tunnel with escaped convicts right on their tail. The creative booby-traps are very reminiscent of Indiana Jones, which shouldn't surprise anybody who watches movie credits, and even though the content is most unusual, the movie never loses it's believablity (except, perhaps, during the Superman shirt gag).This may very well be my favorite Spielberg film."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a deal!","review":"For all who want the best movies for the best price.

See when I was a kid and I first saw Goonies it was like a little adventure you were preparing for. You had your blanket it was dark you had your friends over watching the film made you yourself go on an adventure. Why anyone would give this film anything below a 4 star rating is beyond me.I dont have to tell you the story line of this film because chances are you saw it already if not then you must be somewhere under 27 or 28 because this film was really for the late 20 early 30's individual before surround sound, and HD was even considered as a movie format. The benefit of Goonies is that it takes you back to when you were a kid and keeps you there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally.....The Goonies on DVD!!!!!!","review":"Let me just start out buy saying The Goonies rule.

It's escapist at its best, with a group of offbeat kids go on a wild treasure hunt, chased by escaped convicts and their psycho mom, discover a pirate galleon, lose a treasure and save their neighborhood, all in one day.I hap hoped that the director would follow up with a Three Investigators movie but I never saw one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but probably not acceptable for sub-teen viewing","review":"Jeepers! I saw this when I was a teenager and remembered it being a great movie with lots of adventure, laughs and greats sets, which it is. However, in the interim from childhood to when I showed it to my seven- and eight-year-old children, I somehow purged any memories of the movie's extensive profanity. My wife and I winced as various characters used the \\"S\\" word throughout the film (okay, it was probably less than ten times, but still). Seems rather unnecessary to have all the \\"S\\" bombs in there along with the \\"damn\\" and \\"hell\\" variations. Next time, we'll preview some of the fondly remembered oldies before showing them to the children, unless they come with the safe \\"G\\" rating. Great movie, but just exercise caution with the young ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great adventure tarnished with filthy language","review":"I remembered this moving growing up, and couldn't wait to buy it for my children.

Like Twain, Steven Spielberg understands a specific kind of half-earthy, half-magical kids' world that many of us never quite abandon, nor want to. The Goonies is one of the top films ever in that genre. I would compare it to Stand By Me and, more recently, Moonrise Kingdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gonnies","review":"I seen the Goonies before,it was hilarious,Characters where great.Watch it with your family and hear the laughter.

I barely remembered seeing it when it first came out with my son, who was at the time 12 yrs old. I recalled it being somewhat of an adventure/mystery, which it is. However, the kids swear throughout the movie and in one scene, one of the boys is taunting another telling him about seeing his mother naked, taking pictures, etc. All totally unnecessary for the story line, but I guess Spielberg felt it made it more real. I shut the movie off before finishing--It is still a good story, but if you try to avoid foul language situations for your kids, this is not going to be ok, especially for younger kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"i got it quickly n it looks good. im a huge goonies fan and i cant wait to watch it and play the board game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, language inappropriate for youngsters.","review":"This is a very funny movie.

Mike, Sean Astin Sam .;'The movie is so much fun to watch on it's own. But watch it with commentary. When it says \` Commentary with hidden treasures', there not kidding.Not only do you get to listin about behind the scenes but all ( if not most ) of the actors and actresses can be seen during the commentary.Even Donner the director is there and it's quiet wonderful and fun to watch.The Goonies is a good funny family film to watch. The acting is kind of goofy but totally worth watching though.Seriously though every DVD in the world should be made like this, or something like this.You get so much entertainment on one DVD.

This information in this book is just barely beyond common sence and provides little practical advise for legal publications, whether academic or professional. However, many law schools seem to require their first-year students to subject themselves to the pain of reading part, if not all of this poor excuse for a teaching instrument. Personally, I had to read two chapters; the prof spend 20 minutes on the material, and even admitted the book has little to offer. Yet the book was on HER booklist as a required title.

It was very tedious to get through, highlighting the intricacies of the Nightingales' land ownership and family relations. While all of this information was pivotal to the plot, it made the book stagnant and there were many instances that I found myself thumbing through the information for the next instance of plot progression. I should have selected a different book for my reading assignment. I barely finished it in time for my project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"There certainly is plenty of information in this book; unfortunately much of it gets repeated over and over.

As a result, we are now seemingly back to square one with same old, same old. Elliott and Olivia are seemingly the whole show again from this point forward and I don't know if I can handle that. The episode is also a bit over the top. Virtually every person who comes forward in this episode is a closet alcoholic and, in some rare instances, an in your face AA member. If we could have stuck to the defendant's alcoholism solely, this episode probably would have worked. As it is, I think the show pretty much blew up in its makers' faces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Gift","review":"This was purchased as a Christmas gift.

I frankly wish this was happening a bit more often as it can get tedious just watching Olivia and Elliott week in and week out. There is a teenage boy who is a suspected murderer who is under investigation this episode. However, the entirety of his past is examined by the detectives and a far more sinister villain comes to light.

I've been in love with this movie since first I saw it about 10 years ago. I never understood why it's not included in some of Eastwood's best work. I'm not knocking the Dirty Harry movies (believe me, I love them all) but Kelly's is Eastwood at his best. His straight schtick is awesome. There's some drama, and a ton of comedy. Some people think Eastwood started his comedy roles with the \\"Any which way but loose\\" movies. But it really all started with Kelly's Heroes.People!! Buy this movie!

Needless to say, the lack of military discipline and the 'we're in this for ourselves' attitude was very popular when seen at the base theater by a house full of conscripts. Filmed in eastern Europe, it was the first or one of the first war movies to use authentic German hardware, the Tiger Tanks as portrayed in the movie. One major nit-pick: the German commanders complaint about the gas is bogus; the Tiger was a diesel-electric drive, and diesel fuel is not nearly as volatile as gasoline. This was a major issue in WWII, the german tanks were diesel (and more heavily armoured) and the sherman's were thin-skinned and gas powered, hence their nick-name 'Ronson's'.Super war flick though."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD REVIEW","review":"A most excellent transfer!

I know \\"Kelly's Heroes\\" is suppossed to be a dark comedy set during WWII and SPR is a dark drama set during WWII....but after watching both movies back to back the similarities are too many to mention. As for \\"Kelly's Heroes\\", it's about time this movie made it to DVD....if you have never seen this movie (where have you been?) you are in for a real treat as it has just about everything you could think of in a WWII movie and then some (comedy, drama, action).

With many big names back then, and some still now such as Eastwood and Donald Sutherland, this movie has nice action and some good laughs.This may be just an average film, however Donald Sutherland's character (funny war bum type) and my interest in WWII help push the rating it to a 4 for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice war movie,but hippie tank driver out of place","review":"clint eastwood made only 2 world war II movies, where eagles dare and this one. the hippie tank commander is the only real part of the movie that has not aged well,but this is still a good war movie about men tring to steal gold from the german army and starting an attack instead as they all race to get the gold. not great but close it's still worth putting in your clint collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIDDEN SHERMAN BLASTING TIGERS","review":"A lot of the hippie stuff in this movie is total nonsense & typifies the 1970's counter-culture era & crime caper genre. But there are terrific uniforms, equipment & combat scenes to be enjoyed. The Tiger tanks are amazingly convincing running mockups based on T-34 chasis. The film captures the dynamic movement & stalking of tanks in a French village. This is a comedy, action adventure so don't expect the real World War 2. The body count really piles up starting with the Sherman tank attack at the German rail yard.

Clint Eastwood (Kelly) is his usual stoic self supported by half of Hollywood. Some very funny scenes with Don Rickles, Donald Sutherland (WOOF!), Telly Savalas and Carol O'Connor--to mention just a few. Lots of action--and some commentary on the futility of war--but all in all a great flick. Add it to your collection--you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eastwood hated it, but you won't","review":"Clint was reported to be unhappy with the way the film was edited at the time of it's release. I'm sure he has softened on it over the years, because there is no other WWII film quite like it. It's odd serio-comic tone, well played by a superb cast, is priceless. Donald Sutherland's anachronistic character is an absolute howl, and an oddly cast Don Rickles works just fine. The musical soundtrack, however, is often dreadful. But that is a petty quibble, and fails to prevent me from highly recommending the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"gee, what a fun war.","review":"a fairly sterotypical squad of soldiers pull off a bank heist in the middle of the allied forces' race to berlin. complete with the bumbling hasn't-a-clue general. if you want anacronisms, donald sutherland presages the flower children of the sixties, and for you lounge rats, don rickles does his non-stop insults for laughs. still, somehow the darned thing manages to entertain in a comforting way. if movies were food, this would be mac and cheese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugh","review":"Best wireless microphone I have ever used.

I could not imagine the pain of loosing ones Mother and Aunt to murder by a man they once trusted. Not surprising the people who came in and out of his front door/photo booth and probably took advantage of him in his state. Again sad. I was glad to read that there were some constants in his life that did try to help him but were unsucessful.

The photo booth that Dave Navarro installed in his house gave people a bit of privacy that they then turn right around and expose to whomever wants to peek in. Reading the stories and seeing how people sound, then looking at the photos they posed for (sometimes way before or way after the narrative) is a neat contrast... Although in a lot of cases, the people in the pictures are as self-absorbed as the photo booth experience itself, so no contrast is found."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wild Ride","review":"This book was very hard to put down for me. Why? Because I was fascinated by how far Dave Navarro put himself out there emotionally with this book. Parts of it did not paint him well at all. Crawling around in Dave's head for the three sittings it took me to finish wasn't always easy...but breathlessly now on the other side I respect him as a person, flaws and all. Just like the rest of us. To reveal so much of yourself to the crushing scrutiny of mass society when your persona is your bankable commodity shows incredible fortitude and being pretty darn secure in who he is as a person.Good for you Dave.

Absolutely not!Janice Howse was a much loved music teacher at the school.

Now, she not only has lost her job, but she has lost her teaching credentials and these decisions were all made by numerous objective parties. What the author does so well in her book is she blames everyone else for her losses (including her own attourney), but never looks at her own actions that have caused her to be an ineffective employee in the first place.

Think about it, can any person make another person commit suicide?I think this author is trying to ruin the reputations of many good people, and she is showing disrespect to Mr. McCann's family and friends by publishing and trying to manipulate this tragedy. If she is willing to exploit that, what else is she exploiting?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Black Hole in the Memory","review":"The author obviously spent a lot of time finiding clever titles for her chapters! This is why I had to at least give the book a star... but boy, did she forget her story line! The downfall of this read is first and foremost the lack of consistency in facts, opinions, and arguments brought forward. I counted at least ten major contracdictions of facts and arguments in my first read alone. The book is not much in terms of disclosing interesting facts, but could make for a great comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"abusing the public school system","review":"This is the story of a teacher in a financially strapped school district who was well past retirement age and was offered a golden handshake to retire. She did not want to do so and as a result wasted huge amounts of taxpayer monies and working educators' time fighting through multiple appeals and an independent court process. She lost every time. Her revenge was to publish this book. Like most self-published books, it lacks objectiveness and any kind of editorial coherence. One quickly tires of her repetitive claims of innocence maligned. Before you buy it, ask yourself if you think teachers in the public school system are entitled to work past their seventies just because they want to and without regard to the financial realities of the school system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be named \\"NOT Automated Web Testing\\"","review":"Very misleading title. I bought the book thinking it would discuss tools for automated web testing (gee, I got that idea from the title somehow); but the book is only about basic procedures in general testing. \\"Testing Computer Software\\" and \\"Testing Web Applications\\" by Cem Kaner, et al. had better information on basic testing procedures AND automated testing.

Finally, the book arrived and after a few hours of reading I realized that the book was not at all what the title promised. This is a book about the basic practices and methodologies of testing with an emphasis on Web testing. I was hoping for specific information on the methods, concepts and practices of test automation. If you have little experience in testing on the Web or otherwise, this book is great for you. If, however, you want to do what its' title suggests... automated web testing, THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read!!","review":"The book is not organized at all.

Certainly nobody who already knows anything about software projects, software testing or web development.The attached CD (17.2 Mb) is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Web Site Testing","review":"The book \\"Automated Web Testing Toolkit\\" by Diane Stottlemyer is a well written book on testing and setting up the test process for web sites. It has information on traditional testing and discusses how these processes apply to web testing.It has information on several companies that offer automated test tools and also goes into testing using manual methods. Also one of the strong points for me was learning how to set up the test environment for web sites. I also enjoyed the information on firewalls and security.The information on the business process was helpful and can be used throughout the whole test process.I would recommend this book to anyone who has to start out and set up a test process for a web application."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice travel set of dominoes","review":"From reading reviews it sounds like there's a lot of variation of build quality on this product.

If you're with the rest of us here in 2001, then find another source of help. The badly outdated information about the nature of the Web is only topped by the author's annoying choices of \\"catchwords\\" to use throughout the book. \\"Chunks,\\" for example, apparently means blocks of text containing fewer than 100 words (it's also the author's recommended maximum page length). Not so bad by itself, but when used repeatedly, and with variation (chunk it, chunking), the practice gets a bit annoying. In the preface, the author reveals a bias to print media, which is unnecessary if you read the introduction.

Due to the confusing way the products were presented, and in no discernably logical order, I later discovered that I had inadvertently changed the order to DVDs which I didn't need but was resigned to pay for, and went back and ordered the CDs I did need. Since receiving the DVDs, I have discovered that they will not work with Nero, Ulead DVD MovieFactory, Pinacle Studio Ultimate, Windows Vista, or the Phillips Blu-ray burner that is in my computer--They resist formatting by any of the software I use.

Funky, heavy, melodic rock that is one of the most underrated albums of the decade. Extreme at the top of their game. From the first track on, this album cranks out infectious grooves for the ages. No other band at the time could come close to Extreme. Nuno Bettencourt is a guitar god and flashes his chops all over the record. Best tracks are \\"Decadence Dance\\", \\"It's a Monster\\", \\"Get the Funk Out\\", and \\"He-Man Woman Hater\\" but it has great slow songs as well. Still listen to it all the time to this day from the time I got it in 1991."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex!

Sure, there are some nice hooks here and there. Nuno is a fine guitar player. Unfortunatly, Nuno realizes this all too well. Extreme's music is lacking the essential ingredient in funk which is breathing room. Any chance of a consistent funky groove is suffocated by Nuno's Van Halen/Malmsteen chops or Gary Cherone's Freddy-Mercury-meets-Brad-Delp vocal treatments. To prove that they are diverse,a few ballads are thrown in the mixture.(What better way to sell an album these days)? In 'Get The Funk Out' they sing: \\" No rotten apple's gonna spoil my funk.\\" Mine either, so I'll avoid this apple. An album closer to 90's funk is the Chili Pepper's 'Bloodsugarsexmagic.' However, if you want to hear a 90's group with the musical indulgence of Cream and the staying power of Kajagoogoo, this may be your band. Just don't call it Funk cause it ain't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A small mistake...","review":"I purchased the vinyl version of this album long ago, when I was 15. I was very impressed by the guitar skills of Nuno Bettencourt, and I liked the anthemic \\"More Than Words\\". Ten years after, I can safely say the album has lost most of its appeal: no one is interested anymore in faster-than-light guitar solos, and the metal-flavoured pop of these guys sounds quite silly, a useless heritage of 80s. Besides, in the same years a few really groundbreaking album surfaced (eg Pearl Jam's Ten, Nirvana's Nevermind) that showed where good rock music was heading, definitely away from this stuff. I consider Pornograffitti a mistake in my \\"career\\" as a listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Annoying Song Ever...","review":"\\"More Than Words\\" was one of the Most Overplayed songs of 1991, and one of the Most (if not THE MOST) Annoying and Most Boring songs of ALL TIME!

Okay, you may think I'm overdoing it, but I promise, I'm not. Just turn up the guitar riff on Suzi to full volume, sit in front of the speakers, and behold the genius.

The ring doesn't lay flat, of course it's going to get torn. Wait until you price them.Next, take a good look at the handles. Why are they so small and close to the pot?

I know it seemed like a new roster everytime a new album came out. And this album was near the end of classic Mac and right before they became soft rock(or lite) radio's trademark for commercialized, overplayed, almost grocery store background music.

This album starts off with the mellow rocker \\"Emerald Eyes\\", the roller of Christine McVie's \\"Believe Me\\" and upbeat \\"Just Crazy Love\\". Bob Welch gives us the haunting classic mood rocker \\"Hypnotized\\", which got plenty of airplay in the 70's and early 80's on album rock radio. Bob also gave us \\"The City\\", a rocking slide guitar rocker, \\"Miles Away\\", another nice little rocker.

I used to have a copy of Buckingham Nicks........nice song on that is \\"the Races Are Run\\" and shows their influence in the more comtemporay Fleetwood Mac.

The story is not very interesting or creatively told. Yes, it holds a good message but that is not the only point of reading a book- I like to hear pleasing or clever language too. Also, the artwork is all dull colors and the animals are not cute-just kinda blah. I expect a lot better artwork in a children's book. Finally, the weird accent of the kid who does Ellison on the cd and the annoying voice of Weasel make the cd something I don't want to play as an adult. My daughter likes it but doesn't ask to hear it on her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is an avatar of Dullness","review":"I am neither a Sanskritist nor practitioner of Hinduism. I am not qualified to evaluate the author's biases, hidden or revealed, in writing on Hindu traditions and literature. I would just add my voice here on this point: the book is written in an exceedingly dull manner. The prose is stilted, lifeless, and lacking in both content and colour. The bibliographies are useful, and I appreciate references to the original texts from which the tales are (poorly) retold. But overall it's simply too drab to be much more than an anthology of cold prose. I didn't think it was possible to make Kali-Ma sound boring -- but this author succeeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly inaccurate and condescending","review":"For those who want to truly learn about hinduism, I would recommend the Bhagavad Gita translations. Versions by Ram Dass, Eknath Easwaran, Parmahansa Yogananda are quite good though there is no replacement for the original text in Sanskrit.Also, I would recommend David Frawley'sGods, Sages and Kings: Vedic Secrets of Ancient Civilization.I will not even dwell into the details of the book that I found inaccurate . You can figure the author's viewpoint just by noticing that the title uses the term 'myth'. When you discuss some, if not all, religious sacred scriptures and label them as 'myths' you clearly show yourself as a non-believer and one who typically adopts a condescending attitude.I felt the need to write this review since the top rated review calls Hindus who dont accept this book 'idiots'.And in the future, it would be nice to see reviewers who do not resort to tactics of grade one students- name calling. Maturity is highly appreciated . Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Silly book by a sex-obsessed author - Freudian analysis to explore religion? At best, one can describe it as the product of an over-imaginative mind, but it's certainly not a book on Hindu religion, because it interprets the religion in ways that the practitioners never intended or even imagined. \\"Your interpretation of my beliefs reflects the way you think, not the way I think.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally inaccurate","review":"This book is full of inaccuracies.

The 3.5mm portion of the adapter is bigger than it should be, and all three of the headphone sets I tried just fall out of the adapter with any light force on the cord. If there isn't any force at all pulling the plug out of this adapter, the sound quality is fine, but the second the SMALLEST little force pulls on the cord, it just falls right out.

It just isn't something that you need when you're planning your wedding because it isn't loaded with that much information. For example, it has several pages just talking about the engagement ring, which you don't need information on because you probably already have the ring if you're planning your wedding.

This is one of those rare perfect albums. Each cut somehow seamlessly flows to the next and you will be hard pressed to find a song you would even want to skip. Although Pearl Jam and Soundgarden went on to make incredible music I would have taken 20 years of TOD over either band.Although it is \\"grunge\\" I think this album blurs the line as it is a blues, rock, sing/songwriter, infused collection of some very powerful and heartfelt singing by Mr. Cornell. This is when Chris Cornell was at his pinnacle (IMHO). Just fantastic...buy it. : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget \\"Nevermind\\"","review":"All I will say is that \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\" Is the single greatest vocal perfomance in the history of rock. When you hear Chris Cornell blast out with shaddering emotion on this track, you will be blown away, just like I was. Eddie Vedder, another great singer, also appears throughout the album, adding beutiful harmony. \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\" is indeed the single best vocal performance in the history of rock, and is reason alone to purchase this CD. Overall, most of the songs are good, and the album is one of the most underrated of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Seattle Sound at it's best!","review":"As a fan of grunge music, i have to say that this tribute to Andrew Wood is one of the best albums i have heard in a while.

If you are a fan of 90s rock you won't be disappointed with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminal Grunge","review":"Matt Cameron on drums. Chris Cornell on vocals. Mike McCready and Stone Gossard on guitar. Jeff Ament plays bass. The term 'supergroup' would not mean anything if it weren't for this band. More songwriting and performing talent was present in the studio for TotD than any other record I own. While Eddie Vedder only appears on Hunger Strike, Chris Cornell's voice makes a surprisingly good counterpoint to Mike McCready's wailing guitars, which absolutely dominate this record. 'Reach Down' is a ten-minute epic prayer to the god of Rock, with a great solo followed by stunning a capella. 'Call Me a Dog' is one of Cornell's true lyrical masterpieces. Of course, if you had to pick five songs to define the Seattle movement, 'Hunger Strike' would be on the list. The PJ guys' ability to do 'mellow' allows Cornell to cut loose on songs like this a lot more than he did with Soundgarden."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a MUST HAVE for primitive rug hookers","review":"The patterns and photos in this book are superb!

With some brilliant editing and highly tuned selective memories the Buttons have indeed created an unparalled love story. However, I know the Buttons and know that what you read isn't exactly the whole story. The Buttons are extremely selective in their collective experiences, the sharing and dispensing of love with family and friends, and think nothing of flattening others personal feelings along the way. Their inner social circle places them on such an elevated status that one cannot, nor should not disagree with the Buttons. With all this said, I have found a perfect use for this book, it makes for a good door stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"No widescreen version!","review":"Too sad.I have widescreen TV and this dvd is annoying.It has only full screen format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids","review":"Wayne Szalinski is a crazy scientist who invents a miniaturizing machine that is so powerful it only blows things up.

A benefit of owning a DVD player is the ability to own films widescreen and with extras (which these DVDs lack). If we are turning into a digital society... then make it worth our while. Disney's choice of the aspect ratio 1:33:1 release has cheated these films' directors in that the widescreen anamorphic format is how the director intended us to see it.

I usually need the highest setting, and this one was pretty decent.Cons: Bulky size.Part where you're suppose to hold onto and place your fingers gets really hot and unbearable to hold on.The same parts to hold on to is uncomfortable regardless of heat, the ridges start to wear your fingers out.There is a weird guide in the middle of the straightener, to keep the two paddles aligned.

I can't imagine getting my hair this straight and smooth with any other product (and I've tried tons, believe me).

The results for me aren't that great, it straightens my hair a little but it's still frizzy. It's lightweight which is nice. I don't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair. I definitely prefer other models over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke After One Year","review":"I bought this product for my wife, who occasionally straightens her hair, even though she already has naturally straight hair.

Anyways, after EXACTLY on year, the product just stopped heating. The lights turn on but the heating never begins. What I find fascinating is that I'm not the only person this has happened to.

After looking around and reading the reviews I purchased the Conair Tourmaline 2 inch because the reviews and description read similar to my nano silver. The product is indeed dual voltage however, in order to use it wet, the hair has to be wet. The temperature gage is awkward and it broke my daughter's hair off. When I used the Nano silver there was no hair breakage. After an hour of trying to straighten my daughter's hair I gave up and turned the product off. Now I am in the market for another dual voltage product similar to my SS9 Nano silver. I will be returning product back to Amazon for a refund. Also another website has the same product for $5 or more less than Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"My hair is curly, but not difficult to straighten. The wet setting button does not provide enough heat to dry and straighten my hair. The dry set button does not provide enough heat either. The pins don't do much to help pull the hair straight. The result was frizzy, course, partly straight hair, it took a long time, and I got so hot during the process that I'm sure it frizzed my hair more. Also, the vents are on the side, which made it easy to burn myself from the steam. Probably best for lightly wavy, thin caucasion type hair. Everyone else, spend the extra money for the Maxi-Glide. Does a much better job and is easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too pleased","review":"I read all the reviews & thought this would do the trick. My daughter does not like the results at all.

I have naturally curly/frizzy hair which even after blow drying straight, still has some frizz to it. This flat iron takes the frizz out without drying my hair out which other flat irons have done in the past. I like that it also has the option of using it when your hair is wet so you can change the setting and flat iron your hair without the risk of totally burning/frying it. This one has an auto off after a length of time as well which is great for someone like me who usually forgets that it's still plugged in!

Moral of the story: Just because they come out with one good book doesn't mean you should run out and buy their next book. Han Ong, what were you thinking? Stylistically its out of control, you used to be so candid and honest and straightforward, now your words only confuse and depress me.

The jansport was more roomy I got for my second child and it wasn't too heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great, rolls nice, arm straps easily hidden","review":"This rolling backpack looks better in person and has nice fabric details that are hard to see in the picture. I was surprised to see that it has a removable padded, zippered pouch with handles for my laptop. This is nice for transporting the laptop by itself. It is a little hard to get the backpack zipped up once the laptop pouch is inserted with a laptop inside, but there is another large compartment for binders, folders, books, etc. Unfortunately, you don't get quite as much room for these in the second large compartment as appears in the picture. There's a small flap with Velcro in the back to cover the backpack arm straps to keep them from dragging on the ground in rolling mode, which can be flipped around to cover the wheels when wearing it as a backpack. Overall a very nice product at a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Enough","review":"Tough enough is what it is. Simple and well padded. Room for mouse and cords etc..

It was a welcome change from the flimsy, oft poorly constructed, brief case style cases. I wasn't sure about how long it would last. I am a network tech for an ISP so my bag is in use everyday, all day. I am hard on bags and notebooks. This bag has outlasted two notebooks and fulfills my every desire for an all-around notebook case / tool bag. I fill it at times with paper work and cables to do router installs and network cross connects. I have crammed it under seats on airplanes, crammed its pockets with water bottles, and crammed its generous insides with carry on essentials. It has never failed me. Everyone in my company, almost without exception, now is begging for this bag. I intend buying one for myself and as a gift for my nephew for schoolwork. I believe even he will have a tuff time destroying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Comfortable, and roomy","review":"bought the backpack to replace a messenger style bag that hurt my shoulders.

Highly recommend this to anyone who needs a sturdy product that needs to be mobile."},{"rating":"2","title":"I get compliments on this all the time","review":"I've had this bag forever, and I used to use it every day, but with a new job, I don't. At my previous job, I had to tote a laptop to and from work on the train, and all over town every day, and this was PERFECT. I wanted to find a bag where the laptop was as close to the handle/rolling mechanism as possible (tough to explain, but a lot of bags have the laptop compartment in the very front, so over time the bag ends up rolling forward when you set it down since the heaviest thing -- the laptop -- is so far away from the support). I also love using it for overnight trips since it fits under an airplane seat and has so many handy compartments for easily accessible stuff. People on the train ask me about it a lot because they are looking for an overnight bag or a work bag or just a backpack."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE design for carrying laptops","review":"I was excited at how lightweight this bag was and thought I would just love it. However, I quickly found that this bag is poorly designed for carrying laptops (full sized weight) or anything tall and heavy. It is designed to lean at an angle that causes it to fall backwards ALL (I mean multiple times per day) the time when there is anything heavy such as a laptop in it. I am surprised that my laptop has not yet met its death due to this bag falling over. I now have to remember to prop the bag against a wall or desk to keep it from falling over and damaging my laptop. This bag would have had potential if they had not designed it with such a diagonal lean and nothing at the bottom to balance the weight. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please DO NOT get it!","review":"I got this for my 11in Macbook Air. Since it's designed for 12in notebooks, i figured that there would be enough room. My Macbook can barely snug in to the case. Plus the material is not very sturdy. It is truly a Sleeve ONLY, not a case, after only 3 months of use, there's a big hole at the bottom corner, exposing the cheap white foam lining. I will upload a picture for proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Targus Packpack","review":"Zipper failed on first trip. Too small for 15\\" laptop. Poor quality.

I needed a bag that rolls, I can sling over my shoulder as needed and has lots of space. Lots of pockets would be nice too!! This bag fills all those requirements.Pros:+ I like the T handle and the large rollerblade style wheels that glide very smoothly.+ Lots of storage capacity.+ Many zippered pockets to sort everything I carry (3 ring binders, overnight essentials, earplugs, keys, work gloves, etc). You get the idea)+ Backpack straps that hide under a flap when not used.Cons:- Backpack straps feel a bit thin. They haven't broke yet but I fear they might. As I want this to last I try not to use them much.- There is a small net pouch on the side (water bottle?) with a drawstring that already broke from the side today.Overall this seems to be a good bag, I would definitely recommend it for school use or typical business travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit!","review":"Our Toshiba netbook fits perfectly into this case.

Big enough for the MBP and my notebooks and book for class. It was great until 3 days ago. The zipper began getting stuck. At first I thought it was the zipper getting stuck with the fabric, like all other zippers do. Upon inspection, I found that the zipper tracks have quite big gaps and now the actual zipper has came off the track and is now useless. I can only close the biggest bag in one direction now. It sucks that I can't return this or get an exchange as my 30 days expired a few days ago. It was a great product, while it lasted.

I've heard this album quite a few times over the years to give it a chance but this album never had a chance. Road to hell is such a boring chorus, I wonder what people are on to be overrating a dull track so much. Man of sorrows is another track that goes nowhere, it tries to be tuneful and emotional but fails and some people are apparently still impressed by it. I hear the sound of someone reaching for ideas but not getting anywhere.As for the rest of the album, when I say I have heard it a few times over close to a decade and just now and still can't remember the tuneless forgetable tunes, that explains this album in a nutshell. Bruce did a better job with Skunkworks. But overall I say, I'd skip his works and listen to the Blaze and Di'anno albums with Battlezone and Killers. Never mind what a handful of Bruce drones and Bruce era Maiden fanboys tell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what Maiden should have evolved into.","review":"After hearing this c.d., it's obvious that Bruce didn't have as much say into the direction of Iron Maiden as he should have. (No offense to Steve Harris). This c.d. has added elements and color that Iron Maiden NEVER had - an all accoustic song, a REALLY heavy rhythm section, and an even mix of the instruments! Don't get me wrong, I love Maiden up through Seventh Son, but Mr. Harris can be a little narrow minded. His over-mixed bass playing tends to take away from the heaviness of the riffs. (Imagine driving a fast car over a bunch of speed bumps).As for Accident of Birth, I really can't pinpoint the standout songs, 'cause they all stand out. Roy Z does a remarkable job! I saw this tour when I was in Minnesota, and it's a real shame that they were playing in small bars and clubs. This c.d. is one of the highlights of the '90s!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...YEAH!!!!!

From egining to end I was not led down and 4 years later Im still not tired of it. This takes the best Maiden style riffing and throws in a heavy groove. This is what Maiden shoul have done after seventh son. Taken a few years off a once the early 90's scene unfurled, Unleash this ... on the world. Not to bash Blaze BAiley.

Even in films that were saved by the superior performances of others - such as Dustin Hoffman in \\"Rain Man\\", or Paul Newman in \\"The Color of Money\\"- Tom still played the cocky unlikable character.With a handful of bizarre public appearances, he developed a nearly universal reputation, Sloane Crosley wrote in Village Voice, as \\"one spoke behind Michael Jackson on the freak wheel.\\"This is his cocky bartender movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"tom cruise lives up to razzie award winner status","review":"This is one of the worst acted and moronic story lines ever written.

But, the supporting characters happen to be so fascinating that at times it's hard to focus on anything else. In addition to this, the film has glorious cinematography- especially the scenes set in the tropics. Another thing \\"Cocktail\\" has going for it is its soundtrack: great 80s music!!

I wish the entire pouch was removable and there was PALS webbing behind it and on up the entire back of the pack. It could really use a waist belt! The side pouches are good sized but the webbing on them is pretty useless in my opinion, adding a pouch to them makes the pack way to wide, and I am a wide guy.

We have a VHS set of early Hitchcock movies and I am guessing this is the same- The Thirty Nine Steps, Sabotage, Blackmail, The Lady Vanishes, etc. Unless these movies have been remastered (and at $9.99, do you think they have been?

The DVD hasn't been released yet - How are they supposed to know? Given the St. Clair Group's stellar record of providing zero information, and their oh so informative website, how exactly does one derive this info?C'mon now, get a grip and relax.

While there may be some truths and things to be learned from this book, weeding through the gross misinformation is troublesome.The hard to read calligraphy and fonts.The ridiculous glossary. Most definitions are just the authors OPINIONThe dangerous section on using LSD, Peote, and mushrooms even during pregnancy.A photo of a nude little girl. No, not playing in the sprinkler, just standing there posed and the photo is of her torso and genital area.I truly wanted to like this book. I was just so turned off by it though.I would suggest Susun Weed's book \\"Wise Woman herbal for the Childbearing Year\\".

While the author included lists of herbs at the end of every section, it is a very poor guide of how to use the herbs, what exactly they do (medically not spiritually), and what the contraindications are. I learned far more about this author's personal view on life than I ever wanted to know. I threw the book away right after reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, but outdated technology","review":"Bought this for the aged parents thinking it would be a nice alternative for the pricey PC system they are constantly having problems with.BIG MISTAKE. Set up was simple, instructions were very clear. However, MSN-TV uses a three or four year old version of Explorer. In addition to outdated software, there is no memory. So, many websites will not load. The new funtionalities on many sites will not run.All the MSN-TV is good for is e-mail. If that's all you need, then this might fit the bill. For any other purposes, look elsewhere.As for the speed - well, let's just say that the aged parents are retired, but even they don't have THAT much time to waste.All in all, a great idea which needs a lot more work.

The story is a little dry really but interesting. For the most part it is a worthy purchase but many will find it too dull if they expect another Demon City. The movie never quite harnesses it's opening eerie environment, and then loses its hold on you as the story drags on. The themes are mature and there is nudity and graphic violence. Basically a cop must fight demons before they come and take over the dimension in which humans live. A dirty old man is the secret to stopping them and he is hired to protect him. A few laughs involving the old mans ruthless desires to the demon woman who was sent to also protect him. The cop falls for the demon girl in text book format and the story progresses until you wake up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsoleted by modern anime","review":"If you are looking for a graphically outdated movie with dull action scenes, a loose plot, and many rape/relations scenes, this movie might be for you. However, don't get too excited just yet, almost all of the adult scenes really don't show anything graphic, but rather use grunts/moans and implied movements instead.As for alternatives, if you are looking for a good horror flick, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust is a good option. If you wish to see a horror flick with great visuals, Blood the Last Vampire is a good option. If you are looking for a horror flick with gratuitous gore and female nudity, Ninja Scroll is a good choice. Lastly, if you are looking for an action/horror series, Hellsing is a great pick.Bottom line: there are many better anime movies out there then Wicked City regardless of what you are looking for in a horror movie. Let this old dog sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nudity and Violence","review":"This movie sucked. Anime costs too much, especially for a movie such as this. To me it seemed like an excuse to pack a movie full of as much sex material as posible and still not call it a hentai. It did not compare to Ninja Scroll at all, and the cheesy music made even semi-good parts suck. Dont buy this movie if you havent seen how bad it was. If you are still suspicious rent it and save yourself the hastle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked Waste of Money","review":"Wicked City is by far one of the worst animes I have ever seen. I'm a huge fan of Ninja Scroll, but Wicked City lacks any positive qualities such as good characters, plot, artwork, or even music. I do enjoy anime gore and some sexuality, but this one just went over the edge. Many of the scenes became ridiculously cheesy and/or gross causing me to laugh or just simply turn my head. Hardcore anime fans may just want to rent this one once to experience its \\"unique\\" style, but I urge everyone to at least watch Wicked City once before buying it to determine if you can stomach its content. I had high hopes for this movie, but it just kept getting worse and worse and I regret ever buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick, Twisted World","review":"I caught this movie on late night cable about a month ago and it has disturbed me ever since. I lost count in the amount of violence especially towards women. How do you have a woman raped by two men and ten minutes later have sex with the one man she is attracted to and who saved her life. A woman is depicted as a spider who shoots webbing from her genetalia? Movies like this make me wonder more about the persons who create this madness. All I can think of is that they are future rapists and serial killers. My sons love Japanese anime. I pray they never come across this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked City","review":"Wicked City was the best Japanimation movie I have ever seen. It is filled with action suspense, horror, and comedy. I sugjest this movie to anybody who likes movies period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"How can any one watch \\"Wicked City\\" and keep a straight face? Do people actually get off on animated nudity and sex? That thought is even more frightening and hilarious than this film. I've watched a lot of Anime in my life and have had to tolerate a lot. Even \\"Urotsukidoji / Legend of the Overfiend\\" has more merits than this film. \\"Wicked City\\" is probably the worst I've seen. It's not really that the content disturbs me. It's the plot of two agents trying to save a dirty old man that is obsessed with porn and whenever he has sex with a woman, she happens to turn into an alien and try to kill him. Not to mention monsters rapping a woman every other scene. It's just too silly and absurd for me. The quality is pretty good and has a moody dark style. The English dubbed actors do a good job but it's all in vain for such a lousy plot and tendencies to show more sex then plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"toldja we shouldn't a landed on this planet !","review":"This movie tries hard to deliver but fails.

Though some similarities between INSEMINOID and ALIEN do exist, this one quickly establishes itself as a story about deep-space maternal instincts gone mad.

As a postpartum doula trainer I have established this book as a required reading for students and I myself have re-read it several times to make sure I stay on track with the mission intended when Mrs. Raphael first discussed the need for this special professional.

However, the the American Larousse appears to have approximately one-third of the content of the French version. As a purely illustrative example, the American version's section on sweetbreads is approximately two columns' worth of loosely-packed print, while the French version features six pages of dense text on the subject.Especially in light of its cost, the American Larousse is a bitter disappointment.

It's almost November 11, 2003, so I may just make it another 3 more weeks until this comes out.This movie was HIGHLY UNDER-rated. I like Tom Berrenger a lot but wouldn't rate him at the top of the actors list. However, the synergy that occurs between Tom and Sidney Poitier helps Tom to perform better than usual, though in all fairness Tom was EXCELLENT in Platoon. In any event, this was a well-made and acted movie that deserves your attention.Some might find the beginning of the movie a little harsh/violent, but this adds intensity to the story (i.e. it is not the usual pointless, wanton, Hollywood shock violence we're used to).I think this is a film that both men and women will enjoy thoroughly. There's the rugged outdoors stuff for the guys- Berrenger seems to fit in well w/rugged, outdoors roles like this and Last of the Dogmen.

This movie blends Sidney Poitier in the role of an FBI agent after a murderer who travels cross-country to get to Canada. I would've loved to see Poitier use this film to revise his role as Virgil Tibbs, but he chose not to. Tom Berenger was excellent as the outdoorsman who leads him in the woods. Kirstie Alley was good as the guide kidnapped by the murderer to lead him out of the woods. This film can still be appreciated despite its first release in 1988. Much of it still holds true. The wonders of nature and outdoors are captivating. The film has drama, action, and humor.

There was an air of creepiness in several parts of this film, good use of humor at opportune times, and the way they threw in guys like Andy Robinson and Richard Masur and a few other shady guys to keep you wondering on the trail, good stuff.I hope everyone will buy this movie.

The studio photography isn't up to the noir standards of Peter Gunn, but the scenes shot on real New York streets (generous amounts of that footage) are like a wonderful time capsule of that long ago age. Riveting stuff, those street scenes. And the jazz group that Johnny S. sits in on as a pianist comprises huge jazz names of the '50s and '60s--Shelly Manne, Red Mitchell, Red Norvo, Barney Kessel.

The main guy doesn't know what he is talking about, and the rest are just kids with high tech toys. Buy Ghost Adventures, it's by far the best show out there and they provide credible evidence. Just a side note... I remember one episode where they think they have a demon in their presence. The main moron then states that 'its dangerous to even say aloud the name of this entity' because of how evil it is. That being said, for something so dangerous, they flash the name of the demon on the tv numerous times during the episode. Come on!!

This amazing album offers more to metal fans than anything on \\"Ride the Lightning\\". Chris Cornell's amazing vocals(so unfairly compaired to Robert Plant)hit more notes than Kim Thayil's guitar. With rock anthems such as \\"Outshined\\", and the amazing drum work on \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\", this album should have gone polyplatinum. Maybe they were just too good for the public to catch on"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of the Best Metal albums of the 90's","review":"This is a true classic. Much better than the entire grunge scene they were unfairly lumped into (because they showed up LONG before that started), Soundgarden made excellent recordings that have passed the test of time unlike most of the bands to come around that time in the US. Badmotorfinger is their best recording. It's much better in every aspect to all of their previous albums and EPs; and heavier and faster than the wonderful and more accessible Superunknown and the somewhat lacking Down on the Upside. I started listening to Soundgarden when I heard their awesome \\"Birth Ritual\\" back in 1992, which was obviously taken from the Badmotorfinger sessions. I still listen to all of their stuff and I feel it's better than Audioslave- but that doesn't mean Audioslave is bad- not at all. Actually, considering how the music scene is right now Audioslave is one of the best bands you can listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another One of Soundgarden's Great Albums...","review":"I love this CD. As soon as I heard the opening track \\"Rusty Cage\\", I knew that this CD would be brilliant. Chris Cornell's vocals are amazing, as usual, which is no suprise. The guitars are also finely tuned, as usual. This is one of the earlier and heavier albums. \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" is byfar my favorite song on the CD. Other standout tracks include \\"Outshined\\" (which features an insanely heavy opening riff, that is played again throughout the song), \\"Face Polution\\", \\"Holy Water\\", \\"New Damage\\", and \\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\\" (my second favorite song on the CD). Pick this one up along with Louder Than Love, another classic Soundgarden album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow up.","review":"Great follow.up to their last cd.

Outshined is the best so.g and stands out as one of their best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOUNDGARDEN'S CLASSIC!","review":"All the music from Soundgarden catalogue is great. They are one of the greatest bands from the metal world, and Badmotorfinger is their classic! Some gems like Outshined and Jesus Christ Pose and other gorgeous moments like Searching with my good eye closed and Room a thousand years wide. In fact, all the songs are great! Soundgarden was at the top in the early 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Soundgarden album","review":"I can't pick a favorite on this album. Jesus Christ Pose sticks out hard and so does Room a Thousand Years Wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Awesome","review":"In my opinion, Badmotorfinger is best Soundgarden album. The group really found its sound here for the first time on a full album. Layered guitar textures by Thayil and amazing vocals by Cornell really pull this one through. The album starts strong with Rusty Cage and ends with New Damage and leaves you wanting more. Sure, theres some filler in the middle, but this is an album that all grunge fans NEED to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for a grunge lover.","review":"This album personifies the genre of grunge. It is very raw and certainly not elegant by any stretch of the imagination. Typically, when I put on this album, a majority of the people I'm with are so disturbed by Chris Cornell's range and screaming power that they want to shrivel up and die. That's not to mention the purposly over-distorted guitar that often doesn't have a shred of traditional musical formation. These guys remind me of a hair metal band from hell. I'm quite certain that any one in the human race will be doing themselves a favour by checking out \\"Slaves and Bulldozers\\" on this album...It is awe-inspiring to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"God and Soundgarden","review":"The goal of every musician is to create, out of the zillions of moments of sounds he or she might make in a career, at least one or two that are GODHEAD. Cornell's vocal in _Slaves and Bulldozers_, along w/Thayil's solo in the same song are Soundgarden's moments of GODHEAD. Even if the rest of the CD were complete crap (which, incidentally, it isn't), you should buy the thing for those few moments alone. They encapsulate everything that matters about heavy music."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing piece of music!","review":"I recently bought this album because my brother who has been a longtime Soundgarden fan told me it was amazing. My favorite bands include Lamb of God, Meshuggah, Burnt By the Sun, Dillinger Escape Plan, etc... so I bought it thinking it would be a good classic to have however it wouldn't be in my cd player everyday. I was wrong. This cd is absolutely amazing. I can't believe people were doing this in 1991... songs like Face Pollution and Jesus Christ Pose are easily as technical as any Dillinger or Meshuggah song and at the same time heavy as hell. As far as Chris Cornell goes... he has never done anything like this again and never will. Great riffs, vocals, songwriting, drumming, drumming, and did I mention drumming make this a must own classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outshined","review":"I really enjoyed the mind trip to my youth. Boy Scouts just wouldn't have been the same with out the Jesus Christ Pose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a punch to the face...","review":"Like a punch to the face, this disc comes at you. From the opening track, \\"Rusty Cage\\"(my fave),it bulldozes it's way right over you, never letting up till the end. Heavy, down-tuned riffs pummel ones brain on the brilliant \\"Outshined\\", to the hair-raising wails of Cornell on \\"Face Pollution\\". This is the CD I put in when I feel like getting a speeding ticket! For someone looking to discover Soundgarden for the first time, this is the CD to get first. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy.","review":"Their earlier albums may have been more grunge, or even punk, but this is no doubt a metal album. Closer to \\"Pantera\\" than \\"Pearl Jam\\". This got them more attention then \\"Louder Than Love\\" did, and includes the tracks \\"Rusty Cage\\", \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\", and \\"Outshined\\". All three awesome songs. But I think the masterpiece here is \\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\\". From front to back, that's a headphones classic. Not everything on here is great, but most of it rocks. Fanatics may want to find the very limited edition of this called \\"SOMMS\\". It comes with an extra 5-track disc. Anyone looking for their first, or only \\"Soundgarden\\" cd, should just get \\"A-Sides\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Soundgarden's best","review":"I believe this was the pinnacle album for the band. I remember when it came out, a friend and I had picked up a copy within days of release. It stayed in our disk players for some time. Every track on the album simply rocks. It blended enough of the early heavy grunge with enough moodiness and mellowness to create the best of Soundgarden. For pure grunge sound, nothing beats Ultramega OK, but for the best of both Soundgarden worlds, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest CD ever","review":"This CD is GREAT. All of Soundgarden's work is superb. I can honestly say I like every song on this CD, not the same, but they'll all great. I really really like Room a thousand years wide. Soundgarden is very talented, they can make a song heavy without ruining the song, that's exactly why they're as famous as they're are. Room a thousand years wide never really got too popular, but it's probably one of my favorites by them.. Also Rusty Cage, Jesus Christ Pose.. all of the songs are so good. This CD and all others by Soundgarden are a MUST BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mal-odious as well as Mel-odious!","review":"This is a very impressive debut from a clearly musically talented band. They remind me a little of Black Sabbath and yet they do have a slightly different twist to their sound enough to make them sound uniquely themselves. Track 6 is one example of this as it shows they can be very hard and yet have a melodious side as well. The guitarist is very good though not quite in the Tony Iommi league as yet but still he plays very interesting chops. The lead singer has a much better voice than Ozzie though. I only gave 4 stars because I suppose for an unremastered disc the sound is okay but after 14 years, it really is about time they cleaned up the sound. Overall, a rather decent disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second best of the big three....","review":"Slightly better than Superunknown, but not quite as good as DOTU. Keep in mind, choosing between Badmotorfinger, Superunknown, and DOTU is like having to decide whether you want steak, shrimp, or Mahi (so long as you love steak, shrimp, and Mahi). Can't go wrong with any of them.Worth buying for: Searching with my Good Eye Closed and Outshined. Searching is an incredible song. Highly recommend it. That said, see below...Icing on the cake: After Searching and Outshined, it's all pretty much icing.Could have done without: Even though Searching is my favorite song on here, I could have done without the intro...both creepy and a bit disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"the first CD i ever had","review":"When I was 9, my family finally got with the times and got a CD player and the very first CD I got (and listened to) was Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger. I almost played this album out and to this day (9 years later) I still love it. From the dual guitars in \\"Rusty Cage\\" to the dreary \\"New Damage,\\" this was a definitive album for Soundgarden, and it was on this album that their craft of Black Sabbath-like drudgery and Led Zeppelin-influenced sophistication (with a hint of Rush-like odd time signatures). My favorites on this album were always \\"Outshined,\\" \\"Slaves & Bulldozers,\\" \\"Jesus Christ Pose,\\" \\"Searching w/ My Good Eye Closed,\\" \\"Room 1000 Years Wide,\\" and \\"New Damage.\\" With Chris Cornell belting out heavy high-pitched lyrics of pure angst, with the amazing guitar solos of Kim Thayil, and the awesome rhythm section of Ben Shepard and Matt Cameron (now of Pearl Jam), Badmotorfinger is a definitive album by Soundgarden, although they would get better on their final 2 efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not GRUNGE; it's pure HEAVY METAL","review":"Yes, yes Badmotorfinger is a heavy metal record! I can't understand why people lump Soundgarden in the \\"grunge\\" genre, which in fact never existed ( it's just another hip name that executives find to force-feed music to the poor and mindless MTV Generation ). What really saddens me though is that many people don't realize the true value of this record. It's quite possibly one of the top 5 metal records released in this decade, and many people seem to ignore it. Badmotorfinger is, without a doubt, what modern Black Sabbath should sound like! Of course, I'm not saying that Soundgarden is a mere Sabbath clone; they are way much more than that...it's a real shame that the band decided to end their activities..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"People!!

The other cuts aren't even worth mentioning. Their second album \\"superunknown\\" is ten times better because you can at least listen to it from time to time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank g0d grunge died out!","review":"Soundgarden are pompous, overblown, pretentious, and epitomise all that was rotten about music in the 1990s. Along with NIrvana, ALice in Chains, and Pearl Jam, Soundgarden were one of those flannel clad, shoe gazing alternative rock bands record companies forced on the public during the early 1990s grunge explosion. Their lyrics were filled with pretentious angst and frustration, which appealed to snobby suburban rich kids who thought their lives were miserable just because their yuppie parents didn't give them a high enough allowance. But we all grow up eventually, and by the time we are adults, angst ridden grunge music no longer appeals to us. THank g0d grunge is dead. GRunge sucks. It is the nu metal of the early 90s, unsophisticated music for unsophisticated listeners.

I watched \\"Heaven's Gate The Untold Story\\" and I was horrified that the producer could try to pass this off as a documentary. I have never seen so much editorializing in a so-called documentary. It was poorly produced, biased and unbalanced, and not worth the hour of my time it took to watch it.

I have done several stories on US based cults, and this amateur style documentary, was obviously thrown together, haphazardly, in a desperate attempt to drain a few nickles out of the pool of human suffering. Clearly the producer has no idea of story cohesion, or of the most simple of lighting techniques available. I am a documentary producer at the University of Chicago, and it appalls me that someone would try to pass this off as legitimate research. There is far more in depth coverage in Newsweeks articles detailing the cult, and can be read in 15 minutes. Having to sit through this docu-style farce, is the real tragedy.

Each entry is short, and it is hard to stop reading once you begin. The Donaldsons did good work in putting this together.

A Phantom addict, I found this version emotionally compelling in such a way as to expand even more on characters I was obsessed with in the film.Beautifully written, it flows wonderfully and you won't regret paying the price for the book. I won't sell mine, that's how good it is.But I have to agree with another reviewer that I did not care for the ending. I sat there with, \\"What the- ?\\" So that was a let down.But there was simply too much to admire, savor and enjoy in this book to pass simply because this creator chose to end it the way she did.Let's face it, to improve on genius would not be an easy task."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritually and emotionally stiring.....","review":"From the moment I read the first words of this book I could barely find time for anything else, including sleep. From the very first page Susan Kay's remarkable story grabbed my attention and interest and held it until the very last page. I have seldom read a more emotionally and heart tugging book. Few and far between are the authors whose words can have such a profound effect on their readers. This is a book to be cherished and definately a must for your personal library.

Absolutely and singlemindedly..... when I was in grade 3. Seriously. There are some parts to it that are actually good, like when Erik is in Persia or ROme.((hence the 2 star rating)) The rest reads like sheer melodrama, which is sad, because this book had great potential.Anyway, the story is intreguing, instead of the basic Phantom story we all know, this starts from the very beginning, and chronicles the life of the extraordinary man, who would become the Phantom.For people who are considering this book, I'd reccomend reading it at the library first. As I said, the book's not bad.. but it wasn't what I remembered it to be. If you like it, then buy it.... don't just order it on a whim though (((unless I'm the only person who does that... heh heh... >_< ))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I did not care for how this story was told, this book should have begun about 250 pages in.

A must for not just phantom (Erik) lovers, but also for people who enjoy solid, top-notch writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Haunting, Lovely and Scarey","review":"In this book Susan Kay takes a monster and makes you fall in love with him. He has been turned into a man who can murder someone in a heartbeat and not break a sweat or blink an eye, and yet the audience aches for him.

Once I started reading it, it was hard to put down. Once I finished reading it, I wanted to see the muscial again and run out and buy all the \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" CDs. The Phantom was so well written--it was more like reading an autobiography rather than a fictional story. It was a beauty story, one that I will read over, and over again. I came to this site looking for a copy of the Phantom, I'm so glad I found it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly amazing...","review":"This is the exact supplement to the Leroux that Phantom phans were looking for. When I first heard about this book, years ago, I was incredibly skeptical. Needless to say, within the first few pages I was hooked and read it all within one day. The characters are all so real...They're emotions reach out and touch you. And Erik, the mysterious Phantom of the Opera, is suddenly so very human. Susan Kay is a marvelous writer, adding great depth to each of her characters. It is quite obvious that she loves Erik, for she tells his story as none other could have. Don't hesitate to buy this book! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!!","review":"Phantom really gives a feeling of Erik, the Phantom's life. It lets you see him as more of a person and understand why he does things. I recomend this book to anyone, not just Phantom fans. The story is moving and wonderful. It shows a facinating character from his own eyes and the eyes of others who have known him. I love this book and think others will as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answered everything!","review":"I am a Phanatic of Erik's story and have read many versions.

I have never heard of Susan Kay, prior to my book discussion's to read her book \\"Phantom\\". I hope this will not be the last Susan Kay book I have the pleasure to read.Kay explains the birth and formative years of the person we will eventually know as The Phantom of the Opera. The first chapter is voiced by Erik's mother. The second by Erik. The voice of each chapter is announced on a front piece. I do not recall ever having such intense feelings for or about so many characters in one book. My emotions ran the gamut from disgust to compassion to joy to sorrow. Now that I have finished the book, I feel I have separated from a dear friend. Fortunately I can visit anytime I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I'm not going to bother writing a long review about this book; other reviewers have done an eloquent job. I just want to say that this book gives an extremely plausible explanation about the 49 years (give or take) leading up to the last year of Erik's life as depicted in the classic tale. Kay does a good job of clearing up the mysteries to which Leroux alludes. I found this an extremely satisfying story, where Erik, in all of his maniacal glory is still, in the end, a sympathetic character. This is most definitely a book that all lovers of the original story should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Phantom of the Opera Fans Listen Up!","review":"I consider myself a TRUE Phantom of the Opera fan and was very skeptical of this book. I almost didn't read it because I didn't want anything to taint the original version. As a matter of fact, I didn't buy this book for myself - it was a gift. I had no intention of buying a copy-cat. Don't make the same mistake I almost made. This book if fabulous! A must read! I am back at amazon to order a couple more copies for my best friends. This book compliments the original Phantom of the Opera so well, and it is impossible to put down. Note: Have some Kleenex nearby! Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phantom Lives","review":"I'm not a critic nor am I a reviewer, but I just finished this book and I'm walking around .like I just lost the love of my life.

Thanks Ms. Kay"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly the best fiction I've ever read!","review":"Not only does susan kay bring the charcters of the story to life, but the reader can understand what moves them to do what they do. By the end of the book the reader laughs with, cries with, and loves, each and every person in the book. The devastation that Eric experiences growing up into manhood makes the reader endeared to him,and I believe every women can understand Christens fears and confusion about love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Webber should do a prequel, not a sequel!","review":"The reason I say His Lordship Webber should read this book is because it would give him great material for a prequel, Not a seqiel to \\"Phantom\\". That story doesn't need a sequel. It's complete in itself. My mom gave this book a long time ago, and I was sad when it fell apart. I think this book is neat because it makes the Phantom, Christine, and Raoul more three-dimensional, believable characters, as well as giving plausible explanations of what happened to Erik the Phantom in his past, which explains why he acts the way he does in the Leroux story and musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom Haunts You","review":"I first read this book years ago while in high school... being a thespian, I had Phantomitis, so I snatched up the book when I ran across it in the bookstore. What I found was a story that went well beyond the musical and which has stayed with me since. Susan Kay breathes life into a mystery... and actually makes him more \\"romantic\\" and mysterious than he was before, if that's possible. I cried through out the story and was terribly upset at the end because it was over. Since that first copy, I've gone through two others and re-read them til they fell apart... I have to admit I'm a bit horrified at the prices now. While this is truly one of my favorite books of all time... I think I'll try to wait it out and see if I can get it at a lower price...."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Let me just say that this book rules!! The background story of one of the most amazing character in literature is finally told! From his beginning years to the last six months of his life, Erik's story is told in breathtaking detail, from his POV to those around him including his mother, an Italian stonemason, his friend the Persian of Leroux's story, Christine, and Raoul.I definetly recommend this book! Leroux himself would be proud of this story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing even close to Leroux's vision for the story","review":"Yuck! what a perverted and twisted version of a really innocent love story! I read the book, hoping to find the same tones and ideas envisioned by Gaston Leroux, since Kay says she has read the original novel nonstop time and time again. Well, obviously she missed something! There is nothing sexual about Leroux's POTO! And all the relationships in Kay's book are screwed up and make absolutely no sense. Please, if you are looking for a companion book, maybe another version of Leroux's story (which is wonderful), you won't find it here. The plots and ideas and the feelings of the characters are so far-fetched, and basically very out of character, I wonder if Susan Kay has ever actaully read Leroux's novel, becuase this story is not based on that book at all and apperantly came from the depths of some twisted and perverted mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!","review":"~This book was absolutely disgusting and revolting. It begins with the story being told by his mother, telling how she hates him then it moves on to his teenage years where he becomes prey to all sorts of disgusting things. If you have any morals whatsoever don't read this book. I personally am a Phantom of the Opera fan but this book was not a welcome addition to the story. I realize that the reason some of the things are in there are because the author wants to give us a background as to why"},{"rating":"2","title":"utterly amazing","review":"this book was utterly amazing! i had been given a gift certificate for my birthday and i was searching in vain for something that i would enjoy, and then out of the corner of my eye i saw something that sent chills down my spine. that stark white mask seemed to be staring at me from the cover of the book! i quickly grabbed it and returned the other paperbacks to their places on the shelves. i could barely contain my excitement as i drove home. i have been a phan for a little over a year and i have read the leroux book twice and i will see the musical in september. this is honestly one of the best books i have ever read (and i have read a lot, believe me!) it is truly worthy of the legacy that is the phantom of the opera. i read over half the book in one day! i truly believe that to some extent that there really was an Erik and i hope you do too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT SO MUCH I ALMOST DON'T WANT TO SHARE IT...","review":"After the plays, the movies, and the original novel, I thought i had sucked in every bit of Phantom available. I walked into a bookstore and literally TRIPPED over this book. Curious by the title, I opened it and began to read. Two hours passed until I could tear myself away long enough to buy it. Since that time, i have read it dozens upon dozens of times. The trouble is, I've never been able to loan it out. Instead, I bought my best friend the copy for his birthday. neither of us have ever been the same. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb tale of a great character!!","review":"This is truly one of THE BEST books I've ever read. Erik's story really hit close to home. His genius and basically good heart were all masked by his face, and no one but Susan Kay could tell this story to such heart-wrenching depth. I've followed everything Phantom, and Susan Kay is definitely on the right track with what I believe Gaston Leroux was trying to say and accomplish with this tale. The way she wove Gaston's characters into a story behind the story was remarkable. Anyone, not just Phantom fans, would truly appreciate this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!!!!","review":"I have been obsessed with The Phantom of the Opera for about two years now. I own the original book and both the Phantom CDs. Never before have I been so moved. I was completely pulled into the book from start to finish. This incredible novel covers the life of Erik from birth to death and even a little after. This book gives you insight to how cruel people are to anything that's different. If you don't cry at least once before the end of this book, either you have no emotions, or there's something wrong with your tear ducts. Now I own Susan Kay's Phantom and I'm never ever giving it up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom by Susan Kay; A complete history of Eric the Phantom","review":"Phantom by Susan Kay should be titled \\"A Complete History of Eric the Phantom of the Opera\\" It is without question one of the most imaginative, romantic, and complete re-tellings of Gaston Leroux's original novel. Ms. Kay has done her homework and done it well as evidenced by the meticulously thought out plot set against a historically correct as possible background. If you want the real story of the Phantom before, during and after \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" skip the terrible \\"Phantom of Manhattan\\" and pick up a copy of \\"Phantom\\" by Susan Kay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this book out of print?????","review":"I sincerely believe a publishing company should have jumped at the opportunity to reissue this book when the Phantom of the Opera movie came out last year. This telling of the phantom's tale is so touching and thorough, it far surpasses the original. Why, oh why, has no one reissued this book?I'm so glad I got my used hardcover before all of the used book seller decided to charge upwards of $100 per copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super read!","review":"Susan Kay starts her book with Erik's birth and takes it through to his death. It's a dark story and made you feel for the young Erik. The older Erik was so much the Michael Crawford version from Phantom I found myself rooting for him to win Christine as much as I did when I saw the show! Susan Kay gave the story a beautiful ending that Erik himself would have loved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in a long time","review":"I've read Phantom 2 times so far and I'm recommending it to all my friends who like The Phantom of the Opera.

I'd still wholly recommend this book if you want a sweeping story with great characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and excellent read","review":"This has to be one of the best books I have read in a really long time. It gives a brillant depth to the phantom's life. Though I felt that the portrayal of Christine's character made her too \\"weak\\" (I always thought she should be strong), the rest of the book more than makes up for this one small shortcoming. I called out of work to finish reading this book! I recommend it to any fan of Phantom of the Opera. I can't stop talking about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful...but","review":"This is a fantastic book, staying very true to the original novel, unlike so many others. But there are a few problems. Mainly the ending. It was totally unnessisary for Erik & Christine to sleep together at the end. Besides being wrong, it takes away from the deep pity, sorrow, and heartbreakingness in the original. It also seems to imply that Christine's heart really belonged to Erik all along, not Raoul. While this is what you *want* to happen, the way you think it *should* be, it takes away from the patheticness and dorrow in the original. my summary: Fantastic...until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veiws of a highschooler..","review":"Overall, I thought this book was incredible.

It's totally incredible and the outcome made me cry.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A kind of love that is spelled C-A-N-O-N D-E-A-T-H","review":"Is this book decently written? The first few chapters are pretty good. If you can get past the endless amount of angst, improbable infant achievements, poorly characterized characters, and sexy, sexy corpses, it's not soul hemorrhage inducing. The Persia chapter of the book really shines. It's after that that Susan Kay should have slapped a 'finis' in and sent it off to the publisher. It's a decent read, but certainly not better than the original in any way, shape or form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating and Astounding...","review":"I read this book a while ago and STILL haven't gotten over it!

But this book gives you much more insight to his tortured mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book has it all !","review":"Phantom was recommended to me by a freind, And how happy I was that I took his advice. The book is especially good because you have no opportunity to become bored with the characters. Susan Kay moves from one character to the other, seamlessly telling the story from their point of view, and how they were all affected by Erik. I must Disagree with many others who have reviewed this book saying that this was a good Romantic Novel, It is much more than that, and to say such a thing would scare away the men from reading such a well done book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"When I started reading this book, from the first couple of pages it pulled me in, and I could barely put the book down. I loved the diffrent points of views, and I love Kay's writing style! She brought the story alive, and keeps it going until the last words of the story. I didn't like the ending too much, but I loved the way she portrayed Erik, and she gave him a whole other side. She seemed to answer questions that Leroux left unanswered, but also opened a few more. But all in all I loved this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"No one can choose where we will love...\\"","review":"One of the most heart-wrenching,tear-jerking tales I have ever read.

It's the perfect companion to Michael Crawford's interpretation of a Erik as a beautiful soul trapped in a horrific body. It shows how the actions and prejudices of others can warp someone. (BTW - Break out the hankies. I've read this book several times & I cry in the same four places every time.) Its not all tragedy though, Erik's wicked sense of humor had me laughing out loud at times. If you like the story of the Phantom of the Opera you must read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE best novel I've read, second only to Leroux's...","review":"Being an avid, albeit new, obsessee of the story of Erik, Christine, Raoul, and the Paris Opera House(L'Opera Garnier), I was recommended this book by a good friend who stated clearly \\"You are not a fan until you read this book.\\" So, taking her advice, I bought one of the original copies of the book, and have loved it ever since. I would even go as far as to say that it's the \\"Bible\\" of the Phantom world. The way Kay tells of Erik's childhood and adolescent life gives you an insight to what made him the way he was in Leroux's novel. The novel gives you a view of how Christine did indeed love Erik, and leads you to believe that she really would have stayed with him, had he not died. And it gives \\"I love you Erik. I love you in so many ways but my love is the love of a child afraid to grow up...\\" as the reason Christine chooses Raoul.If you count yourself as even a partial phan, you MUST read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book brought me to tears several times...","review":"This has got to be one of my favorite books EVER, and I'm pretty picky about my favorite book list. It is definitely an improvement on Gaston Leroux's original (the original focused only on the Phantom's last days). This book brought me to tears several times. It is the story of the Phantom, from the beginning of his life to the end, told in several voices of different people in his life. AMAZING historical detail and gut-wrenching scenes. At its heart is a love story so inspiring, it will make you re-read the book again and again. The ending is awesome, where everything comes full circle. This book is perfect for Phantom fans, and for those who have yet to discover the Phantom of the Opera!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is my favorite book, and let me say, I'm an AVID reader. I go through a couple books a week, at the very least. This book never fails to move me. I've read it over and over, it totally absorbs me, and I read it every couple years, and there are very few books I can say that about anymore, as my attention span tends to wander...Hey look! A squirrel!Seriously though, this is such a great story. It fleshes out the story and answers so many questions I'm sure most Phans have wondered. What was Erik's (the Phantom's)childhood really like? Where did he learn all his skills? How exactly did the Persian come into the story? It beautifully incorporates the different versions of Erik and pays tribute to them.I rather think it might be better then Leroux's original, blasphemous as that might sound. I wonder if he'd like it.Seriously. If you're a Phan (you'll know what that means) and want a compelling read, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't tell a book by its cover","review":"Once again, a book that was overwhelmingly favorably reviewed is one that I cannot even get through.

The author done an excellent job as far as I am concern she gave me my money's wroth. If you don't like long and especially challenging books do not READ them and then try to fault the author of a great read. I feel that books as such maybe should come with a warning saying CAUTION not for fast and unable to keep up with an extreme amount of characters please do not attempt to read!! REMMBER this is just my opinion. I love the book but was ready to read only this book usually I am able to read 2-3 books at the same time but would not even try with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunday Jews","review":"The book was well-reviewed, but I found it terribly disappointing. The characters are both unrealistic and unsympathetic, the book is stuffed with solecisms, particularly regarding Judaism, and the writing style is at best precious and at worst impenetrable."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could it get good reviews?","review":"My wife read the cover reviews, full of praise, so we both checked it out of the library, and spent 15 minutes reading passages to each other, at first with dismay, and then, thankfully, with a lot of laughs. It was consistently, horribly written: flabby sentences, pretentious settings (like we should care she dines with university presidents), characters one wishes to . . .(oh, nevermind). Just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank god. I thought it was just me.....","review":"(I'm tickled to see these other reviews.)I tried. Really I did. But to no avail.Too many characters to keep track of. No discernable connection between them...even though they're supposedly in the same family! How did the author stay interested enough to tell this story?Knowing that this author was president of PEN and the American Congress of Letters (or whatever) makes me think that the Empress has no clothes. Or that she simply had a multi-book contract to fulfill and that because of her \\"fame\\" no one at the publisher had te balls to reject the manuscript....."},{"rating":"1","title":"700 pages of boredom","review":"The only reason I finished this book is because once I start a book, I finish no matter how bad. The writing style of this book is odd and hard to pay attention to. I can't tell you how many times my mind wondered and I didn't pay attention to what i had just read. Too many implications with no answers. Do I come to my own conclusion? I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious - VERY","review":"The most pretentious book I have ever read. Who in the world talks like these people or this author?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A reader in New York, N.Y.","review":"I am heartened to see so many readers willing to disclose how awful this book is. The only way I got through it is by its being the only book I had on a 12 hour flight. There is not a true or credible character to be found in nearly 700 pages. I tolerate a wide variety of writing styles, but not ones that are deliberately opaque. There are pages of utter gibberish here. And honestly, the \\"deep thoughts\\" are just silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Center Director","review":"The pole pad is used on an outdoor, 4 1/2\\" single pole standards. Putting the pad on was very easy with the attached straps. I am not sure about the life of the pad, given the harsh weather of cold as well as hot/humid temps that we have in the northeast.

One of my favorite bands & I adore the sound of Cornell's voice. His style of singing & he can range four octaves. The lyrics are poetic & the musical composition rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundgarden-Loud, angry...and good.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this when it came out. I was 14 and it was different than anything I had really heard. Different songs from this one band could (almost) be fit into different genres. There was a hardness to it and yet a more tempered feel at times. I think that the band showed a hint of what was to come and I have always thought they were innovative in their approach. This one was no different and did NOT disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best of the 90's","review":"this CD rocks from start to finish! Soundgarden is certainly the best band to have emerged from the Seattle scene and is in my opinion, much more interesting and effective than Nirvana or Pearl Jam.most interesting of all is the moods Soungarden can deliver throughout the course of this recording. tunes like 'Black Hole Sun' and 'Limo Wreck' have an obvious melancholy to them while other tunes are simple, uptempo, in your face rock-n-roll packed with plenty of energy. all the members are solid musicians and the produciton on this CD, for those of you who pay attention to that, is top notch with some nice layering of guitar and vocal tracks.i aslo recommend: Down On The Upside (also Soundgarden), OK Computer or Kid A (Radiohead), Darkk Bros., Foo Fighters..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superunknown is the ultimate climax in Soundgarden music","review":"Perhaps the greatest aspect of this album is its consistency and its variety. The trademark operetic wailings of Chris Cornel and the wa wa pedal solos of Kim Thail are all packed together to tell you what band you're listening too, but the depth and maturity in this album, relative to the heavier and less musical in my opinion albums of their past, give you a rich education in rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"\\"Black Hole Sun\\" is by far one of the best songs ever made. But other than that few songs are widely known. However, this album is awesome. The dark moody sound only helps to emphasize the character of Chris Cornell's vocals, and he plays on the band extremely well. Of all the tracks, my second fav would have to be the unknown song \\"4th of July.\\" This CD is great, especially for those with good sound systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as \\"Nevermind\\"","review":"Superunknown is one of those hardrock records you bump into maybe once in a five years! The phenominal melodic gifts Mr. Cornell has are very rare these days! And when put together with the catchy hard riffs of Mr. thayil, the ultimate hard rock experience is there. Listen to the hardrockers like \\"My Wave\\", \\"Let Me Drown\\" or \\"Spoonman\\", or the more softer and melodic \\"Black Hole Sun\\" or \\"Superunknown\\", and you will understand why this is concidered as the zenit in the soundgarden's career. Very rarely - perhaps never, actually - have I heard a record, that has 15 (on my euro-version there's 16) songs but which still manages to keep on the sheer energy, intensity and innovativity. A definite 90's classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Band Out of Seattle","review":"This Album Rocks&the Lyrics are Great.Of Course it was Black Hole Sun that got my attention but after Getting this Disc I was Really Feeling the Vibe Of The Words&Music.The Raw Feel got My Attention.i wish they could have stayed together because they are one of the few bands over the past Decade that still matter.4th of July is the cut.One OF The Best Albums of the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just to reiterate...","review":"Great to see all of these reviews which show what an undeniable force this album was and still is. The best album of the 1990's, and one of the best ever made, to be sure. Let Me Drown will forever stand as one of the best songs to kick off any album. Fell on Black Days is a classic, which just happened to get a lot of airplay. The sequence of Superunknown, Head Down, and Black Hole Sun is the apex of the whole experience, but the remainder of the album is far from anticlimactic. Limo Wreck, Fresh Tendrils, The Day I Tried to Live, and Like Suicide carry the latter half through an epic journey. In spite of the mostly dark themes of the material, this album is an uplifting triumph for those of us who love great songs and great albums, on the scale of Gershwin, Mozart, and the Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd!","review":"Soundgarden is a great band. This is their best cd. My favorite 2 songs are the title track \\"Superunknown\\" and \\"The day I tried to live.\\" BUY IT NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superunknown is a Great Rock Album","review":"Although they didn't achieve the success of their friends' Alice In Chains, Nirvana and Pearl Jam the music on this album is more impressive than ever. The songs display the explosive low-tuned guitar notes of Kim Thayil along with bassist Ben Shepard and Drummer Matt Cameron, proving to be one of rocks most potent rhythm sections. And of course you have the ultimate Soundgarden signature of singer Chris Cornell's wailing, powerful vocals.The album shows it's maturity with songs like \\"Kickstand\\", \\"Like Suicide\\" and \\"Mailman\\". The best part of album are the singles \\"Spoonman\\" (which features a slight cheesy but interesting megaphone spoken word type vocals) and \\"Black Hole Sun\\" a dark psychedelic moody power ballad that broke Soundgarden into the Top 40. This is a great rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"jesus tries to crack a smile beneath another shovel load","review":"this album contains some of the most dark and deep lyrics you will ever encounter. the opening track \\"let me drown\\" sets the tone for the whole album. there are many heavy tracks such as \\"mailman\\" and \\"4th of july.\\" the latter is the definitive track of the album. it seems to nicely compliment \\"black hole sun.\\"of course you can't forget \\"the day i tried to live,\\" which is without question the greatest song EVER written by anyone. it is truly an amazing masterpiece.amidst the darkness there are also several uplifting tracks like \\"kickstand\\" \\"half\\" and \\"head down\\". many hardcore fans feel that this album is over-produced, but this is hardly the case. it's this level of production that is neccesary to create such songs as \\"superunknown\\" and \\"black hole sun.\\" listen to this album alone in a dark room or in the back seat of a car on a road trip while looking off into the distance."},{"rating":"2","title":"a grunge masterpiece","review":"rhis cd along with ten,facelift and core from stp were the defining alternative albums of the eighties.songs like spoonman,the day i tried to live and black hole sun are what made this cd great.very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last great rock CD","review":"11 years and counting since this CD came out. 11 years and counting since there has been another rock CD as good as this. Every track on here is an absolute killer. No filler, no dumb lyrics, no choruses that get amazingly boring after one listen (Linkin Park and Green Day anyone?) \\"Fell On Black Days\\" is an amazing track along with \\"Superunknown\\", \\"Spoonman\\", \\"The Day I Tried To Live\\", and of course \\"Black Hole Sun\\" which has a great guitar solo about 3 minutes into the song. Everything here sounds very original despite the heavy Zeppelin/Sabbath influences that Soundgarden has. It's too bad they are no more however the were smart to exit while on top and Cornell's new group, Audioslave, is a band to watch out for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This album has been with me for around 11 years If Im not mistaken, this is a wonderful album, what Grunge was really about! The same amazing lyrics from Cornell, and the sweet guitar of Thayil. Tight, band, nice dark lyrics, smooth transitions 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"I just dug this CD out of my massive CD collection for the first time in two or three years. Once I listened to it, I was reminded why I bought it in the first place. The entire CD is excellent, especially \\"My Wave\\" and \\"Fell on Black Days\\". This is one of the best rock albums of the 90's, no question."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best, but not 100% good grunge...","review":"I really like this album nad it's great to listen to, but some of the songs on the album don't need to be there. I love Mailman, My Wave and Black Hole Sun more than any of the others and Head Down, Spoonman, and Like Suicide are other songs that really leave an impact. It's songs like Fresh Tendrils that are just annoying. I wish that they would have left that song off of the album and about two others. I don't like skipping around. It's better that Down on the Upside, though. That album is just OK for Soundgarden. Overfloater reminds me of Pink Floyd and that is the high point on the album. There are other good songs, though. Buy it if you're a Soundgarden fan. If you want a good album, buy either Superunknown, A-Sides, Badmotorfinger, Louder than Love or the Flower EP. Those are your best buys. Don't disregard this album, however, Mailman and My Wave are songs that a Soundgarden fan cannot do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and polished","review":"Well, this is a record I heard daily in the spring days of 1994, but now, let's say it's some of the records I don't want to let any of my friends know I have. After the excellent ULTRAMEGA OK (just the title says all) and the less excellent Badmotorfinger this must be considered as the complete sell-out! The only really cool track is Ben Shepherd's \\"Half\\". I can't help thinking of pop-grunge fourteen year old girls with pierced noses when I hear \\"Black Hole Sun\\". Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare of a purchase unless you love thrash metal!!","review":"Was shocked to be recommended this album after listening to & loving Sublime. Not at all in the same genre. Absolutely hated it. Skimmed through all the tracks in utter horror before giving it to my brother - sorry guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"They just copied Nirvana. It was a major rip-off. Dont buy it! Buy any of the other Nirvana cd's because they are all better than this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"their best album ever!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this is by far the best work garden has ever put out,if you dont have it you need to buy it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a voice! What a band!","review":"This is Soundgarden's most famous album and deservedly so. It is dark and moody, but has some upbeat stuff too. \\"Fell on Black Days\\" is my favorite on this one. Everything about it is excellent. It has the perfect balance that is so hard to find in many songs. \\"Black Hole Sun\\" is the mega-hit from this album. It is an excellent song which shows how beautiful Chris Cornell's voice can be (it also has a very original video). \\"Spoonman\\" is the other radio hit and is different than most of their songs. It has a great beat and some very cool drumming. \\"The Day I Tried To Live\\" is a very interesting song. The lyrics make it seem like someone is given a chance to live and they waste it. This is another screamer and features more of the signature tightness from the band. There are many other good songs on this album, but I feel these are the biggest standouts. Any fan of the grunge era owes it to themselves to get this. It is a prime example of the genre at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This is simply a masterpiece. Soundgarden evidently learned from Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath how to make a heavy and melodic record that is ethereal, moody, and full of raw rock and roll power. Chris Cornell is one of the greatest rock and roll singers of all time. This album has it all from great ballads like \\"Black Hole Sun\\" and \\"Fell on Black Days\\" to heavy rockers like \\"My Wave,\\" \\"Superunknown,\\" and \\"Spoonman.\\" Some of the tracks that didn't receive much radio play like the Zeppelinesque \\"Fresh Tendrils,\\" the dark and moody \\"4th of July,\\" and \\"The Day I Tried To Live\\" are every bit as good as the singles. This album sounds every bit as good in 2005 as it did in 1994. There are probably very few classic albums that came out in the 1990s. This is one of them. Soundgarden and Alice in Chains are probably the best of the grunge bands. Alice in Chains, however, never put out a masterpiece. Soundgarden did."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOUNDGARDEN METAL","review":"Superunknown is a piece of art in the metal world. The Soundgarden sound evolution is real clear here. The band mature the heavy metal of Badmotorfinger and create this classic. Some songs like Fell on Black days, The day i tried to live and Spoonman are gems. All the album are great!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Great classic 90's grunge album, highly recommended if you like bands like Nirvana or just rock in general"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tied with Badmotorfinger as Best Soundgarden Album","review":"This album, along with Badmotorfinger, is perfect in every way. I believe neither surpasses each other because they are two completely different styles , which also proves that Soundgarden was not only one of the greatest bands ever, but also one of the most creative and progressive. Badmotorfinger was more heavy in your face rock, while this album has a darker mood with great melody and songs you will never forget. What makes this album so great is how perfectly all of the band members work so perfectly together to create such harmony. Containing the must-have songs Fell on Black Days, Black Hole Sun, Like Suicide, 4th of July and Limo Wreck, you simply must have this album or you are missing out on musical perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD ever","review":"this is my favorite cd of all time. although my favorite band is nirvana, my favorite song and cd are both by soundgarden. 4th of july is the best song of all time. all of the other songs(with the exception of half and kickstand, which totaly sucked)are absolutely phenomonal. i love this cd. it is a must buy for grunge fans. i recommend it over any other cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of 94 and the rest of the 90s.","review":"I know I must be offending people by saying this but Soundgarden isnt my favorite grunge band.I think they were a great band no doubt about that but Chris Cornells voice can be a little too unsettling at times such as on Limo Wreck but I think this was a great album.From the opening Let Me Drown to the closing track Like Suicide every song on here is done with style,grace and talent.My favorite song on here is Black Hole Sun but Fresh Tendrils comes in a close second with Fell On Black Days coming in a mean third.I think the riffs on here are great and Chris Cornell has a very talented singing voice no doubt about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"SuperOk","review":"Yet another 90s metal band generally though of as alternative. It was really Pop Metal that was absent in the early 90s. Soundgarden is similar to Alice In Chains, Candlebox and Blind Melon, though somewhat more interesting. They also have a lot in common with various grunge bands. Stand outs include \`Fell On Black Days' \`Black Hole Sun' and \`Spoonman', all of which received attention on alternative radio. Recommended for hard rock fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD has it all","review":"Just a couple of thing to say about this CD...first off, there isn't a single weak song on the CD except maybe for 'Half'. the other thing is that these are the songs you should listen to closely: The Day I Tried to Live, Fourth of July, Like Suicide, and Superunknown. Finally, try some of Soundgardens other CD's such as: Screaming Life/Fopp, Ultramega OK, Louder than Love, Badmotorfinger, and Down on the Upside. Take my word as a long-time Soundgarden fanatic that these CD are worth their weight in gold. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Incredible Album","review":"Am I the only one whose favorite song on the album is \\"Head Down\\"? That has to be the most hypnotic and addictive song ever recorded and such a different sound for Soundgarden. However, there are plenty of traditional rocking greats here as well. Soundgarden at their height and by far superior to anything Audioslave has done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably soundgardens most universal album","review":"On all their early albums soundgarden didn't really appeal to all crowds of rock other then metal and grunge fans but with superunknown soundgarden are much more diverse in there music style and pretty much anyone who likes rock can appreciate this album. Lyrically this album is extremely deep and one of the best and musically you don't get much tighter playing then this. The best songs are fell on black days, 4th of july, the day i tried to live and like suicide. This album holds together very well and is enjoyable no matter what mood your in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mellow contribution to Grunge....","review":"This album stunned me in ways more than once. Back in February of '94, I remember hearing their new song on the radio titled \\"Black Hole Sun\\", which is today a classic song. I was singing along to it instantly, and I liked it so much I bought the album on its release date in March 8.After listening to \\"Black Hole Sun\\" countless times, I decided to listen to the other tracks on the album, and they were freakin' awesome. \\"Superunknown\\" was a very catchy song and \\"Fell on Black Days\\" was a very dark yet meaningful song.I can also remember scratching the hell out of the cd and having to buy a new copy about three months after I had bought the original. That is how good it is, so if you're walking into \\"fye\\" or \\"Sam Goody\\" or Best Buy\\" or where ever there are cds, remember to get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Soundgarden Album","review":"What can I say... This album is outstanding! I never get tired of listening to this CD. I'm not going to sit here and write a fancy review about this CD. It is what it is...

You'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes, dark","review":"I keep listening to this album - technically about perfect - that said, it's to my ear overproduced and not quite true to the voice of the artists at times - but still brilliant and powerful! Very much among the strongest music I have heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album from an amazing band","review":"I just saw Soundgraden and fell in love with this album all over again. It is truly a masterpiece from one of the great rock bands of all time. The vocals have amazing dynamics from sweet to raw and aggressive, the guitar is tasty heavy, intricate and varied, the bass is very interesting and adds a lot to the song and the drums are amazing. Matt Cameron is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundgarden owns Seattle metal sound","review":"This is the way albums should be made. Everything from the booklet to the CD graphics are superb. The music is amazing. They combine angst with desparation and never look back. Metal hasn't been so good since Tool released Undertow in 1992. If you don't own this album, you are not getting something."},{"rating":"1","title":"a well-padded magazine article in need of an editor","review":"I snatched this book up when I saw it; what an interesting topic: \\"The Inner Life of Music and Mathematics.\\" But I was disappointed in the book. The author acknowledges that the book grew out of an essay he wrote for the Sunday (New York) Times; it still seems like a magazine article; only, to stretch it out to book length, the writing just kind of rambles, with little apparent discipline, efficiency, or signs of editing. It was probably a heck of an essay; unfortunately, it's not a heck of a book. I gained a few insights (none of which were original to the author), but overall it was a yawner. I think there's still a good book yet to be written on this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"This book is Clarke's first, and is a neat little book.It's not up to his later standards, but for me, was fun reading.It shows the start of early radar and some interpersonal conflicts/relationships at his 1st RAF posting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and light read..............","review":"I picked this book after reading the reviews and and I'm so glad I did.

I could not identify with the characters and the narrative was disjointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great day read !

I was in the mood for Witches and Magic - hoping for Bewitched meets Practical Magic so I entered the key word Witch and Kitchen Witch popped up and looked like it would fit the bill. Then Poof! The witch wasn't really a witch. There was no magic. It was just the tired story of a pretty woman who uses her beauty to get what she wants. She bewitched the men but not me. It was cute if you enjoy romantic fluff but that isn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just can't get into it","review":"I tried, I really tried to care about the characters in this book. They were so incredibly boring and/or annoying. I didn't care about the heroine or her difficulties in fact I was offended by her behavior when she was trying to get the job. She lied, and still expected people to respect her? Please, this book ended up in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"I actually put it down...","review":"I just didn't enjoy it. I didn't feel for the characters at all (even with the introduction of the young, single parent boy)... and ended up donating the book before it was finished. The plot seemed to be nonexistent, the dialogue trying too hard to be suggestive.... and really... underwear flying around the office? Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Porn Pathetic","review":"I was incredibly disappointed by this book. I stopped at chapter 2 and started skimming to see if it was worth it to muddle through the shallow characters and weak plot. What I quickly found was soft porn thinly (and I do mean thinly) veiled as a story. Why bother with character development or a solid plot when you can throw constant sexual tease and teen-boy-sex fantasy in its place. Pathetic really. Try Madelyn Alt for decent characters that grow, for real sexual tension, nicely developed plots and an overall good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cooking in this kitchen stinks","review":"I was really disappointed in this story because the title sounded so cute. However, I was horribly wrong and was unable to finish because I just could not stand the the 2 main characters, Logan and Melody. They both have an obvious attraction toward each other, but whine whine is all they do. If they did get together at the end of the book, they deserve each other. Find another book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has potential but...","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but was disappointed. I read the first 5 chapters before putting it down. All I can say is that there is too much sexual tension and not enough witchery. Maybe if I had read further it would have gotten better, but there was only so much desperate sexual attraction that I could take."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny!","review":"I loved this story. Melody and Logan are destined to be together, no matter how different they are, and boy are they different. Oh, and Logan's son Shane is a hoot. This story is a riot. It's got everything you need for a fun evening of reading, and you will read it in one night. You won't be able to help yourself.Melody has the smarts to land a job as a TV cook, because she watches cooking shows all the time and she figures, I can do that. But, really, she doesn't know how to cook. No problem. She learns and while she's learning from her sexy upstairs neighbor and Producer, they're falling in love, though the lust is great too.This is a great beginning to Blair's witch trilogy and I can't recommend it highly enough. It's a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful and Sassy Romp Through the Kitchen","review":"This book was a fun, light-hearted romantic romp. As to the Title, \\"The Kitchen Witch\\", I'll leave you to figure out whether stunning Melody Seabright is one or not.Ms. Seabright certainly bewitched me with her upbeat cheerfulness and loving heart. Melody only wants a job to prove she can take care of herself, and to show her Father, that he can be proud of her.Logan Kilgarvin only wants to prove to himself and his young son, Shane, that he can be a good Father and provider.The sky is alight with the sparks between these two when they meet. Exploding chickens aside, this book was a joy to read and I laughed myself silly.I look forward to reading the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun. I loved it.","review":"The beginning of one of the best romantic comedy series I've ever read. Witchy, yet not, absolutely hilarious. A great love story.

They're the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cute story but not sexy enough for me.","review":"I thought this book was very cute and I don't regret buying it but it wasn't what I was expecting. I really expected a little more romance. The story was nice and it was definitely funny but if your used to Christine Warren novels this doesn't compare. It's a nice story and a good way to pass the time but not one I would rush out to purchase. It's well written and everything jut not one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, if you're twelve or have never read a book before","review":"This is a really terrible book. When Amazon recommended it to me I thought it was a crime book or a book about witchcraft - I like those. This is a terrible romance chicklit rubbish (I also like some of those but this is awful). It mainly focuses on the main characters ERECTIONS which are very frequent and describtions of his \\"THICKNESS????\\". The sex scenes are unbelievable (at least to those who have actually had sex) and the main characters are flat and empty (except for the kid, who at age four is surely a child wonder as he takes active part in adult life and conversations, am guessing the author never met a four year old). Also the characters are supposed to have \\"baggage\\" and a \\"past\\" but really their lives have been rather uneventful so you don't get what the fuss is about. AVOID - Please!Ps. I really wanted to like this - so against better judgement I read it through waiting for it to get better - it didn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched, Not Wicked","review":"This book has great cover art and terrific marketing behind it. And trust me, that's all it has.Here's the whole book: two very attractive people spend hundreds of pages ALMOST having sex. Can you guess the climax of the plot? It doesn't really matter, because you won't care by the time it rolls around.The writing is execrable. The barely-there plot is completely predictable. The characters are one-dimensional. Gigantic passages are devoted to explicit descriptions of the characters' sexual antics, but they're not even erotic.This book is being aggressively marketed, but I can't explain why. Please don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't find the story past the sex","review":"I thought the premise of this book was great but I was so disappointed. It is one a the few books I threw out. I tried and I tried but I got disgusted with the sex. Give me the story with the sex thrown in, but this guy's every thought in the book was sexual. It was too much for me and I moved on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise that never went anywhere","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The premise is great and the opening drew me in, but after that, it fell flat. Logan and Melody don't seem very well fleshed out and I never understand them. The writing is entertaining, but I never really cared about the characters and had to struggle to finish.Another thing I thought was odd - there is no witch or witchcraft in this book. Because of the title, I expected a fun story about a witch. But Melody just pretends, which was kind of like my impression of the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but no magic","review":"I'm a sucker for a wacky, funfilled romance. This was close enough for government work - I'd give it 2 1/2 stars. But I cannot tell you how annoyed I was to find out that there is NO ACTUAL MAGIC in this book (a la Mary Janice Davidson). It's NOT a paranormal. No matter what the title and description insinuate, Melody is NOT a witch. She's just a girl who dresses like a witch as a gimmick for her cooking show because she lives in Salem (in fact, the misleading advertising is what dropped this from a 3 to a 2 when I had to choose). Other than that, it's cute and fast enough for a beach read, but the characters are a bit shallow and rather irritatingly un-self-aware, and the ending is a little trite. Not the worst book I've read by any stretch of the imagination, good enough that I'll probably give Blair another shot, but I can't recommend it without a lot of warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"yummy romp through the not so supernatural","review":"I picked up this book thinking it had a little flair of supernatural. I was wrong but still wasn't dissapointed. It turned out to be a sweet and funny story about a woman taking advantage of her reputation as a witch, a very sweet little boy, and his dad who just now gets to be with his son.I liked the idea of the TV show and the sparks flying between our \\"witch\\" Melody and new father Logan. The intimate scenes are not sugarcoated with pretty words, but there aren't too many of them and they don't last long. So if that normally bothers you it doesn't play that large of a role here. I also found the other woman vying for Logan and the situations that came up with her pretty unbelievable...one minute something huge happens and then the consequences are not mentioned for many many days. I still would reccommend this story- just remember to suspend your disbelief during those scenes. This story is wonderful girly fluff and I have gone back for seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item for Wedding Gift","review":"I have purchased 2 of these frames for recent weddings and both parties loved them. I definately would purchase again. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the heart-shaped design in the lower right corner. It looks great with portrait orientation but if the photo you are using works best with landscape orientation, it may need to be flipped and printed \\"backwards\\" in order to work without the heart being upside down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nutty Morons Aside...","review":"After reading the review from the raving egotist who gave the book one star simply because Mr. Ellis doesn't think he's as smart as his mom told him he is I thought that I should write one too, but I'll keep it short.If you are interested in nature, science, etc. and are looking for an engaging, casual book to spend some time with you'll learn a lot from this one.The book is written for the Average Joe and is in Average Joe language, so if you believe that you're the guy Einstein stole all his ideas from you might find the book too simplistic, but if you're a normal person who likes reading about science the book will keep you entertained.Oh and watch out for Steve Alten.

I watch movies for entertainment not to pattern my life after. I would be ignorant judge my standards and any one eles by a movie. So I found it very entertaining.

I almost do not recognize her in this movie. I think that this is one of my favorite Halle Berry movies.I do not like movies that paint black women in stereotypical light and down grade the worth of black women. But this movie did not come off as offensive to me, it was just pure funny and not an attack. I do not know how to explain it. I think that it made fun of situations with a touch of imagination. The person who wrote this movie probably attended a hair convention in Georgia one time and another time listened to some young girls who wanted to be in music videos and was inspired by other things that they have seen or heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!!!","review":"This movie is so funny. I love the the actors and the funny moments. This movie always makes me laugh, and puts me in a good mood. If you want something light and funny this is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time a campy BLACK comedy came along!","review":"I for one am sick of reviewers like Mr. Maltin automatically panning everything that isn't of the same level as say \\"The English Patient\\" or \\"Casablanca\\". Some movies are just straight up comedy, aiight already?! While this movie does portray stereotypes such as the trashy ghetto fabulous urban black wannabe diva and the ultra snobby and stuffy white Beverly Hills millionaire, these stereotypes are (it seems to me) intentional and just add to the laughter! Yes, the plot is contrived, yes it probably couldn't happen in real life, but who gives a s@#$? It's funny as hell, filled with celebrity cameos, and let's face it - where else could one see Miss Halle Berry sporting gold teeth, finger waved platinum blond hair, and vinyl hot pants?! The hairstyles and clothes alone are enough to laugh oneself into intensive care! This movie is the type I have been waiting to see for quite awhile, a campy black comedy for the 90's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"B.A.P.S","review":"CONTRARY TO OTHER REVIEWS, I TOTALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. I FOUND IT VERY FUNNY AND ETHNIC. IT WAS A CONCEPT MOVIE OF HUMOR THAT WAS FOR LAUGHING, NOT FOR EDITING FOR GOOD OR BAD QUALITY.

EVERYONE SHOULD LIGHTEN UP AND JUST LAUGH AT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MOVIE TO THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable, yet uplifting","review":"The one thing i especially liked about the movie was that in spite of the stereotypes the girls remained themselves.

First, if you like four beautiful women in tight pants showing lots of cleavage, who, after shooting some bottles off a fence, become accomplished gunslingers and hit everything they shot at, whether they aim at it or not, and you don't mind a thin plot and dumb dialog, then this is the movie for you.If, however, you like something at least remotely close to the old west, has a plot and decent dialog, this movie is not for you. In one scene, the girls are taking target practice. The only problem is, they are standing in front of a road with automobile tire tracks visible.

I do not have a HDTV, however, I plan to buy one in the near future. DVD disc sound and picture, when hooked up to a typical television set, are excellent. I put a music CD disc in, and it also sounded great. It is a very good value for the money. The only problem I have had with it occured when I tried to play a DVD disc that I rented from a supermarket. It was just too scratched up for it to be played. According to \\"Consumer Reports\\", some DVD players can play damaged DVDs and damaged CDs. I suppose that also depends on how badly they are damaged.

Besides playing almost every format of disc known, it is firmware upgradable, so it will likely keep pace with new formats as they become available. One reviewer said that it was not user-friendly. Do not confuse a great degree of user-selectable preferences as being complicated. Novice users can play it right out of the box, but power users will find it ultimately enjoyable.

The progressive scan option simply didn't work. When turned on, the picture was split in 1/2 in separate parts of my HDTV, and in black and white only.The menu navigation was cumbersome and really hard to get used to. My suggestion is to go to APEX's home page, and download the manual before you buy this item. If you can easily understand the manual, (and you don't receive a defective unit) then you'll have no problems with this unit.The remote control was strange to say the least. The usual 'enter' button was not near the directional buttons, so when you scroll through the DVD menu or the DVD player menu you have to constantly look for the enter button located among 10 other similar sized buttons. It's a small thing, but it drove me insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!!!","review":"Had this DVD and worked until red lines appeared on led screen.

There are 2 versions out there that I am aware of. The newer version works better than the older one. The beauty of this is that it does a great job converting PAL<->NTSC. While not \\"Region Free\\", it has the complete look, feel,\` and quality of the Malata. In fact, if it wasn't for the Apex label, it seems like it's EXACTLY like the [expensive] Malata. It does the 16:9 correctly in PAL<-> NTSC, and you can adjust the aspect if needed! Great features for the price!There are some issues with the Progressive scan, but overall it does a relatively good job. Heck, I would say that for the price, it does a FANTASTIC job. Also, with some of the newer high-end TV's, some of the deinterlacer's on the TV's are better than the DVD players anyway, so you may not need it in the future!I tried SVCD and VCD, and both worked well for me.Note, I don't use MP3 or photo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw-away dvd player","review":"I bought this player due to reviews in last year's consumer reports.

I would rate this on a par with Faces and Raise as being an album where each track is superbly produced and different from the other tracks. The 2 choruses on Heart to Heart are subtley different from each other and this point exemplifies the musical subtlties that are present across the album. Even after 16 years, I still get a lift from hearing the tracks. Miracles is so powerful, and Maurice's voice consistent and clear. Fall in Love With Me is so simply catchy and the chord changes during the intro are spine tingling.

The tragedies of slavery in the South brought such sadness to me. But the book didn't focus more on that than the romance. It was evenly split. My only problems were these little things:Jolene should not have lied so much.Kurt was a little niave at times.There was also grammar and spelling errors, but this book is from the eighties, what do you expectAll in all, it was a very interesting read and I cannot wait to get more books from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"just as awful as everyone says","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money. This really is as bad and worse than everyone says. I love opera, love some good dance, this is neither. Very sad arias badly sung with then some god awful upbeat tune planted over them??? WHAAA??? Great idea, would be nice for someone to do it properly now.Just read other reviews, it's all true, run away...run FAR away....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it!","review":"Do not buy the CD!

Also, it conspicuously lacks any tracks by Massive Attack or Portishead which is the biggest drawback to this anthology. That said, it's still great listening and will work as anyone starting out on trip hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firm and Fine","review":"LOve these pillows. I purchased the firm and the soft and the combination works very well for me and my hubby. I love the firm and soft combo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, am I glad I bought these...","review":"I got a screaming deal on these pillows, getting them for $16.99ea instead of the $44 they are now.My only regret is not getting two more.These things are so packed that it was a struggle getting them into their King Sized pillowcases. But that's a GOOD thing, right?Sure, they'll pack down. But by starting out this firm and overstuffed, it'll end up in a good place too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with pillows","review":"Very happy with these pillows - nice material and hard enough so when you put your head down it doesn't feel like it hits the mattress. I'm a side sleeper so these work great. Very comfortable and supportive, while still being nice and soft!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Compact","review":"We have had these pillows for about a month and am very satisfied with them. They have not compacted and have the same shape as when we bought them. I would not recommend them for \\"face\\" sleepers as they do not compress very much, but for side and back sleepers they are superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time!","review":"As a previous General Mgr., I have never given anything or anyone a top rating! I have always felt that there needs to be some incentive for individuals or products to be better! In this case, because the previous nine reviewers had given this pillow a 5 star rating I go along this one time! For it's quality, price, and functionality I will give this pillow the top rating for meeting my needs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Walken is spectacular, albeit underutilized in this role. The story is interesting, but a bit drawn in places and rushed in others. The brief shots of Naimh Dolan make you wish they had cast her in the lead female role, and you get the feeling that Jared Harris is doing his best Walken impression throughout the film. Worth seeing but no thrill ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncle Walken we hardly knew ye...","review":"Disappointing because it had potential. Alison Elliot in the lead is a complete stiff and shows virtually no range. Lots of shots of her in the second half of the movie staggering around (as the wife or the witch) looking distraught. There's your drama and it just ain't enough. Jared Harris does a better job as the husband. Tough to get involved though when the married couple they portray comes off as a bit repellant. Walken does his usual thing (which I like) and breaths a bit of life into the midpoint but the story turns to complete mush after he leaves (too soon). As the site review mentions above, the underwater photography is quite pretty. Not intended as a \\"serious\\" horror movie to be sure but Nadja (also an underachieving movie) had the better sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, artistic and pathetic horror","review":"Lots of people like myself were attracted to this movie because of the box cover and the presence of Christopher Walken. If he is in it, it must be good right? Instead we are treated to what starts out as a depressing, confusing drama of two alcoholics and their son on their way to meet Grandma. From there we suddenly end up with the corpse of a druid witch in the basement who isn't dead and wants a soul.While the acting is decent and the sets and scenery intriguing, the plot gets silly and tiresome.Its barely scary and half way through you will start to wonder, \\"where is this film going\\"? At the end you will realize the dvd box cover was more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah","review":"Just couldnt get into the movie, and I enjoy gothic tales. I did like the first song in the movie, but can find out who the band was. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"It was sort of interesting, maybe just because you can look at Alison Elliot during the movie. Christopher Walken is his usual psychotic self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Bad.","review":"Also known as Trance, I picked this one up because I saw a preview for it and the premise looked interesting-- family goes to Ireland to dry out (oh, yeah, like THAT would work) and stay with the crazy uncle (Christopher Walken, the only A-list actor in the film). The crazy uncle has the well-preserved body of a two-thousand-year-old druidess in the basement, and hey! she just happens to look like the wife. (You can see where this is going, I'm sure.) We've seen it a hundred times. And it was done better a hundred times. Perhaps the longest ninety-five minutes I've spent in front of a television so far this year. Avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror,Romance and nice soundtrack.","review":"Released on video in Brazil a month ago,this film mixes horror and romance in a cool way. Walken's character,uncle Bill,gets so fascinated by the female druid mummy and her story through the centuries and falls in love with her in hope she'll suddenly comes back to life to save him from boredom.But her story was so sad although intense that might make you think if it's worthy to leave all plans and purposes behind for a great passion. Yes,there is also blood in some scenes,but I think this a very nice movie and somehow reflective. Walken's performance is as good as ever and the other actors are also alright.The soundtrack is nice,mixing indie guitar and techno bands plus good incidental tunes. Yes,do see this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic sound engineering","review":"It was many months ago that I watched this film on DVD. I wish to add something that no other reviewer has given emphasis to; The film has the most awesome sound track I have ever heard. I have a very good home theater audio set up (of modest cost). The audio track completely surprised me with the dynamic range and eerie sounds. If you think you have a good wide-ranging sound system, you will want to watch this film. The film is okay even if your sound system is lacking. Sound effect 5 stars. Visual imagery 4 stars. Story 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes AWFUL and makes your mouth feel funny.","review":"Ugh, these are awful. They work for your allergies, but the taste is just indescribably disgusting.

It allows him to enjoy his type of music without offending the rest of the family."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot reccomend this book.","review":"So full of innacuracies and the typical revisionist ideals of trashing our heroes and those who fought for our country, that this book is not a good addition to any Alamo or History library.I tossed it after I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist","review":"Some revisionist points need to be made in the interest of the whole truth, but the author is one-sided to a fault. The book is glib, full of sweeping statements, a work of opinion and propaganda, not history.In our time, people are so used to the idea of the U.S. as the great world power that they may have trouble in understanding that in the 1830s, on the world stage, the U.S. was a minor, upstart country with an uncertain future. Mexico, on the other hand, even after its disastrous War of Independence, was perceived as the heir apparent of the fabled wealth of New Spain. Hindsight is made out to be 20-20 vision, but it is not if it prevents one from understanding how things were and how they were perceived at the time. In this way, our knowledge of what was then the future can impede our understanding of the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your High School Texas History Reader","review":"This was one of several books required for my pre-statehood Texas history class at the University of Texas back in the mid '90s. The first day of class, my professor asked, \\"Who here took a Texas history class while in middle school or high school?\\" Most of the students' hands went up. He then asked, \\"Who here referred to your teacher as 'Coach'?\\" Most of the hands stayed up. His point was pretty clear--most of those that promulgate the watered-down, incomplete version of Texas history to most Texans are not well equipped to question its validity. Long's book paints a more complete, well referenced picture of the motives of the rebels and the factors that led to the rebellion. It also provides a satisfactory summary of the international political context in which the rebellion took place. The book is an interesting, easy read, and quite entertaining...so much so, I had to read it again when I stumbled across it in my library just recently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and revisionary only to set the record straight","review":"I read this book after graduating college and the subject has always been of major interest from my childhood. Only ignorant fools who know nothing of the subject or those too lazy to follow up with their own research would criticize this work as inaccurate. Fact is, they were all bigots and self-centered racists...even Santa Anna. I won't even take the time to explain to those who do not have the ability to process simple information. This period in history is just like all others where Europeans, Spanish included, took something they had no right to take, broke treaties, and spun a web to make themselves look like hero's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duel of Eagles","review":"Giving this garbadge one star is being generous.It is silly, and a complete waste of time and money-revisionism at its worst! It dishonors the memory of the great men who fought and died at the Alamo. Just another book by a liberal who hates America"},{"rating":"1","title":"Personal diatribe, not history. Truth is the casualty.","review":"I have read nearly everything written on the Texas War for Independence so was looking forward to this revision with interest. Unfortunately, this \\"history\\" reads like a personal vendetta against anybody and everybody, except a select few Mexican officers who resisted Santa Anna, but carried out his orders nonetheless. Its simply awful, with sweeping generalities and twisted conclusions while taking as gospel some accounts while completely ignoring others that counter them. Long appears to have had two goals in writing this revision - skewer any and all Americans involved, and most of the Mexicans...and selling books. He is neither a scholar nor a serious historian. Historians don't have personal agendas. Avoid this book - it adds exactly nothing (except opinion) to the discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and not worth the money","review":"The first half of the book has some useful information. It gives the schematics and even PCB tracing patterns for a couple of decent devices, one of which is a very simple (and thus small) crystal controlled voice transmitter. In my opinion these 10 pages or so of useful info are not worth the price of the book. There is better stuff out there. The second half of the book contains some very outdated info on things like analog 800MHz cell phone interception and listening to the old style 46Mhz and 900 Mhz analog cordless phones. He also wastes a great deal of space on a dtmf tone decoder, which are not very expensive or difficult to find anyway. All in all a poor excuse for this kind of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compensating for Erroneous Review","review":"Saw the other review (not a real bad one) that said the book needs updating. In Sheldon's defense, I'd like to state that the book references his web site, which does, in fact, have updates. Mr. Charrett appears to have taken great pains to keep the text updtated and I strongly advise the other reviewer to consider this fact. His support sites are: phreak.co.uk/sxc and jillett.com/sxc. He has corrections listed there as well.Circuits I've tried work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went from good to goofy","review":"The movie started out pretty good and then towards the end it just got silly and farfetched to the point where we were laughing. The quality of acting also went the same way, started really good and then was a little less believable as time went on...maybe the actors even knew what they were acting out was silly material at that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"AND THE OPERATOR SAYS 40 CENTS MORE FOR THE NEXT THREE MINUTES...","review":"Maria Bello stars as Lorraine, a divorced mother who has trouble coping with life. She is unable to take charge of her life and blames herself for every misfortune that comes her way. While spending her last dollar at a convenience store on pizza bagels for her and her son, she gets carjacked by Roy, (Stephen Dorff) a somewhat understanding, yet terrifying bank robber who gets along great with her son Chad, who BTW needs a father figure. The movie takes you to a point where it can go a number of different ways and downhill would not have been my first choice, but that is how it went.Good acting, although Mario Bello becomes less convincing as the plot turns unrealistic.F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"some authentic people and cars some artsy types","review":"I actually enjoyed the bulk of this film, very reminiscent of the way cars got done in the old dayslike the comment \\" i don't have $10000. for a paint job and niether did they back then\\". The black and white footage looks like it could've been shot in the 50s, Ian Rousell, more of an artist than a car guy was entertaining to watch as he goes thru the motions of creating a car not good on the tech details, the boatwindshield he cut down was actually a modern day aftermarket piece, he said I'm building a model A whenit is actually a 26 27 Ford roadster pickup body. The other cars owned and built by regular car guys,building them over years in some cases. The shop teacher ,Lyle Wishart, was over the top, I wish I hada shop teacher like that when in school, he pushes his students to be creative,proactive and they seemto have a good time !! this dvd is inexpensive, entertaining and informative.Dave"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh!","review":"Not that great other than seeing Scratch pinstripe. Ian is a different character in an artsy way and does not seem to build with practical knowledge. If we built stuff like he did and had it inspected for legal street use we would be denied the ability to drive it on public roads.

It's a great bonding session and I get to see what they think of the parenting decisions made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design!","review":"If this was just designed a bit better it would be great. It heats quick and leaves hair smooth. I have long hair, so I need to hold the end while curling my hair. When I first started to use this curling iron, I burned my fingers numerous times. The end is way to short, plus it is rounded and not easy to hold on to. Another problem is where the control to turn on/off is located. The switch is located right where your pinky goes, and I usually end up turning it off once, during each use. This is frustrating when you don't realize you have done this, and the iron cools. Lastly, the hinge catches your hair and pulls it out. I would not recommend this item until they change the design, and I will make sure next time I purchase a curling iron, that I look more closely at the design, and read some reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This is a great curling iron. It heats up well, allows you to set different heat settings, and holds the curl for a long time - which is something I have a really hard time getting my hair to do. My only complaint is that the section at the end of the iron is really small and I burn my fingers a lot when trying to hold on to both ends. Also, the clasp doesn't hold the hair very well so it sometimes takes a couple of tries to get my hair to stay in it, but once I do, then it works well. This iron is well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"This curling iron is terrible, which is a shame because all the reviews are generally positive. It burns my hair and doesn't curl AT ALL. I've tried the different heat settings, smaller and bigger chunks of hair and leaving it in for awhile - it just does not work. I have straight fine hair and I have never experienced this problem with any curling iron in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY this curling iron!","review":"I bought this curling iron, allured by the claim of the tourmaline technology being better for my hair. I have used multiple curling irons and curlers throughout the years, but have never had the horrible experience I've had with this one. It is apparently WAY too hot, even on the lowest setting. In one week of use, my hair has gone to it's worst shape ever. I have lost patches of hair, and every time I use this iron, my hair feels \\"crunchy.\\" I am never using it again, while I still have some hair left on my head, and will be looking for another one ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"Heats up quickly and curls my fine, straight, hard to curl hair.

Not to mention cheap!!! it works as good as my old expensive one. Great gift idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"This curling iron does heat up quickly and curls hair well without snagging hair as some other brands do. However, the tip is so small and gets so hot that it's nearly impossible to hold onto. I burned my fingers badly thinking that I could hold onto the entire plastic end as you can with all other curling irons. However, only the very tip is cool enough to touch, which doesn't have enough surface area to hold onto.This curling iron has a very poor design. It doesn't matter how it curls your hair if you can't even hold onto the curling iron itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"curling iron","review":"This curling iron is difficult to use for long hair. The tip is difficult to control while curling and gets very hot. It is small and so you often touch the iron.

The iron shuts off everytime I pick it up and put it to my hair. POOR DESIGN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I have repeatedly burned my index finger with this curling iron. The black plastic end of the curling iron has a little safety rest so that the curling iron doesn't burn surface it is heated up on. However, the rest doesn't go all the around the circumfrance of the black plastic end of the curling iron so it is really easy to initially rest your index finger on the safety rest and when you go to turn the curling iron in an attempt to wind your hair around the barrel, your finger automatically moves from the safety rest to the PIPING HOT IRON!. I actually blistered my index finger the third time I used this curling iron! Choose a safer curling iron or suffer the burns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Use, Always Turns Off","review":"This curling iron is such a hassle because the on/off switch as well as the temperature setting buttons are on the handle, and every time I roll my hair I end up turning the curling iron off.

Very frustrating!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw & Frustrating to use","review":"This iron drives me crazy. It heats up rather quickly and has three heat settings but those are the only positive aspects I can think of. It is nearly impossible to use this device without turning it off during styling. The on/ off switch is super sensitive and placed right where your hand needs to go in order to hold the iron safely. Besides the poor design, the iron is not that effective as a styling tool.

Definitely returning this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Buy","review":"There are more cons than pros with this curling iron.CONS* The tip of the curling iron is rounded, so that it is nearly impossible to get a grip on it while curing your hair.* Because of the badly designed tip, I have burnt myself three times, while only using it twice.* While in use, it will turn off because the on/off button is exactly where most women would place their fingers while curling their hair.* It is awkward to hold and manipulate because of its shape.PROS* If you don't mind a burnt scalp and fingers, and the fact that it will turn off several times as you bump the on/off switch while curling your hair, it will produce good curls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy to turn off accidentally","review":"This curling iron is being returned. The number one reason is that the on/off switch's design and placement is awful. I turned it off several times without noticing right away. Another thing I didn't like is that there's no indicator for when it has reached the temperature. Also, the \\"cool tip\\" still gets a bit hot. And last but certainly not least, the CURLS DID NOT LAST!!

I also wanted the 1 1/2 barrel.My hair is very malleable, and I usually always get good curls that last the whole day. However, right after I curl my hair with this iron, the curls go away within 15-20 minutes, it's really bizarre. I don't use any styling products, and I usually don't need to to keep the curl.

Should I return it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Curling Iron?","review":"I tried this curling iron the same day I got it. I was so disappointed that it did not work for me. I was expecting it to at least give me big waves...my hair comes out straight with a curl at the end. What the?

I would literally just have my hair in it for 2-3 seconds because any longer I felt was horrible for my hair. When I released my hair from the curling iron my hair felt like it was sizzling to the touch. When I used this for about a month, I realized my hair was getting so damaged. My hair felt like straw and I have never had that problem with another curling iron. Yes, it works well, doesn't snag hair, leaves hair smooth...but damages the heck out of it!

It was a good deal at $16."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design","review":"You can't get your hand near the tip without burning it and in the meantime your other hand keeps turning it off because of the control placement. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"Although this iron does heat up very quickly and does grip your hair very well, there are issues. The cool tip is far too short (or far too heat-conductive), and thus heats up...which means sore, burned fingers. The clamping power of the iron is great -- hair doesn't slip out, even to thin ends -- BUT the price you will pay for that is weird, straight crimp lines every couple of inches in the curl. It's just TOO tight. Also, the on-off button is badly placed, and I have to watch constantly because it's very easy to accidentally turn it off. A beep would be nice -- other irons have a beep feature for on/off; with a design this poor, a beep should have been included. Also, when it turns off, you have to adjust the heat back up to the temperature you want, so it's a two to four step process every time you accidentally shut it off.I give it two stars only because of how fast it heats up and how smooth the surface of the barrel is. Otherwise I'd rate it a one star for the mid-curl crimps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is one of the worst curling irons I have ever bought.

This curling iron is going back tomorrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Button drives me crazy","review":"I am actually on Amazon right now looking for a replacement because I cannot stand the stupid button getting turned off constantly and having to turn it back on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"I would have given it a zero star if I could.- The unit keeps turnig off or changes the set temperature. The on/off and temperature buttons are so sensitive that with just a light touch the unit either turns off or changes the setting. Because of the locaion of the switches on the handle, it's impossible to avoid touching them. I accidentally turned off the power every time I curled a section of hair.- The end tip is too hot to hold. You could burn you fingers!I'm returning mine. I can't find a bettter way to hold this iron properly without turning off the unit and burning my fingers at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conair ceramic curling iron","review":"I am disappointed with this curling iron.

You must upgrade the subwoofer. The bass is weak, however, there is no sub output. Also, the speakers come with wires that have male to female connections that are color coded. What a pain in the a** it was to have to splice each and every connector in order to utilize my monster cable. The wireless rear channel is very sweet though and everything else is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony DAV-FX900W","review":"The installation process was fairly easy. The programming was a little more complex. There is a downside to this system in that there are several different ways to wire from the DVD player to the TV and so far I cannot find a solution that allows the TV sound to be ran through the unit. The only thing left to try is the digital optical cable. If that does not work, I will be very disappointed. The system however, performs admirably with the DVD's and that is enough to warrant keeping this system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good system","review":"This is a very good system for the money. The sound is great, but you have to make sure there is nothing in between the IR sensor on the speaker and the IR from the system. Also, the DVD player is slow to read the DVD after you load it and the same when you change from TV to DVD. If you can handle the wait, you'll love this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok starter system","review":"This is a great system out of the box and for those new to surround systems, but not for the advanced listener. This system is easy to install. That is all I can say about it. The listening effects are maddening. You are unable to control the treble or bass yourself and will have to rely on preset Sony programs and you will be left wanting more if you have more than a small living space. The sound strength is very weak, and yes, as previous posts stated, update the base as this system has none. More, the absolute worst part of this system is not only they length it takes to read a disk; you will have no idea if it you have selected a cd or dvd until it has finished reading the disk. Not worth my time. This is a great system for those who can not hook up a wired system; but for all others, save your money for something more meatier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon.com who?","review":"Do not purchase anything through Amazon.com that it is not being sold directly by them.

SONY is in bed with the distributors and blocks your playing the DVD. This s not a legal block; it's just SONY in collusion with the film folks to diminish the value of your film collection. So be aware.This is the same as SONY's decision to no longer support Cablecards in its TVs. This is so the cable companies can overcharge you for the scramble box which gives them much of their profit. The government mandated cablecards for the cable companies so the cable companies do support them but then the cable companies got collusive manufacturers like SONY to help the cable companies defeat what they couldn't defeat themselves.You will be better to work with a more customer friendly company. SONY is not a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony DAVFX-900W Rcommended System","review":"PROS: Excellent System appearance wise. Sound Ratings on a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 10. Lives up to the Sony name by delivering excellent sound, and the features that go with it.CONS: Hookup can be somewhat confusing and instructions for hookup could be structured better. Explanations for proper hookup does not go into enough detail for using correct cables, and/or which setup should be used. Hookup for AM and FM radio very cheaply made which causes pause for the Sony name, by not being what is expected by the Sony brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surround sound system","review":"Very good sound. Wireless rear speakers work fine (There is a wire running between the two rear speakers though) One thing I don't like is that I don't get good sound off of broadcast T.V.

I get better broadcast T.V. sound out of my $200.00 RCA unit.Some reviewers have complained about the music quality sound when playing CD's. Maybe I'm just tone deaf but it sounds great to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a great system. So easy and versatile to use. Set-up was very easy as long as you read the instructions. I love the fact that the rear speakers are wireless (You would never know they are). You don't even have to use the stands for the speakers. I have them mounted to the wall and they look like they had always been there. My wife hates the fact that it takes a little longer to switch disks around. It is well worth it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good surround sound system","review":"I like this system, the sounds are very clear and clean.

The production quality was not good either. It gave the impression of having been made in someone's garage. Worst of all though was the continual reference to some information about the Sphinx that would be given at the end of the lecture and that was missing in its entirety.

Along the fairy tale line we have the overriding symbol of the Fountain of Youth (in this case, the Indoor Swimming Pool of Youth) which is supposed to indicate, roughly, a Be-Careful-You-May-Get-What-You-Wish-For moral. The movie is annoying, redeemed only by the charm of the old campaigners in the cast. It's not the fairy tale aspect that irritates so much as the cloying sentimentality that the tale is cocooned in. Director Ron Howard seems obviously influenced by his (apparent) idol, Steven Spielberg, that other great . . . \\"populist entertainer\\". (I was going to use another phrase.) Howard, Spielberg -- what's the difference? Same basic outlook; same basic movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"This boring movie chewed up two hours of my life!","review":"I hate this movie so much the thought of it makes me want to cry.

The book contains many exciting accounts of Degelow's air combat experiances and would make a great read for any aviation or military history enthusiast.The fact that Degelow is one of the many aces who never get much attention from historians makes the info in this book even more interesting.This book also contains many excellent photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-Provoking","review":"I really like this movie. The actors are top-notch and the subject matter is deep and frightening. It brings to the forefront what many, including those in the LGBT community, are afraid to REALLY discuss. It's worth owning and gifting. My ONLY negative comment is the actors playing the gay characters don't seem completely comfortable playing a couple. Their interactions were awkward and stiff. I also noticed the straight couples kissed, but these two would 'hug' to express their intimacy. It stood out to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The twilight of the Golds - Well worth a look !!","review":"Enjoyed the movie a lot, I felt that it is a realistic depiction of a gay relationship in the 21st century.

Liberals are to politcally correct, they can not handle the truth. I mean the truth about the racesWhen Adam admits how certain races are mentelly inferior, you know its true but you cant have the courage to say so. You know its true but you are afraid to say so. When Adam jokes about the holacost, you know its good but you have to pretend that you care about apeerances. you know that its really a good thing after all (you know who runs the government, and Adam does to.)Thats why Adam is a hero because he says the truth about the races that noone else has the guts to say. Adam you rule and stay on the air even if those liberals and races try to kick you off. Your race politics are to importent and need to be voiced. Superior people like us have to prevale.

Perhaps it is a harmless schoolgirl crush, but it could be something far more insideous, after all Dr. Drew is hardly a schoolgirl. The observations in the book are obvious and Dr. Drew smartly lets Adam provide the serious medical advise. Still I am glad I have the book as it is rather funny and very useful as I read it to telemarketers when they call."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploiting the Abused for Cheap Laughs","review":"It's because of fans like Mr. Ciccolini (below) that I've grown to despise Loveline. The show's crypto-racist hosts continually pander to the white adolescent moronic bigots who make up most of its audience, inviting severely damaged people to call in for medical advice, only to hold them up as objects of contempt for the amusement of their listeners. The advice these two arrogant creeps pretend to offer to their pitiful callers is usually trite, banal, and sometimes dangerously wrong. Any \\"help\\" Pinsky and Carolla do manage to give is far outweighed by their cruel treatment of teens who have already suffered plenty of abuse in their lives and are now made into national laughingstocks. (...) Loveline long ago ceased to be a public service offering useful advice and has now become another sad symptom of our sick, cruel, exploitative popular culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BOOK IS VERY GOOD!","review":"Once i started reading the first page of the book i just couldn't let it go!

It's entertaining. Sure, diagnosing anonymous callers in under two minutes is unethical and irresponsible, but it sure makes for a great listen. Anyway, I bought (and, sadly, read) this book because I was expecting a little deeper exploration of some of Drew's no-nonsense MDology and Adam's intoxicant fueled philosophies. I got none of that. What I got was a book that could've been assembled in a few hours. Brief rants from high atop the soapy box about how any woman who doesn't part her hair just so has been raped and raised by alcoholics, etc. and Adam isn't actually very funny. He has good timing, but a lot of what he says is just retarded. His jokes don't work on the page. Clearly Adam is looking for a father figure and wants Drew to embrace him and love him, which is why he gets so mad at callers...he just wants the attention focused on him, and his alcoholica.

It is the biggest waste of time. Adam doesn't know what he's talking about. He's a big dumb oaf. Do you really want to hear what a big dumb oaf has to say? He's like that boyfriend/girlfriend you had who was too afraid to love anyone. (mainly, because he/she couldn't love themselves)Amazon has thousands of great books to buy. This book, however, is not one of them. Don't jump on the bandwagon. Your problems are too important to have these guys pick them apart. They don't even know you. And they don't care. There are many people who are willing to help you. They enjoy helping others. These people are not not them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be standard high-school text","review":"This is the book that we all wish we'd had in high school.

I'm a recent fan of the Loveline show and wanted to get some more in-depth coverage of issues that Drew only touches on during the show. Sadly, neither this book nor Cracked provides that. I'd go so far as to say that we actually get less here than on their radio show. There's no excuse for this because while Loveline is free, these books cost good money, so readers expect a little more in return. I think it's depressing that a healer and good samaritan like Dr. Drew would produce crap like this book and the equally empty Cracked, in an attempt to rip off his devoted, trusting fans. I would like to return both these books to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I found this book to be amazing, because Dr. Drew and Adam know how to be honest. It's nice to read a book that isn't politically correct for a change.

We have those ominous scenes which tell of a thrilling adventure to come...but it all subsides in a whimper. Gary Russell's problem as a writer in this story is that he is too self-indulgent, having so much fun with old ideas and concepts that he forgets to pace the plot nicely. The end, which could never be called a climax, is particularly dissatisfying. When a book draws upon a TV show as heavily as this does and dabbles too much in homage, it can never hope to succeed as gripping fiction. But the humour gives the story its moments and Sam's recovery from her crush on the Doctor is a refreshing change. And Russell does deliver some nice moral arguments which, if emphasised over the schlocky plot, would have made the book a much better work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Doctor Who book!

The customer service lady said, \\"Since it is a new product, they don't have parts ready yet. It will be ready at the end of Feburuary.\\" We need to wait to clean our blender for half a year? At this point, I guess we have no other choice. We hope it won't break again if we could get the part in March.

He delves into the psychological state of Selby's characters, common themes that run through all the works, allusions to influential literature, and Selby's evolution as a writer and person. His treatments ofLast Exit to Brooklyn (Bloomsbury Classic Reads)andRequiem for a Dream: A Novelare especially illuminating.Giles' observations are clearly expressed and most importantly, he isn't trying to convince you of HIS profundity, which is so common of authors writing this sort of thing. He's focused on the texts and explaining what they mean and how the various elements of the story relate to Selby's overall vision.My one complaint with Giles' work is that it's short. It's 164 very small pages that you will get through in 1 or 2 reading sessions. That said, the analysis will likely make you re-read Selby's works and deepen your experience of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's STILL Singing?!","review":"Sheesh, this hack is still singing.

I like the tanto blade but it required a little more sharpening right out of the box to get it shaving sharp. The black finish is also nice and so far its holding up. After sharpening the blade I took it out in the woods and batoned some wood. It performed well although I have other knives for batoning I wanted to test the black finish which held up nicely. Over all good quality for the price. Nice rubber grips and a slim profile and a decent sheath."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best thing about it is the price.","review":"As other people have noted, the sheath is worthless. It doesn't even seem to be made specifically for this knife. I'll be making a more durable one from card stock, duct tape, and truck bedliner spray. As for the knife, well, it's ok, but still only a three-star rating for it. I don't have big ape paws, but the handle on it is still too small. In a fencing-style grip, the pommel stud digs into the heel of my palm. The design of the blade shape leaves a full inch of blade from the hilt unsharpened, so it's effectively a 3.75\\" blade with a bit of extension, especially if you like to grip it with your thumb on top of the blade. A much better choice for only around $30 is theCold Steel Kobun Black Kraton Handle. You'll get a much better knife with a more usable blade and handle, and a sheath that the knife won't pierce when you insert it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smith and Wesson Tanto boot knife","review":"I expected it to be bigger but the quality is good.

I cut a rope like butter with it, two soft swipes and clean cut, no rips or anything.Showed it to my grandpa and said I paid $16 for it and before we even cut anything with it he asked me to buy him one lol. That was cool. The blade has small dings I can see with my naked eye from wear and tear but it is still razor sharp. I love it. I own a Kershaw Turbulence folder pocket knife and a $120 buck knife and I still love how sharp this $16 knife is.If I had one good reason to recommend it: it's razor sharp and has a quality leather shealth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!","review":"With the Smith & Wesson name attached, I somehow expected something... more. It does have a thick heavy blade, but it has a second rate cheesy appearance. The edge looks like it was set with the coarse stone on a bench grinder.

Hats off, hats off indeed.Having been in love with their music for 25 years now, seeing this -- my 1st time to EVER see Kate and Anna on film -- was a joy. There is simply nobody else out there quite like them, and the heart-wrenchingly gorgeous sounds they are capable of. For lovers of music, as opposed to the latest flavor of icecream that comes and goes, I could not endorse this more than I do.

This album is the high point of his career so far, in terms of quality and sound. His voice is flawless and the song choices are perfect. If you're looking for an album to put on for a romantic evening, or just to relax on your own and drift off to sleep with some Sinatra-styled lullabies, this is the one.

My husband saturated the carpet, I mean saturated. He even treaded in the areas in tennis shoes so as to get down into the pad. The product sqooshed and foamed up. Guess what...2-3 days later the stench returned. However, it now smells like a metallic/piss smell. We also tried What Odor? Didn't work.

Before spraying this product I cleaned the problem areas with Clorox disinfectant and used a damp cloth to let it dry for an hour. I sprayed lots of anti icky poo on the tile floor, frame doors and all the specific problem areas then went over again with a dry cloth so the areas were not soaking wet and let it dry.

When I read the reviews here I was so excited that I might be able to save the carpet and furnish the room for guests staying over the holidays. I soaked the area with the product as directed and waited until it dried but it didn't get rid of the odor. I expected that the high price of this stuff must mean it would work. What a disappointment! Also, I don't see any guarantee offered by the manufacturer of this product. Maybe it works on other odors, but not cat pee. I had to remove the carpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got cat urine out of wall to wall carpet!","review":"I scrubbed and tried everything to get out cat urine from a new wall to wall carpet in our playroom.

I had tried using Nature's Miracle with moderate success. My cat decided the new sofa was her litter box, and got to the cushions 3 or 4 times. After the sofa cushions dried, I was amazed to find that they do not smell of cat urine - even with a nose up close! I also used the cushion injector, which I was very pleased with. I should mention that this time with Icky-Poo (and not the Nature's Miracle) I rented an upholstery cleaner from Home Depot, and I think that also made a huge difference. It seems to keep the cats away as well - they don't like the smell. It is not medicinal or off-putting to \\"humans\\" and really smells pretty clean and fresh. Certainly worth a try if your feline is being uncooperative."},{"rating":"2","title":"the only stuff that worked on leather couch","review":"We accidentally left out cat in the home theater.

The Feliway, which I bought (as recommended on this site and others) to keep the cat away from the spot, said that cats will be drawn by commercial carpet cleaners, so which is it? I tried saturating the spot with the cleaner and then blotting. The cat came back and peed on the spot that I had cleaned. I tried cleaning it and simultaneously spraying the Feliway.

The tegaderm covering gives somewhat when he tries to pick at it so it discourages him from continuing that habit. It has worked very, very well, and the price was a godsend compared to what we would have had to pay at a medical store.

Two lovers running from the law on the highway, murdering human obstacles. And the awards it won (Australian movie of the Year, etc.)may lead you to believe that this is a movie not to be missed. But don't be fooled. It's a barely competent thriller, with only a minimal level of suspense and a threadbare storyline. The film bogs down completely halfway through, and the ending is unsatisfying.

The live accapella was perfect and the harmony was amazing! The recording still brings me to tears! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reaches the Spiritual Core","review":"Corsican polyphony has a unique place in world music. There are similarly constructed, but far less profound pieces from neighboring Sardinia. But the only music I can think of as having the same rapt, exalted spirit is the l2th Cent. organum of Leoninus and Perotinus.There are recordings of larger forces, but the most moving and resonant examples of the genre have have been small groups like this one. Four or five men (or women in a few instances) face each other so as to fully absorb the timbre and emotional intensity of their companions, and will each other to join in an exquisite blend.Until now, the preeminent ensemble has been A Filetta, which garnered international attention and made several recordings that I implore you to acquire. Now at the top there's also Barbara Furtuna, with a slightly different sound and approach, but the same exactly-on-target way of making music that reaches the spiritual core."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"Yes, I thought that book would be a good help for my work as an administrator, and it ended up being a big disappointment. I have read a lot of computer books in the last three years as I passed my MCSE exams, and this is the most poorly written I have come across. There is no linear thinking about how things work, you often have to guess what the author is talking about, which makes reading at time confusing. It's always a sign to me when I have to read a paragraph three times to understand what the author really means, and then realize it wasn't that complicated, but was only written in a clumsy way.

The blender is fantastic, you can take it off the base and even remove the lid. We now have it sitting next to the big dollhouse as the main kitchen, and you will really love it, it is sooooo cute!

I loved the series, but of course, there were captions through the tv. There are many people who rely on captions when they watch DVDs. Older viewers whose hearing is not what it used to be and viewers whose second language is English are particularly helped by close-captioning and/or subtitles. In fact, many people learn English quicker by watching films with subtitles. Considering how many movies have captions, it can't be very difficult to offer them. I bought the first season and was disappointed that captions were not included. I was about to purchase the complete season, hoping that there would be captions for the final boxed set, but since I don't see captions mentioned in the properties, I guess I'll save my $70.00. Maybe I can spend it on \\"The Borgias\\" if that studio has the courtesy of supplying subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Accurate, But Fun","review":"Of course, this series wasn't historically accurate all of the time, but I loved the characters and the costumes and took it for what it was. The later seasons especially seemed to have spent half their budget on the clothes and jewelry and I adored it.The first season was my least favorite, but then the story picked up and I enjoyed the rest and didn't want to see it end. My feelings swung back and forth between hating and admiring Henry, between disliking and feeling sorry for some of his doomed wives (especially the flamboyant Anne B.), and I found it very emotionally engaging overall. If you get involved with the characters like I did, you will forgive much on other aspects. If history is your thing, then not so much.Overall, costume drama buffs...go for it!

There was no sound on the last half of one of the DVDs.Amazon graciously refunded my money upon return of the defective set and I purchased a replacement set. The first DVD of the final season just stopped about 20 minutes in and would not go past that point, in repeated tries and several players.We since found out my brother in law bought one of the same sets at a box store in Miami and also had a bad DVD in the set.As great as the Tudors mini-series is, don't waste your time with a company who can't use proper quality DVDs or equipment.

So much so, that if you have aging, well-read parents who enjoy history, but are a bit conservative in their tastes, I must advise against watching this show with them.We were visiting my parents for a weekend and brought along a disk to watch in the evening. Well, rather than going to bed early as I expected, they asked what we were watching, and joined in after we told them it was about Henry VIII. I thought we were in the clear until the very last scenes of the episode, when Henry fantasizes about doing the deed with Anne Boleyn in the woods. Nothing quite like the awkwardness of watching softcore porn with your parents. Be advised!"},{"rating":"1","title":"crud","review":"I don't understand: if they were going to get so far off \\"history,\\" by stressing the lurid aspects of this story, if they were going to fudge so much . . . why didn't they just bring in some fantasy writers to change the names up to be a bunch of fictional kings and battles, kind of like \\"Game of Thrones\\"?How much work would that have been?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tudors-love Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Henry Cavill","review":"I loved the series!

Annoyingly historically inaccurate in places (for example, Cardinal Wolsey did not commit suicide while confined to the Tower, but actually died of illness in a monastery just prior to being arrested...always a master of timing). Nonetheless presents a compelling overview of the passions and politics of the era. Touches upon the terror his daughters must have experienced as they were in and out of favor, promised in marriage to various and sundry suitors, then had promises reneged. Beautifully staged and costumed with a magnificent cast of actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"A very good, often very compelling series. I genuinely enjoyed and appreciated the care the show's creators obviously have for creating the feel of the times. Religious and sexual corruption go hand in hand to create the characters lives. Some liberties are taken with the historical content of course, but not much, and usually only when needed for dramatic emphasis. All and all it was really fun.

Any fan of painter Romaine Brooks will be interested to find she plays a role here. In fact, many of her portrait sitters also have walk-on roles in Winaretta's life.Anecdotes abound, if you like program-note tidbits.

It has potential, but is hampered by a low budget and awkward dialogue. Neil Patrick Harris and Matthew Lillard make good adversaries, but the script simply isn't up to snuff. The events that conspire aren't very shocking or surprising; nor is the overly conventional ending. Some of the psychology between characters is interesting, but other than that this is a lost cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Room","review":"This movie could have been better, if they'd only have focused on every aspect of the Matthew Lillard's character. The audience is fed too many useless visuals. The dialogue is very weak and at times awkward.Through all of it, Matthew Lillard still manages to pull off a brilliant performance. The other actors outside of his clique seem confused, static and incomplete. They should have just shaved it down to one aspect, the one aspect people were interested in. Neil Patrick Harris' character was not one that most people are interested in. However it has beautiful cinematography, that just doesn't make up for the weak plot.

Taki is glamour without the glitz, wealth combined with anonymity, privilege and comfort without meterosexual softness, and manliness without burlesque or misogyny.Taki's tales are a world most mortals never see, so it is a joy to read. What is amazing is the reality of the circles he moves in, rather than the fantasies spun by the likes of Judith Krantz, Town & Country, or the Robb Report.An unapologetic elitist gentleman, ever giving communists and the spineless a fair punch in their clownish noses.

This in fact has an excellent handle design that opens the spout when you pick it up and makes it easy to fill the kettle with water thru the spout. However, the kettle doesn't always whistle and when it did, it sounded like a loud screeching horn and sputtered water from the spout and the lid when it boiled. I also found the kettle a bit on the large size (though most these days seem to be) for my personal use. Rather I have returned this for the Oxo Downpour tea kettle which I found somewhat better - a nice, consistant whistle though it also sputters a little bit of water from the spout and a slightly smaller size to my liking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Copco Teakettle","review":"A teakettle is a fairly basic product, but there are a wide range of designs available, some better than others. This one has a basically intelligent design, but has a slight flaw. The positives: it is well made, feels solid, has a good grip on the handle, and has an innovative stopper mechanism. When the kettle is lifted, the articulated handle lifts the stopper for pouring. When the kettle is set down, the reverse happens and the stopper closes. So far, so good. The only problem is that when the water is boiling, steam rises, blows out through the whistle on the stopper and condenses on the outside of the stopper. If the kettle is lifted quickly, drops of hot water can spatter and hit the lifting hand. It's not a serious problem, but one has to be careful. Other than that we are satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't whistle","review":"You have to slam the handle down to make sure it whistles, and even then can barely be heard outside the room. The only way to make the whistle loud is to push down on the handle. Half the time it never whistled, worked better if you only put very little water in, but why buy a 2.5 quart when you can only make 2 cups at a time? Disappointed since the concept seems great, but a non whistling kettle is worse than useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice design","review":"This is a lovely kettle with a nice design. The main problem with the kettle is if you use unfiltered tap water, the boiled water tastes like metal. You can't make tea without using filtered water.

However maybe there was a reason this set V.2 was soft-pedaled. Many episodes are quite inferior to previous seasons. Several are almost agonizing to watch such as the Angry Astronaut, Tarnished Trademark, Melancholy Marksman and Counterfeit Crank. In some respects the preparatory story and characterizations (to the murder) are more elaborate than before but they end up getting in the way of the courtroom drama. In the Angry Astronaut episode for the first time I was more baffled than Hamilton Burger as Perry goes through a preposterous courtroom exercise. The actors including the judge looking on couldn't hide their own perplexity at what they were watching. I sure hope this is not indicative of season six and beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will always love PERRY but...","review":"I should have listened to the reviews about the downfall beginning in Season 5.

I probably will keep collecting until I have the full run, and likewise probably keep yelling at the tv \\"Who are you and why are you talking for Perry!?!?\\" when this \\"slow\\" actor has a line.

For those who put down all black and white television, the quality of these videos shows you the nuances that are not quite captured with the distraction of color. Seeing these episodes fully restored is worth the price. If you only ever watched Perry in syndication, you'll be surprised at how much you missed for those extra commercial breaks. One hour network shows are now 42 or so minutes in length- these programs are closer to FIFTY two minutes. The great exterior shots of LA and the cars are a veritable time capsule of the 50's and early 60's. My only complaint is the same as every other reviewers: it's taking SOOOO long to get these out!

Filmed at a time when political incorrectness was unheard of, smoking was savoured and not considered a dirty habit, the preparation, consumation and thorough enjoyment of food uninhibited, the actors diction is clearly audible and without the use of (now)common day expletives used as adjectives.Original. Subsequent food films are but a drop of sizzling butter to burn away into browness.Unfortunately the world has lost a great actor in Robert Morley but Jacqueline Bisset, George Segal and Nigel Havers are still kicking about.The movie is as good now as when I first saw it in my late teens although now I can also appreciate better its particular nuances.Thank you Amazon for having the film in stock.

The maps are barely small ink line drawings that have no detail at all. The information in the descriptions contains a lot of words but not much useful information about habits, habitats or unique charicteristics that would differentiate between similar appearing species.

It is about a boy and a girl that run away from their families. They tell everybody that they are brother and sister and that their names are Bill and Julie Vernon-Greene. This book is unique because it takes place a long time ago. It takes place during the 1940's in London during WWII. This book is written in the form of a novel.

They had both ran away from their families and went to London. This had taking place in London during the 1940s while London had been being bombed and there had been toppling buildings, air-raid wardens, and rescue squads. It was an ok book, but it wasn't interesting enough. I didn't think it was that great because it didn't have enough action going on and the ending just left me hanging and I didn't like that. Another thing that I didn't like was that there wasn't really a problem and the little problem they did have wasn't solved totally, so it confused me in the end.

I think you should read this book if you are kind of bored and have nothing else to do. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read books from old times. To me it was not a good book.

He not only puts forward many of the more radical modernist theories, he basicly puts his stamp of approval on most of them. For example, that Paul didn't write the Pastoral epistles, and many of his other epistles like Colossians, Ephesians and others are also doubtful. That John didn't write all the books in his name. That neither did Peter write 2 Peter, or James write James, perhaps Jude either.Furthermore, that the bible does by no means present a coherent consistant theology. Rather every book has a somewhat different theology that can't be reconciled. Rather we have to prioritise the more important ones. Furthermore, we need to read the gnostic writings to really get as close as possible to what Jesus actually taught.I suppose if you want to know what the modernists are thinking, this gives some insight, but is this the Christian point of view?"},{"rating":"2","title":"real world code","review":"This book allows one to quickly go from a Swing amateur to a very competent Swing programmer.

While they generally don't detract from understanding the topic at hand, they are annoying.While this is not a rank beginner book, I do believe it could be useful for someone who has gone through all of the Swing trails in the Java tutorial and written some basic GUI stuff. Before I got this book, the Java tutorial and the Javadoc was all I knew about Swing and I found this book quite digestible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this book for?","review":"It looks this Book's attempt to teach Swing is failed because of:1) Book plagued with API reprints - always a sign of a weak java book2) Lack of practical techniques - sorry, but pasting chunks of code does not substitutes putting practical programming methods in organized orderSmall Example - in jtree chapter no methods given for tree traversing (only brief info that such a thing exists). Such important topic as search in a tree is totally missing.3) Book is too complex and disorganized for a beginner and missing practical tidbits for the solid swing user.

Krugman as always warns peoplenot to be intellectually lazy. Intellectual laziness can lead one tofall into the conventional wisdom trap. One must be wary of conventional wisdom as it is often wrong. The author explains very well what free trade is about for a country. It is certainly not a zero-sum game. A country always gains from free trade. However there are some redistributional effects. The country may gain as a whole but certain industries lose. The main lesson from the book is that a country's economic well-being is mostly determined by domestic policies. That is especially true for big economies like the US where trade (exports) represents about 10 to 12 % of gross domestic product (GDP). END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Thinking, Compact, and Ruthlessly Correct","review":"I am an economics professor, and find this book an absolutely fantastic antidote to the alarmist crap (and dogmatic resistance to inconvenient facts) offered by foes of international trade. This book is easy to read and digest, and the data and ideas Krugman presents so clearly do not require any economic education beyond the ordinary undergraduate level. I hearitly recommend the book to anyone dazzled by fears of China or threats to U.S. manufacturing.Easily the most entertaining part of this book is Krugman's treatment of Lester Thurow, Paul Kennedy and others who spent the 1990's extending wooly headed thinking to its local maximum. Modern writing on economics is awash in charlatans and cranks, and Krugman dispenses with them in a way to set the standard.I re-read this book every few years and recommend it to all my grad students in economics as an example of communicating ideas with simple elegance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"I was looking for some timeless walking/running advice. This book was disappointing because it was very dated. There is an entire chapter devoted to what to wear and there are several pages on sprorts bras. Apparently, when the book was written, comfortable sports bras did not exist. Wow. Even beyond that, the author takes every opportunity to discourage people from using a treadmill. She does concede, however, that a treadmill is good if you don't want to mess up your hair in the wind while running. Really? Really?!! I have lost 15 lbs using my treadmill because I have to run early in the morning when my son is still asleep. In addition, I get such a great workout that I am drenched!!

The slim design has additional advantage of enabling the unit to be plugged into surge suppressors or wall outlets where clearance is at a minimum. Although Mcally does not include a charging cord, the iPod's USB cord permits sufficient link to whatever type of iPod you may have. Some may argue the cost of Mcally's iPod charger (roughly same as Apple's charger) to be excessive.

My only complaint is that it was way too short, and I didn't like the way storm was protrayed. Moreover, I believe the X-men anime had more pros than cons. Don't listen to these people because they are extremely biased. I will give it 4.5 stars out of 5 for the slick animation combined with the different approach that was taken with the X-men anime...Furthermore, if the X-men was your cup of tea, I suggest picking up Iron Man the anime and Woverine when it comes out, although Woverine is one of the weakiest out of the three remakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anime Craze..","review":"I Love Anime...

I had my testicles surgically removed. In an Interview on Salon.com the author says \\"Castration does not get rid of the sexual drive, get rid of erections or any amount of sexual activity.\\" WRONG!!! How would he know any way? He is NOT a Eunuch. He has had a vasectomy but that is totally different. I can speak from experience; when a man becomes a eunuch his sex drive drops to absolute zero. I had a very strong sex drive prior to castration but it is now completely gone. The only way for a Eunuch to regain his sex drive is to take some form of testosterone replacement. I have never heard of any real life Eunuch who was not on testosterone replacement therapy that had a sex drive. Don't waste your time on this book; the author obviously didn't do enough, if any research. If you want to learn about Eunuchs then search the web. There are a lot of us out there, and our numbers are growing."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Testimony: \\"Castration\\" is a Great Book","review":"Gary Taylor's \\"Castration\\" is an endlessly fascinating, provocative, and highly entertaining exploration not only of the history of the unkindest cut but of the evolving meaning of manhood from ancient times to the present, and even into the future. Scrupulously scholarly and challenging, the book is nevertheless actually fun to read. Drawing extensively on literature, religion, and psychology, Taylor methodically examines the evolution of castration and its relationship to agriculture, faith, race, gender, and science. I found his analysis of the passage from Matthew's Gospel where Jesus addresses the topic of eunuchs to be especially enlightening. Did Christ really salute self-made eunuchs? Was he really anti-family? This book will not fail to teach you, provoke you, and force you to reconsider your ideas about what manhood means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it was better","review":"I bought the Air Therapy Key Lime scent because I wanted a natural spray that did NOT remind me of a gym bathroom like most of the Orange-heavy scents do.

The focus of this work is on the qualifications and the work of deacons.The book is broken up into nine chapters most of them take one or more of the qualifications and discusses what that qualification looks like and what it means. There is also a chapter on “deaconesses�?and whether or not the church has an office of deaconesses as well as a chapter on how to go about selecting deacons. This chapter has helpful suggestions and cautions for those who are going to be appointing deacons.I found this work to be well written and balanced. The author takes time to define words and to even give other views that are not his own.This is certainly well worth reading in fact I read this book years ago for one of the classes I took at Sunset International Bible Institute and I just picked it up again to reread it.

Her musings on the nature of masculinity and feminity are almost comically out of touch with reality. It appears her views have evolved no more frequently than her trademark hair-do, itself a relic of the 50s. Most unfortunate is that Schlafly's own life seems to contradict what she writes. Schlafly, obviously, is no stay-at-home woman. She herself utilizes the attributes of masculinity that she declares off limits to good, christian women. And what of the fact that childrearing using all her righteous indignation produced a gay son? Schlafly has all the charateristics of a feministy, yet she uses the term to label those whom she hates.

If the words weren't printed in the CD booklet, half the time I wouldn't know what the woman is talking about; her pronunciation is appalling.What a waste of money.

This country has so many native speakers available, why did they choose a singer who obviously has no clue about what they are singing?

Its writing is beautiful, subtle, evocative and yet haunting. I cannot get the protagonist out of my mind.

A book about mothers, daughters, (lost) children and people who were (or will) not be given the chance to have any of them and the way they deal with it.A disturbing aspect of the plot is the otherwise-loveable main character's schizophrenia which leads her to do unforgivable actions and the fact that nor the writer nor its characters seem to make something big out of these (their consequences seem to be quickly forgotten), leaving the reader to have to do the judge and jury's work by himself (which is an uncommon experience and maybe participates to the book interest).The main character's synesthesia (the affliction of associating colors to feelings, sounds, etc) is \\"only\\" a secondary aspect of the story/style which I was hoping would have been used/studied more deeply...

We've had ours six weeks and I haven't had any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD!","review":"I bought this item for my baby and she never used it. It was a problem getting her into it and when she was finally strapped in all she would do is cry. This product is only good until the baby weighs too much. It is a short lived product. My suggestion is not to get it. Use a stroller instead or a baby seat carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"BACK PAIN AND UNCOMFORABLE","review":"I would have to say after trying 6 different baby/toddler carriers over the last two years, baby bjorn is the worst design! All your babies weight is carried on you shoulders and when my baby was only 4mo. old I could only carry him for 15min. in the bjorn without my back KILLING ME! So it is not even worth buying. And its not good for babies to hang from between their legs! If you want a comfortable baby carrier that is good for you and baby that you can nurse in and wear in the front, back, or hip, try the Ergo Baby carrier or one like it. It must strap onto your hips first, that way it carriers the babies weight on your hips NOT your shoulders making it much better for your posture and comfort! I made myself a carrier just like the ergo baby and I can carry my 30lb toddler in it for over an hour comfortably and my 9 month old even longer! Do your research before spending the money on a carrier and get a good one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"You'll love it. My husband especially likes it because he feels he's \\"getting a workout\\". Our baby enjoyed this carrier much more than the Sling carrier by Snugli. He is secure and safe. As he got older, he loved looking out at the world. Easy to use, easy to clean, great product. No need to even shop around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breastfeeding Moms Beware!","review":"At first, I thought this carrier was great. Being carried so closely seemed to soothe the baby and even make her fall asleep when it wasn't even close to naptime. And it was great to have two free hands when she was still awake. But breastfeeding moms beware! If you wear the carrier for more than 10-15 minutes, you may get plugged ducts which are extremely painful and can lead to infection. My baby only weighs 10 pounds and the minimum recommended weight for the carrier is 8 pounds. THe pressure that those straps put on the chest can cause these plugged ducts. I've tried repositioning the straps so that one falls outside my chest and the other in between. Didn't work. I'd return this expensive carrier if I could but I threw out the packaging! Luckily, dads won't have such a problem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The coolest!","review":"I love this carrier! I agree with some reviewers that it's hard to do chores, etc. with the baby strapped on. But, I didn't buy it for that. It's main advantage is that you can carry your baby but not have to hold onto him. My husband loves the carrier and my son loves to hang on dad and look around when we go to the mall, zoo, etc. This way he can see up on our level. This is especially nice in stores without a lot of room to move around in. I frequent antique shops and they usually are old houses with stairs that have been converted into shops. I can'wear' my son on the front of me and look around at ease. It's relatively comfortable (especially for Dad) and my baby stays happier longer in this than in a stroller. It's a lifesaver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Wonderful product. Safe secure and comfortable for both mom dad and baby. The instructions that it came with though didn't work for me. The make it very complicated trying to slide baby in. I just snap in both tabs, hold my son against me and lift the flap and slide in both sides, easy. trying to get his leg through the leg whole while one side was closed was too hard for me. For the person who said that their child's legs were squished when sitting down all you have to do is spread their legs on your hips. It was definitely worth the money and I love how it holds my sons head when facing in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know better","review":"I received this as a gift when I had my first daughter. I couldn't wait to put her inside and carry her around. The fact was, it was too heavy for my back, to bulky of a carrier and too difficult to put on. I used it no more than FIVE times! Another mom at my new mother's support group had her baby in a new native baby sling/pouch. That is wonderful! I am now pregnant with my second and that is what I will get. It is half the price and twice as practical!

Since sharing my story with others in different Mommies' groups, I have found quite a lot of people who did not have positive experiences with carriers either...I am not blaming the product or its design; I just think some babies enjoy being in there while others do not.

The flange that attaches to the bag and allows you to slip it into the vacuum cleaner is attached to the bag is a haphazard manner. Most of the bags had this flange glued on so that the bag would tear when inserted into the holder in the vacuum. Thus rendering the bag defective. I won't by these bags again.

This one went into the trash before I had finished reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing -- read Dr. Ruth's book instead","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I found numerous inaccuracies, both in the author's descriptions of religious teachings and in information about sexual practices. In some cases (such as his chapter on BDSM), he begins with a completely wrong assumption about *why* people practice BDSM and what they get out of it, and then bases all his judgement on those false precepts. I found many points in which he was out-and-out wrong.If you're interested in the subject, Dr. Ruth Westheimer's book \\"Heavenly Sex: Sexuality in the Jewish Tradition\\" is a much better book -- more accurate and more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter hypocrisy (as if we are surprised!)","review":"The rabbi's pose is transparently hypocritical because Judaism's \\"holiest\\" book, the Talmud, teaches misogyny, the fundamental \\"orthodox\\" Judaic doctrine about women:\\"Though a woman be as a pitcher full of filth and her mouth be full of blood, yet all speed after her.\\" ---Talmud, Shabbat 152band also, \\"...a man may do whatever he pleases with his wife at intercourse: Meat which comes from the abbatoir may be eaten salted, roasted, cooked or seethed; so with fish from the fishmonger.... A woman came before Rab and complained [of her husband's sodomy with her], \\"Rabbi replied: 'Wherein does it differ from fish?\\" ---Talmud, Nedarim 20b, Soncino edition, p.58"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Epitome of Ignorance !!!!!","review":"Bible believers have been known to conform to pretty strange religious teachings but the thought of having sex in a manner that must be pleasing to God has got to be the biggest pile of tripe I have ever come across. What makes Shmuley Boteach thinks he knows what god likes when one is in the thralls of passion?????Never mind what your partner likes, as long as the great Peeping Tom in the sky is not turned on then the act is a no-no. ....... How utterly ridiculous??!!Readers, as long as the parties involved are consenting adults acting in privacy and it feels good....... DO IT!!!!Shmuley Boteach should try it some time"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-d73dbddb"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/23.md","filePath":"library/23.md"}'),R={name:"library/23.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
